CREC-2015-01-12-pt1-PgH191-5,CREC-2015-01-12,114,ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION LEGISLATION,"[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 5 (Monday, January 12, 2015)] [House] [Pages H191-H192] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION LEGISLATION The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Alabama (Mr. Byrne) for 5 minutes. Mr. BYRNE. Madam Speaker, just last month, we made a promise to the American people. We promised our constituents that we would fight the Obama administration's decision to give executive amnesty to many of those in this country illegally. I am pleased to announce that this week the House will fulfill that promise and act to defund the illegal executive action. All last year, we strongly urged the President not to act alone, and the American people spoke clearly in last November's election, but the President forged ahead anyway. [[Page H192]] Now, in order to preserve our Nation's longstanding system of checks and balances to preserve the very order of our Constitution, the House will act to rein in President Obama's plans for executive amnesty. We will vote on legislation, which I was proud to cosponsor, written by my Alabama colleague, Congressman Robert Aderholt, which would prevent the President from carrying out his plans for executive amnesty. Let me be clear: this is tough legislation which completely eliminates all funds for implementation of the President's illegal actions. The bill has the support of many leading voices in the immigration debate including my home State Senator, Jeff Sessions. Just as important, the legislation makes clear that no Federal benefits can be granted to any alien as a result of the policies defunded and also eliminates funds to consider new, renewal, or previously-denied applications for executive amnesty. The legislation doesn't just defund the President's executive action. The legislation paves the way for stronger border security by increasing funds for border agents, detention beds, and enforcement activities. In order to halt illegal immigration in this country, we must stop encouraging illegal immigration by offering amnesty and instead put more attention on actually securing our borders. I wish this legislation wasn't necessary. I wish President Obama had listened to the American people and enforced our current laws instead of continuing his my-way-or-the-highway style of governing; instead, he moved ahead with action that clearly violates our Constitution and has poisoned the well for serious conversation on immigration reform. Madam Speaker, I must ask a simple question that has very serious consequences: When will it stop? When will President Obama stop issuing shortsighted executive action and instead work together with this Congress to find long-term solutions to the real issues plaguing our country? I fear that the answer to that question is not promising, given that while we were on this floor taking our oath of office, the White House was busy issuing veto threats. I understand that the legislative process may not be convenient for the President, but the process exists for a reason. The Congress makes the laws, and the President should enforce them. This President just doesn't get that. This week, the House will act to rein in the President once again. We will attempt to right the scales of power and restore our constitutional system of checks and balances. We cannot and we will not sit back idly and allow the President to act alone. We promised the American people we would respond, and this week, we will hold true to our word. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 5 (Monday, January 12, 2015)] [House] [Pages H191-H192] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION LEGISLATION The SPEAKER pro tempore.

CREC-2015-01-12-pt1-PgH192-2,CREC-2015-01-12,114,THE FRENCH FIGHT BACK,"[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 5 (Monday, January 12, 2015)] [House] [Pages H192-H193] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] THE FRENCH FIGHT BACK The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Poe) for 5 minutes. Mr. POE of Texas. Madam Speaker, around 11 a.m. on January 7, on a cold winter day in Paris, France, two men armed with AK-47s forced a woman entering the offices of a French newspaper to let them in. After murdering the security guard in the lobby, they ran up to the second floor and shouted, ``Where is Charb? Where is Charb?'' Charb is the nickname for the newspaper's editor, Mr. Charbonnier. Over the next 5 minutes, the two men would seek out and execute Mr. Charbonnier and 10 other people in the newspaper. They left the building, shouting the Islamic phrase, ``Allah Akbar'' or ``God is the greatest.'' They then murdered a policeman, ran back to their car, shouting, ``We have revenged the Prophet Muhammad.'' You see, Madam Speaker, these killers murdered because the paper exercised the human right of free speech and a free press. The assassin brothers were on the run for 2 days, but on January 9, the police cornered them at a standoff near the Paris airport. The police rescued a hostage, and the brothers were killed, going out just like they wanted to, in a massive firefight as martyrs. On the same day, another gunman, but an accomplice of the two brothers, took hostages at a kosher grocery store on the east side of Paris. Police stormed the grocery store and killed the terrorist, but not before he had murdered Jewish hostages. You see, Madam Speaker, these three killed because people disagreed with them. They killed the Jews because they were Jews. They killed the people at the newspaper because they had the audacity to print things that these folks--these terrorists--did not approve of. The French authorities did a superb job hunting down and killing these terrorists. The two brothers responsible for the initial attack have a history of terrorist activities. One brother said he even dreamed of killing Jews in France. Hours before one of them met his Maker, they called a French TV station, saying, ``We are telling you that we are defenders of the Prophet--peace and blessings be upon him--and that I was sent by al Qaeda in Yemen and that I went there, and it is the imam al-Awlaki that financed me.'' Yes, Madam Speaker, we have heard this before, young people traveling overseas where they meet radical Islamic jihadists who preach hate and murder in the name of religion. {time} 1215 They are indoctrinated and infected with the cancer of radical Islam and sent back to their home country to inflict terror and kill men, women, and children. They kill in the name of their radical religious beliefs. We are even seeing this in the United States. Groups like ISIS are encouraging Americans to join their reign of terror. Americans who travel overseas to fight with ISIS are not coming back home to America to open coffee shops. They are coming back to do mischief and kill us. That is why I have introduced and reintroduced the FTO Passport Revocation Act that would authorize the revocation or denial of passports to individuals affiliated with foreign terrorist organizations. The Benedict Arnold traitors who turn against America and join the ranks of foreign radical terrorist organizations should lose their [[Page H193]] rights. This bill will help law enforcement locate these individuals by preventing them from traveling internationally so they can be captured and brought to justice. Most importantly, this legislation will prevent traitor Americans from entering the United States undetected. Madam Speaker, the French people held a solidarity rally in honor of the murdered. It was also a statement of freedom. Some estimated over 2 million attended the rally in Paris. Marching arm in arm with French President Hollande were 40 world leaders, including German Chancellor Merkel, Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu, and Palestinian President Abbas. Unfortunately, the United States President, the Vice President, and the Secretary of State did not choose to show up and support this solidarity meeting. That is unfortunate. The French are a close ally and our oldest ally. We have a portrait of the great Frenchman Lafayette in this very Chamber across the way from George Washington. Freedom is under attack by these terrorists. They are a threat to civilization, order, and liberty. The United States should be more outspoken in our support for the French people and our opposition to terror. We should support our allies like the French and mourn when they mourn and be resolved to track terrorists down anywhere in the world where they are. They are at war with us, Madam Speaker. The French Prime Minister said it best: We are fighting a war, not a war against religion, not a war of civilizations, but to defend our values, which are universal. It is a war against terrorism and radical Islam, against everything that aims to shatter solidarity, liberty, and brotherhood. And that is just the way it is. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 5 (Monday, January 12, 2015)] [House] [Pages H192-H193] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] THE FRENCH FIGHT BACK The SPEAKER pro tempore.

The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Doggett) for 5 minutes. Mr. DOGGETT. Madam Speaker, today is a special day for San Antonio because our San Antonio Spurs are being recognized at the White House for their victorious season. We have, of course, already had many a celebration in San Antonio, but it is good to see this celebration now reaching 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue. Congratulations to the San Antonio Spurs on this fifth amazing championship ring. Serving here in Congress as a representative for much of San Antonio, including the very place in the Alamo City where the Spurs have scored so many of these victories, I know that nothing defines the Spurs or San Antonio like the teamwork, the determination, and the positive attitude they displayed on this trail to the 2014 championship victory. These values are shown through the Spurs' ``Silver and Black Give Back''; a community and outreach program which has benefited over 250,000 children and coaches in the past couple of decades, all this in a city that is overflowing with Spurs enthusiasm and Spurs fans. I would have to say that all of San Antonio knows that the Spurs are certainly no Mavericks at basketball; they are well-seasoned, team players. They were able to rain down Thunder on all of their 2014 opponents with a regular season record of 62 wins out of 82 games. And that is not all that set the Spurs apart; they are true Trailblazers, hiring the first female assistant coach in the NBA, Becky Hammon. Overall, when it came down to that fifth ring, the Spurs, a team that lives in our Texas temperatures, were able to beat the Heat with a cool 4-1 series blowout. Like San Antonio itself, the Spurs have attracted the best and brightest from all over the world. There never has been, and there never will be, a team quite like the San Antonio Spurs in a city that is like no other. Congratulations to a dynasty.

CREC-2015-01-12-pt1-PgH191-4,CREC-2015-01-12,114,REMEMBERING STANLEY ISRAELITE,"[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 5 (Monday, January 12, 2015)] [House] [Page H191] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] REMEMBERING STANLEY ISRAELITE The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Connecticut (Mr. Courtney) for 5 minutes. Mr. COURTNEY. Madam Speaker, today, I rise to remember one of eastern Connecticut's most generous, caring, and devoted citizens, Stanley Israelite. Stanley passed away this past December at age 89 and leaves behind an enduring powerful legacy in his native Norwich and throughout Connecticut. I ask the U.S. House to join me in expressing condolences to his wife, Linda Hershman; and his four children, Michael Israelite, Abby Dolliver, Mindy Wilkie, and Jon Israelite. After his passing, a memorial service was held at Beth Jacob Synagogue, which was the scene of an overflow crowd of people from all walks of life. His longtime boss, former U.S. Senator Chris Dodd; Lieutenant Governor Nancy Wyman; State legislators; mayors and former mayors; small business owners; labor union leaders; and his neighbors and friends from the city he loved, Norwich, Connecticut, were all in attendance. Senator Dodd delivered a stirring eulogy filled with humor and passion, describing Stanley's amazing life of service. As Senator Dodd related, Stanley dedicated his life to helping others. After starting his career in his family-owned jewelry store, he uncovered his true passion, assisting members of his community with any problem, anytime, after intervening with a family in crisis. He left the business, and after holding a variety of human service and business advocacy positions in Norwich--and earning citizen of the year and citizen of the decade awards in the 1960s--went on to work for Chris Dodd. Stanley ran his constituent service programs, beginning in 1974 with Dodd's election as Second District Congressman, the seat that I now have the honor to hold, and later as State director to Senator Dodd after Chris' election to the Senate in 1980. Stanley remained a fixture in Connecticut politics, known for his consummate dedication to helping constituents get the help they needed. He spent decades ensuring that Connecticut citizens received help from the VA, Medicare, and Social Security; solved thorny immigration problems; helped small business owners get their feet under them; and then doggedly pushed forward projects to improve local communities. Today, one of the projects he spearheaded, an industrial park in Norwich that never would have been realized without Stanley's efforts, now bears his name, the Stanley Israelite Norwich Business Park, renamed in his honor in 2005. In 1995, Stanley was recognized as U.S. News and World Report's 12 Indispensable Americans. For all the awards and honors that his community rightly bestowed on him throughout his career, Stanley, himself, valued the thank you notes that he received from grateful constituents above everything. In 1995, he explained to a reporter from The New London Day that the highest honor in the Dodd office was to post a constituent thank you letter on the office refrigerator. ``That is our glory,'' he said. ``If you are on the refrigerator, then you have done a good job.'' Stanley's personal mantra--which he instilled in his colleagues, friends, and family--was always, ``Don't forget the people.'' After a lifetime of service to his community, the people he helped and everyone who had the privilege to know him will certainly never forget him. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 5 (Monday, January 12, 2015)] [House] [Page H191] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] REMEMBERING STANLEY ISRAELITE The SPEAKER pro tempore.

CREC-2015-01-12-pt1-PgH193,CREC-2015-01-12,114,CALIFORNIA HIGH-SPEED RAIL BOONDOGGLE,"[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 5 (Monday, January 12, 2015)] [House] [Page H193] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] CALIFORNIA HIGH-SPEED RAIL BOONDOGGLE The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from California (Mr. LaMalfa) for 5 minutes. Mr. LaMALFA. Madam Speaker, today I once again will speak about California's high-speed rail system. Now, just this last week, they had a symbolic groundbreaking for this system in the context of getting started. California has been, since 2008, anticipating the start of high-speed rail. What do we have instead? Empty promises, a lot of waste, and a lot of money going down the tubes. What we see is that when the plan was first put in place, the voters of California approved a $33 billion link from Los Angeles to San Francisco. What they are now being given is something that has tripled in price. What they have now been given at this groundbreaking, which is symbolic, what you saw was a mound of dirt with about an 8-foot section of ties and rails on that. That is very symbolic for those doing the groundbreaking, but also for those of us that will be paying for it. What this high-speed rail system will turn into is several links of rail between north and south California that aren't linked up, that have no way to power them, and no trains will be running on them for several years. So instead of the $33 billion plan that they saw on the ballot in 2008--which, by the way, it was on the 2006 ballot and, before that, on the 2004 ballot, but those involved knew that they would have, politically, a hard time selling that to people in California--it has ballooned to a $100-billion plan until they revise it again downwards by taking away part of the high-speed system in San Francisco and L.A., where they will instead be using local transit to link to the center section that runs through central California. That is not even legal under Prop 1A. What Prop 1A spells out is that it has to be a high-speed system that will make it from San Francisco to L.A. or reverse in 2\1/2\ hours at speeds of 220 miles per hour. This promise will not be upheld. Now, why is this important to a national audience, to Members of Congress, and to people in other States? It is because, after the stimulus package was passed in 2009-2010, some of that Federal money is going to go for the high-speed rail system in California. Indeed, several other States were recipients of those initial grants. After they looked at their own ideas for high-speed rail and saw the costs involved and the infeasibility, they turned that money back into that pot of money. California, of course, stepped forward and said: Hey, give us all of that money. So they have received, at this point, about $3.5 billion that they can spend, dollar for dollar, for the bond money they spend themselves, the State money. So what that means for Americans is that we know Californians will be back at the Federal well once again trying to get more money for their high-speed plan. What we see is that their down-sized plan will still cost $68 billion. They only have identified $13 billion for the whole system. No private sector money--which is what we were told when the ballot measure passed--has stepped forward to be part of this. The plan is $55 billion short. The Federal Government, so far, has offered about 3\1/2\. Did they think they would get the other 52 from the Federal Government since no private sector money wants to come forward for this? Will they get it out of the California taxpayers? Nobody knows. Indeed, the Governor, at the groundbreaking the other day, said: Don't worry about the money; we will get it. Well, part of their measure has been to impose a cap-and-trade program on the people of California which so far has generated about $250 million per year. At that rate, it will be how many centuries before they can catch up and get enough money just to pay for high-speed rail which cap-and-trade wasn't even intended for anyway? Folks, we have a giant problem here. High-speed rail in California should not be the Federal taxpayers' burden. It shouldn't even be the people of California's burden. They barely passed it by 52-48 percent on that 2008 ballot after two previous ballot delays. Delay, delay, delay is what you see with this system. So what really needs to happen is the people of California need to step forward, put this back on the ballot, and have a vote once again on this. And the Federal Government doesn't need to be giving signals that they are going to send even more money for this boondoggle which has been failed, flawed, and deceptive since day one. Madam Speaker, it is a massively flawed project that leaves taxpayers at all levels on the hook for many, many years to come for something that may not even run in our lifetime. So we, as Federal legislators, need to put a stop to any idea--as my colleagues have been doing--for more money to go forward for high-speed rail. And we need the people of California to wake up to that idea and demand that it be placed back on the ballot, this money go instead for other projects that could be helpful for their transportation corridors, for their highway system, and for the normal mode of rail which can be made to be enhanced to drive 125 miles per hour, which would be beneficial. Madam Speaker, we need to get on the ball and get back to reality on what high-speed rail will really cost Californians and the American taxpayer and urge that it be placed back on the ballot and give the people that choice once again. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 5 (Monday, January 12, 2015)] [House] [Page H193] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] CALIFORNIA HIGH-SPEED RAIL BOONDOGGLE The SPEAKER pro tempore.

And we need the people of California to wake up to that idea and demand that it be placed back on the ballot, this money go instead for other projects that could be helpful for their transportation corridors, for their highway system, and for the normal mode of rail which can be made to be enhanced to drive 125 miles per hour, which would be beneficial. Madam Speaker, we need to get on the ball and get back to reality on what high-speed rail will really cost Californians and the American taxpayer and urge that it be placed back on the ballot and give the people that choice once again. ____________________","Congressional Record, Volume 161 Issue 5 (Monday, January 12, 2015) [Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 5 (Monday, January 12, 2015)] [House] [Page H193] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] CALIFORNIA HIGH-SPEED RAIL BOONDOGGLE The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from California (Mr. LaMalfa) for 5 minutes. Mr. LaMALFA. Madam Speaker, today I once again will speak about California's high-speed rail system. Now, just this last week, they had a symbolic groundbreaking for this system in the context of getting started. California has been, since 2008, anticipating the start of high-speed rail. What do we have instead? Empty promises, a lot of waste, and a lot of money going down the tubes. What we see is that when the plan was first put in place, the voters of California approved a $33 billion link from Los Angeles to San Francisco. What they are now being given is something that has tripled in price. What they have now been given at this groundbreaking, which is symbolic, what you saw was a mound of dirt with about an 8-foot section of ties and rails on that. That is very symbolic for those doing the groundbreaking, but also for those of us that will be paying for it. What this high-speed rail system will turn into is several links of rail between north and south California that aren't linked up, that have no way to power them, and no trains will be running on them for several years. So instead of the $33 billion plan that they saw on the ballot in 2008--which, by the way, it was on the 2006 ballot and, before that, on the 2004 ballot, but those involved knew that they would have, politically, a hard time selling that to people in California--it has ballooned to a $100-billion plan until they revise it again downwards by taking away part of the high-speed system in San Francisco and L.A., where they will instead be using local transit to link to the center section that runs through central California. That is not even legal under Prop 1A. What Prop 1A spells out is that it has to be a high-speed system that will make it from San Francisco to L.A. or reverse in 2\1/2\ hours at speeds of 220 miles per hour. This promise will not be upheld. Now, why is this important to a national audience, to Members of Congress, and to people in other States? It is because, after the stimulus package was passed in 2009-2010, some of that Federal money is going to go for the high-speed rail system in California. Indeed, several other States were recipients of those initial grants. After they looked at their own ideas for high-speed rail and saw the costs involved and the infeasibility, they turned that money back into that pot of money. California, of course, stepped forward and said: Hey, give us all of that money. So they have received, at this point, about $3.5 billion that they can spend, dollar for dollar, for the bond money they spend themselves, the State money. So what that means for Americans is that we know Californians will be back at the Federal well once again trying to get more money for their high-speed plan. What we see is that their down-sized plan will still cost $68 billion. They only have identified $13 billion for the whole system. No private sector money--which is what we were told when the ballot measure passed--has stepped forward to be part of this. The plan is $55 billion short. The Federal Government, so far, has offered about 3\1/2\. Did they think they would get the other 52 from the Federal Government since no private sector money wants to come forward for this? Will they get it out of the California taxpayers? Nobody knows. Indeed, the Governor, at the groundbreaking the other day, said: Don't worry about the money; we will get it. Well, part of their measure has been to impose a cap-and-trade program on the people of California which so far has generated about $250 million per year. At that rate, it will be how many centuries before they can catch up and get enough money just to pay for high-speed rail which cap-and-trade wasn't even intended for anyway? Folks, we have a giant problem here. High-speed rail in California should not be the Federal taxpayers' burden. It shouldn't even be the people of California's burden. They barely passed it by 52-48 percent on that 2008 ballot after two previous ballot delays. Delay, delay, delay is what you see with this system. So what really needs to happen is the people of California need to step forward, put this back on the ballot, and have a vote once again on this. And the Federal Government doesn't need to be giving signals that they are going to send even more money for this boondoggle which has been failed, flawed, and deceptive since day one. Madam Speaker, it is a massively flawed project that leaves taxpayers at all levels on the hook for many, many years to come for something that may not even run in our lifetime. So we, as Federal legislators, need to put a stop to any idea--as my colleagues have been doing--for more money to go forward for high-speed rail.

Mr. Speaker, a majority of Americans support building the Keystone pipeline to create jobs and strengthen our energy independence; yet President Obama threatens to block this critical project. The most environmentally secure means to transport oil is by pipeline. This pipeline means hundreds of permanent jobs in South Carolina's Second Congressional District, where companies like Michelin Tire Corporation in Lexington and MTU America in Graniteville produce the earthmover tires and engines used for Canadian oil sand development; also, the Colonial pipeline to North Augusta reduces gas prices for consumers locally. Last week, in a bipartisan vote, the House passed a bill to approve the Keystone pipeline. I hope the President will support the priorities of the American people rather than cater to a generous campaign donor. In conclusion, God bless our troops, and the President, by his actions, must never forget September the 11th in the global war on terrorism. Our sympathy to America's first ally, France, over the terrorist attacks last week. Our solidarity with France is clear with the portrait of the Marquis de Lafayette gratefully placed in the House Chamber as one of only two portraits in this room. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 5 (Monday, January 12, 2015)] [House] [Page H194] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] THE KEYSTONE PIPELINE (Mr. WILSON of South Carolina asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)

Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr. Speaker, a majority of Americans support building the Keystone pipeline to create jobs and strengthen our energy independence; yet President Obama threatens to block this critical project. The most environmentally secure means to transport oil is by pipeline. This pipeline means hundreds of permanent jobs in South Carolina's Second Congressional District, where companies like Michelin Tire Corporation in Lexington and MTU America in Graniteville produce the earthmover tires and engines used for Canadian oil sand development; also, the Colonial pipeline to North Augusta reduces gas prices for consumers locally. Last week, in a bipartisan vote, the House passed a bill to approve the Keystone pipeline. I hope the President will support the priorities of the American people rather than cater to a generous campaign donor.

We have the only nonpartisan unicameral legislature in the Nation, a body that I proudly served in for 16 years, as did my good friends Senator Deb Fischer and Congressman Adrian Smith. In Lincoln, legislators are not bound by political parties but by the needs of their constituents; rather than provide partisan sound bites, members of the unicameral provide solutions forged through compromise and collaboration. We need more of this tradition in Washington, and I hope to bring Nebraska common sense to this body. We need to find more ways to come together and solve our Nation's problems. The American people do not want dogged partisanship. They want us to work together to get real results that help make their everyday lives better. I have pledged to be an independent, pragmatic voice for my constituents to responsibly tackle the difficult issues facing our country and to do so in a bipartisan manner.

SEC. 8. PROHIBITION ON NEW APPROPRIATIONS. No additional funds are authorized to be appropriated to carry out this Act and the amendments made by this Act, and this Act and such amendments shall be carried out using amounts otherwise made available for such purposes. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Miller) and the gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. Brown) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Florida. General Leave Mr. MILLER of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Florida? There was no objection. Mr. MILLER of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in proud support of H.R. 203, the Clay Hunt SAV Act. This bill was introduced by my good friend and a very important member of the Veterans Affairs' Committee, Congressman Tim Walz from Minnesota. I am honored to join him and Congresswoman Tammy Duckworth from Illinois as an original cosponsor of this legislation. I am also grateful for the support of several of our military veterans' service organizations, including the Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America, the Veterans of Foreign Wars, the American Legion, the Disabled American Veterans, the Military Officers Association of America, and the Wounded Warrior Project. H.R. 203 is named after a true American hero, Clay Hunt. Clay was a Marine Corps veteran who served honorably in both Afghanistan and Iraq, where he was wounded in battle. Clay returned home grappling with posttraumatic stress disorder but refused to let his personal struggles prevent him from devoting his time to humanitarian work and advocacy on behalf of his fellow veterans. However, in March of 2011, at just 28 years of age, Clay took his own life. With an average of 22 veterans committing suicide each day, Clay was far from alone in his pain, and his family and friends are far from alone in their heartbreak over his loss. The last several years have seen significant increases in the Department of Veterans Affairs' mental health and suicide prevention budget, staff, and programs; however, we have not seen a corresponding decrease in the number of our Nation's heroes who take their own lives. What is more, for some groups of veterans, including female veterans and veterans of Iraq and Afghanistan, suicide rates are actually getting worse. Mr. Speaker, we have got to do more to help these veterans access the supportive services and mental health care that they need to save their lives. With the passage of H.R. 203, we will. To improve the efficiency and effectiveness of VA programs and increase awareness of available services, H.R. 203 would require an annual third-party evaluation of VA's mental health care and suicide prevention programs and require that VA publish an interactive Web site to serve as a central source of information regarding VA mental health services. To increase VA's capacity to meet the mental health care needs of our veterans, it would establish a pilot program that would repay education loans for individuals who have received a degree in psychiatric medicine and who agree to work at the VA for at least 2 years. To create a seamless transition from Active Duty to veteran status and increased community support for those in need, it would establish another pilot program to assist veterans during transition and require VA to collaborate with nonprofit mental health organizations in the community. Importantly, H.R. 203 would extend an additional 1 year of eligibility for VA health care services for certain combat veterans who have not yet enrolled and whose 5-year combat eligibility period recently expired. Before I yield, I want to take a moment to once again express my condolences to Clay's family and friends as well as the families and friends of our honored veterans who have lost their lives to suicide. I want to offer them my personal commitment to continue the aggressive pursuit to end veteran suicide. The passage of this bill today is just the first in what will be a continuing series of legislative and oversight efforts that our committee is going to undertake throughout the 114th Congress to improve access to mental health care for veterans in need, increase the efficiency and effectiveness of VA's mental health and suicide prevention programs, and increase meaningful partnerships with community providers who are often the first line of defense for their struggling veterans and the families of those veterans. This bill, which passed the House last Congress, will not single- handedly halt the scourge of veteran suicide, but it is an important step, and it is a step that we owe Clay and those like him who desperately need and certainly deserve our help. With that, I urge all of my colleagues to join me in supporting H.R. 203. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Ms. BROWN of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 203, the Clay Hunt SAV Act. This legislation passed the House last month in the closing days of the 113th Congress. I am pleased that we were able to act on this measure as one of the first items of business in the 114th Congress. Providing the mental health care that veterans need and effectively dealing with the crisis of veteran suicides have been longstanding concerns of the Committee on Veterans' Affairs. War is indeed terrible, and the effects of combat and service on our veterans lasts a lifetime. For far too long, society--and the military culture itself--has acted as if the need for mental health care treatment is a weakness and has discouraged adequate treatment. This attitude is changing, but it cannot change fast enough. In the area of mental health for our veterans and returning servicemembers, there is no easy answer or quick fix. I appreciate the work of my friend from Minnesota, Tim Walz; Chairman Miller; and all of my colleagues on the committee in fashioning a bill that I believe will make a difference in the lives of our veterans. H.R. 203 takes a number of important steps, including improving the safety net for at-risk veterans, while also introducing some accountability into the VA mental health care and suicide prevention program, using a third-party evaluation. It will provide veterans with a Web site that will serve as a centralized source of information on mental health services. H.R. 203 initiates a program to help address some of the glaring mental health personnel shortages at the VA. While the incentives in this bill are limited to the psychiatry field, I would like to see this effort expanded in the future to all the mental health professional shortfalls. {time} 1715 H.R. 203 would expand peer support networks, which we have heard are quite effectively used. And I believe the reporting requirement in this bill will confirm that additional resources should be permanently dedicated to fully utilizing peer support. H.R. 203 would also provide an additional window of eligibility for combat veterans who may have missed the window of opportunity to sign up for VA health care. This extra time will help to ensure that veterans receive the health care, including mental health care, that they need. I thank the chairman for working to bring this bill up quickly so that the House can act and send this important measure to the Senate. I look forward to working with Chairman Miller, and with Florida being the State with the second-largest population of veterans and the most senior population, I know that the committee will do a good job having two of the leadership team from Florida. But let me be clear: there are 435 Members of Congress, and each of them have veterans in their district, and we will work to make sure that all veterans get the care that they have earned and deserve. [[Page H199]] Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. MILLER of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I thank the new ranking member for her words. I look forward to working with her on legislation in the future. With that, Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from the Second District of Indiana, from Elkhart, Indiana (Mrs. Walorski). Mrs. WALORSKI. Mr. Speaker, I thank the distinguished gentleman from Florida for yielding, and I am grateful to be here today to support the Clay Hunt SAV Act. Every day, 22 veterans take their own lives. We have all experienced this in our districts; I have as well. On March 31, 2011, Clay Hunt was one of those 22 veterans that day who took his own life. Today, we honor Clay and his family with the Clay Hunt SAV Act. Clay's story was one of bravery and dedication. He relied on the VA for care and received a 30 percent disability rating for PTSD brought on during his service. He appealed the rating and encountered a bureaucratic nightmare. Clay had to wait months to see a psychiatrist at a VA Medical Center. Two weeks later, Clay took his own life. Five weeks after his death and 18 months after filing an appeal with the VA for his PTSD rating, his appeal was approved. Clay's story details the urgency that our Nation's heroes deserve. The Clay Hunt SAV Act will increase access to mental health care and improve the quality of care troops and veterans receive. Together, we can change this system so that no other veteran ever has to endure what thousands of veterans have already gone through, including Clay. I am honored to stand here today and am grateful to my colleagues. I urge support for this legislation. Ms. BROWN of Florida. Mr. Speaker, how much time is remaining? The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentlewoman from Florida has 16\1/2\ minutes remaining. Ms. BROWN of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. Walz). Mr. WALZ. Mr. Speaker, I thank the ranking member for your support of this important piece of legislation. As you heard, we are here once again. We had a piece of legislation that attempted to, as I think the chairman spoke about, address an issue that cuts to the heart and the soul of this Nation: When our warriors come home, how can we reintegrate them? And I think it is important, and I want to thank the chairman, one, for working so diligently on many numerous issues, but on this piece of legislation, and for bringing it back up again, but I think also for setting an example. The Nation expects us to do what is right by our warriors. They expect us to work together to find solutions. Something that we do in the committee is looking and seeing where we can improve and pointing out where there are faults. But that is not good enough. Pointing out the faults is one thing, and it is important. Finding solutions is what really matters, and this piece of legislation, I think, starts to do that. To my colleagues who are here, I would say this. We can certainly disagree and disagree strongly and passionately. But I think if the public knew and they could feel it and, I think, in this piece of legislation see it, there are many more things that bind us together, and our care and our commitment for our warriors is one of those. This is a piece of legislation that wasn't just written here in the Halls of Congress. It was written by the families, Susan and Richard Selke, Clay's parents; by the Houghtalings in Minnesota; and the Kellys in New Ulm, Minnesota; and each of these Members that you hear speak about it. Since we passed this legislation, and it failed in the Senate, over 750 veterans have taken their lives. Many times down here, we feel like everything we do is the most important thing that needs to happen now. Rarely is that true. In this case, it is. We can't wait another day. We can't pass this problem forward because it is not only ripping at families, it is ripping at our Nation. These are our best and brightest. You heard about Clay. Clay's a Marine who went to Iraq. He got shot by a sniper and, as a Marine, that irritated him. It didn't hurt him. He came back. He had his Purple Heart, and he could have come back and taken our thank yous. He didn't. He went to Afghanistan to continue on. He knew the extremism that was threatening Iraq and Afghanistan would some day threaten this Nation, so he was forward. He did his time. After he came back, that wasn't enough. He went to Haiti to help. After that, that wasn't enough. He sat in our offices on numerous occasions working on everything from access to the VA to the things you heard the gentlelady talk about in Indiana that were causing frustration amongst our veterans. And I think for me the thing is, like for so many of us, Clay appeared to have everything. He appeared that he knew and was competent and had it there, but we all know that they have demons, and Clay had demons. So what this piece of legislation does--you heard the specifics, and it does do specific things, and no one is claiming that this is going to be the fix. But I would make the case that what the Clay Hunt bill has done and what it has done amongst our partners in the veterans service organizations is made it absolutely clear we will not leave anyone behind. We will not turn a blind eye to this, and we will not rest until we at least make the attempt to get that number down to zero. We may never get there, but this piece of legislation starts to address it. So I think it is important, and I want to thank the ranking member for being on this bill and putting it forward, and the chairman, who was an original author of this and has been instrumental in making it happen. What we are doing here is not just passing legislation. What we are doing here is changing the attitudes, focusing the Nation's attention on this, because I don't care if it is Elkhart, Indiana, if it is Pensacola, Florida, or if it is Mankato, Minnesota. When we go to talk to our constituents, regardless of their political leanings, they tell us, take care of our warriors, do what is right. Fix the system. This piece of legislation does that. It does it in a cost-effective, smart manner, and we have got the opportunity to start moving forward. I would say and encourage my colleagues, let's pass this thing, but let's not see it as an end result of a process we have been working on. Let's see it as the first of many things to try and make changes to be smarter about how we use taxpayer dollars, but also to demand effectiveness, because Clay's parents deserve that. Thousands of others across this Nation deserve that. The more than 1 million veterans that will return over the next few years are counting on us to put everything in place to provide that help. So I encourage my colleagues, support this legislation. I encourage my colleagues, take this as an example. I want to thank Speaker Boehner and Majority Leader McCarthy for making it a priority. I think it speaks volumes. This piece of legislation is on the floor in the first week. That says something, that there is a commitment to getting it right, there is a commitment to working together, and there is a commitment to showing effectiveness for the American people. So, we have got that opportunity. I ask my colleagues to support this legislation, get engaged with what is happening with our veterans, and let's prove that their service was not in vain, that this democracy is strong, that our commitment to them is unwavering and that, at the end of the day, that is what really matters. Mr. Speaker, I am very grateful for the opportunity to again tell you about a very important piece of legislation that will help in our fight to improve mental health care for our returning warriors: H.R. 203, the Clay Hunt SAV Act. I'd like to thank the Chairman of the House Veterans Affairs Committee, Mr. Miller, and Rep. Duckworth for continuing to be my partners in this effort. I'd also like to thank Speaker Boehner for bringing this to the floor swiftly. And, a big thank you to Senators McCain, Burr, Blumenthal, and Isakson for all their work on the SAV Act. Most importantly, I'd like to thank Clay's parents, Susan and Richard Selke. They are holding Congress' feet to the fire to make sure we get this done and to prevent another family from going through what they continue to go [[Page H200]] through each and every day. We cannot let them down. H.R. 203, the Clay Hunt Suicide Prevention for American Veterans Act, is an example of how we can work together on Capitol Hill. The legislation is named in honor of Iraq and Afghanistan War Veteran and suicide prevention advocate, Clay Hunt. Clay epitomized what it meant to live a life of service, both in and out of uniform. He helped countless veterans overcome their demons but tragically took his own life in March of 2011. The legacy he left behind, however, will live on for generations to come. The bill you see before you was the result of strong partnerships with our veteran service organizations, strong bipartisan efforts here in Congress, and the resolve of Clay's parents pushing and pushing and pushing to get this thing done. This bill is what you get when you have folks sitting around the table, trusting one another, and working together to get it right for our nation's veterans. Our premise for this bill was simple: suicide occurs because many vets return to their community and then disconnect from it. So, we wanted to create a bill that would get the communities involved and coordinated. We also knew it would be important to increase both oversight of the VA and their capacity to deal with over a million veterans returning from war. Specifically, the bill: 1. Establishes a peer support and community outreach pilot program to assist transitioning servicemembers with accessing VA mental health care services. 2. Requires the VA to create a one-stop, interactive website to serve as a centralized source of information regarding all mental health services for veterans. 3. Addresses the shortage of mental health care professionals by authorizing the VA to conduct a student loan repayment pilot program aimed at recruiting and retaining psychiatrists. 4. Requires yearly evaluations--with interim reports due in the first two years and a final report due the third year and every year after-- conducted by a third party, of all mental health care and suicide prevention practices and programs at the VA to find out what is working and what's not working and to make recommendations to improve care. Authorizes a Government Accountability Office (GAO) report on the transition of care for PTSD and TBI between the DoD and the VA. One veteran lost to suicide is one too many. With many of our warriors returning from war, all too often our heroes return only to face a war of their own at home. While there is no bill that will completely end veteran suicide, this bipartisan measure is a step in the right direction. In short, it's a start towards fixing a problem, but we must not lose focus on this problem after passing this bill. We must continue working to improve care for our veterans. I urge my colleagues to support this measure so that we can send it over to the Senate and onto the President swiftly. Mr. MILLER of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from the Sixth District of Pennsylvania (Mr. Costello), a new member of the committee, who, in his first week, has already jumped in with both feet. Mr. Costello has been to my office and started looking closely at the oversight agenda that we have. Mr. COSTELLO of Pennsylvania. I thank the distinguished gentleman from Florida for yielding. Mr. Speaker, I stand here today to express my support of Congressman Tim Walz's Clay Hunt Suicide Prevention for American Veterans Act. It is a privilege to serve on the House Committee on Veterans' Affairs and in this Congress, to work to improve the quality of life for our Nation's veterans, their families, and their caregivers. In the coming months, I look forward to working in a bipartisan, commonsense manner with dedicated Members and veterans like my colleague from Minnesota (Mr. Walz) to find solutions to help our Nation's veterans transition to civilian life. One of the most critical areas that we as a committee and Congress must work to establish is comprehensive, timely, responsive, and effective mental health care services for our post- 9/11 veterans, many of whom have served our country for multiple deployments in conditions not witnessed or experienced by any other generation of soldier. This bill first prioritizes bringing accountability to the VA. By bringing in a third party to conduct an annual evaluation within the Department of Veterans Affairs, we can better provide agency accountability by doing just this. Second, we must provide better access to mental health services for our veterans and their families. This bill does just that. Finally, it helps facilitate and increase awareness for peer and community support providers for our veterans and their families. This commonsense legislation works towards those priorities of providing an accountable and supportive VA for our veterans, in furtherance of helping veterans get the best treatment possible. So, Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support this commonsense legislation to promote mental health support for our Nation's heroes and thank Congressman Walz for his leadership on this important legislation. Ms. BROWN of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee). (Ms. JACKSON LEE asked and was given permission to revise and extend her remarks.) Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, this is an appropriate and wonderful statement of two distinguished Members of Congress, the chairman and ranking member of the Veterans' Affairs Committee, and I associate myself with their words on how crucial this legislation is, and what an important statement the Veterans' Affairs Committee is making: that there is no party affiliation when it comes to saving the lives of our men and women who put on the uniform. To the author of this bill, Mr. Walz, as I chatted with him on the floor, I indicated to him that just this weekend I met for hours with two wounded warriors, both of them having experience with PTSD, both of them being challenged about the transition into civilian life, both of them knowing of this legislation, feeling left out and deprived that it did not, despite the valiant effort of this House, pass in the last Congress. So let me congratulate all of you for recognizing that this is a crucial, lifesaving element of the men and women that we stand and admire and love. Every day, 22 veterans take their lives, but it is 8,000 a year. And if I might say, Texas walks alongside of Florida and other States in having the highest number of returning vets. Two million served in Iraq and Afghanistan across the Nation. Now, one-third, 600,000, have experienced traumatic brain injury and PTSD. From the early years of working with then-Chairman and Ranking Member Murtha, I was privileged to bring $1 million to my district for PTSD, but that is not the heart of it. The bleeding and the sorrow of these men and women is not befitting of the service and the uniform that they put on. Not one moment should they wait at a veterans hospital for treatment for PTSD that should keep them grounded. Not one moment should they be alone contemplating suicide, without treatment and friends and family having assistance. This bill makes that statement, H.R. 203, the Clay Hunt SAV Act. It says that you are not alone and that we have put our actions where our words are. We have walked the walk. So I want to say to those wounded warriors who shared their heart with me, proudly come back and say: This bill is moving, and as it moves to the United States Senate, this bill is moving. And as we look to the President's desk, a signature will allow this bill to be in place. To those who missed the deadline, this law will allow you to still be able to receive that treatment because it allows an extended time for those who have missed the deadline. I know as I go back home to Texas and meet families that they are looking for action when it comes to our beloved veterans and those who have put on the uniform to serve this Nation as they watched their comrades die. This is a bill that says, God bless America. {time} 1730 The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentlewoman has expired. Ms. BROWN of Florida. I yield an additional 1 minute to the gentlewoman from Texas. Ms. JACKSON LEE. This is a bill that reflects the Constitution, the Declaration of Independence, and our wonderful Pledge of Allegiance to the flag of the United States of America. I want to say to my friends at Ellington Field, which is just down the road [[Page H201]] from my congressional district, and to the many bases across the State of Texas that have amongst their ranks veterans who have served in Active Duty and who are still pressing forward in spite of conditions that they face, this is the bill that provides the answer and the love and affection for the veterans and military personnel who have put on the uniform every day and who have never--never once--shied away from their duty and decided that their lives and their ills were greater than their commitment to this Nation. We owe them this. This is a ``God bless America'' bill. I thank the proponents of it. Mr. MILLER of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I would like to inquire of the ranking member how many speakers she has left. Ms. BROWN of Florida. The last speaker just finished. I have no additional speakers. Mr. MILLER of Florida. We have no additional speakers either, so we are prepared to close. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Ms. BROWN of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. It is unacceptable that 22 veterans are dying by suicide every day. We need to pull all stakeholders together to work as a group to solve the problem. There is not one cause and not one answer. There are a multitude of answers and a multitude of causes and solutions. The Department of Defense, the VA, and the veterans service organizations need to work together to come up with many solutions that will meet the needs. There is not one solution but many. I pledge to work with my colleague from Minnesota and Chairman Miller to address the issues in the upcoming session. Access to mental health care and benefits for our veterans is an issue I plan to focus on in the months ahead, and I look forward to working with all of my colleagues to ensure that veterans are given the benefits and services that they have earned. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. MILLER of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Ms. BROWN of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Connecticut (Mr. Larson). Mr. LARSON of Connecticut. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the ranking member, and certainly, I want to thank the chairman. I won't take the 2 minutes, but I want to thank them for their incredible cooperation on this most important of issues. Derek Denfeld, from my district, lost his life. There has been sadness and the coming together of the community. Our hearts go out to his wife, Heather; to his son, Felix; and certainly to his parents, Deb and Chris, whom I know personally. I thank the ranking member. I thank the sergeant major for his sponsorship of this bill, and I thank the ranking member and the chairman for what is an important piece of legislation. As noted, we can't wait another day for this to take effect. Ms. BROWN of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. MILLER of Florida. Mr. Speaker, in closing, I appreciate the comments from both sides of the aisle, and I look forward to working with all of our colleagues on future issues as they relate to the Department of Veterans Affairs and, in particular, the SAV Act. I yield back the balance of my time. Ms. DUCKWORTH. Mr. Speaker, I was pleased that my colleagues unanimously agreed during the 113th Congress that we must act to combat Veteran suicide and I am grateful that we are acting quickly in the first days of the 114th Congress to address this critical unfinished business. The statistics are heartbreaking. An average of 22 Veterans commit suicide every day. So each day that we delay action is a day we cannot afford. I was proud to help introduce HR. 5059, Clay Hunt Suicide Prevention for American Veterans Act with Chairman Jeff Miller and Representative Tim Walz. While there is no bill that will completely end Veteran suicide, this comprehensive measure is a step in the right direction. It will remove barriers that prevent our nation's heroes from getting the quality, timely mental health care that they deserve. It is my sincere hope that my colleagues in the Senate will take note of the momentum in the House and bring this legislation to the Senate Floor as soon as possible. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Miller) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 203. The question was taken. The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the opinion of the Chair, two-thirds being in the affirmative, the ayes have it. Ms. BROWN of Florida. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays. The yeas and nays were ordered. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further proceedings on this motion will be postponed. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 5 (Monday, January 12, 2015)] [House] [Pages H196-H201] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] CLAY HUNT SUICIDE PREVENTION FOR AMERICAN VETERANS ACT Mr. MILLER of Florida.

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Miller) and the gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. Brown) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Florida. General Leave Mr. MILLER of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Florida? There was no objection. Mr. MILLER of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in proud support of H.R. 203, the Clay Hunt SAV Act. This bill was introduced by my good friend and a very important member of the Veterans Affairs' Committee, Congressman Tim Walz from Minnesota. I am honored to join him and Congresswoman Tammy Duckworth from Illinois as an original cosponsor of this legislation. I am also grateful for the support of several of our military veterans' service organizations, including the Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America, the Veterans of Foreign Wars, the American Legion, the Disabled American Veterans, the Military Officers Association of America, and the Wounded Warrior Project. H.R. 203 is named after a true American hero, Clay Hunt. Clay was a Marine Corps veteran who served honorably in both Afghanistan and Iraq, where he was wounded in battle. Clay returned home grappling with posttraumatic stress disorder but refused to let his personal struggles prevent him from devoting his time to humanitarian work and advocacy on behalf of his fellow veterans. However, in March of 2011, at just 28 years of age, Clay took his own life. With an average of 22 veterans committing suicide each day, Clay was far from alone in his pain, and his family and friends are far from alone in their heartbreak over his loss. The last several years have seen significant increases in the Department of Veterans Affairs' mental health and suicide prevention budget, staff, and programs; however, we have not seen a corresponding decrease in the number of our Nation's heroes who take their own lives. What is more, for some groups of veterans, including female veterans and veterans of Iraq and Afghanistan, suicide rates are actually getting worse. Mr. Speaker, we have got to do more to help these veterans access the supportive services and mental health care that they need to save their lives. With the passage of H.R. 203, we will. To improve the efficiency and effectiveness of VA programs and increase awareness of available services, H.R. 203 would require an annual third-party evaluation of VA's mental health care and suicide prevention programs and require that VA publish an interactive Web site to serve as a central source of information regarding VA mental health services. To increase VA's capacity to meet the mental health care needs of our veterans, it would establish a pilot program that would repay education loans for individuals who have received a degree in psychiatric medicine and who agree to work at the VA for at least 2 years. To create a seamless transition from Active Duty to veteran status and increased community support for those in need, it would establish another pilot program to assist veterans during transition and require VA to collaborate with nonprofit mental health organizations in the community. Importantly, H.R. 203 would extend an additional 1 year of eligibility for VA health care services for certain combat veterans who have not yet enrolled and whose 5-year combat eligibility period recently expired. Before I yield, I want to take a moment to once again express my condolences to Clay's family and friends as well as the families and friends of our honored veterans who have lost their lives to suicide. I want to offer them my personal commitment to continue the aggressive pursuit to end veteran suicide. The passage of this bill today is just the first in what will be a continuing series of legislative and oversight efforts that our committee is going to undertake throughout the 114th Congress to improve access to mental health care for veterans in need, increase the efficiency and effectiveness of VA's mental health and suicide prevention programs, and increase meaningful partnerships with community providers who are often the first line of defense for their struggling veterans and the families of those veterans. This bill, which passed the House last Congress, will not single- handedly halt the scourge of veteran suicide, but it is an important step, and it is a step that we owe Clay and those like him who desperately need and certainly deserve our help. With that, I urge all of my colleagues to join me in supporting H.R. 203. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Ms. BROWN of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 203, the Clay Hunt SAV Act. This legislation passed the House last month in the closing days of the 113th Congress. I am pleased that we were able to act on this measure as one of the first items of business in the 114th Congress. Providing the mental health care that veterans need and effectively dealing with the crisis of veteran suicides have been longstanding concerns of the Committee on Veterans' Affairs. War is indeed terrible, and the effects of combat and service on our veterans lasts a lifetime. For far too long, society--and the military culture itself--has acted as if the need for mental health care treatment is a weakness and has discouraged adequate treatment. This attitude is changing, but it cannot change fast enough. In the area of mental health for our veterans and returning servicemembers, there is no easy answer or quick fix. I appreciate the work of my friend from Minnesota, Tim Walz; Chairman Miller; and all of my colleagues on the committee in fashioning a bill that I believe will make a difference in the lives of our veterans. H.R. 203 takes a number of important steps, including improving the safety net for at-risk veterans, while also introducing some accountability into the VA mental health care and suicide prevention program, using a third-party evaluation. It will provide veterans with a Web site that will serve as a centralized source of information on mental health services. H.R. 203 initiates a program to help address some of the glaring mental health personnel shortages at the VA. While the incentives in this bill are limited to the psychiatry field, I would like to see this effort expanded in the future to all the mental health professional shortfalls. {time} 1715 H.R. 203 would expand peer support networks, which we have heard are quite effectively used. And I believe the reporting requirement in this bill will confirm that additional resources should be permanently dedicated to fully utilizing peer support. H.R. 203 would also provide an additional window of eligibility for combat veterans who may have missed the window of opportunity to sign up for VA health care. This extra time will help to ensure that veterans receive the health care, including mental health care, that they need. I thank the chairman for working to bring this bill up quickly so that the House can act and send this important measure to the Senate. I look forward to working with Chairman Miller, and with Florida being the State with the second-largest population of veterans and the most senior population, I know that the committee will do a good job having two of the leadership team from Florida. But let me be clear: there are 435 Members of Congress, and each of them have veterans in their district, and we will work to make sure that all veterans get the care that they have earned and deserve. [[Page H199]] Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. MILLER of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I thank the new ranking member for her words. I look forward to working with her on legislation in the future. With that, Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from the Second District of Indiana, from Elkhart, Indiana (Mrs. Walorski). Mrs. WALORSKI. Mr. Speaker, I thank the distinguished gentleman from Florida for yielding, and I am grateful to be here today to support the Clay Hunt SAV Act. Every day, 22 veterans take their own lives. We have all experienced this in our districts; I have as well. On March 31, 2011, Clay Hunt was one of those 22 veterans that day who took his own life. Today, we honor Clay and his family with the Clay Hunt SAV Act. Clay's story was one of bravery and dedication. He relied on the VA for care and received a 30 percent disability rating for PTSD brought on during his service. He appealed the rating and encountered a bureaucratic nightmare. Clay had to wait months to see a psychiatrist at a VA Medical Center. Two weeks later, Clay took his own life. Five weeks after his death and 18 months after filing an appeal with the VA for his PTSD rating, his appeal was approved. Clay's story details the urgency that our Nation's heroes deserve. The Clay Hunt SAV Act will increase access to mental health care and improve the quality of care troops and veterans receive. Together, we can change this system so that no other veteran ever has to endure what thousands of veterans have already gone through, including Clay. I am honored to stand here today and am grateful to my colleagues. I urge support for this legislation. Ms. BROWN of Florida. Mr. Speaker, how much time is remaining? The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentlewoman from Florida has 16\1/2\ minutes remaining. Ms. BROWN of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. Walz). Mr. WALZ. Mr. Speaker, I thank the ranking member for your support of this important piece of legislation. As you heard, we are here once again. We had a piece of legislation that attempted to, as I think the chairman spoke about, address an issue that cuts to the heart and the soul of this Nation: When our warriors come home, how can we reintegrate them? And I think it is important, and I want to thank the chairman, one, for working so diligently on many numerous issues, but on this piece of legislation, and for bringing it back up again, but I think also for setting an example. The Nation expects us to do what is right by our warriors. They expect us to work together to find solutions. Something that we do in the committee is looking and seeing where we can improve and pointing out where there are faults. But that is not good enough. Pointing out the faults is one thing, and it is important. Finding solutions is what really matters, and this piece of legislation, I think, starts to do that. To my colleagues who are here, I would say this. We can certainly disagree and disagree strongly and passionately. But I think if the public knew and they could feel it and, I think, in this piece of legislation see it, there are many more things that bind us together, and our care and our commitment for our warriors is one of those. This is a piece of legislation that wasn't just written here in the Halls of Congress. It was written by the families, Susan and Richard Selke, Clay's parents; by the Houghtalings in Minnesota; and the Kellys in New Ulm, Minnesota; and each of these Members that you hear speak about it. Since we passed this legislation, and it failed in the Senate, over 750 veterans have taken their lives. Many times down here, we feel like everything we do is the most important thing that needs to happen now. Rarely is that true. In this case, it is. We can't wait another day. We can't pass this problem forward because it is not only ripping at families, it is ripping at our Nation. These are our best and brightest. You heard about Clay. Clay's a Marine who went to Iraq. He got shot by a sniper and, as a Marine, that irritated him. It didn't hurt him. He came back. He had his Purple Heart, and he could have come back and taken our thank yous. He didn't. He went to Afghanistan to continue on. He knew the extremism that was threatening Iraq and Afghanistan would some day threaten this Nation, so he was forward. He did his time. After he came back, that wasn't enough. He went to Haiti to help. After that, that wasn't enough. He sat in our offices on numerous occasions working on everything from access to the VA to the things you heard the gentlelady talk about in Indiana that were causing frustration amongst our veterans. And I think for me the thing is, like for so many of us, Clay appeared to have everything. He appeared that he knew and was competent and had it there, but we all know that they have demons, and Clay had demons. So what this piece of legislation does--you heard the specifics, and it does do specific things, and no one is claiming that this is going to be the fix. But I would make the case that what the Clay Hunt bill has done and what it has done amongst our partners in the veterans service organizations is made it absolutely clear we will not leave anyone behind. We will not turn a blind eye to this, and we will not rest until we at least make the attempt to get that number down to zero. We may never get there, but this piece of legislation starts to address it. So I think it is important, and I want to thank the ranking member for being on this bill and putting it forward, and the chairman, who was an original author of this and has been instrumental in making it happen. What we are doing here is not just passing legislation. What we are doing here is changing the attitudes, focusing the Nation's attention on this, because I don't care if it is Elkhart, Indiana, if it is Pensacola, Florida, or if it is Mankato, Minnesota. When we go to talk to our constituents, regardless of their political leanings, they tell us, take care of our warriors, do what is right. Fix the system. This piece of legislation does that. It does it in a cost-effective, smart manner, and we have got the opportunity to start moving forward. I would say and encourage my colleagues, let's pass this thing, but let's not see it as an end result of a process we have been working on. Let's see it as the first of many things to try and make changes to be smarter about how we use taxpayer dollars, but also to demand effectiveness, because Clay's parents deserve that. Thousands of others across this Nation deserve that. The more than 1 million veterans that will return over the next few years are counting on us to put everything in place to provide that help. So I encourage my colleagues, support this legislation. I encourage my colleagues, take this as an example. I want to thank Speaker Boehner and Majority Leader McCarthy for making it a priority. I think it speaks volumes. This piece of legislation is on the floor in the first week. That says something, that there is a commitment to getting it right, there is a commitment to working together, and there is a commitment to showing effectiveness for the American people. So, we have got that opportunity. I ask my colleagues to support this legislation, get engaged with what is happening with our veterans, and let's prove that their service was not in vain, that this democracy is strong, that our commitment to them is unwavering and that, at the end of the day, that is what really matters. Mr. Speaker, I am very grateful for the opportunity to again tell you about a very important piece of legislation that will help in our fight to improve mental health care for our returning warriors: H.R. 203, the Clay Hunt SAV Act. I'd like to thank the Chairman of the House Veterans Affairs Committee, Mr. Miller, and Rep. Duckworth for continuing to be my partners in this effort. I'd also like to thank Speaker Boehner for bringing this to the floor swiftly. And, a big thank you to Senators McCain, Burr, Blumenthal, and Isakson for all their work on the SAV Act. Most importantly, I'd like to thank Clay's parents, Susan and Richard Selke. They are holding Congress' feet to the fire to make sure we get this done and to prevent another family from going through what they continue to go [[Page H200]] through each and every day. We cannot let them down. H.R. 203, the Clay Hunt Suicide Prevention for American Veterans Act, is an example of how we can work together on Capitol Hill. The legislation is named in honor of Iraq and Afghanistan War Veteran and suicide prevention advocate, Clay Hunt. Clay epitomized what it meant to live a life of service, both in and out of uniform. He helped countless veterans overcome their demons but tragically took his own life in March of 2011. The legacy he left behind, however, will live on for generations to come. The bill you see before you was the result of strong partnerships with our veteran service organizations, strong bipartisan efforts here in Congress, and the resolve of Clay's parents pushing and pushing and pushing to get this thing done. This bill is what you get when you have folks sitting around the table, trusting one another, and working together to get it right for our nation's veterans. Our premise for this bill was simple: suicide occurs because many vets return to their community and then disconnect from it. So, we wanted to create a bill that would get the communities involved and coordinated. We also knew it would be important to increase both oversight of the VA and their capacity to deal with over a million veterans returning from war. Specifically, the bill: 1. Establishes a peer support and community outreach pilot program to assist transitioning servicemembers with accessing VA mental health care services. 2. Requires the VA to create a one-stop, interactive website to serve as a centralized source of information regarding all mental health services for veterans. 3. Addresses the shortage of mental health care professionals by authorizing the VA to conduct a student loan repayment pilot program aimed at recruiting and retaining psychiatrists. 4. Requires yearly evaluations--with interim reports due in the first two years and a final report due the third year and every year after-- conducted by a third party, of all mental health care and suicide prevention practices and programs at the VA to find out what is working and what's not working and to make recommendations to improve care. Authorizes a Government Accountability Office (GAO) report on the transition of care for PTSD and TBI between the DoD and the VA. One veteran lost to suicide is one too many. With many of our warriors returning from war, all too often our heroes return only to face a war of their own at home. While there is no bill that will completely end veteran suicide, this bipartisan measure is a step in the right direction. In short, it's a start towards fixing a problem, but we must not lose focus on this problem after passing this bill. We must continue working to improve care for our veterans. I urge my colleagues to support this measure so that we can send it over to the Senate and onto the President swiftly. Mr. MILLER of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from the Sixth District of Pennsylvania (Mr. Costello), a new member of the committee, who, in his first week, has already jumped in with both feet. Mr. Costello has been to my office and started looking closely at the oversight agenda that we have. Mr. COSTELLO of Pennsylvania. I thank the distinguished gentleman from Florida for yielding. Mr. Speaker, I stand here today to express my support of Congressman Tim Walz's Clay Hunt Suicide Prevention for American Veterans Act. It is a privilege to serve on the House Committee on Veterans' Affairs and in this Congress, to work to improve the quality of life for our Nation's veterans, their families, and their caregivers. In the coming months, I look forward to working in a bipartisan, commonsense manner with dedicated Members and veterans like my colleague from Minnesota (Mr. Walz) to find solutions to help our Nation's veterans transition to civilian life. One of the most critical areas that we as a committee and Congress must work to establish is comprehensive, timely, responsive, and effective mental health care services for our post- 9/11 veterans, many of whom have served our country for multiple deployments in conditions not witnessed or experienced by any other generation of soldier. This bill first prioritizes bringing accountability to the VA. By bringing in a third party to conduct an annual evaluation within the Department of Veterans Affairs, we can better provide agency accountability by doing just this. Second, we must provide better access to mental health services for our veterans and their families. This bill does just that. Finally, it helps facilitate and increase awareness for peer and community support providers for our veterans and their families. This commonsense legislation works towards those priorities of providing an accountable and supportive VA for our veterans, in furtherance of helping veterans get the best treatment possible. So, Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support this commonsense legislation to promote mental health support for our Nation's heroes and thank Congressman Walz for his leadership on this important legislation. Ms. BROWN of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee). (Ms. JACKSON LEE asked and was given permission to revise and extend her remarks.) Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, this is an appropriate and wonderful statement of two distinguished Members of Congress, the chairman and ranking member of the Veterans' Affairs Committee, and I associate myself with their words on how crucial this legislation is, and what an important statement the Veterans' Affairs Committee is making: that there is no party affiliation when it comes to saving the lives of our men and women who put on the uniform. To the author of this bill, Mr. Walz, as I chatted with him on the floor, I indicated to him that just this weekend I met for hours with two wounded warriors, both of them having experience with PTSD, both of them being challenged about the transition into civilian life, both of them knowing of this legislation, feeling left out and deprived that it did not, despite the valiant effort of this House, pass in the last Congress. So let me congratulate all of you for recognizing that this is a crucial, lifesaving element of the men and women that we stand and admire and love. Every day, 22 veterans take their lives, but it is 8,000 a year. And if I might say, Texas walks alongside of Florida and other States in having the highest number of returning vets. Two million served in Iraq and Afghanistan across the Nation. Now, one-third, 600,000, have experienced traumatic brain injury and PTSD. From the early years of working with then-Chairman and Ranking Member Murtha, I was privileged to bring $1 million to my district for PTSD, but that is not the heart of it. The bleeding and the sorrow of these men and women is not befitting of the service and the uniform that they put on. Not one moment should they wait at a veterans hospital for treatment for PTSD that should keep them grounded. Not one moment should they be alone contemplating suicide, without treatment and friends and family having assistance. This bill makes that statement, H.R. 203, the Clay Hunt SAV Act. It says that you are not alone and that we have put our actions where our words are. We have walked the walk. So I want to say to those wounded warriors who shared their heart with me, proudly come back and say: This bill is moving, and as it moves to the United States Senate, this bill is moving. And as we look to the President's desk, a signature will allow this bill to be in place. To those who missed the deadline, this law will allow you to still be able to receive that treatment because it allows an extended time for those who have missed the deadline. I know as I go back home to Texas and meet families that they are looking for action when it comes to our beloved veterans and those who have put on the uniform to serve this Nation as they watched their comrades die. This is a bill that says, God bless America. {time} 1730 The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentlewoman has expired. Ms. BROWN of Florida. I yield an additional 1 minute to the gentlewoman from Texas. Ms. JACKSON LEE. This is a bill that reflects the Constitution, the Declaration of Independence, and our wonderful Pledge of Allegiance to the flag of the United States of America. I want to say to my friends at Ellington Field, which is just down the road [[Page H201]] from my congressional district, and to the many bases across the State of Texas that have amongst their ranks veterans who have served in Active Duty and who are still pressing forward in spite of conditions that they face, this is the bill that provides the answer and the love and affection for the veterans and military personnel who have put on the uniform every day and who have never--never once--shied away from their duty and decided that their lives and their ills were greater than their commitment to this Nation. We owe them this. This is a ``God bless America'' bill. I thank the proponents of it. Mr. MILLER of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I would like to inquire of the ranking member how many speakers she has left. Ms. BROWN of Florida. The last speaker just finished. I have no additional speakers. Mr. MILLER of Florida. We have no additional speakers either, so we are prepared to close. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Ms. BROWN of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. It is unacceptable that 22 veterans are dying by suicide every day. We need to pull all stakeholders together to work as a group to solve the problem. There is not one cause and not one answer. There are a multitude of answers and a multitude of causes and solutions. The Department of Defense, the VA, and the veterans service organizations need to work together to come up with many solutions that will meet the needs. There is not one solution but many. I pledge to work with my colleague from Minnesota and Chairman Miller to address the issues in the upcoming session. Access to mental health care and benefits for our veterans is an issue I plan to focus on in the months ahead, and I look forward to working with all of my colleagues to ensure that veterans are given the benefits and services that they have earned. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. MILLER of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Ms. BROWN of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Connecticut (Mr. Larson). Mr. LARSON of Connecticut. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the ranking member, and certainly, I want to thank the chairman. I won't take the 2 minutes, but I want to thank them for their incredible cooperation on this most important of issues. Derek Denfeld, from my district, lost his life. There has been sadness and the coming together of the community. Our hearts go out to his wife, Heather; to his son, Felix; and certainly to his parents, Deb and Chris, whom I know personally. I thank the ranking member. I thank the sergeant major for his sponsorship of this bill, and I thank the ranking member and the chairman for what is an important piece of legislation. As noted, we can't wait another day for this to take effect. Ms. BROWN of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. MILLER of Florida. Mr. Speaker, in closing, I appreciate the comments from both sides of the aisle, and I look forward to working with all of our colleagues on future issues as they relate to the Department of Veterans Affairs and, in particular, the SAV Act. I yield back the balance of my time. Ms. DUCKWORTH. Mr. Speaker, I was pleased that my colleagues unanimously agreed during the 113th Congress that we must act to combat Veteran suicide and I am grateful that we are acting quickly in the first days of the 114th Congress to address this critical unfinished business. The statistics are heartbreaking. An average of 22 Veterans commit suicide every day. So each day that we delay action is a day we cannot afford. I was proud to help introduce HR. 5059, Clay Hunt Suicide Prevention for American Veterans Act with Chairman Jeff Miller and Representative Tim Walz. While there is no bill that will completely end Veteran suicide, this comprehensive measure is a step in the right direction. It will remove barriers that prevent our nation's heroes from getting the quality, timely mental health care that they deserve. It is my sincere hope that my colleagues in the Senate will take note of the momentum in the House and bring this legislation to the Senate Floor as soon as possible. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Miller) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 203. The question was taken. The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the opinion of the Chair, two-thirds being in the affirmative, the ayes have it. Ms. BROWN of Florida. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays. The yeas and nays were ordered. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further proceedings on this motion will be postponed. ____________________","Congressional Record, Volume 161 Issue 5 (Monday, January 12, 2015) [Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 5 (Monday, January 12, 2015)] [House] [Pages H196-H201] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] CLAY HUNT SUICIDE PREVENTION FOR AMERICAN VETERANS ACT Mr. MILLER of Florida.

SEC. 8. PROHIBITION ON NEW APPROPRIATIONS. No additional funds are authorized to be appropriated to carry out this Act and the amendments made by this Act, and this Act and such amendments shall be carried out using amounts otherwise made available for such purposes. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Miller) and the gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. Brown) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Florida. General Leave Mr. MILLER of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Florida? There was no objection. Mr. MILLER of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in proud support of H.R. 203, the Clay Hunt SAV Act. This bill was introduced by my good friend and a very important member of the Veterans Affairs' Committee, Congressman Tim Walz from Minnesota. I am honored to join him and Congresswoman Tammy Duckworth from Illinois as an original cosponsor of this legislation. I am also grateful for the support of several of our military veterans' service organizations, including the Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America, the Veterans of Foreign Wars, the American Legion, the Disabled American Veterans, the Military Officers Association of America, and the Wounded Warrior Project. H.R. 203 is named after a true American hero, Clay Hunt. Clay was a Marine Corps veteran who served honorably in both Afghanistan and Iraq, where he was wounded in battle. Clay returned home grappling with posttraumatic stress disorder but refused to let his personal struggles prevent him from devoting his time to humanitarian work and advocacy on behalf of his fellow veterans. However, in March of 2011, at just 28 years of age, Clay took his own life. With an average of 22 veterans committing suicide each day, Clay was far from alone in his pain, and his family and friends are far from alone in their heartbreak over his loss. The last several years have seen significant increases in the Department of Veterans Affairs' mental health and suicide prevention budget, staff, and programs; however, we have not seen a corresponding decrease in the number of our Nation's heroes who take their own lives. What is more, for some groups of veterans, including female veterans and veterans of Iraq and Afghanistan, suicide rates are actually getting worse. Mr. Speaker, we have got to do more to help these veterans access the supportive services and mental health care that they need to save their lives. With the passage of H.R. 203, we will. To improve the efficiency and effectiveness of VA programs and increase awareness of available services, H.R. 203 would require an annual third-party evaluation of VA's mental health care and suicide prevention programs and require that VA publish an interactive Web site to serve as a central source of information regarding VA mental health services. To increase VA's capacity to meet the mental health care needs of our veterans, it would establish a pilot program that would repay education loans for individuals who have received a degree in psychiatric medicine and who agree to work at the VA for at least 2 years. To create a seamless transition from Active Duty to veteran status and increased community support for those in need, it would establish another pilot program to assist veterans during transition and require VA to collaborate with nonprofit mental health organizations in the community. Importantly, H.R. 203 would extend an additional 1 year of eligibility for VA health care services for certain combat veterans who have not yet enrolled and whose 5-year combat eligibility period recently expired. Before I yield, I want to take a moment to once again express my condolences to Clay's family and friends as well as the families and friends of our honored veterans who have lost their lives to suicide. I want to offer them my personal commitment to continue the aggressive pursuit to end veteran suicide. The passage of this bill today is just the first in what will be a continuing series of legislative and oversight efforts that our committee is going to undertake throughout the 114th Congress to improve access to mental health care for veterans in need, increase the efficiency and effectiveness of VA's mental health and suicide prevention programs, and increase meaningful partnerships with community providers who are often the first line of defense for their struggling veterans and the families of those veterans. This bill, which passed the House last Congress, will not single- handedly halt the scourge of veteran suicide, but it is an important step, and it is a step that we owe Clay and those like him who desperately need and certainly deserve our help. With that, I urge all of my colleagues to join me in supporting H.R. 203. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Ms. BROWN of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 203, the Clay Hunt SAV Act. This legislation passed the House last month in the closing days of the 113th Congress. I am pleased that we were able to act on this measure as one of the first items of business in the 114th Congress. Providing the mental health care that veterans need and effectively dealing with the crisis of veteran suicides have been longstanding concerns of the Committee on Veterans' Affairs. War is indeed terrible, and the effects of combat and service on our veterans lasts a lifetime. For far too long, society--and the military culture itself--has acted as if the need for mental health care treatment is a weakness and has discouraged adequate treatment. This attitude is changing, but it cannot change fast enough. In the area of mental health for our veterans and returning servicemembers, there is no easy answer or quick fix. I appreciate the work of my friend from Minnesota, Tim Walz; Chairman Miller; and all of my colleagues on the committee in fashioning a bill that I believe will make a difference in the lives of our veterans. H.R. 203 takes a number of important steps, including improving the safety net for at-risk veterans, while also introducing some accountability into the VA mental health care and suicide prevention program, using a third-party evaluation. It will provide veterans with a Web site that will serve as a centralized source of information on mental health services. H.R. 203 initiates a program to help address some of the glaring mental health personnel shortages at the VA. While the incentives in this bill are limited to the psychiatry field, I would like to see this effort expanded in the future to all the mental health professional shortfalls. {time} 1715 H.R. 203 would expand peer support networks, which we have heard are quite effectively used. And I believe the reporting requirement in this bill will confirm that additional resources should be permanently dedicated to fully utilizing peer support. H.R. 203 would also provide an additional window of eligibility for combat veterans who may have missed the window of opportunity to sign up for VA health care. This extra time will help to ensure that veterans receive the health care, including mental health care, that they need. I thank the chairman for working to bring this bill up quickly so that the House can act and send this important measure to the Senate. I look forward to working with Chairman Miller, and with Florida being the State with the second-largest population of veterans and the most senior population, I know that the committee will do a good job having two of the leadership team from Florida. But let me be clear: there are 435 Members of Congress, and each of them have veterans in their district, and we will work to make sure that all veterans get the care that they have earned and deserve. [[Page H199]] Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. MILLER of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I thank the new ranking member for her words. I look forward to working with her on legislation in the future. With that, Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from the Second District of Indiana, from Elkhart, Indiana (Mrs. Walorski). Mrs. WALORSKI. Mr. Speaker, I thank the distinguished gentleman from Florida for yielding, and I am grateful to be here today to support the Clay Hunt SAV Act. Every day, 22 veterans take their own lives. We have all experienced this in our districts; I have as well. On March 31, 2011, Clay Hunt was one of those 22 veterans that day who took his own life. Today, we honor Clay and his family with the Clay Hunt SAV Act. Clay's story was one of bravery and dedication. He relied on the VA for care and received a 30 percent disability rating for PTSD brought on during his service. He appealed the rating and encountered a bureaucratic nightmare. Clay had to wait months to see a psychiatrist at a VA Medical Center. Two weeks later, Clay took his own life. Five weeks after his death and 18 months after filing an appeal with the VA for his PTSD rating, his appeal was approved. Clay's story details the urgency that our Nation's heroes deserve. The Clay Hunt SAV Act will increase access to mental health care and improve the quality of care troops and veterans receive. Together, we can change this system so that no other veteran ever has to endure what thousands of veterans have already gone through, including Clay. I am honored to stand here today and am grateful to my colleagues. I urge support for this legislation. Ms. BROWN of Florida. Mr. Speaker, how much time is remaining? The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentlewoman from Florida has 16\1/2\ minutes remaining. Ms. BROWN of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. Walz). Mr. WALZ. Mr. Speaker, I thank the ranking member for your support of this important piece of legislation. As you heard, we are here once again. We had a piece of legislation that attempted to, as I think the chairman spoke about, address an issue that cuts to the heart and the soul of this Nation: When our warriors come home, how can we reintegrate them? And I think it is important, and I want to thank the chairman, one, for working so diligently on many numerous issues, but on this piece of legislation, and for bringing it back up again, but I think also for setting an example. The Nation expects us to do what is right by our warriors. They expect us to work together to find solutions. Something that we do in the committee is looking and seeing where we can improve and pointing out where there are faults. But that is not good enough. Pointing out the faults is one thing, and it is important. Finding solutions is what really matters, and this piece of legislation, I think, starts to do that. To my colleagues who are here, I would say this. We can certainly disagree and disagree strongly and passionately. But I think if the public knew and they could feel it and, I think, in this piece of legislation see it, there are many more things that bind us together, and our care and our commitment for our warriors is one of those. This is a piece of legislation that wasn't just written here in the Halls of Congress. It was written by the families, Susan and Richard Selke, Clay's parents; by the Houghtalings in Minnesota; and the Kellys in New Ulm, Minnesota; and each of these Members that you hear speak about it. Since we passed this legislation, and it failed in the Senate, over 750 veterans have taken their lives. Many times down here, we feel like everything we do is the most important thing that needs to happen now. Rarely is that true. In this case, it is. We can't wait another day. We can't pass this problem forward because it is not only ripping at families, it is ripping at our Nation. These are our best and brightest. You heard about Clay. Clay's a Marine who went to Iraq. He got shot by a sniper and, as a Marine, that irritated him. It didn't hurt him. He came back. He had his Purple Heart, and he could have come back and taken our thank yous. He didn't. He went to Afghanistan to continue on. He knew the extremism that was threatening Iraq and Afghanistan would some day threaten this Nation, so he was forward. He did his time. After he came back, that wasn't enough. He went to Haiti to help. After that, that wasn't enough. He sat in our offices on numerous occasions working on everything from access to the VA to the things you heard the gentlelady talk about in Indiana that were causing frustration amongst our veterans. And I think for me the thing is, like for so many of us, Clay appeared to have everything. He appeared that he knew and was competent and had it there, but we all know that they have demons, and Clay had demons. So what this piece of legislation does--you heard the specifics, and it does do specific things, and no one is claiming that this is going to be the fix. But I would make the case that what the Clay Hunt bill has done and what it has done amongst our partners in the veterans service organizations is made it absolutely clear we will not leave anyone behind. We will not turn a blind eye to this, and we will not rest until we at least make the attempt to get that number down to zero. We may never get there, but this piece of legislation starts to address it. So I think it is important, and I want to thank the ranking member for being on this bill and putting it forward, and the chairman, who was an original author of this and has been instrumental in making it happen. What we are doing here is not just passing legislation. What we are doing here is changing the attitudes, focusing the Nation's attention on this, because I don't care if it is Elkhart, Indiana, if it is Pensacola, Florida, or if it is Mankato, Minnesota. When we go to talk to our constituents, regardless of their political leanings, they tell us, take care of our warriors, do what is right. Fix the system. This piece of legislation does that. It does it in a cost-effective, smart manner, and we have got the opportunity to start moving forward. I would say and encourage my colleagues, let's pass this thing, but let's not see it as an end result of a process we have been working on. Let's see it as the first of many things to try and make changes to be smarter about how we use taxpayer dollars, but also to demand effectiveness, because Clay's parents deserve that. Thousands of others across this Nation deserve that. The more than 1 million veterans that will return over the next few years are counting on us to put everything in place to provide that help. So I encourage my colleagues, support this legislation. I encourage my colleagues, take this as an example. I want to thank Speaker Boehner and Majority Leader McCarthy for making it a priority. I think it speaks volumes. This piece of legislation is on the floor in the first week. That says something, that there is a commitment to getting it right, there is a commitment to working together, and there is a commitment to showing effectiveness for the American people. So, we have got that opportunity. I ask my colleagues to support this legislation, get engaged with what is happening with our veterans, and let's prove that their service was not in vain, that this democracy is strong, that our commitment to them is unwavering and that, at the end of the day, that is what really matters. Mr. Speaker, I am very grateful for the opportunity to again tell you about a very important piece of legislation that will help in our fight to improve mental health care for our returning warriors: H.R. 203, the Clay Hunt SAV Act. I'd like to thank the Chairman of the House Veterans Affairs Committee, Mr. Miller, and Rep. Duckworth for continuing to be my partners in this effort. I'd also like to thank Speaker Boehner for bringing this to the floor swiftly. And, a big thank you to Senators McCain, Burr, Blumenthal, and Isakson for all their work on the SAV Act. Most importantly, I'd like to thank Clay's parents, Susan and Richard Selke. They are holding Congress' feet to the fire to make sure we get this done and to prevent another family from going through what they continue to go [[Page H200]] through each and every day. We cannot let them down. H.R. 203, the Clay Hunt Suicide Prevention for American Veterans Act, is an example of how we can work together on Capitol Hill. The legislation is named in honor of Iraq and Afghanistan War Veteran and suicide prevention advocate, Clay Hunt. Clay epitomized what it meant to live a life of service, both in and out of uniform. He helped countless veterans overcome their demons but tragically took his own life in March of 2011. The legacy he left behind, however, will live on for generations to come. The bill you see before you was the result of strong partnerships with our veteran service organizations, strong bipartisan efforts here in Congress, and the resolve of Clay's parents pushing and pushing and pushing to get this thing done. This bill is what you get when you have folks sitting around the table, trusting one another, and working together to get it right for our nation's veterans. Our premise for this bill was simple: suicide occurs because many vets return to their community and then disconnect from it. So, we wanted to create a bill that would get the communities involved and coordinated. We also knew it would be important to increase both oversight of the VA and their capacity to deal with over a million veterans returning from war. Specifically, the bill: 1. Establishes a peer support and community outreach pilot program to assist transitioning servicemembers with accessing VA mental health care services. 2. Requires the VA to create a one-stop, interactive website to serve as a centralized source of information regarding all mental health services for veterans. 3. Addresses the shortage of mental health care professionals by authorizing the VA to conduct a student loan repayment pilot program aimed at recruiting and retaining psychiatrists. 4. Requires yearly evaluations--with interim reports due in the first two years and a final report due the third year and every year after-- conducted by a third party, of all mental health care and suicide prevention practices and programs at the VA to find out what is working and what's not working and to make recommendations to improve care. Authorizes a Government Accountability Office (GAO) report on the transition of care for PTSD and TBI between the DoD and the VA. One veteran lost to suicide is one too many. With many of our warriors returning from war, all too often our heroes return only to face a war of their own at home. While there is no bill that will completely end veteran suicide, this bipartisan measure is a step in the right direction. In short, it's a start towards fixing a problem, but we must not lose focus on this problem after passing this bill. We must continue working to improve care for our veterans. I urge my colleagues to support this measure so that we can send it over to the Senate and onto the President swiftly. Mr. MILLER of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from the Sixth District of Pennsylvania (Mr. Costello), a new member of the committee, who, in his first week, has already jumped in with both feet. Mr. Costello has been to my office and started looking closely at the oversight agenda that we have. Mr. COSTELLO of Pennsylvania. I thank the distinguished gentleman from Florida for yielding. Mr. Speaker, I stand here today to express my support of Congressman Tim Walz's Clay Hunt Suicide Prevention for American Veterans Act. It is a privilege to serve on the House Committee on Veterans' Affairs and in this Congress, to work to improve the quality of life for our Nation's veterans, their families, and their caregivers. In the coming months, I look forward to working in a bipartisan, commonsense manner with dedicated Members and veterans like my colleague from Minnesota (Mr. Walz) to find solutions to help our Nation's veterans transition to civilian life. One of the most critical areas that we as a committee and Congress must work to establish is comprehensive, timely, responsive, and effective mental health care services for our post- 9/11 veterans, many of whom have served our country for multiple deployments in conditions not witnessed or experienced by any other generation of soldier. This bill first prioritizes bringing accountability to the VA. By bringing in a third party to conduct an annual evaluation within the Department of Veterans Affairs, we can better provide agency accountability by doing just this. Second, we must provide better access to mental health services for our veterans and their families. This bill does just that. Finally, it helps facilitate and increase awareness for peer and community support providers for our veterans and their families. This commonsense legislation works towards those priorities of providing an accountable and supportive VA for our veterans, in furtherance of helping veterans get the best treatment possible. So, Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support this commonsense legislation to promote mental health support for our Nation's heroes and thank Congressman Walz for his leadership on this important legislation. Ms. BROWN of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee). (Ms. JACKSON LEE asked and was given permission to revise and extend her remarks.) Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, this is an appropriate and wonderful statement of two distinguished Members of Congress, the chairman and ranking member of the Veterans' Affairs Committee, and I associate myself with their words on how crucial this legislation is, and what an important statement the Veterans' Affairs Committee is making: that there is no party affiliation when it comes to saving the lives of our men and women who put on the uniform. To the author of this bill, Mr. Walz, as I chatted with him on the floor, I indicated to him that just this weekend I met for hours with two wounded warriors, both of them having experience with PTSD, both of them being challenged about the transition into civilian life, both of them knowing of this legislation, feeling left out and deprived that it did not, despite the valiant effort of this House, pass in the last Congress. So let me congratulate all of you for recognizing that this is a crucial, lifesaving element of the men and women that we stand and admire and love. Every day, 22 veterans take their lives, but it is 8,000 a year. And if I might say, Texas walks alongside of Florida and other States in having the highest number of returning vets. Two million served in Iraq and Afghanistan across the Nation. Now, one-third, 600,000, have experienced traumatic brain injury and PTSD. From the early years of working with then-Chairman and Ranking Member Murtha, I was privileged to bring $1 million to my district for PTSD, but that is not the heart of it. The bleeding and the sorrow of these men and women is not befitting of the service and the uniform that they put on. Not one moment should they wait at a veterans hospital for treatment for PTSD that should keep them grounded. Not one moment should they be alone contemplating suicide, without treatment and friends and family having assistance. This bill makes that statement, H.R. 203, the Clay Hunt SAV Act. It says that you are not alone and that we have put our actions where our words are. We have walked the walk. So I want to say to those wounded warriors who shared their heart with me, proudly come back and say: This bill is moving, and as it moves to the United States Senate, this bill is moving. And as we look to the President's desk, a signature will allow this bill to be in place. To those who missed the deadline, this law will allow you to still be able to receive that treatment because it allows an extended time for those who have missed the deadline. I know as I go back home to Texas and meet families that they are looking for action when it comes to our beloved veterans and those who have put on the uniform to serve this Nation as they watched their comrades die. This is a bill that says, God bless America. {time} 1730 The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentlewoman has expired. Ms. BROWN of Florida. I yield an additional 1 minute to the gentlewoman from Texas. Ms. JACKSON LEE. This is a bill that reflects the Constitution, the Declaration of Independence, and our wonderful Pledge of Allegiance to the flag of the United States of America. I want to say to my friends at Ellington Field, which is just down the road [[Page H201]] from my congressional district, and to the many bases across the State of Texas that have amongst their ranks veterans who have served in Active Duty and who are still pressing forward in spite of conditions that they face, this is the bill that provides the answer and the love and affection for the veterans and military personnel who have put on the uniform every day and who have never--never once--shied away from their duty and decided that their lives and their ills were greater than their commitment to this Nation. We owe them this. This is a ``God bless America'' bill. I thank the proponents of it. Mr. MILLER of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I would like to inquire of the ranking member how many speakers she has left. Ms. BROWN of Florida. The last speaker just finished. I have no additional speakers. Mr. MILLER of Florida. We have no additional speakers either, so we are prepared to close. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Ms. BROWN of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. It is unacceptable that 22 veterans are dying by suicide every day. We need to pull all stakeholders together to work as a group to solve the problem. There is not one cause and not one answer. There are a multitude of answers and a multitude of causes and solutions. The Department of Defense, the VA, and the veterans service organizations need to work together to come up with many solutions that will meet the needs. There is not one solution but many. I pledge to work with my colleague from Minnesota and Chairman Miller to address the issues in the upcoming session. Access to mental health care and benefits for our veterans is an issue I plan to focus on in the months ahead, and I look forward to working with all of my colleagues to ensure that veterans are given the benefits and services that they have earned. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. MILLER of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Ms. BROWN of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Connecticut (Mr. Larson). Mr. LARSON of Connecticut. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the ranking member, and certainly, I want to thank the chairman. I won't take the 2 minutes, but I want to thank them for their incredible cooperation on this most important of issues. Derek Denfeld, from my district, lost his life. There has been sadness and the coming together of the community. Our hearts go out to his wife, Heather; to his son, Felix; and certainly to his parents, Deb and Chris, whom I know personally. I thank the ranking member. I thank the sergeant major for his sponsorship of this bill, and I thank the ranking member and the chairman for what is an important piece of legislation. As noted, we can't wait another day for this to take effect. Ms. BROWN of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. MILLER of Florida. Mr. Speaker, in closing, I appreciate the comments from both sides of the aisle, and I look forward to working with all of our colleagues on future issues as they relate to the Department of Veterans Affairs and, in particular, the SAV Act. I yield back the balance of my time. Ms. DUCKWORTH. Mr. Speaker, I was pleased that my colleagues unanimously agreed during the 113th Congress that we must act to combat Veteran suicide and I am grateful that we are acting quickly in the first days of the 114th Congress to address this critical unfinished business. The statistics are heartbreaking. An average of 22 Veterans commit suicide every day. So each day that we delay action is a day we cannot afford. I was proud to help introduce HR. 5059, Clay Hunt Suicide Prevention for American Veterans Act with Chairman Jeff Miller and Representative Tim Walz. While there is no bill that will completely end Veteran suicide, this comprehensive measure is a step in the right direction. It will remove barriers that prevent our nation's heroes from getting the quality, timely mental health care that they deserve. It is my sincere hope that my colleagues in the Senate will take note of the momentum in the House and bring this legislation to the Senate Floor as soon as possible. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Miller) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 203. The question was taken. The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the opinion of the Chair, two-thirds being in the affirmative, the ayes have it. Ms. BROWN of Florida. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays. The yeas and nays were ordered. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further proceedings on this motion will be postponed. ____________________",package_114_129.csv,48718,48718,48786,"[congressional record volume 161, number 5 (monday, january 12, 2015)] [house] [pages h196-h201] from the congressional record online through the government publishing office [ www.gpo.gov ] clay hunt suicide prevention for american veterans act mr. miller of florida. mr. speaker, i move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (h.r. 203) to direct the secretary of veterans affairs to provide for the conduct of annual evaluations of mental health care and suicide prevention programs of the department of veterans affairs, to require a pilot program on loan repayment for psychiatrists who agree to serve in the veterans health administration of the department of veterans affairs, and for other purposes. the clerk read the title of the bill. the text of the bill is as follows: h.r. 203 be it enacted by the senate and house of representatives of the united states of america in congress assembled, section 1. short title. this act may be cited as the ``clay hunt suicide prevention for american veterans act'' or the ``clay hunt sav act''. sec. 2. evaluations of mental health care and suicide prevention programs of department of veterans affairs.

however, we have not seen a corresponding decrease in the number of our nation's heroes who take their own lives. what is more, for some groups of veterans, including female veterans and veterans of iraq and afghanistan, suicide rates are actually getting worse. mr. speaker, we have got to do more to help these veterans access the supportive services and mental health care that they need to save their lives. with the passage of h.r. 203, we will. to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of va programs and increase awareness of available services, h.r. 203 would require an annual third-party evaluation of va's mental health care and suicide prevention programs and require that va publish an interactive web site to serve as a central source of information regarding va mental health services. to increase va's capacity to meet the mental health care needs of our veterans, it would establish a pilot program that would repay education loans for individuals who have received a degree in psychiatric medicine and who agree to work at the va for at least 2 years. to create a seamless transition from active duty to veteran status and increased community support for those in need, it would establish another pilot program to assist veterans during transition and require va to collaborate with nonprofit mental health organizations in the community. importantly, h.r. 203 would extend an additional 1 year of eligibility for va health care services for certain combat veterans who have not yet enrolled and whose 5-year combat eligibility period recently expired. before i yield, i want to take a moment to once again express my condolences to clay's family and friends as well as the families and friends of our honored veterans who have lost their lives to suicide. i want to offer them my personal commitment to continue the aggressive pursuit to end veteran suicide. the passage of this bill today is just the first in what will be a continuing series of legislative and oversight efforts that our committee is going to undertake throughout the 114th congress to improve access to mental health care for veterans in need, increase the efficiency and effectiveness of va's mental health and suicide prevention programs, and increase meaningful partnerships with community providers who are often the first line of defense for their struggling veterans and the families of those veterans. this bill, which passed the house last congress, will not single- handedly halt the scourge of veteran suicide, but it is an important step, and it is a step that we owe clay and those like him who desperately need and certainly deserve our help. with that, i urge all of my colleagues to join me in supporting h.r. 203. mr. speaker, i reserve the balance of my time. ms. brown of florida. mr. speaker, i yield myself such time as i may consume. mr. speaker, i rise in support of h.r. 203, the clay hunt sav act. this legislation passed the house last month in the closing days of the 113th congress. i am pleased that we were able to act on this measure as one of the first items of business in the 114th congress. providing the mental health care that veterans need and effectively dealing with the crisis of veteran suicides have been longstanding concerns of the committee on veterans' affairs. war is indeed terrible, and the effects of combat and service on our veterans lasts a lifetime. for far too long, society--and the military culture itself--has acted as if the need for mental health care treatment is a weakness and has discouraged adequate treatment. this attitude is changing, but it cannot change fast enough. in the area of mental health for our veterans and returning servicemembers, there is no easy answer or quick fix. i appreciate the work of my friend from minnesota, tim walz; chairman miller; and all of my colleagues on the committee in fashioning a bill that i believe will make a difference in the lives of our veterans. h.r. 203 takes a number of important steps, including improving the safety net for at-risk veterans, while also introducing some accountability into the va mental health care and suicide prevention program, using a third-party evaluation. it will provide veterans with a web site that will serve as a centralized source of information on mental health services. h.r. 203 initiates a program to help address some of the glaring mental health personnel shortages at the va. while the incentives in this bill are limited to the psychiatry field, i would like to see this effort expanded in the future to all the mental health professional shortfalls. {time} 1715 h.r. 203 would expand peer support networks, which we have heard are quite effectively used. and i believe the reporting requirement in this bill will confirm that additional resources should be permanently dedicated to fully utilizing peer support. h.r. 203 would also provide an additional window of eligibility for combat veterans who may have missed the window of opportunity to sign up for va health care. this extra time will help to ensure that veterans receive the health care, including mental health care, that they need. i thank the chairman for working to bring this bill up quickly so that the house can act and send this important measure to the senate. i look forward to working with chairman miller, and with florida being the state with the second-largest population of veterans and the most senior population, i know that the committee will do a good job having two of the leadership team from florida. but let me be clear: there are 435 members of congress, and each of them have veterans in their district, and we will work to make sure that all veterans get the care that they have earned and deserve. [[page h199]] mr. speaker, i reserve the balance of my time. mr. miller of florida. mr. speaker, i thank the new ranking member for her words. i look forward to working with her on legislation in the future. with that, mr. speaker, i yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from the second district of indiana, from elkhart, indiana (mrs. walorski). mrs. walorski. mr. speaker, i thank the distinguished gentleman from florida for yielding, and i am grateful to be here today to support the clay hunt sav act. every day, 22 veterans take their own lives. we have all experienced this in our districts; i have as well. on march 31, 2011, clay hunt was one of those 22 veterans that day who took his own life. today, we honor clay and his family with the clay hunt sav act. clay's story was one of bravery and dedication. he relied on the va for care and received a 30 percent disability rating for ptsd brought on during his service. he appealed the rating and encountered a bureaucratic nightmare. clay had to wait months to see a psychiatrist at a va medical center. two weeks later, clay took his own life. five weeks after his death and 18 months after filing an appeal with the va for his ptsd rating, his appeal was approved. clay's story details the urgency that our nation's heroes deserve. the clay hunt sav act will increase access to mental health care and improve the quality of care troops and veterans receive. together, we can change this system so that no other veteran ever has to endure what thousands of veterans have already gone through, including clay. i am honored to stand here today and am grateful to my colleagues. i urge support for this legislation. ms. brown of florida. mr. speaker, how much time is remaining? the speaker pro tempore. the gentlewoman from florida has 16\1/2\ minutes remaining. ms. brown of florida. mr. speaker, i yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from minnesota (mr. walz). mr. walz. mr. speaker, i thank the ranking member for your support of this important piece of legislation. as you heard, we are here once again. we had a piece of legislation that attempted to, as i think the chairman spoke about, address an issue that cuts to the heart and the soul of this nation: when our warriors come home, how can we reintegrate them? and i think it is important, and i want to thank the chairman, one, for working so diligently on many numerous issues, but on this piece of legislation, and for bringing it back up again, but i think also for setting an example. the nation expects us to do what is right by our warriors. they expect us to work together to find solutions. something that we do in the committee is looking and seeing where we can improve and pointing out where there are faults. but that is not good enough. pointing out the faults is one thing, and it is important. finding solutions is what really matters, and this piece of legislation, i think, starts to do that. to my colleagues who are here, i would say this. we can certainly disagree and disagree strongly and passionately. but i think if the public knew and they could feel it and, i think, in this piece of legislation see it, there are many more things that bind us together, and our care and our commitment for our warriors is one of those. this is a piece of legislation that wasn't just written here in the halls of congress. it was written by the families, susan and richard selke, clay's parents; by the houghtalings in minnesota; and the kellys in new ulm, minnesota; and each of these members that you hear speak about it. since we passed this legislation, and it failed in the senate, over 750 veterans have taken their lives. many times down here, we feel like everything we do is the most important thing that needs to happen now. rarely is that true. in this case, it is. we can't wait another day. we can't pass this problem forward because it is not only ripping at families, it is ripping at our nation. these are our best and brightest. you heard about clay. clay's a marine who went to iraq. he got shot by a sniper and, as a marine, that irritated him. it didn't hurt him. he came back. he had his purple heart, and he could have come back and taken our thank yous. he didn't. he went to afghanistan to continue on. he knew the extremism that was threatening iraq and afghanistan would some day threaten this nation, so he was forward. he did his time. after he came back, that wasn't enough. he went to haiti to help. after that, that wasn't enough. he sat in our offices on numerous occasions working on everything from access to the va to the things you heard the gentlelady talk about in indiana that were causing frustration amongst our veterans. and i think for me the thing is, like for so many of us, clay appeared to have everything. he appeared that he knew and was competent and had it there, but we all know that they have demons, and clay had demons. so what this piece of legislation does--you heard the specifics, and it does do specific things, and no one is claiming that this is going to be the fix. but i would make the case that what the clay hunt bill has done and what it has done amongst our partners in the veterans service organizations is made it absolutely clear we will not leave anyone behind. we will not turn a blind eye to this, and we will not rest until we at least make the attempt to get that number down to zero. we may never get there, but this piece of legislation starts to address it. so i think it is important, and i want to thank the ranking member for being on this bill and putting it forward, and the chairman, who was an original author of this and has been instrumental in making it happen. what we are doing here is not just passing legislation. what we are doing here is changing the attitudes, focusing the nation's attention on this, because i don't care if it is elkhart, indiana, if it is pensacola, florida, or if it is mankato, minnesota. when we go to talk to our constituents, regardless of their political leanings, they tell us, take care of our warriors, do what is right. fix the system. this piece of legislation does that. it does it in a cost-effective, smart manner, and we have got the opportunity to start moving forward. i would say and encourage my colleagues, let's pass this thing, but let's not see it as an end result of a process we have been working on. let's see it as the first of many things to try and make changes to be smarter about how we use taxpayer dollars, but also to demand effectiveness, because clay's parents deserve that. thousands of others across this nation deserve that. the more than 1 million veterans that will return over the next few years are counting on us to put everything in place to provide that help. so i encourage my colleagues, support this legislation. i encourage my colleagues, take this as an example. i want to thank speaker boehner and majority leader mccarthy for making it a priority. i think it speaks volumes. this piece of legislation is on the floor in the first week. that says something, that there is a commitment to getting it right, there is a commitment to working together, and there is a commitment to showing effectiveness for the american people. so, we have got that opportunity. i ask my colleagues to support this legislation, get engaged with what is happening with our veterans, and let's prove that their service was not in vain, that this democracy is strong, that our commitment to them is unwavering and that, at the end of the day, that is what really matters. mr. speaker, i am very grateful for the opportunity to again tell you about a very important piece of legislation that will help in our fight to improve mental health care for our returning warriors: h.r. 203, the clay hunt sav act. i'd like to thank the chairman of the house veterans affairs committee, mr. miller, and rep. duckworth for continuing to be my partners in this effort. i'd also like to thank speaker boehner for bringing this to the floor swiftly. and, a big thank you to senators mccain, burr, blumenthal, and isakson for all their work on the sav act. most importantly, i'd like to thank clay's parents, susan and richard selke. they are holding congress' feet to the fire to make sure we get this done and to prevent another family from going through what they continue to go [[page h200]] through each and every day. we cannot let them down. h.r. 203, the clay hunt suicide prevention for american veterans act, is an example of how we can work together on capitol hill. the legislation is named in honor of iraq and afghanistan war veteran and suicide prevention advocate, clay hunt. clay epitomized what it meant to live a life of service, both in and out of uniform. he helped countless veterans overcome their demons but tragically took his own life in march of 2011. the legacy he left behind, however, will live on for generations to come. the bill you see before you was the result of strong partnerships with our veteran service organizations, strong bipartisan efforts here in congress, and the resolve of clay's parents pushing and pushing and pushing to get this thing done. this bill is what you get when you have folks sitting around the table, trusting one another, and working together to get it right for our nation's veterans. our premise for this bill was simple: suicide occurs because many vets return to their community and then disconnect from it. so, we wanted to create a bill that would get the communities involved and coordinated. we also knew it would be important to increase both oversight of the va and their capacity to deal with over a million veterans returning from war. specifically, the bill: 1. establishes a peer support and community outreach pilot program to assist transitioning servicemembers with accessing va mental health care services. 2. requires the va to create a one-stop, interactive website to serve as a centralized source of information regarding all mental health services for veterans. 3. addresses the shortage of mental health care professionals by authorizing the va to conduct a student loan repayment pilot program aimed at recruiting and retaining psychiatrists. 4. requires yearly evaluations--with interim reports due in the first two years and a final report due the third year and every year after-- conducted by a third party, of all mental health care and suicide prevention practices and programs at the va to find out what is working and what's not working and to make recommendations to improve care. authorizes a government accountability office (gao) report on the transition of care for ptsd and tbi between the dod and the va. one veteran lost to suicide is one too many. with many of our warriors returning from war, all too often our heroes return only to face a war of their own at home. while there is no bill that will completely end veteran suicide, this bipartisan measure is a step in the right direction. in short, it's a start towards fixing a problem, but we must not lose focus on this problem after passing this bill. we must continue working to improve care for our veterans. i urge my colleagues to support this measure so that we can send it over to the senate and onto the president swiftly. mr. miller of florida. mr. speaker, i yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from the sixth district of pennsylvania (mr. costello), a new member of the committee, who, in his first week, has already jumped in with both feet. mr. costello has been to my office and started looking closely at the oversight agenda that we have. mr. costello of pennsylvania. i thank the distinguished gentleman from florida for yielding. mr. speaker, i stand here today to express my support of congressman tim walz's clay hunt suicide prevention for american veterans act. it is a privilege to serve on the house committee on veterans' affairs and in this congress, to work to improve the quality of life for our nation's veterans, their families, and their caregivers. in the coming months, i look forward to working in a bipartisan, commonsense manner with dedicated members and veterans like my colleague from minnesota (mr. walz) to find solutions to help our nation's veterans transition to civilian life. one of the most critical areas that we as a committee and congress must work to establish is comprehensive, timely, responsive, and effective mental health care services for our post- 9/11 veterans, many of whom have served our country for multiple deployments in conditions not witnessed or experienced by any other generation of soldier. this bill first prioritizes bringing accountability to the va. by bringing in a third party to conduct an annual evaluation within the department of veterans affairs, we can better provide agency accountability by doing just this. second, we must provide better access to mental health services for our veterans and their families. this bill does just that. finally, it helps facilitate and increase awareness for peer and community support providers for our veterans and their families. this commonsense legislation works towards those priorities of providing an accountable and supportive va for our veterans, in furtherance of helping veterans get the best treatment possible. so, mr. speaker, i urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support this commonsense legislation to promote mental health support for our nation's heroes and thank congressman walz for his leadership on this important legislation. ms. brown of florida. mr. speaker, i yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from texas (ms. jackson lee). (ms. jackson lee asked and was given permission to revise and extend her remarks.) ms. jackson lee. mr. speaker, this is an appropriate and wonderful statement of two distinguished members of congress, the chairman and ranking member of the veterans' affairs committee, and i associate myself with their words on how crucial this legislation is, and what an important statement the veterans' affairs committee is making: that there is no party affiliation when it comes to saving the lives of our men and women who put on the uniform. to the author of this bill, mr. walz, as i chatted with him on the floor, i indicated to him that just this weekend i met for hours with two wounded warriors, both of them having experience with ptsd, both of them being challenged about the transition into civilian life, both of them knowing of this legislation, feeling left out and deprived that it did not, despite the valiant effort of this house, pass in the last congress. so let me congratulate all of you for recognizing that this is a crucial, lifesaving element of the men and women that we stand and admire and love. every day, 22 veterans take their lives, but it is 8,000 a year. and if i might say, texas walks alongside of florida and other states in having the highest number of returning vets. two million served in iraq and afghanistan across the nation. now, one-third, 600,000, have experienced traumatic brain injury and ptsd. from the early years of working with then-chairman and ranking member murtha, i was privileged to bring $1 million to my district for ptsd, but that is not the heart of it. the bleeding and the sorrow of these men and women is not befitting of the service and the uniform that they put on. not one moment should they wait at a veterans hospital for treatment for ptsd that should keep them grounded. not one moment should they be alone contemplating suicide, without treatment and friends and family having assistance. this bill makes that statement, h.r. 203, the clay hunt sav act. it says that you are not alone and that we have put our actions where our words are. we have walked the walk. so i want to say to those wounded warriors who shared their heart with me, proudly come back and say: this bill is moving, and as it moves to the united states senate, this bill is moving. and as we look to the president's desk, a signature will allow this bill to be in place. to those who missed the deadline, this law will allow you to still be able to receive that treatment because it allows an extended time for those who have missed the deadline. i know as i go back home to texas and meet families that they are looking for action when it comes to our beloved veterans and those who have put on the uniform to serve this nation as they watched their comrades die. this is a bill that says, god bless america. {time} 1730 the speaker pro tempore. the time of the gentlewoman has expired. ms. brown of florida. i yield an additional 1 minute to the gentlewoman from texas. ms. jackson lee. this is a bill that reflects the constitution, the declaration of independence, and our wonderful pledge of allegiance to the flag of the united states of america. i want to say to my friends at ellington field, which is just down the road [[page h201]] from my congressional district, and to the many bases across the state of texas that have amongst their ranks veterans who have served in active duty and who are still pressing forward in spite of conditions that they face, this is the bill that provides the answer and the love and affection for the veterans and military personnel who have put on the uniform every day and who have never--never once--shied away from their duty and decided that their lives and their ills were greater than their commitment to this nation. we owe them this. this is a ``god bless america'' bill. i thank the proponents of it. mr. miller of florida. mr. speaker, i would like to inquire of the ranking member how many speakers she has left. ms. brown of florida. the last speaker just finished. i have no additional speakers. mr. miller of florida. we have no additional speakers either, so we are prepared to close. mr. speaker, i reserve the balance of my time. ms. brown of florida. mr. speaker, i yield myself such time as i may consume. it is unacceptable that 22 veterans are dying by suicide every day. we need to pull all stakeholders together to work as a group to solve the problem. there is not one cause and not one answer. there are a multitude of answers and a multitude of causes and solutions. the department of defense, the va, and the veterans service organizations need to work together to come up with many solutions that will meet the needs. there is not one solution but many. i pledge to work with my colleague from minnesota and chairman miller to address the issues in the upcoming session. access to mental health care and benefits for our veterans is an issue i plan to focus on in the months ahead, and i look forward to working with all of my colleagues to ensure that veterans are given the benefits and services that they have earned. mr. speaker, i reserve the balance of my time. mr. miller of florida. mr. speaker, i reserve the balance of my time. ms. brown of florida. mr. speaker, i yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from connecticut (mr. larson). mr. larson of connecticut. mr. speaker, i want to thank the ranking member, and certainly, i want to thank the chairman. i won't take the 2 minutes, but i want to thank them for their incredible cooperation on this most important of issues. derek denfeld, from my district, lost his life. there has been sadness and the coming together of the community. our hearts go out to his wife, heather; to his son, felix; and certainly to his parents, deb and chris, whom i know personally. i thank the ranking member. i thank the sergeant major for his sponsorship of this bill, and i thank the ranking member and the chairman for what is an important piece of legislation. as noted, we can't wait another day for this to take effect. ms. brown of florida. mr. speaker, i yield back the balance of my time. mr. miller of florida. mr. speaker, in closing, i appreciate the comments from both sides of the aisle, and i look forward to working with all of our colleagues on future issues as they relate to the department of veterans affairs and, in particular, the sav act. i yield back the balance of my time. ms. duckworth. mr. speaker, i was pleased that my colleagues unanimously agreed during the 113th congress that we must act to combat veteran suicide and i am grateful that we are acting quickly in the first days of the 114th congress to address this critical unfinished business. the statistics are heartbreaking. an average of 22 veterans commit suicide every day. so each day that we delay action is a day we cannot afford. i was proud to help introduce hr. 5059, clay hunt suicide prevention for american veterans act with chairman jeff miller and representative tim walz. while there is no bill that will completely end veteran suicide, this comprehensive measure is a step in the right direction. it will remove barriers that prevent our nation's heroes from getting the quality, timely mental health care that they deserve. it is my sincere hope that my colleagues in the senate will take note of the momentum in the house and bring this legislation to the senate floor as soon as possible. the speaker pro tempore. the question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from florida (mr. miller) that the house suspend the rules and pass the bill, h.r. 203. the question was taken. the speaker pro tempore. in the opinion of the chair, two-thirds being in the affirmative, the ayes have it. ms. brown of florida. mr. speaker, on that i demand the yeas and nays. the yeas and nays were ordered. the speaker pro tempore. pursuant to clause 8 of rule xx, further proceedings on this motion will be postponed. ____________________",48718

Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 33) to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to ensure that emergency services volunteers are not taken into account as employees under the shared responsibility requirements contained in the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The text of the bill is as follows: H.R. 33 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. This Act may be cited as the ``Protecting Volunteer Firefighters and Emergency Responders Act''. SEC. 2. EMERGENCY SERVICES, GOVERNMENT, AND CERTAIN NONPROFIT VOLUNTEERS. (a) In General.--Section 4980H(c) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 is amended by redesignating paragraphs (5), (6), and (7) as paragraphs (6), (7), and (8), respectively, and by inserting after paragraph (4) the following new paragraph: ``(5) Special rules for certain emergency services, government, and nonprofit volunteers.-- ``(A) Emergency services volunteers.--Qualified services rendered as a bona fide volunteer to an eligible employer shall not be taken into account under this section as service provided by an employee. For purposes of the preceding sentence, the terms `qualified services', `bona fide volunteer', and `eligible employer' shall have the respective meanings given such terms under section 457(e). ``(B) Certain other government and nonprofit volunteers.-- ``(i) In general.--Services rendered as a bona fide volunteer to a specified employer shall not be taken into account under this section as service provided by an employee. ``(ii) Bona fide volunteer.--For purposes of this subparagraph, the term `bona fide volunteer' means an employee of a specified employer whose only compensation from such employer is in the form of-- ``(I) reimbursement for (or reasonable allowance for) reasonable expenses incurred in the performance of services by volunteers, or ``(II) reasonable benefits (including length of service awards), and nominal fees, customarily paid by similar entities in connection with the performance of services by volunteers. ``(iii) Specified employer.--For purposes of this subparagraph, the term `specified employer' means-- ``(I) any government entity, and ``(II) any organization described in section 501(c) and exempt from tax under section 501(a). ``(iv) Coordination with subparagraph (A).--This subparagraph shall not fail to apply with respect to services merely because such services are qualified services (as defined in section 457(e)(11)(C)).''. (b) Effective Date.--The amendments made by this section shall apply to months beginning after December 31, 2013. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. Ryan) and the gentleman from Connecticut (Mr. Larson) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Wisconsin. General Leave Mr. RYAN of Wisconsin. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous material on H.R. 33, currently under consideration. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Wisconsin? There was no objection. Mr. RYAN of Wisconsin. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I am here bringing forward Mr. Barletta's bill, and it is really simple. One of the cornerstones of our civil society--one of the great pieces of the American story--is volunteerism but, in particular, volunteerism among our first responders. [[Page H202]] So many of us represent congressional districts that thrive on and exist on and preserve their safety on volunteer firefighters and first responders. Unfortunately, in the Affordable Care Act, there is a huge glitch. Under ObamaCare, volunteer firefighters and first responders are counted in many ways as if they were full-time equivalent employees, and therefore, volunteer fire departments are getting hit with enormous fines, mandates, and taxes. It shouldn't be that way. It is causing a huge paperwork burden, not to mention a fiscal drain on the budgets of these small fire departments and emergency responding agencies in our communities and in rural areas all across America. This legislation fixes this. I want to thank Congressman Barletta for introducing this because he clearly understands as a former mayor and as someone who represents Pennsylvania, which I know has a lot of volunteer firefighters just like we do in rural Wisconsin, that these are the lifeblood of our communities. The last thing that they need to do when they are so concerned about preserving public safety and health is to worry about all of these ObamaCare mandates. Mr. Barletta's bill preserves the freedom to operate for our 780,000 public service volunteer firefighters. It removes this mandate and exempts them from this onerous mandate, so they can continue providing the public service that they have been right now. Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Barletta), the author of this legislation. Mr. BARLETTA. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of my bill, H.R. 33, the Protecting Volunteer Firefighters and Emergency Responders Act. This is a good, truly bipartisan bill that protects our first responders, our volunteer firefighters, and emergency services personnel. It protects them by ensuring that they are not considered employees under the employer mandate provision of ObamaCare. If they were, some fire companies would be forced to pay for the volunteers' health insurance or pay a fine, driving many fire departments out of business. As a former mayor, I know how important volunteer fire companies are to the health and safety of a community. Simply put, this is a public safety issue. I first learned about this issue from a volunteer firefighter, Bob Timko, back home, and I began a crusade to clear this up for volunteer firefighters and localities and the residents of Pennsylvania and every other State. As you know, the employer mandate of ObamaCare kicks in for employers with 50 or more employees. Now, some fire companies may hear about this and immediately think, ``Well, we only have 25 volunteers, so we are safe. We don't have 50.'' That may not necessarily be the case. Some fire companies are considered part of their local government. If you take the number of firefighters, paid and unpaid, and add them to the number of other public employees, such as highway workers, police, code enforcement officers, health officers, and clerical workers, you can easily reach 50, even in a small town. This would be a very big deal in my home State of Pennsylvania, where 97 percent of our fire companies are either completely or mostly volunteers. Nationally, almost 92 percent of fire companies use at least some volunteers, and over 86 percent depend on all or mostly volunteers. Those numbers come from the 2012 National Fire Department Census conducted by the United States Fire Administration. If your district is like mine, then volunteer firefighters are ingrained in your community. We won an initial battle on this issue. After I raised it with the IRS and brought pressure to bear through this legislation, they finally relented and changed their rules regarding the Federal tax status of volunteer firefighters. However, this is too important of a public safety issue to be left to the changing positions of unelected Federal bureaucrats at the IRS. Their arbitrary regulatory guidance could easily be changed back. Our people back home deserve better. We owe our emergency service volunteers, who risk their lives every day, rock-solid certainty. This legislation says, once and for all, that volunteer firefighters are just that--volunteers--and should not be subjected to the employer mandate. It takes away the power of the IRS to change the rules. I want to thank my colleagues on both sides of the aisle for their continued support. Last year, this bill passed the Ways and Means Committee by a strong bipartisan vote of 37-0, and it passed the House by a very rare unanimous vote of 410-0. Not one single Member, Republican or Democrat, opposed it. I want to thank Speaker Boehner, Majority Leader McCarthy, Majority Whip Scalise, the Ways and Means Committee, and their staffs. We all recognize that my bill is a simple, bipartisan solution to an unforeseen consequence of the President's health care law. This bill has the strong support of the National Volunteer Fire Council, the International Association of Fire Chiefs, and the Congressional Fire Services Institute. I want to thank my partners, as well as the men and women they represent, for their help. To be clear, forcing volunteer fire companies to comply with ObamaCare will not extend health insurance to the uninsured; rather, it will close firehouses, placing people at risk. I strongly urge the passage of this bill. Mr. LARSON of Connecticut. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I want to start off by certainly extending congratulations to Representative Barletta for his persistency in continuing to bring this legislation forward. As he has pointed out, it has been bipartisanly supported, and it deserves passage. It passed unanimously, as he indicated, in both the Ways and Means Committee and also unanimously on this floor, which is no small order. Of course, it comes in the midst of controversy. I say ``controversy'' because--well, our distinguished chairman is to be congratulated as well for not only bringing this bill forward, but also for the great victory that was won by the Green Bay Packers yesterday. Mr. RYAN of Wisconsin. Will the gentleman yield? Mr. LARSON of Connecticut. In a moment, because I do want to continue my praise of the Aaron Rodgers look-alike. Today, our distinguished chairman announced that he is not running for President. We think that it is so that his look-alike, Aaron Rodgers, may fill that void. I know that it was an outstanding victory by the Packers yesterday, but it was not without controversy on our own committee. I know that Kenny Marchant, Kevin Brady, and Sam Johnson are very concerned about this, but as the chairman said, ``The rules are the rules,'' and we should proceed from there. {time} 1745 But I also want to thank all of those, and especially the chairman, who raised the point about volunteer firefighters. All of us have that visual in our minds, of course, of those going up the stairs so that people can come down the stairs. And since September 11, and noting that volunteer firefighters cover more than 70 percent of this country, this clearly is a bill that was worthy of the unanimous approval and consent that it received and, as I indicated, is bipartisanly supported by our entire delegation. I want to commend the gentleman from Connecticut, Representative Courtney, who will speak later, and also the gentlewoman from Connecticut, Representative Esty, and also the National Volunteer Fire Council, which has been 1,000 percent behind this and also other tax issues that are going to be coming before our committee that have been bipartisanly supported as well by Representative Reichert, Tom Latham, and others. And I know that we share the bipartisan spirit in this. I also would like to say that, along with firefighters, the many people who are emergency medical volunteers could benefit from a number of volunteer tax breaks that we could provide as well. I look forward to working with our distinguished chairman and, again, commend the gentleman from Pennsylvania, Representative Barletta. I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. RYAN of Wisconsin. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 30 seconds to say that I [[Page H203]] appreciate the kind words from the gentleman from Connecticut. This is bipartisan. It is wonderful when we can work together and find common ground to get things done and find common ground where the completion of a pass is the completion of a pass, it is a rule. Mr. LARSON of Connecticut. Will the gentleman yield? Mr. RYAN of Wisconsin. I yield to the gentleman from Connecticut. Mr. LARSON of Connecticut. We are especially gratified, though, in a true show of compassionate conservatism that you reached out to the chief fan of the Jersey Cowboys--excuse me--the Dallas Cowboys, Chris Christie, to provide him with both a hug and a sincere gesture from Wisconsin. Mr. RYAN of Wisconsin. Reclaiming my time, all in good jest. With that, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Kelly), a member of the full committee. Mr. KELLY of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I rise in very strong support of H.R. 33, and I want to thank Speaker Boehner and Majority Leader McCarthy for allowing this legislation to come forward so early in this Congress. I agree with the gentleman from Connecticut (Mr. Larson). People always say: I wish you guys could get along; just get something done. This is something that we overwhelmingly believe in and we are going to get done. I think that the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Barletta) has explained very clearly that it has to become statute. It can't be left to be some nebulous fact that is rolling around out there. Now, these people who do this work--and in Pennsylvania, 97 percent, almost eight out of every 10 firefighters come from the volunteer aspect of it; they are not paid. Yet because of some type of allowance they are given, they fall under the Affordable Care Act, and this would destroy volunteer fire departments as we know them. So what Mr. Barletta has very thoughtfully done is he has put forth a piece of legislation that would guarantee that these folks don't have to worry about that. Now, I have got to tell you, in the little town that I grew up in and live in, Butler, Pennsylvania, so many people volunteer their time to do the volunteer fire fighting. They are also the EMS. They are the first responders. Last spring, one of our volunteer firemen by the name of Ryan Sekerski, on his way home from work, he heard over his scanner that a fuel truck had overturned. The driver was trapped inside that truck. He then went to the scene of the accident, got his equipment that was in the trunk of his car, got out, and saved that driver's life. These are the people that we are talking about. When you come to the people's House, America's House, America's Congress, we look at the things that we can do together, things that just make sense. While we may disagree on some other aspects of what it is that we try to get done, on this, we are solid. This just makes sense for America. This makes sense for all those that lay their life on the line anytime there is an emergency or a fire. They do it voluntarily. Hundreds and thousands of hours in training go into this. They spend time away from their families. They take time away from personal time, where they could be doing other things, to get trained so that they can help other Americans who may need their help. It is absolutely incredible. It is so American. It is something we look at with a great sense of pride. And we went to the IRS and said: Listen, what we really need now is a statute that guarantees that these volunteer fire departments will not be put under pressure, where they would have to go out of business. This is not a health care issue, not as far as it is supplying health care or paying a fine for those that volunteer; but this is a health care issue for every single American for whom these people supply necessary services on a voluntary basis to save their lives and their property. So I think the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Barletta) is a champion on this issue. He was in the last Congress and the fact that it has come forward again--it is so overwhelmingly supported by both sides of our House that it truly is America's Congress. It truly is America's issue. It truly is an issue that makes sense for all of us. It is maybe our small way of thanking all those folks that do that every day without any pay, just because of the greatness in their hearts. Mr. LARSON of Connecticut. Mr. Speaker, I really deeply appreciate the words of my colleague and fellow member of the Ways and Means Committee. Again, I want to commend the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Barletta). I want to submit for the Record a letter from the Department of the Treasury that, at the bequest of a number of Members bipartisanly submitted and they made the changes to the rules. B. Exclusions From Definition of Hour of Service Commenters requested that hours of service performed in certain capacities not be counted as an hour of service. The final regulations adopt the following changes in response to these comments. 1. Volunteer Employees Commenters requested that hours of service performed in the capacity of a volunteer for a government entity or tax-exempt organization not be counted as hours of service for purposes of section 4980H. Under the definition of hour of service outlined in these regulations, an hour of service is generally defined as an hour for which an employee is paid or entitled to payment. Accordingly, hours worked by a volunteer who does not receive (and is not entitled to receive) compensation in exchange for the performance of services are not treated as hours of service for purposes of section 4980H. Commenters noted, however, that some volunteers receive compensation in the form of expense reimbursements, stipends, contributions to employee benefit plans, or nominal wages. Local governments, for instance, noted that many volunteer firefighters or other emergency responders are paid a salary or an hourly wage, generally at a rate lower than the rate paid to non-volunteers performing services in a similar capacity. Other volunteer firefighters or emergency responders may receive expense reimbursements or other fees each time they respond to a call. Commenters generally expressed concern that volunteer service would be discouraged if volunteer hours were required to be counted when determining whether the individual is a full-time employee for purposes of section 4980H. In response to these concerns, the final regulations provide that hours of service do not include hours worked as a ``bona fide volunteer.'' For this purpose, the definition of ``bona fide volunteer'' is generally based on the definition of that term for purposes of section 457(e)(11)(B)(i), which provides special rules for length of service awards offered to certain volunteer firefighters and emergency medical providers under a municipal deferred compensation plan. For purposes of section 4980H, however, bona fide volunteers are not limited to volunteer firefighters and emergency medical providers. Rather, bona fide volunteers include any volunteer who is an employee of a government entity or an organization described in section 501(c) that is exempt from taxation under section 501(a) whose only compensation from that entity or organization is in the form of (i) reimbursement for (or reasonable allowance for) reasonable expenses incurred in the performance of services by volunteers, or (ii) reasonable benefits (including length of service awards), and nominal fees, customarily paid by similar entities in connection with the performance of services by volunteers. Mr. LARSON of Connecticut. Mr. Speaker, I think it is both appropriate and right that we codify this and put it into a law. With that, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Connecticut, Joe Courtney, one of the chief sponsors who, along with Elizabeth Esty, helped engineer this bill. Mr. COURTNEY. Mr. Speaker, first of all, I want to congratulate the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Barletta) for his leadership on this legislation, which has been noted. As we are standing here today, there are probably thousands of calls happening all across the country for fire suppression, for medical emergencies, for people with all types of difficulties that volunteers--people who don't have to step up and train and spend all the hours and be available at the expense of their family time and their work time--will respond to these calls. And for a lot of communities that rely on volunteers, the issue of recruitment and retention and just trying to make the environment conducive for people to make that act of volunteering is a challenge that I think all of us hear about from our volunteer fire departments and first responders all across the Nation. So when this issue of the Affordable Care Act being possibly a requirement for the shared responsibilities of employers was out there, again, I applaud Mr. Barletta for stepping up, introducing this legislation, and following [[Page H204]] up with mail to the IRS Commissioner. They did respond almost exactly a year ago, saying that the regulations would not count bona fide volunteers in terms of the 50-employee count. But as was noted, I think it is always better to have it in statute rather than rely on the whims of administrative agencies that can change with the change of administration. So again, I think this is an example of how the country really wants us to operate. Again, if you look at the Affordable Care Act, since its passage, we have worked together to eliminate the 1099 filing requirement; we have worked together to make sure that our military families, through TRICARE, would have age 26 coverage, which was left out when the bill was initially filed; and here today, we are following up again with an example of commonsense fixes to the legislation, which is what I think the country really is looking for. I would also note that the gentleman from Connecticut (Mr. Larson) has legislation to restore tax exclusions which were on the books a number of years ago to help volunteer fire departments use property tax exemptions and equipment donations that had been treated as income by the IRS in past years. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired. Mr. LARSON of Connecticut. I yield the gentleman an additional minute. Mr. COURTNEY. Unfortunately, those tax exemptions expired. And I know, again, the gentleman--and I am sure with bipartisan support--is going to introduce measures to bring those back and, again, allow these departments that are struggling to retain and recruit to have the tools so that they can make it easier, rather than having to file 1040s and drive people crazy around tax filing time for things like boots and coats and a property tax exemption being treated as taxable income. So again, I look forward to the passage of this legislation with the huge bipartisan margin that we saw last year; and given the administration's response to our entreaties, again, I fully expect that there will be a bill signing ceremony at the White House, assuming it gets through the Senate. Again, with that, I would urge passage. Mr. RYAN of Wisconsin. Mr. Speaker, I have no further requests for time other than to close. May I inquire of the gentleman from Connecticut? Mr. LARSON of Connecticut. I have no further requests for time. Joe Courtney said, ``Don't forget to mention the Patriots,'' so I would be remiss if I didn't. Mr. RYAN of Wisconsin. I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. LARSON of Connecticut. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I want to thank Representative Courtney also for recognizing the Volunteer Responder Incentive Protection Reauthorization Act, as I mentioned earlier, which is something that has been bipartisanly cosponsored in the past by Representatives Reichert, Latham, myself, and others. The distinguished chairman and I, who are classmates, who came into this Congress together--he has also been a great proponent and advocate for making sure that these volunteers, who never were intended in both the case of Mr. Barletta and also in the case of the IRS, something that is administratively burdening for the IRS, this is, as Mr. Kelly so passionately said, something that is common sense, that we ought to work on together, and that we ought to provide the relief for, those who provide more than 70 percent of the volunteer aid across this country, especially when it comes to fighting fires. And our National Volunteer Fire Council is supportive of this as is the Fire Chiefs Association. I am looking forward to working with my colleagues across the aisle to ensure this. Again, with that, I commend and congratulate the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Barletta) and thank him for his fine work in this area, and I look forward to supporting him on future endeavors. I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. RYAN of Wisconsin. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself just a few moments to say to the gentleman from Connecticut (Mr. Larson), I appreciate him for his comity, for the bipartisan nature of this. I would say to the gentleman from Connecticut (Mr. Courtney), first, they have to get through some tough luck--Andrew Luck, in particular-- in order to make it to where they want to go. With that, for the purpose of closing on his own bill, I would like to yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Barletta). Mr. BARLETTA. Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank my colleagues on both sides. There are very few times when you have a vote here that is unanimous, and it is for a simple reason. It is that everyone here understands and appreciates what these men and women in our communities are willing to do to make the community safe. You know, as a mayor, I have come to appreciate the volunteer firefighters more than I could ever imagine. Many times, I have watched them stand out in the middle of a road with a boot, trying to raise money so that they could buy gear or equipment or get more training. The volunteers ask very little of their community compared to what they are willing to give, and that is the ultimate sacrifice. They are willing to give their lives for people that they don't even know. They are willing to walk into a burning fire. I can remember one night, our local fire department in Hazleton, Pennsylvania, they ran in, and they came out with a little baby whose life they saved. And I also remember a day when they couldn't save a life and how it affected every one of those men and women as if it were their own child. They have a lot to worry about, and what they shouldn't worry about is where they are going to get money to provide health insurance or pay a fine. I am sure this was an unintended consequence, and we here recognize that. So again, I want to thank the chairman and my colleagues for standing with me and saluting the real American heroes, the men and women who volunteer to save us, our first responders. Mr. RYAN of Wisconsin. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. Ryan) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 33. The question was taken. The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the opinion of the Chair, two-thirds being in the affirmative, the ayes have it. Mr. LARSON of Connecticut. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays. The yeas and nays were ordered. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further proceedings on this motion will be postponed. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 5 (Monday, January 12, 2015)] [House] [Pages H201-H204] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] PROTECTING VOLUNTEER FIREFIGHTERS AND EMERGENCY RESPONDERS ACT Mr. RYAN of Wisconsin. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 33) to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to ensure that emergency services volunteers are not taken into account as employees under the shared responsibility requirements contained in the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The text of the bill is as follows: H.R. 33 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. This Act may be cited as the ``Protecting Volunteer Firefighters and Emergency Responders Act''. SEC. 2. EMERGENCY SERVICES, GOVERNMENT, AND CERTAIN NONPROFIT VOLUNTEERS. (a) In General.--Section 4980H(c) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 is amended by redesignating paragraphs (5), (6), and (7) as paragraphs (6), (7), and (8), respectively, and by inserting after paragraph (4) the following new paragraph: ``(5) Special rules for certain emergency services, government, and nonprofit volunteers.-- ``(A) Emergency services volunteers.--Qualified services rendered as a bona fide volunteer to an eligible employer shall not be taken into account under this section as service provided by an employee. For purposes of the preceding sentence, the terms `qualified services', `bona fide volunteer', and `eligible employer' shall have the respective meanings given such terms under section 457(e). ``(B) Certain other government and nonprofit volunteers.-- ``(i) In general.--Services rendered as a bona fide volunteer to a specified employer shall not be taken into account under this section as service provided by an employee. ``(ii) Bona fide volunteer.--For purposes of this subparagraph, the term `bona fide volunteer' means an employee of a specified employer whose only compensation from such employer is in the form of-- ``(I) reimbursement for (or reasonable allowance for) reasonable expenses incurred in the performance of services by volunteers, or ``(II) reasonable benefits (including length of service awards), and nominal fees, customarily paid by similar entities in connection with the performance of services by volunteers. ``(iii) Specified employer.--For purposes of this subparagraph, the term `specified employer' means-- ``(I) any government entity, and ``(II) any organization described in section 501(c) and exempt from tax under section 501(a). ``(iv) Coordination with subparagraph (A).--This subparagraph shall not fail to apply with respect to services merely because such services are qualified services (as defined in section 457(e)(11)(C)).''. (b) Effective Date.--The amendments made by this section shall apply to months beginning after December 31, 2013. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. Ryan) and the gentleman from Connecticut (Mr. Larson) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Wisconsin. General Leave Mr. RYAN of Wisconsin. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous material on H.R. 33, currently under consideration. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Wisconsin? There was no objection. Mr. RYAN of Wisconsin. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I am here bringing forward Mr. Barletta's bill, and it is really simple. One of the cornerstones of our civil society--one of the great pieces of the American story--is volunteerism but, in particular, volunteerism among our first responders. [[Page H202]] So many of us represent congressional districts that thrive on and exist on and preserve their safety on volunteer firefighters and first responders. Unfortunately, in the Affordable Care Act, there is a huge glitch. Under ObamaCare, volunteer firefighters and first responders are counted in many ways as if they were full-time equivalent employees, and therefore, volunteer fire departments are getting hit with enormous fines, mandates, and taxes. It shouldn't be that way. It is causing a huge paperwork burden, not to mention a fiscal drain on the budgets of these small fire departments and emergency responding agencies in our communities and in rural areas all across America. This legislation fixes this. I want to thank Congressman Barletta for introducing this because he clearly understands as a former mayor and as someone who represents Pennsylvania, which I know has a lot of volunteer firefighters just like we do in rural Wisconsin, that these are the lifeblood of our communities. The last thing that they need to do when they are so concerned about preserving public safety and health is to worry about all of these ObamaCare mandates. Mr. Barletta's bill preserves the freedom to operate for our 780,000 public service volunteer firefighters. It removes this mandate and exempts them from this onerous mandate, so they can continue providing the public service that they have been right now. Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Barletta), the author of this legislation. Mr. BARLETTA. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of my bill, H.R. 33, the Protecting Volunteer Firefighters and Emergency Responders Act. This is a good, truly bipartisan bill that protects our first responders, our volunteer firefighters, and emergency services personnel. It protects them by ensuring that they are not considered employees under the employer mandate provision of ObamaCare. If they were, some fire companies would be forced to pay for the volunteers' health insurance or pay a fine, driving many fire departments out of business. As a former mayor, I know how important volunteer fire companies are to the health and safety of a community. Simply put, this is a public safety issue. I first learned about this issue from a volunteer firefighter, Bob Timko, back home, and I began a crusade to clear this up for volunteer firefighters and localities and the residents of Pennsylvania and every other State. As you know, the employer mandate of ObamaCare kicks in for employers with 50 or more employees. Now, some fire companies may hear about this and immediately think, ``Well, we only have 25 volunteers, so we are safe. We don't have 50.'' That may not necessarily be the case. Some fire companies are considered part of their local government. If you take the number of firefighters, paid and unpaid, and add them to the number of other public employees, such as highway workers, police, code enforcement officers, health officers, and clerical workers, you can easily reach 50, even in a small town. This would be a very big deal in my home State of Pennsylvania, where 97 percent of our fire companies are either completely or mostly volunteers. Nationally, almost 92 percent of fire companies use at least some volunteers, and over 86 percent depend on all or mostly volunteers. Those numbers come from the 2012 National Fire Department Census conducted by the United States Fire Administration. If your district is like mine, then volunteer firefighters are ingrained in your community. We won an initial battle on this issue. After I raised it with the IRS and brought pressure to bear through this legislation, they finally relented and changed their rules regarding the Federal tax status of volunteer firefighters. However, this is too important of a public safety issue to be left to the changing positions of unelected Federal bureaucrats at the IRS. Their arbitrary regulatory guidance could easily be changed back. Our people back home deserve better. We owe our emergency service volunteers, who risk their lives every day, rock-solid certainty. This legislation says, once and for all, that volunteer firefighters are just that--volunteers--and should not be subjected to the employer mandate. It takes away the power of the IRS to change the rules. I want to thank my colleagues on both sides of the aisle for their continued support. Last year, this bill passed the Ways and Means Committee by a strong bipartisan vote of 37-0, and it passed the House by a very rare unanimous vote of 410-0. Not one single Member, Republican or Democrat, opposed it. I want to thank Speaker Boehner, Majority Leader McCarthy, Majority Whip Scalise, the Ways and Means Committee, and their staffs. We all recognize that my bill is a simple, bipartisan solution to an unforeseen consequence of the President's health care law. This bill has the strong support of the National Volunteer Fire Council, the International Association of Fire Chiefs, and the Congressional Fire Services Institute. I want to thank my partners, as well as the men and women they represent, for their help. To be clear, forcing volunteer fire companies to comply with ObamaCare will not extend health insurance to the uninsured; rather, it will close firehouses, placing people at risk.

Accordingly, hours worked by a volunteer who does not receive (and is not entitled to receive) compensation in exchange for the performance of services are not treated as hours of service for purposes of section 4980H. Commenters noted, however, that some volunteers receive compensation in the form of expense reimbursements, stipends, contributions to employee benefit plans, or nominal wages. Local governments, for instance, noted that many volunteer firefighters or other emergency responders are paid a salary or an hourly wage, generally at a rate lower than the rate paid to non-volunteers performing services in a similar capacity. Other volunteer firefighters or emergency responders may receive expense reimbursements or other fees each time they respond to a call. Commenters generally expressed concern that volunteer service would be discouraged if volunteer hours were required to be counted when determining whether the individual is a full-time employee for purposes of section 4980H. In response to these concerns, the final regulations provide that hours of service do not include hours worked as a ``bona fide volunteer.'' For this purpose, the definition of ``bona fide volunteer'' is generally based on the definition of that term for purposes of section 457(e)(11)(B)(i), which provides special rules for length of service awards offered to certain volunteer firefighters and emergency medical providers under a municipal deferred compensation plan. For purposes of section 4980H, however, bona fide volunteers are not limited to volunteer firefighters and emergency medical providers. Rather, bona fide volunteers include any volunteer who is an employee of a government entity or an organization described in section 501(c) that is exempt from taxation under section 501(a) whose only compensation from that entity or organization is in the form of (i) reimbursement for (or reasonable allowance for) reasonable expenses incurred in the performance of services by volunteers, or (ii) reasonable benefits (including length of service awards), and nominal fees, customarily paid by similar entities in connection with the performance of services by volunteers. Mr. LARSON of Connecticut. Mr. Speaker, I think it is both appropriate and right that we codify this and put it into a law. With that, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Connecticut, Joe Courtney, one of the chief sponsors who, along with Elizabeth Esty, helped engineer this bill. Mr. COURTNEY. Mr. Speaker, first of all, I want to congratulate the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Barletta) for his leadership on this legislation, which has been noted. As we are standing here today, there are probably thousands of calls happening all across the country for fire suppression, for medical emergencies, for people with all types of difficulties that volunteers--people who don't have to step up and train and spend all the hours and be available at the expense of their family time and their work time--will respond to these calls. And for a lot of communities that rely on volunteers, the issue of recruitment and retention and just trying to make the environment conducive for people to make that act of volunteering is a challenge that I think all of us hear about from our volunteer fire departments and first responders all across the Nation. So when this issue of the Affordable Care Act being possibly a requirement for the shared responsibilities of employers was out there, again, I applaud Mr. Barletta for stepping up, introducing this legislation, and following [[Page H204]] up with mail to the IRS Commissioner. They did respond almost exactly a year ago, saying that the regulations would not count bona fide volunteers in terms of the 50-employee count. But as was noted, I think it is always better to have it in statute rather than rely on the whims of administrative agencies that can change with the change of administration. So again, I think this is an example of how the country really wants us to operate. Again, if you look at the Affordable Care Act, since its passage, we have worked together to eliminate the 1099 filing requirement; we have worked together to make sure that our military families, through TRICARE, would have age 26 coverage, which was left out when the bill was initially filed; and here today, we are following up again with an example of commonsense fixes to the legislation, which is what I think the country really is looking for. I would also note that the gentleman from Connecticut (Mr. Larson) has legislation to restore tax exclusions which were on the books a number of years ago to help volunteer fire departments use property tax exemptions and equipment donations that had been treated as income by the IRS in past years. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired. Mr. LARSON of Connecticut. I yield the gentleman an additional minute. Mr. COURTNEY. Unfortunately, those tax exemptions expired. And I know, again, the gentleman--and I am sure with bipartisan support--is going to introduce measures to bring those back and, again, allow these departments that are struggling to retain and recruit to have the tools so that they can make it easier, rather than having to file 1040s and drive people crazy around tax filing time for things like boots and coats and a property tax exemption being treated as taxable income. So again, I look forward to the passage of this legislation with the huge bipartisan margin that we saw last year; and given the administration's response to our entreaties, again, I fully expect that there will be a bill signing ceremony at the White House, assuming it gets through the Senate. Again, with that, I would urge passage. Mr. RYAN of Wisconsin. Mr. Speaker, I have no further requests for time other than to close. May I inquire of the gentleman from Connecticut? Mr. LARSON of Connecticut. I have no further requests for time. Joe Courtney said, ``Don't forget to mention the Patriots,'' so I would be remiss if I didn't. Mr. RYAN of Wisconsin. I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. LARSON of Connecticut. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I want to thank Representative Courtney also for recognizing the Volunteer Responder Incentive Protection Reauthorization Act, as I mentioned earlier, which is something that has been bipartisanly cosponsored in the past by Representatives Reichert, Latham, myself, and others. The distinguished chairman and I, who are classmates, who came into this Congress together--he has also been a great proponent and advocate for making sure that these volunteers, who never were intended in both the case of Mr. Barletta and also in the case of the IRS, something that is administratively burdening for the IRS, this is, as Mr. Kelly so passionately said, something that is common sense, that we ought to work on together, and that we ought to provide the relief for, those who provide more than 70 percent of the volunteer aid across this country, especially when it comes to fighting fires. And our National Volunteer Fire Council is supportive of this as is the Fire Chiefs Association. I am looking forward to working with my colleagues across the aisle to ensure this. Again, with that, I commend and congratulate the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Barletta) and thank him for his fine work in this area, and I look forward to supporting him on future endeavors. I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. RYAN of Wisconsin. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself just a few moments to say to the gentleman from Connecticut (Mr. Larson), I appreciate him for his comity, for the bipartisan nature of this. I would say to the gentleman from Connecticut (Mr. Courtney), first, they have to get through some tough luck--Andrew Luck, in particular-- in order to make it to where they want to go. With that, for the purpose of closing on his own bill, I would like to yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Barletta). Mr. BARLETTA. Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank my colleagues on both sides. There are very few times when you have a vote here that is unanimous, and it is for a simple reason. It is that everyone here understands and appreciates what these men and women in our communities are willing to do to make the community safe. You know, as a mayor, I have come to appreciate the volunteer firefighters more than I could ever imagine. Many times, I have watched them stand out in the middle of a road with a boot, trying to raise money so that they could buy gear or equipment or get more training. The volunteers ask very little of their community compared to what they are willing to give, and that is the ultimate sacrifice. They are willing to give their lives for people that they don't even know. They are willing to walk into a burning fire. I can remember one night, our local fire department in Hazleton, Pennsylvania, they ran in, and they came out with a little baby whose life they saved. And I also remember a day when they couldn't save a life and how it affected every one of those men and women as if it were their own child. They have a lot to worry about, and what they shouldn't worry about is where they are going to get money to provide health insurance or pay a fine. I am sure this was an unintended consequence, and we here recognize that. So again, I want to thank the chairman and my colleagues for standing with me and saluting the real American heroes, the men and women who volunteer to save us, our first responders. Mr. RYAN of Wisconsin. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. Ryan) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 33. The question was taken. The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the opinion of the Chair, two-thirds being in the affirmative, the ayes have it. Mr. LARSON of Connecticut. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays. The yeas and nays were ordered. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further proceedings on this motion will be postponed. ____________________","Congressional Record, Volume 161 Issue 5 (Monday, January 12, 2015) [Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 5 (Monday, January 12, 2015)] [House] [Pages H201-H204] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] PROTECTING VOLUNTEER FIREFIGHTERS AND EMERGENCY RESPONDERS ACT Mr. RYAN of Wisconsin. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 33) to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to ensure that emergency services volunteers are not taken into account as employees under the shared responsibility requirements contained in the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The text of the bill is as follows: H.R. 33 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. This Act may be cited as the ``Protecting Volunteer Firefighters and Emergency Responders Act''. SEC. 2. EMERGENCY SERVICES, GOVERNMENT, AND CERTAIN NONPROFIT VOLUNTEERS. (a) In General.--Section 4980H(c) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 is amended by redesignating paragraphs (5), (6), and (7) as paragraphs (6), (7), and (8), respectively, and by inserting after paragraph (4) the following new paragraph: ``(5) Special rules for certain emergency services, government, and nonprofit volunteers.-- ``(A) Emergency services volunteers.--Qualified services rendered as a bona fide volunteer to an eligible employer shall not be taken into account under this section as service provided by an employee. For purposes of the preceding sentence, the terms `qualified services', `bona fide volunteer', and `eligible employer' shall have the respective meanings given such terms under section 457(e). ``(B) Certain other government and nonprofit volunteers.-- ``(i) In general.--Services rendered as a bona fide volunteer to a specified employer shall not be taken into account under this section as service provided by an employee. ``(ii) Bona fide volunteer.--For purposes of this subparagraph, the term `bona fide volunteer' means an employee of a specified employer whose only compensation from such employer is in the form of-- ``(I) reimbursement for (or reasonable allowance for) reasonable expenses incurred in the performance of services by volunteers, or ``(II) reasonable benefits (including length of service awards), and nominal fees, customarily paid by similar entities in connection with the performance of services by volunteers. ``(iii) Specified employer.--For purposes of this subparagraph, the term `specified employer' means-- ``(I) any government entity, and ``(II) any organization described in section 501(c) and exempt from tax under section 501(a). ``(iv) Coordination with subparagraph (A).--This subparagraph shall not fail to apply with respect to services merely because such services are qualified services (as defined in section 457(e)(11)(C)).''. (b) Effective Date.--The amendments made by this section shall apply to months beginning after December 31, 2013. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. Ryan) and the gentleman from Connecticut (Mr. Larson) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Wisconsin. General Leave Mr. RYAN of Wisconsin. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous material on H.R. 33, currently under consideration. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Wisconsin? There was no objection. Mr. RYAN of Wisconsin. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I am here bringing forward Mr. Barletta's bill, and it is really simple. One of the cornerstones of our civil society--one of the great pieces of the American story--is volunteerism but, in particular, volunteerism among our first responders. [[Page H202]] So many of us represent congressional districts that thrive on and exist on and preserve their safety on volunteer firefighters and first responders. Unfortunately, in the Affordable Care Act, there is a huge glitch. Under ObamaCare, volunteer firefighters and first responders are counted in many ways as if they were full-time equivalent employees, and therefore, volunteer fire departments are getting hit with enormous fines, mandates, and taxes. It shouldn't be that way. It is causing a huge paperwork burden, not to mention a fiscal drain on the budgets of these small fire departments and emergency responding agencies in our communities and in rural areas all across America. This legislation fixes this. I want to thank Congressman Barletta for introducing this because he clearly understands as a former mayor and as someone who represents Pennsylvania, which I know has a lot of volunteer firefighters just like we do in rural Wisconsin, that these are the lifeblood of our communities. The last thing that they need to do when they are so concerned about preserving public safety and health is to worry about all of these ObamaCare mandates. Mr. Barletta's bill preserves the freedom to operate for our 780,000 public service volunteer firefighters. It removes this mandate and exempts them from this onerous mandate, so they can continue providing the public service that they have been right now. Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Barletta), the author of this legislation. Mr. BARLETTA. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of my bill, H.R. 33, the Protecting Volunteer Firefighters and Emergency Responders Act. This is a good, truly bipartisan bill that protects our first responders, our volunteer firefighters, and emergency services personnel. It protects them by ensuring that they are not considered employees under the employer mandate provision of ObamaCare. If they were, some fire companies would be forced to pay for the volunteers' health insurance or pay a fine, driving many fire departments out of business. As a former mayor, I know how important volunteer fire companies are to the health and safety of a community. Simply put, this is a public safety issue. I first learned about this issue from a volunteer firefighter, Bob Timko, back home, and I began a crusade to clear this up for volunteer firefighters and localities and the residents of Pennsylvania and every other State. As you know, the employer mandate of ObamaCare kicks in for employers with 50 or more employees. Now, some fire companies may hear about this and immediately think, ``Well, we only have 25 volunteers, so we are safe. We don't have 50.'' That may not necessarily be the case. Some fire companies are considered part of their local government. If you take the number of firefighters, paid and unpaid, and add them to the number of other public employees, such as highway workers, police, code enforcement officers, health officers, and clerical workers, you can easily reach 50, even in a small town. This would be a very big deal in my home State of Pennsylvania, where 97 percent of our fire companies are either completely or mostly volunteers. Nationally, almost 92 percent of fire companies use at least some volunteers, and over 86 percent depend on all or mostly volunteers. Those numbers come from the 2012 National Fire Department Census conducted by the United States Fire Administration. If your district is like mine, then volunteer firefighters are ingrained in your community. We won an initial battle on this issue. After I raised it with the IRS and brought pressure to bear through this legislation, they finally relented and changed their rules regarding the Federal tax status of volunteer firefighters. However, this is too important of a public safety issue to be left to the changing positions of unelected Federal bureaucrats at the IRS. Their arbitrary regulatory guidance could easily be changed back. Our people back home deserve better. We owe our emergency service volunteers, who risk their lives every day, rock-solid certainty. This legislation says, once and for all, that volunteer firefighters are just that--volunteers--and should not be subjected to the employer mandate. It takes away the power of the IRS to change the rules. I want to thank my colleagues on both sides of the aisle for their continued support. Last year, this bill passed the Ways and Means Committee by a strong bipartisan vote of 37-0, and it passed the House by a very rare unanimous vote of 410-0. Not one single Member, Republican or Democrat, opposed it. I want to thank Speaker Boehner, Majority Leader McCarthy, Majority Whip Scalise, the Ways and Means Committee, and their staffs. We all recognize that my bill is a simple, bipartisan solution to an unforeseen consequence of the President's health care law. This bill has the strong support of the National Volunteer Fire Council, the International Association of Fire Chiefs, and the Congressional Fire Services Institute. I want to thank my partners, as well as the men and women they represent, for their help. To be clear, forcing volunteer fire companies to comply with ObamaCare will not extend health insurance to the uninsured; rather, it will close firehouses, placing people at risk. I strongly urge the passage of this bill. Mr. LARSON of Connecticut. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I want to start off by certainly extending congratulations to Representative Barletta for his persistency in continuing to bring this legislation forward. As he has pointed out, it has been bipartisanly supported, and it deserves passage. It passed unanimously, as he indicated, in both the Ways and Means Committee and also unanimously on this floor, which is no small order. Of course, it comes in the midst of controversy. I say ``controversy'' because--well, our distinguished chairman is to be congratulated as well for not only bringing this bill forward, but also for the great victory that was won by the Green Bay Packers yesterday. Mr. RYAN of Wisconsin. Will the gentleman yield? Mr. LARSON of Connecticut. In a moment, because I do want to continue my praise of the Aaron Rodgers look-alike. Today, our distinguished chairman announced that he is not running for President. We think that it is so that his look-alike, Aaron Rodgers, may fill that void. I know that it was an outstanding victory by the Packers yesterday, but it was not without controversy on our own committee. I know that Kenny Marchant, Kevin Brady, and Sam Johnson are very concerned about this, but as the chairman said, ``The rules are the rules,'' and we should proceed from there. {time} 1745 But I also want to thank all of those, and especially the chairman, who raised the point about volunteer firefighters. All of us have that visual in our minds, of course, of those going up the stairs so that people can come down the stairs. And since September 11, and noting that volunteer firefighters cover more than 70 percent of this country, this clearly is a bill that was worthy of the unanimous approval and consent that it received and, as I indicated, is bipartisanly supported by our entire delegation. I want to commend the gentleman from Connecticut, Representative Courtney, who will speak later, and also the gentlewoman from Connecticut, Representative Esty, and also the National Volunteer Fire Council, which has been 1,000 percent behind this and also other tax issues that are going to be coming before our committee that have been bipartisanly supported as well by Representative Reichert, Tom Latham, and others. And I know that we share the bipartisan spirit in this. I also would like to say that, along with firefighters, the many people who are emergency medical volunteers could benefit from a number of volunteer tax breaks that we could provide as well. I look forward to working with our distinguished chairman and, again, commend the gentleman from Pennsylvania, Representative Barletta. I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. RYAN of Wisconsin. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 30 seconds to say that I [[Page H203]] appreciate the kind words from the gentleman from Connecticut. This is bipartisan. It is wonderful when we can work together and find common ground to get things done and find common ground where the completion of a pass is the completion of a pass, it is a rule. Mr. LARSON of Connecticut. Will the gentleman yield? Mr. RYAN of Wisconsin. I yield to the gentleman from Connecticut. Mr. LARSON of Connecticut. We are especially gratified, though, in a true show of compassionate conservatism that you reached out to the chief fan of the Jersey Cowboys--excuse me--the Dallas Cowboys, Chris Christie, to provide him with both a hug and a sincere gesture from Wisconsin. Mr. RYAN of Wisconsin. Reclaiming my time, all in good jest. With that, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Kelly), a member of the full committee. Mr. KELLY of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I rise in very strong support of H.R. 33, and I want to thank Speaker Boehner and Majority Leader McCarthy for allowing this legislation to come forward so early in this Congress. I agree with the gentleman from Connecticut (Mr. Larson). People always say: I wish you guys could get along; just get something done. This is something that we overwhelmingly believe in and we are going to get done. I think that the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Barletta) has explained very clearly that it has to become statute. It can't be left to be some nebulous fact that is rolling around out there. Now, these people who do this work--and in Pennsylvania, 97 percent, almost eight out of every 10 firefighters come from the volunteer aspect of it; they are not paid. Yet because of some type of allowance they are given, they fall under the Affordable Care Act, and this would destroy volunteer fire departments as we know them. So what Mr. Barletta has very thoughtfully done is he has put forth a piece of legislation that would guarantee that these folks don't have to worry about that. Now, I have got to tell you, in the little town that I grew up in and live in, Butler, Pennsylvania, so many people volunteer their time to do the volunteer fire fighting. They are also the EMS. They are the first responders. Last spring, one of our volunteer firemen by the name of Ryan Sekerski, on his way home from work, he heard over his scanner that a fuel truck had overturned. The driver was trapped inside that truck. He then went to the scene of the accident, got his equipment that was in the trunk of his car, got out, and saved that driver's life. These are the people that we are talking about. When you come to the people's House, America's House, America's Congress, we look at the things that we can do together, things that just make sense. While we may disagree on some other aspects of what it is that we try to get done, on this, we are solid. This just makes sense for America. This makes sense for all those that lay their life on the line anytime there is an emergency or a fire. They do it voluntarily. Hundreds and thousands of hours in training go into this. They spend time away from their families. They take time away from personal time, where they could be doing other things, to get trained so that they can help other Americans who may need their help. It is absolutely incredible. It is so American. It is something we look at with a great sense of pride. And we went to the IRS and said: Listen, what we really need now is a statute that guarantees that these volunteer fire departments will not be put under pressure, where they would have to go out of business. This is not a health care issue, not as far as it is supplying health care or paying a fine for those that volunteer; but this is a health care issue for every single American for whom these people supply necessary services on a voluntary basis to save their lives and their property. So I think the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Barletta) is a champion on this issue. He was in the last Congress and the fact that it has come forward again--it is so overwhelmingly supported by both sides of our House that it truly is America's Congress. It truly is America's issue. It truly is an issue that makes sense for all of us. It is maybe our small way of thanking all those folks that do that every day without any pay, just because of the greatness in their hearts. Mr. LARSON of Connecticut. Mr. Speaker, I really deeply appreciate the words of my colleague and fellow member of the Ways and Means Committee. Again, I want to commend the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Barletta). I want to submit for the Record a letter from the Department of the Treasury that, at the bequest of a number of Members bipartisanly submitted and they made the changes to the rules. B. Exclusions From Definition of Hour of Service Commenters requested that hours of service performed in certain capacities not be counted as an hour of service. The final regulations adopt the following changes in response to these comments. 1. Volunteer Employees Commenters requested that hours of service performed in the capacity of a volunteer for a government entity or tax-exempt organization not be counted as hours of service for purposes of section 4980H. Under the definition of hour of service outlined in these regulations, an hour of service is generally defined as an hour for which an employee is paid or entitled to payment. Accordingly, hours worked by a volunteer who does not receive (and is not entitled to receive) compensation in exchange for the performance of services are not treated as hours of service for purposes of section 4980H. Commenters noted, however, that some volunteers receive compensation in the form of expense reimbursements, stipends, contributions to employee benefit plans, or nominal wages. Local governments, for instance, noted that many volunteer firefighters or other emergency responders are paid a salary or an hourly wage, generally at a rate lower than the rate paid to non-volunteers performing services in a similar capacity. Other volunteer firefighters or emergency responders may receive expense reimbursements or other fees each time they respond to a call. Commenters generally expressed concern that volunteer service would be discouraged if volunteer hours were required to be counted when determining whether the individual is a full-time employee for purposes of section 4980H. In response to these concerns, the final regulations provide that hours of service do not include hours worked as a ``bona fide volunteer.'' For this purpose, the definition of ``bona fide volunteer'' is generally based on the definition of that term for purposes of section 457(e)(11)(B)(i), which provides special rules for length of service awards offered to certain volunteer firefighters and emergency medical providers under a municipal deferred compensation plan. For purposes of section 4980H, however, bona fide volunteers are not limited to volunteer firefighters and emergency medical providers. Rather, bona fide volunteers include any volunteer who is an employee of a government entity or an organization described in section 501(c) that is exempt from taxation under section 501(a) whose only compensation from that entity or organization is in the form of (i) reimbursement for (or reasonable allowance for) reasonable expenses incurred in the performance of services by volunteers, or (ii) reasonable benefits (including length of service awards), and nominal fees, customarily paid by similar entities in connection with the performance of services by volunteers. Mr. LARSON of Connecticut. Mr. Speaker, I think it is both appropriate and right that we codify this and put it into a law. With that, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Connecticut, Joe Courtney, one of the chief sponsors who, along with Elizabeth Esty, helped engineer this bill. Mr. COURTNEY.

I am sure this was an unintended consequence, and we here recognize that. So again, I want to thank the chairman and my colleagues for standing with me and saluting the real American heroes, the men and women who volunteer to save us, our first responders. Mr. RYAN of Wisconsin. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. Ryan) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 33. The question was taken. The SPEAKER pro tempore.

Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further proceedings on this motion will be postponed. ____________________",package_114_129.csv,27614,27614,27682,"[congressional record volume 161, number 5 (monday, january 12, 2015)] [house] [pages h201-h204] from the congressional record online through the government publishing office [ www.gpo.gov ] protecting volunteer firefighters and emergency responders act mr. ryan of wisconsin. mr. speaker, i move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (h.r. 33) to amend the internal revenue code of 1986 to ensure that emergency services volunteers are not taken into account as employees under the shared responsibility requirements contained in the patient protection and affordable care act. the clerk read the title of the bill. the text of the bill is as follows: h.r. 33 be it enacted by the senate and house of representatives of the united states of america in congress assembled, section 1. short title. this act may be cited as the ``protecting volunteer firefighters and emergency responders act''. sec. 2. emergency services, government, and certain nonprofit volunteers. (a) in general.--section 4980h(c) of the internal revenue code of 1986 is amended by redesignating paragraphs (5), (6), and (7) as paragraphs (6), (7), and (8), respectively, and by inserting after paragraph (4) the following new paragraph: ``(5) special rules for certain emergency services, government, and nonprofit volunteers.-- ``(a) emergency services volunteers.--qualified services rendered as a bona fide volunteer to an eligible employer shall not be taken into account under this section as service provided by an employee. for purposes of the preceding sentence, the terms `qualified services', `bona fide volunteer', and `eligible employer' shall have the respective meanings given such terms under section 457(e). ``(b) certain other government and nonprofit volunteers.-- ``(i) in general.--services rendered as a bona fide volunteer to a specified employer shall not be taken into account under this section as service provided by an employee. ``(ii) bona fide volunteer.--for purposes of this subparagraph, the term `bona fide volunteer' means an employee of a specified employer whose only compensation from such employer is in the form of-- ``(i) reimbursement for (or reasonable allowance for) reasonable expenses incurred in the performance of services by volunteers, or ``(ii) reasonable benefits (including length of service awards), and nominal fees, customarily paid by similar entities in connection with the performance of services by volunteers. ``(iii) specified employer.--for purposes of this subparagraph, the term `specified employer' means-- ``(i) any government entity, and ``(ii) any organization described in section 501(c) and exempt from tax under section 501(a). ``(iv) coordination with subparagraph (a).--this subparagraph shall not fail to apply with respect to services merely because such services are qualified services (as defined in section 457(e)(11)(c)).''. (b) effective date.--the amendments made by this section shall apply to months beginning after december 31, 2013. the speaker pro tempore. pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from wisconsin (mr. ryan) and the gentleman from connecticut (mr. larson) each will control 20 minutes. the chair recognizes the gentleman from wisconsin. general leave mr. ryan of wisconsin. mr. speaker, i ask unanimous consent that all members may have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous material on h.r. 33, currently under consideration. the speaker pro tempore. is there objection to the request of the gentleman from wisconsin? there was no objection. mr. ryan of wisconsin. mr. speaker, i yield myself such time as i may consume. i am here bringing forward mr. barletta's bill, and it is really simple. one of the cornerstones of our civil society--one of the great pieces of the american story--is volunteerism but, in particular, volunteerism among our first responders. [[page h202]] so many of us represent congressional districts that thrive on and exist on and preserve their safety on volunteer firefighters and first responders. unfortunately, in the affordable care act, there is a huge glitch. under obamacare, volunteer firefighters and first responders are counted in many ways as if they were full-time equivalent employees, and therefore, volunteer fire departments are getting hit with enormous fines, mandates, and taxes. it shouldn't be that way. it is causing a huge paperwork burden, not to mention a fiscal drain on the budgets of these small fire departments and emergency responding agencies in our communities and in rural areas all across america. this legislation fixes this. i want to thank congressman barletta for introducing this because he clearly understands as a former mayor and as someone who represents pennsylvania, which i know has a lot of volunteer firefighters just like we do in rural wisconsin, that these are the lifeblood of our communities. the last thing that they need to do when they are so concerned about preserving public safety and health is to worry about all of these obamacare mandates. mr. barletta's bill preserves the freedom to operate for our 780,000 public service volunteer firefighters. it removes this mandate and exempts them from this onerous mandate, so they can continue providing the public service that they have been right now. mr. speaker, i yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from pennsylvania (mr. barletta), the author of this legislation. mr. barletta. thank you, mr. chairman. mr. speaker, i rise today in support of my bill, h.r. 33, the protecting volunteer firefighters and emergency responders act. this is a good, truly bipartisan bill that protects our first responders, our volunteer firefighters, and emergency services personnel. it protects them by ensuring that they are not considered employees under the employer mandate provision of obamacare. if they were, some fire companies would be forced to pay for the volunteers' health insurance or pay a fine, driving many fire departments out of business. as a former mayor, i know how important volunteer fire companies are to the health and safety of a community. simply put, this is a public safety issue. i first learned about this issue from a volunteer firefighter, bob timko, back home, and i began a crusade to clear this up for volunteer firefighters and localities and the residents of pennsylvania and every other state. as you know, the employer mandate of obamacare kicks in for employers with 50 or more employees. now, some fire companies may hear about this and immediately think, ``well, we only have 25 volunteers, so we are safe. we don't have 50.'' that may not necessarily be the case. some fire companies are considered part of their local government. if you take the number of firefighters, paid and unpaid, and add them to the number of other public employees, such as highway workers, police, code enforcement officers, health officers, and clerical workers, you can easily reach 50, even in a small town. this would be a very big deal in my home state of pennsylvania, where 97 percent of our fire companies are either completely or mostly volunteers. nationally, almost 92 percent of fire companies use at least some volunteers, and over 86 percent depend on all or mostly volunteers. those numbers come from the 2012 national fire department census conducted by the united states fire administration. if your district is like mine, then volunteer firefighters are ingrained in your community. we won an initial battle on this issue. after i raised it with the irs and brought pressure to bear through this legislation, they finally relented and changed their rules regarding the federal tax status of volunteer firefighters. however, this is too important of a public safety issue to be left to the changing positions of unelected federal bureaucrats at the irs. their arbitrary regulatory guidance could easily be changed back. our people back home deserve better. we owe our emergency service volunteers, who risk their lives every day, rock-solid certainty. this legislation says, once and for all, that volunteer firefighters are just that--volunteers--and should not be subjected to the employer mandate. it takes away the power of the irs to change the rules. i want to thank my colleagues on both sides of the aisle for their continued support. last year, this bill passed the ways and means committee by a strong bipartisan vote of 37-0, and it passed the house by a very rare unanimous vote of 410-0. not one single member, republican or democrat, opposed it. i want to thank speaker boehner, majority leader mccarthy, majority whip scalise, the ways and means committee, and their staffs. we all recognize that my bill is a simple, bipartisan solution to an unforeseen consequence of the president's health care law. this bill has the strong support of the national volunteer fire council, the international association of fire chiefs, and the congressional fire services institute. i want to thank my partners, as well as the men and women they represent, for their help. to be clear, forcing volunteer fire companies to comply with obamacare will not extend health insurance to the uninsured; rather, it will close firehouses, placing people at risk. i strongly urge the passage of this bill. mr. larson of connecticut. mr. speaker, i yield myself such time as i may consume. i want to start off by certainly extending congratulations to representative barletta for his persistency in continuing to bring this legislation forward. as he has pointed out, it has been bipartisanly supported, and it deserves passage. it passed unanimously, as he indicated, in both the ways and means committee and also unanimously on this floor, which is no small order. of course, it comes in the midst of controversy. i say ``controversy'' because--well, our distinguished chairman is to be congratulated as well for not only bringing this bill forward, but also for the great victory that was won by the green bay packers yesterday. mr. ryan of wisconsin. will the gentleman yield? mr. larson of connecticut. in a moment, because i do want to continue my praise of the aaron rodgers look-alike. today, our distinguished chairman announced that he is not running for president. we think that it is so that his look-alike, aaron rodgers, may fill that void. i know that it was an outstanding victory by the packers yesterday, but it was not without controversy on our own committee. i know that kenny marchant, kevin brady, and sam johnson are very concerned about this, but as the chairman said, ``the rules are the rules,'' and we should proceed from there. {time} 1745 but i also want to thank all of those, and especially the chairman, who raised the point about volunteer firefighters. all of us have that visual in our minds, of course, of those going up the stairs so that people can come down the stairs. and since september 11, and noting that volunteer firefighters cover more than 70 percent of this country, this clearly is a bill that was worthy of the unanimous approval and consent that it received and, as i indicated, is bipartisanly supported by our entire delegation. i want to commend the gentleman from connecticut, representative courtney, who will speak later, and also the gentlewoman from connecticut, representative esty, and also the national volunteer fire council, which has been 1,000 percent behind this and also other tax issues that are going to be coming before our committee that have been bipartisanly supported as well by representative reichert, tom latham, and others. and i know that we share the bipartisan spirit in this. i also would like to say that, along with firefighters, the many people who are emergency medical volunteers could benefit from a number of volunteer tax breaks that we could provide as well. i look forward to working with our distinguished chairman and, again, commend the gentleman from pennsylvania, representative barletta. i reserve the balance of my time. mr. ryan of wisconsin. mr. speaker, i yield myself 30 seconds to say that i [[page h203]] appreciate the kind words from the gentleman from connecticut. this is bipartisan. it is wonderful when we can work together and find common ground to get things done and find common ground where the completion of a pass is the completion of a pass, it is a rule. mr. larson of connecticut. will the gentleman yield? mr. ryan of wisconsin. i yield to the gentleman from connecticut. mr. larson of connecticut. we are especially gratified, though, in a true show of compassionate conservatism that you reached out to the chief fan of the jersey cowboys--excuse me--the dallas cowboys, chris christie, to provide him with both a hug and a sincere gesture from wisconsin. mr. ryan of wisconsin. reclaiming my time, all in good jest. with that, i yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from pennsylvania (mr. kelly), a member of the full committee. mr. kelly of pennsylvania. mr. speaker, i rise in very strong support of h.r. 33, and i want to thank speaker boehner and majority leader mccarthy for allowing this legislation to come forward so early in this congress. i agree with the gentleman from connecticut (mr. larson). people always say: i wish you guys could get along; just get something done. this is something that we overwhelmingly believe in and we are going to get done. i think that the gentleman from pennsylvania (mr. barletta) has explained very clearly that it has to become statute. it can't be left to be some nebulous fact that is rolling around out there. now, these people who do this work--and in pennsylvania, 97 percent, almost eight out of every 10 firefighters come from the volunteer aspect of it; they are not paid. yet because of some type of allowance they are given, they fall under the affordable care act, and this would destroy volunteer fire departments as we know them. so what mr. barletta has very thoughtfully done is he has put forth a piece of legislation that would guarantee that these folks don't have to worry about that. now, i have got to tell you, in the little town that i grew up in and live in, butler, pennsylvania, so many people volunteer their time to do the volunteer fire fighting. they are also the ems. they are the first responders. last spring, one of our volunteer firemen by the name of ryan sekerski, on his way home from work, he heard over his scanner that a fuel truck had overturned. the driver was trapped inside that truck. he then went to the scene of the accident, got his equipment that was in the trunk of his car, got out, and saved that driver's life. these are the people that we are talking about. when you come to the people's house, america's house, america's congress, we look at the things that we can do together, things that just make sense. while we may disagree on some other aspects of what it is that we try to get done, on this, we are solid. this just makes sense for america. this makes sense for all those that lay their life on the line anytime there is an emergency or a fire. they do it voluntarily. hundreds and thousands of hours in training go into this. they spend time away from their families. they take time away from personal time, where they could be doing other things, to get trained so that they can help other americans who may need their help. it is absolutely incredible. it is so american. it is something we look at with a great sense of pride. and we went to the irs and said: listen, what we really need now is a statute that guarantees that these volunteer fire departments will not be put under pressure, where they would have to go out of business. this is not a health care issue, not as far as it is supplying health care or paying a fine for those that volunteer; but this is a health care issue for every single american for whom these people supply necessary services on a voluntary basis to save their lives and their property. so i think the gentleman from pennsylvania (mr. barletta) is a champion on this issue. he was in the last congress and the fact that it has come forward again--it is so overwhelmingly supported by both sides of our house that it truly is america's congress. it truly is america's issue. it truly is an issue that makes sense for all of us. it is maybe our small way of thanking all those folks that do that every day without any pay, just because of the greatness in their hearts. mr. larson of connecticut. mr. speaker, i really deeply appreciate the words of my colleague and fellow member of the ways and means committee. again, i want to commend the gentleman from pennsylvania (mr. barletta). i want to submit for the record a letter from the department of the treasury that, at the bequest of a number of members bipartisanly submitted and they made the changes to the rules. b. exclusions from definition of hour of service commenters requested that hours of service performed in certain capacities not be counted as an hour of service. the final regulations adopt the following changes in response to these comments. 1. volunteer employees commenters requested that hours of service performed in the capacity of a volunteer for a government entity or tax-exempt organization not be counted as hours of service for purposes of section 4980h. under the definition of hour of service outlined in these regulations, an hour of service is generally defined as an hour for which an employee is paid or entitled to payment. accordingly, hours worked by a volunteer who does not receive (and is not entitled to receive) compensation in exchange for the performance of services are not treated as hours of service for purposes of section 4980h. commenters noted, however, that some volunteers receive compensation in the form of expense reimbursements, stipends, contributions to employee benefit plans, or nominal wages. local governments, for instance, noted that many volunteer firefighters or other emergency responders are paid a salary or an hourly wage, generally at a rate lower than the rate paid to non-volunteers performing services in a similar capacity. other volunteer firefighters or emergency responders may receive expense reimbursements or other fees each time they respond to a call. commenters generally expressed concern that volunteer service would be discouraged if volunteer hours were required to be counted when determining whether the individual is a full-time employee for purposes of section 4980h. in response to these concerns, the final regulations provide that hours of service do not include hours worked as a ``bona fide volunteer.'' for this purpose, the definition of ``bona fide volunteer'' is generally based on the definition of that term for purposes of section 457(e)(11)(b)(i), which provides special rules for length of service awards offered to certain volunteer firefighters and emergency medical providers under a municipal deferred compensation plan. for purposes of section 4980h, however, bona fide volunteers are not limited to volunteer firefighters and emergency medical providers. rather, bona fide volunteers include any volunteer who is an employee of a government entity or an organization described in section 501(c) that is exempt from taxation under section 501(a) whose only compensation from that entity or organization is in the form of (i) reimbursement for (or reasonable allowance for) reasonable expenses incurred in the performance of services by volunteers, or (ii) reasonable benefits (including length of service awards), and nominal fees, customarily paid by similar entities in connection with the performance of services by volunteers. mr. larson of connecticut. mr. speaker, i think it is both appropriate and right that we codify this and put it into a law. with that, i yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from connecticut, joe courtney, one of the chief sponsors who, along with elizabeth esty, helped engineer this bill. mr. courtney. mr. speaker, first of all, i want to congratulate the gentleman from pennsylvania (mr. barletta) for his leadership on this legislation, which has been noted. as we are standing here today, there are probably thousands of calls happening all across the country for fire suppression, for medical emergencies, for people with all types of difficulties that volunteers--people who don't have to step up and train and spend all the hours and be available at the expense of their family time and their work time--will respond to these calls. and for a lot of communities that rely on volunteers, the issue of recruitment and retention and just trying to make the environment conducive for people to make that act of volunteering is a challenge that i think all of us hear about from our volunteer fire departments and first responders all across the nation. so when this issue of the affordable care act being possibly a requirement for the shared responsibilities of employers was out there, again, i applaud mr. barletta for stepping up, introducing this legislation, and following [[page h204]] up with mail to the irs commissioner. they did respond almost exactly a year ago, saying that the regulations would not count bona fide volunteers in terms of the 50-employee count. but as was noted, i think it is always better to have it in statute rather than rely on the whims of administrative agencies that can change with the change of administration. so again, i think this is an example of how the country really wants us to operate. again, if you look at the affordable care act, since its passage, we have worked together to eliminate the 1099 filing requirement; we have worked together to make sure that our military families, through tricare, would have age 26 coverage, which was left out when the bill was initially filed; and here today, we are following up again with an example of commonsense fixes to the legislation, which is what i think the country really is looking for. i would also note that the gentleman from connecticut (mr. larson) has legislation to restore tax exclusions which were on the books a number of years ago to help volunteer fire departments use property tax exemptions and equipment donations that had been treated as income by the irs in past years. the speaker pro tempore. the time of the gentleman has expired. mr. larson of connecticut. i yield the gentleman an additional minute. mr. courtney. unfortunately, those tax exemptions expired. and i know, again, the gentleman--and i am sure with bipartisan support--is going to introduce measures to bring those back and, again, allow these departments that are struggling to retain and recruit to have the tools so that they can make it easier, rather than having to file 1040s and drive people crazy around tax filing time for things like boots and coats and a property tax exemption being treated as taxable income. so again, i look forward to the passage of this legislation with the huge bipartisan margin that we saw last year; and given the administration's response to our entreaties, again, i fully expect that there will be a bill signing ceremony at the white house, assuming it gets through the senate. again, with that, i would urge passage. mr. ryan of wisconsin. mr. speaker, i have no further requests for time other than to close. may i inquire of the gentleman from connecticut? mr. larson of connecticut. i have no further requests for time. joe courtney said, ``don't forget to mention the patriots,'' so i would be remiss if i didn't. mr. ryan of wisconsin. i reserve the balance of my time. mr. larson of connecticut. mr. speaker, i yield myself such time as i may consume. i want to thank representative courtney also for recognizing the volunteer responder incentive protection reauthorization act, as i mentioned earlier, which is something that has been bipartisanly cosponsored in the past by representatives reichert, latham, myself, and others. the distinguished chairman and i, who are classmates, who came into this congress together--he has also been a great proponent and advocate for making sure that these volunteers, who never were intended in both the case of mr. barletta and also in the case of the irs, something that is administratively burdening for the irs, this is, as mr. kelly so passionately said, something that is common sense, that we ought to work on together, and that we ought to provide the relief for, those who provide more than 70 percent of the volunteer aid across this country, especially when it comes to fighting fires. and our national volunteer fire council is supportive of this as is the fire chiefs association. i am looking forward to working with my colleagues across the aisle to ensure this. again, with that, i commend and congratulate the gentleman from pennsylvania (mr. barletta) and thank him for his fine work in this area, and i look forward to supporting him on future endeavors. i yield back the balance of my time. mr. ryan of wisconsin. mr. speaker, i yield myself just a few moments to say to the gentleman from connecticut (mr. larson), i appreciate him for his comity, for the bipartisan nature of this. i would say to the gentleman from connecticut (mr. courtney), first, they have to get through some tough luck--andrew luck, in particular-- in order to make it to where they want to go. with that, for the purpose of closing on his own bill, i would like to yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from pennsylvania (mr. barletta). mr. barletta. mr. speaker, i would like to thank my colleagues on both sides. there are very few times when you have a vote here that is unanimous, and it is for a simple reason. it is that everyone here understands and appreciates what these men and women in our communities are willing to do to make the community safe. you know, as a mayor, i have come to appreciate the volunteer firefighters more than i could ever imagine. many times, i have watched them stand out in the middle of a road with a boot, trying to raise money so that they could buy gear or equipment or get more training. the volunteers ask very little of their community compared to what they are willing to give, and that is the ultimate sacrifice. they are willing to give their lives for people that they don't even know. they are willing to walk into a burning fire. i can remember one night, our local fire department in hazleton, pennsylvania, they ran in, and they came out with a little baby whose life they saved. and i also remember a day when they couldn't save a life and how it affected every one of those men and women as if it were their own child. they have a lot to worry about, and what they shouldn't worry about is where they are going to get money to provide health insurance or pay a fine. i am sure this was an unintended consequence, and we here recognize that. so again, i want to thank the chairman and my colleagues for standing with me and saluting the real american heroes, the men and women who volunteer to save us, our first responders. mr. ryan of wisconsin. mr. speaker, i yield back the balance of my time. the speaker pro tempore. the question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from wisconsin (mr. ryan) that the house suspend the rules and pass the

Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor one of our own, Joe Strickland, the Chief Reporter of Debates, on his retirement from the House after more than 21 years of service. Joe Strickland is a native Texan. He came to the House in 1993, 2 years after graduating from court reporting school. He quickly distinguished himself not only as an excellent court reporter but as a very capable manager. In 2000, the Clerk of the House promoted Joe to Deputy Chief Reporter and made him Chief in 2005. Joe has participated in seven State of the Union addresses by three Presidents, and he has developed a global reputation as a leader in reporting parliamentary debates. Joe has represented the House abroad on several occasions, Mr. Speaker, including participating in the World e-Parliament Conference in Johannesburg. Here at home, Joe has addressed the national convention of the National Court Reporters Association three times, and he has served on the board of the Greater Washington Shorthand Reporters Association. Mr. Speaker, the House has lost a great resource and role model for the 43 dedicated professionals Joe manages. One of the reporters, of course, is on the floor reporting this now, and we thank her, and we thank all of those who have to listen to us and report what we say. That is a tough job. But I know that Joe will continue to inspire those who serve in the reporting office. I join, and I know all of my colleagues join, in honoring Joe Strickland, thanking him for his service to this House. We wish him a very happy retirement, full of time spent with his husband, Tom, and their son, Kevin. I thank him for his service to the Congress and to our country. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 5 (Monday, January 12, 2015)] [House] [Page H207] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] HONORING THE SERVICE OF JOE STRICKLAND (Mr. HOYER asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.)

Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I rise to discuss work in the House to secure our borders and address the Obama administration's unilateral actions on immigration. This week, the House will consider the 2015 Department of Homeland Security appropriations bill, which takes a number of steps to bolster border security and law enforcement efforts. To start, the legislation provides for the largest operational force levels in the history of the Customs and Border Protection agency. The measure also supports several critical border security initiatives, including around-the-clock surveillance of air, land, and sea approaches to the border. Furthermore, the legislation boosts internal enforcement efforts and strengthens related domestic and international investigations. Finally, the legislation will provide for the amendments that will stop the President's executive actions on immigration. Mr. Speaker, the President's unilateral executive orders should be of concern to each and every Member of this body. I call on colleagues from both sides of the aisle to do what is right--support this legislative package. It protects the borders, it restores the rule of law.

CREC-2015-01-12-pt1-PgH209,CREC-2015-01-12,114,COMMEMORATING THE LIFE OF MARIO CUOMO,"[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 5 (Monday, January 12, 2015)] [House] [Pages H209-H214] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] COMMEMORATING THE LIFE OF MARIO CUOMO The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under the Speaker's announced policy of January 6, 2015, the gentleman from New York (Mr. Crowley) is recognized for the remainder of the hour as the designee of the minority leader. Mr. CROWLEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from California (Ms. Pelosi), the minority leader of the House. Ms. PELOSI. I thank the gentleman for yielding. I thank the distinguished member and longest-serving member--I don't want to say ``senior member''--in the New York delegation for getting us off to a start to sing the praises of Mario Cuomo. It is my honor to join the New York delegation. I feel honored to do so. Four of our children were born in New York, so that gives me some standing on the subject. Mr. Speaker, I come to the floor to join the New York delegation in paying tribute to the memory of Governor Mario Cuomo. I am reminded of Ecclesiasticus. We all know this, but just think of how appropriate it is for Mario Cuomo. In Ecclesiasticus, it says: Now let us praise great men, the heroes of our Nation. They led the people by their counsel and their knowledge of the laws. From their font of wisdom, they gave instruction. These are godly men whose righteous deeds have not been forgotten. Their wealth is their descendants, and their inheritance is their children's children. Their bodies are buried in peace, and their names will live forever. The people will tell of their wisdom, and the congregation will continue to sing their praise. Does that remind you of Mario Cuomo? Is that perfectly appropriate for him? Surely, those words apply to the life and legacy of our great departed friend, Mario. As a fellow Italian American, I have always taken great pride in his leadership. As a San Franciscan who hosted the Democratic Convention, we in California had some kind of claim on Mario Cuomo because of the great speech that he made at that convention which Mr. Rangel referenced, but my observing of his greatness goes farther back than that. It was during a trip to Italy that we were invited by President Carter in 1980 to bring the sympathy and support of the American people to Italy at the time of the earthquake, when they lost 2,700 lives and which left 265,000 people homeless. I mention that because we went by helicopter from village to village to village. Villages were devastated. Mario Cuomo, here was this person who had such a large spirit and a good soul, who could sympathize with these people in English and Italian. For example, in a village where a First Communion class was rehearsing for First Communion, all of the 7-year-olds in that village were in that church when the earthquake hit. The roof came down, and every 7-year-old in the village was lost. Imagine the grief of those individual families and of that community to lose those children, but as you would expect, he was up to the task, knowing that words were completely inadequate and that no sympathy could meet the pain that they were feeling; nonetheless, there was this beautiful, sympathetic man identifying with these people from a region from which his family had come in southern Italy. Mario Cuomo was a pillar of strength through his community, his State, and our Nation. His values, his vision, and his effectiveness for the people of New York were an inspiration around the world. He was a man of principle and eloquence--that was good--and all the world saw, again, that manifested in the ``shining city on a hill'' speech at the 1984 Democratic Convention. With those soaring words, Governor Cuomo summoned the best of America and called us to empower the working people and middle class families who are the backbone of our Nation. He asked us to remember how futures are built. We know Mario Cuomo's language and leadership will echo through the ages just as vital, just as urgent, just as energizing as his words were that day. In word and deed, Governor Cuomo challenged us to make real the American Dream. He had it for his family. He wanted it for everyone else, for all who strived to realize it, and opened the doors of opportunity for every American family. Family meant everything to him. He was a proud Governor of New York for three terms, but his proudest achievement was his beautiful family. No one could miss the pride and inspiration he found in his immigrant parents and how he talked about them so beautifully or in his boundless dedication to Matilda and his children. Our country has lost a great leader, but his family has lost a devoted husband to his wife of over 60 years, to Matilda. He was a loving father to five children--Margaret, Andrew, Maria, Madeline, and Christopher--and was a doting grandfather to some really lovely grandchildren. My husband, Paul, and I and our entire family are heartbroken. We are really heartbroken by his passing, and we continue to extend our deepest sympathy and love to Matilda and their family. I hope it is a comfort to them that so many people in their own State, in the country, and, really, throughout the world mourn their loss and continue to pray for them and continue to be inspired by this great man. As Ecclesiasticus says: People will tell of his wisdom, and the congregation will continue to sing his praise. I thank Mr. Crowley for yielding. I thank him for bringing us together to sing the praises of Mario Cuomo. Mr. CROWLEY. Thank you. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Rochester, New York, Louise Slaughter. Ms. SLAUGHTER. I thank Mr. Crowley for yielding to me. There is so much on my mind as to what I could say about him. I knew him longer than the rest of the New Yorkers. I met him in 1973. I was a member of the Democratic State committee in Rochester, New York, and I was asked by the district attorney to come over to his house and meet a man from New York City who was thinking about running for Governor; so I joined my friends and sat in the [[Page H210]] living room for about an hour, awaiting the guest from New York to get off the telephone in the kitchen and come out and talk to us. He came out. He was perfectly charming, but he didn't know upstate New York. He started by telling us: ``A lot of people are talking to me about running for Governor, and I thought it would be a good idea if I came up here to see what all of you thought.'' I left the house that night, and I said to my friend that I was driving with: ``He is really a nice guy, and he is very smart, but, boy, he needs a lot of help.'' I was really pretty lucky, I think, that I got to do that. As it turns out, Governor Carey ran for Governor at that time, and Mr. Cuomo was appointed secretary of state. He had some great ideas for upstate New York. One of them was they were going to have an upstate coordinator, which is kind of an amorphous title, but I was very blessed that he let me try that job. I had been out of the workforce. I was home. My youngest child was about 12 years old. It was back in the day when one income could bring up a family and educate them. {time} 1945 And so trying to get back into work and to get back into all of that was pretty difficult for me. And I am not sure anybody else would have put up with me, other than Mario Cuomo, giving me every opportunity in the world to try to learn what it is we were trying to do. But, boy, did I ever teach him a few things. We had an old State car, a rattletrap. I drove him all over upstate New York, and the conversations we had would absolutely astound you. We stopped one day in one of our beautiful rural villages in upstate named Pavilion to get a cup of coffee. And a 16-year-old girl came out to wait on us. And here he was: a new person to speak to. Now, those of you who knew him know how exciting that would be. And he started in by asking her, What was the main business in Pavilion? What was the gross domestic product there? He was asking her all these questions. And all she wanted to do was get him a cup of coffee. And I felt a little sorry for her, so I said, ``He is the secretary of state.'' Unfortunately, I forgot the part to say secretary of state of New York. She went back into the kitchen, knowing this man was not Henry Kissinger, and never came back out. And as we rode around in this old red car, he would ask me about the cornfields. And I will tell you, if my agriculture people knew what a botch I made of trying to explain to him the life of the cornstalk, it was really awful. And he would say things like, How do they heat that house over there? What do you think they do? Where do they all go to school? Everything in the world interested him. He was the most extraordinary teacher that I have ever had. I just had those 2 years of showing him upstate New York. And then when he got elected lieutenant governor--I ran that upstate campaign--the State Police took over. But we still carried on all these great conversations we had. And I remember one of the policemen said once that no matter how upset Mario was, when he got off the plane and would go 10 miles or 10 rounds with Louise, they were off on a whole other subject. I learned so much from him. And I know that everybody thinks of him as a one-speech maker sort of a--but let me tell you, that was not it. The speech that he made at Notre Dame was so incredibly wonderful and so important and so instructive that everybody should read that as well. But one of my very favorites was when he made his speech about my hometown of Rochester on Lake Ontario. He described Rochester as a necklace of neighborhoods clustered around the lake. Now that is talking. And he also talked about life, that our life needed to be more than to just hope always to land on the safe squares. And we thought that was such an incredible thing to think about, that your life had to have more meaning than that. The people that we worked with at the secretary of state's office who were holdovers from the previous administration had said to me many, many times how wonderful it was for them to be able to work for such a first-rate lawyer. And believe me, he really was. He loved the country, as Nancy Pelosi pointed out. His love of his family was absolutely legendary. He was a man of deep conviction, of religious faith, who loved his family more than anything. But he also loved the great opportunity that this country had given to him. He talked so admiringly of his father and the strength that his father and mother had, coming here with literally nothing. And it was the manual labor that his father did to lift himself up and, consequently, his family to a better life, and the country. He loved New York. He loved its people. He loved its history more than anything. He loved the institution of governing. So I speak of him as somebody that maybe other people didn't get to know the way I did, but I admired him always. And I am pretty sure I would not be in elected office at all had I not had the opportunity to learn from him, the wonderful opportunity to represent our neighbors and to come down and to try to make law and to make some changes. So I thank you very much for the time, Mr. Crowley. We will not see his like again. Mr. CROWLEY. I thank the gentlelady. I now yield to the gentleman from the Bronx, Mr. Serrano. (Mr. SERRANO asked and was given permission to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. SERRANO. I thank my colleague, Mr. Crowley. This week in 1975, I became a member of the New York State Assembly. This week in 1975, Mario Cuomo became secretary of state. I left to come to Congress in 1990, so I am fortunate to have served in the legislature 16 of the 20 years that he served in the executive branch. And in 1983, when I became chairman of the Education Committee, I really got to know him and to speak to him and to understand what everyone that has spoken has already said. Above all, this man never forgot, and he understood how important it was for him to be the son of an immigrant family. So he wanted everyone else to have the same opportunity. Yes, he was eloquent. Yes, he had to be a great human being--after all, he was a minor league baseball player and was signed by the Pittsburgh Pirates, I believe, to play ball, that alone makes him a great guy. But he was an eloquent man who also remembered his humble beginnings in the grocery store, having to work to get through law school, to be able to understand. So when I stood in front of him as one who had been born an American citizen--but a lot of people forgot along the way that we were and treated us in a different way--he understood. There was that simpatico that he had with him, where he understood where we came from and what we needed. And I am just so honored to have served all those years with Mario Cuomo and to have considered him a friend. When I went to his funeral, Matilda was just so gracious because she wrote a book once where she asked people to write about who had influenced them. And I wrote about a certain gentleman in the Bronx who had played major role in my starting my public career. And she remembered that. And I, once again, offer my condolences to the Cuomo family. But we should not feel sorry that he is gone. We have been blessed with the fact that he lived among us. And for me, 16 of those 20 years, I learned so much from him, and hopefully I was able to help him along the way at times too. Mr. CROWLEY. I thank my friend from the Bronx. And I yield to the gentleman from Manhattan, Mr. Nadler. Mr. NADLER. I thank the gentleman for yielding. Mr. Speaker, I too came to the legislature and served for 16 years there. And for most of that time, Mario Cuomo was Governor. We all know that he was an eloquent philosopher in politics, someone who could express the goals and the principles of public office and of government more eloquently than almost anyone else. Mario Cuomo graduated first in his class from St. John's Law School in 1946. And despite sending out over 70 resumes, he couldn't get a response or an interview from a top law firm because he was Italian. And that was the [[Page H211]] state of prejudice in this country--or at least on Wall Street in 1946. He went on from there to become a major lawyer, to become the Governor of a State, to become a leader of a philosophy in American politics. But in doing so, he never forgot where he came from. He didn't forget his experiences, and he knew that other people were having similar experiences. He was a man of great principle. He vetoed the death penalty--though he knew that the death penalty was very popular in New York--12 times in a row, and he sustained those vetoes. Having not forgotten where he came from, he always wanted to use government to help defenseless people who needed the help of government, and he did. We all know many of the things he did. I am not going to repeat them here. But I want to just mention a couple of things that didn't get great publicity but that I saw as a member of the legislature. When he became Governor, he set up a commission. I forget the exact title--Commission on Child Support, Commission on Day Care, whatever it was. But every year for years, that commission came up with legislation which he supported and pushed, and some of us in the legislature worked on that. And he passed--we passed pioneering legislation, pioneering in this country on child support enforcement, which was considered a radical idea in the early 1980s. We passed the Child Support Standards Act so that judges couldn't leave women and their children without adequate support. He passed day care resource and referral legislation and family day care, all of which came from the initiatives of Governor Cuomo, none of which got a lot of publicity, which was focused on so- called bigger items. But these helped people. These were vital for people living their lives without a lot of money, without a lot of resources. But government became a helper and a friend because of Governor Cuomo. Mr. CROWLEY. Thank you, Mr. Nadler. I now yield to the gentlelady from Brooklyn, Queens, and Manhattan, Ms. Nydia Velaazquez. Ms. VELAAZQUEZ. I thank the gentleman for yielding. Mr. Speaker, I rise to honor a leader who inspired not only New Yorkers but who also captured the imagination of progressives across the Nation. At a time when our national dialogue was dominated by those seeking to leave working families to fend for themselves, Governor Cuomo outlined a different vision. Through his policies as Governor and his evocative speaking abilities, he articulated our moral obligation to care for one another while working toward a society that benefits all Americans, not only the affluent and powerful. All of us remember his famous words from the Democratic convention in San Francisco. Questioning conservatives' rose-colored view of the Nation, he noted we were becoming too much a ``tale of two cities,'' rather than a ``shining city on a hill.'' That speech crystallized the differences in competing philosophies between those who believe Americans can do more to help one another and those who think our Nation has already reached its greatest heights and cannot further improve. However, just as he was serving as an intellectual lodestar for progressive and liberals nationally, Mario Cuomo remained dedicated to improving New Yorkers' lives. A son of Queens, in many ways, he reflected the aspirations and dreams of that borough's residents. Today, Queens is where families of all backgrounds--Latinos, Asian, Italian, and Greek immigrants--converge to secure a decent, affordable place to live. In today's political landscape, we could all benefit from remembering those words. In today's cynical environment, many have forgotten the tremendous good our government can achieve in pursuing justice, creating opportunity, and caring for neighbors in need. Governor Cuomo made many contributions, but that may be among his most important. He provided the intellectual framework to remind us that we have more to do, that our Nation can be better, and that we cannot afford to leave our fellow New Yorkers and Americans behind. For ensuring these ideas remain part of our national conversation, all of us owe him a debt and all of us appreciate his decades of steadfast service. I send my thoughts and my prayers to his family, including his son, Governor Andrew Cuomo. I hope they can take comfort in knowing that all of us join in mourning with them. {time} 2000 Mr. CROWLEY. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlelady from Brooklyn, Queens, and Manhattan. I now yield to the gentlelady from Queens and Manhattan and Brooklyn, Mrs. Carolyn Maloney. Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding and for his leadership in so many ways, and I thank the leader of the Democratic Party for leading us in this tribute to our great Governor. We appreciate very much your presence and support of Mario Cuomo on the floor. It seems only fitting and proper for us to pay tribute to the late Mario Cuomo here in this historic Chamber, here where some of the most powerful and eloquent speakers in our Nation's history have changed the course of human events, not with swords but with words and ideas. Mario Cuomo, the former Governor of New York, the liberal lion of the Empire State, the conscience of the Democratic Party, and a cherished friend, had few peers when it came to making the power of ideas and ideals irresistible forces for good. His faith, his passion, his values, and his unique gifts produced in him an unrivaled ability to articulate the plight, defend the rights, and engage the hopes of ordinary citizens. I had the great fortune to be a delegate when he gave one of the most storied speeches at the National Democratic Convention in 1984. I will never forget it. When Mario Cuomo spoke, it electrified the whole convention. We were transfixed by the power of his appeal right to the deepest reaches of our common humanity. He made all of us feel like we needed to do more, work harder, and help others because that is what really came through when Mario Cuomo spoke: his deep, unwavering commitment to fundamental decency, justice, and humanity. He spoke to a sitting President on behalf of the forgotten and the dispossessed. He spoke to the powerful on behalf of the powerless. ``There is despair,'' he said, ``in the faces you don't see and the places you don't visit.'' Mario Cuomo was right. He spent his life working and looking out for the hardworking people who build our shining cities, who supply our food, who teach our children, who staff our hospitals, people who are too often overworked, overlooked, and underserved. His own family had owned a store in Jamaica, Queens, and he knew full well the value of hard work and of education. He lived the American Dream and spent his life trying to build the American Dream for others. Mario Cuomo worked his way into St. John's University. He attended St. John's University School of Law in New York and graduated first in his class. He first rose to public attention when he came roaring out of Queens back in the 1970s to challenge city hall's condemnation of a working class neighborhood in Corona. People quickly began to appreciate that Mario Cuomo had the transformative power to inspire others to demand for themselves a more just and humane society and a better government. He insisted that representative government should be just that: a government for all the people. Whenever he was on the ballot--and I remember as an active Democrat then--Democrat registration went up because everybody wanted to vote for and help elect Mario Cuomo. They knew he would do everything in his power to give them a fair shake. He once told me--and I always had these terrible elections. He would always tell me that he was my fairy godfather, and he would grant me three wishes to win the election, but only on one condition, that I would go out and grant three wishes to someone else and help them do a better job in what they wanted to do. He was a wonderful friend and a mentor, a husband, a wonderful father. As a parent, there is no question he did a remarkable job. One son is a Governor, another is a news anchor, one daughter [[Page H212]] is a physician, another active in continuing the family work in housing the homeless, and another is an attorney. If that was all that he ever did, that would be plenty for one lifetime. Mario Cuomo did much more. He was secretary of state of the great State of New York, then Lieutenant Governor, and finally Governor for three terms. He led New York to provide health care for children. He began the Decade of the Child, an effort that used multiple health care and educational strategies to better the lives of our most vulnerable. He passed the child support enforcement bill. Under his leadership, the most intense public health plan in the Nation was put in place to take on the AIDS epidemic. Under Mario Cuomo, New York State became the first State in the Nation to enact a seatbelt law. He was a great man, and I am proud beyond all telling to be able to say that he was a friend, a mentor, and a supporter. I grieve his passing, and I send my most heartfelt condolences to his family and his friends. I shall miss the singular and remarkable man until the end of time. To know him was to love him. Mr. CROWLEY. Mr. Speaker, I now yield to the gentleman from Queens and part of Nassau, Mr. Meeks. Mr. MEEKS. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding. When I think of Governor Mario Cuomo, many talk about his great oratory, many talk about some of the fantastic speeches that he made, but when I think about Mario Cuomo, he didn't just talk the talk; he walked the walk. His speeches were not made just because it was a political gathering or forum. His speeches were made because that is what he truly believed. It came from his heart. It is how he lived his life, and you could see that in how he dealt with his family because that was his foundation. From that foundation, he was able to build--and starting with that little place in Jamaica, Queens, that I am now proud to represent, he looked at Queens and then, by extension, the city of New York and then, by extension, the State of New York as the foundation of which he could make a difference, learning from his growing up with his parents. As a result, you found individuals falling in love with Mario Cuomo, and you could see that by the people that were around him who became completely loyal to him because he had a real great leadership. Once you became infected with the spirit of Mario Cuomo, you continued to stay around him, and you would see in the visuals who were with Mario Cuomo until the day that he died folks loyal to him. In this business in this day and age, sometimes, if you don't have that kind of character, people come, and people go. Lastly, because I know that we have got so many members of the New York delegation that are here that want to speak, let me just say that he was competitive. I can think about those days when--I thank him first because he talked about getting into politics, he allowed me to cut my teeth by appointing me first to the New York State Workers' Compensation Board as a judge, then later appointed me to become the supervising judge in the State, having me going all over the State, and then encouraging me to run for the State assembly and, once I got elected to the State assembly, working very closely with him. Once I got into the assembly, I thought he was a nice guy until you got on the basketball court. How competitive was he on that basketball court? Elbows--I look at some of the players now when they are complaining, et cetera, well, you need to go play old school basketball with Governor Mario Cuomo. I close by saying that I thank God--because he was a very religious man, Mario Cuomo, too, but God could have sent him to California; he didn't. He could have had him in Illinois or in Texas or in Florida; no. We were fortunate because God had him, through his parents, who emigrated from Italy to come to a place where the Statue of Liberty was, who believed ``Give me your tired, give me your weary,'' who believed in family, and we had him in the great State of New York. Thank you, Governor Mario Cuomo. Mr. CROWLEY. Mr. Speaker, I thank my good friend. I now yield to the gentleman from Buffalo, New York (Mr. Higgins). Mario Cuomo was known all over New York State, obviously, as the Governor, but my colleague Brian Higgins knew him well. Mr. HIGGINS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today, along with my colleagues, to honor the life and legacy of Governor Mario Cuomo who passed away on January 1 at the age of 82. When we think of Governor Cuomo, we think of him along with his son-- now Governor Andrew Cuomo--and then his counsel Tim Russert from Buffalo driving in a car, riding from the airport to the Moscone Center in San Francisco, still writing new sections of his historic keynote address at the 1984 Democratic National Convention which catapulted him forever as a prominent figure within the Democratic Party. Less remembered than his speeches but just as admirable were his writings. He wrote extensively on the American Dream his immigrant parents achieved, and the numerous causes that he cared about, ``Diaries of Mario M. Cuomo,'' ``Reason to Believe,'' ``Why Lincoln Matters,'' and ``More Than Words,'' which is a collection of 31 speeches he wrote going back to 1974. As a student of government, a teacher of government, and now as a practitioner, in 2006, I went to see Governor Cuomo, former Governor Cuomo, who was practicing law in Manhattan at a place called Willkie, Farr, and Gallagher. Remember, I had 15 minutes scheduled with him and left 2 hours later. I told him that his writings, going back to 1974, were as relevant today as they were when they were written. They were timeless; they were classics. My favorite story is the one that he told about how he came to edit the book, ``Lincoln on Democracy.'' In 1988, Governor Cuomo met in Albany with a delegation from the teacher section of Poland's Solidarity Union, which was the leading advocate for bringing democracy to Poland when it was under Communist rule. The teachers told the Governor that they were building an archive of influential and insightful writings on democracy. They asked if he could recommend writings by American thinkers that had influenced his approach to public service and democracy. Cuomo immediately identified Abraham Lincoln as his favorite source of wisdom. The Polish delegation said, ``Governor, Lincoln's writings and speeches are not available in Poland.'' In fact, they were banned. Cuomo promised to give them the speeches that they needed in order to appreciate what he had come to appreciate in Lincoln. Cuomo says, ``Delegation, come over here.'' He pulled out the 378- page index of the collected works of Abraham Lincoln--not one mention of democracy in those works; so together with Lincoln scholar Harold Holzer, he wrote, edited, and published ``Lincoln on Democracy,'' a book that to this day is essential reading for anyone wishing to understand the uniquely American approach to democracy and governance. True to his word, the Polish version of the book appeared in Warsaw in early 1990 before its English version was available in the United States. Mario Cuomo's gift was that he forced us to think for ourselves. He forced us to consider our history, and he forced us to recognize our responsibility to build a foundation that is better than the foundation that those who came before us built for us. That is the true meaning of the American Dream, and it was embodied by a unique individual who was an unlikely successful lawyer, an unlikely Governor of New York, Mario M. Cuomo. Mr. CROWLEY. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his comments on Governor Cuomo. I now yield to my colleague and friend from the upstate region, Mr. Paul Tonko, who also served in the State assembly while Mario Cuomo was Governor. Mr. TONKO. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Queens, State of New York, for the opportunity to share some thoughts here this evening with our leader, Nancy Pelosi, and members of the New York delegation, as we pay tribute to the life of Mario Matthew Cuomo, the greatest of Governors in New York, and certainly a true [[Page H213]] statesman, a bold and great individual, a humble giant, and a roaring voice, a lion voice for social, economic, and environmental justice. This evening, what I recall about the life of Mario Cuomo is that as I entered the New York State Assembly in 1983, that was the same year that he entered into the office of Governor, and for my first 12 years of service in the New York State Assembly, it was guided and nurtured and impacted by the strength and the passion of Mario Cuomo. {time} 2015 The walk with him and with Matilda Raffa Cuomo as a first couple of New York was a joyous one but a challenging one to pay tribute to the greatness, the foundation of family, and the passion of immigrants. Those two guiding dynamics drove the principles, the integrity, and the message of Mario Cuomo. As a member of his upstate cabinet informing and alerting the Governor to various strengths, vitalities, contributions, and history of upstate New York, we were able to connect in a very meaningful way; the work with him very deliberate and very challenging. I will forever be grateful for the learning curve that was developed by working alongside this person of greatness. I think, also, we need to understand that, as his son Governor Andrew Cuomo eulogized at his funeral service, he made mention very deliberately, Mario Cuomo would not offer, render his words of speeches to an audience telling them what they choose to hear but, rather, what he needed to share. That, I think, speaks to the humble greatness of this individual, one who had a vision not only for his State, but for his country and, for that matter, the world. I was also touched by the Governor's sharing about his dad, the eloquence of his speech, the eloquence of his speaking, his public speaking that reached so many people throughout the world. He talked about those words and put it into an analogy of a fine bit of jewelry where each word seen as a gem would be deliberately chosen, strategically placed, and majestically clustered in a way where that array would reach our senses, would speak to our senses about what is correct, what is socially just and morally sound. That is true leadership. And it is no wonder through that speech in San Francisco that he lit within the minds, hearts, and souls of Americans the best within us, how we could assume this level of greatness by understanding that we are at our best when we incorporate in an inclusive set of principles in our world of politics. Mario Cuomo impacted all of us, myself included, by his reverence for his parents' journey as immigrants. That journey, which was a pathway to freedom, that journey which settled into a grocery story, a corner grocery store, became the pulse of the American Dream for his family that was tethered into this country called the United States of America. He never forgot that. He revered it. He was guided by it. The light that he brought to his field of politics was immense, and it was driven by fairness and inclusion. So this evening, it is an honor to join with my colleagues to speak to a humble man, a great individual, who, with his wife alongside him, Matilda, brought to this State of New York a sense of hope when there was despair. As was said at the funeral, he will continue to live. His voice may have been silenced, but his integrity, his spirit, and his principles will long live in the lives of those who struggle and reach to America, to her government, for a better tomorrow. May he rest in peace. Mr. CROWLEY. I thank the gentleman. Mr. Speaker, at this time, I ask the gentleman from Brooklyn and from Queens, Mr. Jeffries, for his comments. Mr. JEFFRIES. I thank my good friend, the distinguished gentleman from Queens, for anchoring this Special Order hour and for yielding a few moments for me to reflect on the passing of our great Governor, Mario Cuomo. Mr. Speaker, like many other members of the New York delegation, I also served in the New York State Assembly. But unlike most, I didn't get the opportunity to serve alongside Governor Mario Cuomo. I arrived several years after he had completed his three terms in office. So I speak today not from the perspective of someone who served in government alongside Mario Cuomo, but as a young man who grew up in Mario Cuomo's New York. What an opportunity to be able to come of age in the 1980s with a Governor, a leader, who articulated such an eloquent vision of equal protection under the law for everyone. What an opportunity to be able to come of age under a Governor who believed in opportunity for everyone, who recognized that New York State's greatest strength was our diversity from every community, every perspective, and every religious background. It was great to be able to come of age and look up at a Governor who, notwithstanding the political potential pitfalls, stood on principle, was ahead of his time as it relates to his firm opposition to the death penalty at a time when that was not a popular position to take. He was a great leader, a charismatic intellectual, a wonderful family man, a tremendous lawyer, and a wonderful statesman and Governor. I can only imagine that when Mario Cuomo arrived up in Heaven he was prepared to get to work. But I think that there was probably a greeting committee that was there at the gates of Heaven, one of whom was FDR, a former Governor of the State of New York, the other of whom was FDR's cousin, Teddy Roosevelt, two former great Governors of the State of New York. And I think they probably ushered Mario Cuomo to a place in front of the throne of glory where Almighty God Himself may have said to Governor Cuomo: Listen, you can take your suit off and put this robe on. Governor Cuomo, you can rest now. You have been faithful over a few things. You can rest now. Well done, My good and faithful servant, well done. Mr. CROWLEY. Well done, my friend from Brooklyn and Queens. Mr. Speaker, I now would like to yield to the gentlewoman from Flushing, Queens, New York, Ms. Grace Meng. Ms. MENG. Thank you to the gentleman for yielding. Mr. Speaker. Governor Mario Cuomo's legacy is important for all of us to remember here in Congress. Although the late Governor Cuomo is most well known nationally as an eloquent orator and bastion of liberalism, he first received public attention for his career creatively merging the values of social justice and access to affordable housing while protecting family values in my home borough of Queens. Governor Cuomo's life is a personal inspiration as he was also raised in Queens and born to immigrant parents. Perhaps it was this background that allowed him to regard himself as a progressive pragmatist who upheld the idea that government should be a positive source for good. This is best seen through Governor Cuomo's advocacy for an activist government that provides shelter for the homeless, work for the idle, and care for the elderly and infirm even in times of austerity. This belief in a dynamic government met some opposition, but Governor Cuomo recognized the crucial safety net and that government investment is the foundation for a strong economy, an understanding that is imperative in today's political and economic climate. As a mom of two young children, I am particularly touched by his launching of the Decade of the Child to enact educational and health care reforms affecting children. He deeply understood that improving children's lives ultimately betters our communities and empowers our future. Under his leadership, New York was the very first State to enact seatbelt laws, and today we continue focusing on making sure that children's toys and car seats are safe and effective. This academic year, New York City implemented universal pre-K, a concept that the late-Governor Mario Cuomo championed and the current Governor Andrew Cuomo aptly budgeted for success. I believe in what Hubert Humphrey said: The moral test of a government is how it treats those who are at the dawn of life, the children; those who are in the twilight of life, the aged; and those who are in the shadow of life, the sick, the needy, and the handicapped. I think that Hubert Humphrey would have found Governor Cuomo to be a [[Page H214]] strong, moral leader and, like the rest of us, would have mourned the loss of an inspired beacon of progressive ideology. I join my colleagues today from the New York delegation in sending condolences and sympathy to the entire Cuomo family, and know that Governor Cuomo's respected legacy will be a blessing to us all. Mr. CROWLEY. I thank the gentlelady for her remarks. I thank all the members of the New York delegation, as well as Ms. Pelosi, the Democratic leader, for their remarks today and remembrance of the great Governor of the State of New York, Mario Cuomo. Mr. Speaker, I had the opportunity at the early age of 15 years of age to be engaged in, really, my first political campaign. My then- Uncle Walter Crowley, who was one of my political idols in life, along with a fellow by the name of Michael Dowd, were in charge of a portion of Queens County in terms of making sure that, I think, the Catholic vote came out for Mario Cuomo during the 1977 race for mayor of New York, which was famously won in that primary by Ed Koch. But that was not the only election that Mario Cuomo--and storied election--that Mario Cuomo was a part of. He had been a part of elections before that, and, lo and behold, in 1982 he once again found himself in a matchup between himself and Ed Koch, and Mario Cuomo prevailing in that statewide election. At 15 years of age, I remember handing out literature at the churches in western Queens and southern Queens, and it really was my entree into a political life. Then, in 1984, as a student at Queens College, I interned in the office of then-Governor Cuomo. And what an experience that was to be working with Bob Sullivan, his storied pollster, but officially, on the official side, was working in the statistics office with Dick Starkey, a former reporter, a storied reporter in New York City; Marty Steadman; to have Tim Russert walk into the room. We all died because Tim Russert just walked into the room. I can remember in 1986 when I was elected to the State assembly how supportive Mario Cuomo was to me as a young man, recommending me to travel around the world with ACYPL, to come here to Washington to get my feet wet as well, to get that Washington sense. I remember being on the second floor in 1988 in the Blue Room, what is known as the Blue Room where the Governor would give his budgets, anticipating his delving into, diving into the 1988 Presidential elections, only to have my heart broken when Mario Cuomo said he would not run in that election. Mario Cuomo was tough. He had one of the biggest hearts I have ever come to know. He had also gone to law school, my Uncle Walter, and there was an intimacy between the Crowleys and the Cuomo family in Queens County politics, one that exists to this day with his son Andrew, as Governor, and my family as well. Mario Cuomo always did the right thing. He always did the right thing. And Mario Cuomo had an incredible magnetism about him. I have never seen, outside of people who are Presidents of the United States, the kind of magnetic sense that Mario Cuomo emitted. People wanted to be around him. Whenever he was publicly out, he was walking in the street or at an event, it was hard to get near Mario Cuomo because everyone wanted to be around Mario Cuomo. I was always nervous around Mario Cuomo, a healthy nervousness, but I was excited to be around him. I always wanted to be around him. I loved the man. I loved him dearly, although I never had enough time to be with him. As Paul Tonko had said at the funeral--and what a beautiful funeral Mario Cuomo had, what an incredibly beautiful funeral--simple, yet elegant. That is how I describe it. His son Andrew and his entire family, how respectful they were of their father. And I think of the people who attended that funeral had to walk away knowing that these children, all of them, were raised so well: Andrew, Margaret, Madeline, Maria, and Christopher. And all their grandchildren, how they behaved. It was just remarkable, just wonderful to see the respect they had for their father and their grandfather, for their in-law. But Andrew had said that his father told him you don't tell people what they want to hear--and I am paraphrasing. He told them you tell them what they need to hear. You told them what you wanted to tell them, the message you wanted to get across. It wasn't always popular, the message of Mario Cuomo; but I do know that people, even when they disagreed with him, they respected him and they admired him because of his tenacity, because he believed in what he was saying. {time} 2030 I think what they respected about him was he was always consistent as well in his thoughts. We will miss Mario Cuomo. Queens County, his home borough, will miss him. The city of New York and the State of New York, and, I think, the country have lost a great statesman, someone who didn't look to the next election but looked to the next great issue that needed to be tackled, not only in New York, because New York in many respects is the leader of State legislators in the country; he was thinking nationally, he was thinking globally as well. Mario Cuomo will forever be one of my heroes, as is Lincoln. Mario Cuomo was bipartisan. He loved Lincoln, a Republican, but was true to his own democratic principles and his party as well. There is not enough time to say everything about him. But, Mr. Speaker, I once again want to thank the delegation for their loyalty this evening and being here for as long as they were, and the indulgence of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 5 (Monday, January 12, 2015)] [House] [Pages H209-H214] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] COMMEMORATING THE LIFE OF MARIO CUOMO The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under the Speaker's announced policy of January 6, 2015, the gentleman from New York (Mr. Crowley) is recognized for the remainder of the hour as the designee of the minority leader. Mr. CROWLEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from California (Ms. Pelosi), the minority leader of the House. Ms. PELOSI. I thank the gentleman for yielding. I thank the distinguished member and longest-serving member--I don't want to say ``senior member''--in the New York delegation for getting us off to a start to sing the praises of Mario Cuomo. It is my honor to join the New York delegation. I feel honored to do so. Four of our children were born in New York, so that gives me some standing on the subject. Mr. Speaker, I come to the floor to join the New York delegation in paying tribute to the memory of Governor Mario Cuomo. I am reminded of Ecclesiasticus. We all know this, but just think of how appropriate it is for Mario Cuomo. In Ecclesiasticus, it says: Now let us praise great men, the heroes of our Nation. They led the people by their counsel and their knowledge of the laws. From their font of wisdom, they gave instruction. These are godly men whose righteous deeds have not been forgotten. Their wealth is their descendants, and their inheritance is their children's children. Their bodies are buried in peace, and their names will live forever. The people will tell of their wisdom, and the congregation will continue to sing their praise. Does that remind you of Mario Cuomo? Is that perfectly appropriate for him? Surely, those words apply to the life and legacy of our great departed friend, Mario. As a fellow Italian American, I have always taken great pride in his leadership. As a San Franciscan who hosted the Democratic Convention, we in California had some kind of claim on Mario Cuomo because of the great speech that he made at that convention which Mr. Rangel referenced, but my observing of his greatness goes farther back than that. It was during a trip to Italy that we were invited by President Carter in 1980 to bring the sympathy and support of the American people to Italy at the time of the earthquake, when they lost 2,700 lives and which left 265,000 people homeless. I mention that because we went by helicopter from village to village to village. Villages were devastated. Mario Cuomo, here was this person who had such a large spirit and a good soul, who could sympathize with these people in English and Italian. For example, in a village where a First Communion class was rehearsing for First Communion, all of the 7-year-olds in that village were in that church when the earthquake hit. The roof came down, and every 7-year-old in the village was lost. Imagine the grief of those individual families and of that community to lose those children, but as you would expect, he was up to the task, knowing that words were completely inadequate and that no sympathy could meet the pain that they were feeling; nonetheless, there was this beautiful, sympathetic man identifying with these people from a region from which his family had come in southern Italy. Mario Cuomo was a pillar of strength through his community, his State, and our Nation. His values, his vision, and his effectiveness for the people of New York were an inspiration around the world. He was a man of principle and eloquence--that was good--and all the world saw, again, that manifested in the ``shining city on a hill'' speech at the 1984 Democratic Convention. With those soaring words, Governor Cuomo summoned the best of America and called us to empower the working people and middle class families who are the backbone of our Nation. He asked us to remember how futures are built. We know Mario Cuomo's language and leadership will echo through the ages just as vital, just as urgent, just as energizing as his words were that day. In word and deed, Governor Cuomo challenged us to make real the American Dream. He had it for his family. He wanted it for everyone else, for all who strived to realize it, and opened the doors of opportunity for every American family. Family meant everything to him. He was a proud Governor of New York for three terms, but his proudest achievement was his beautiful family. No one could miss the pride and inspiration he found in his immigrant parents and how he talked about them so beautifully or in his boundless dedication to Matilda and his children. Our country has lost a great leader, but his family has lost a devoted husband to his wife of over 60 years, to Matilda. He was a loving father to five children--Margaret, Andrew, Maria, Madeline, and Christopher--and was a doting grandfather to some really lovely grandchildren. My husband, Paul, and I and our entire family are heartbroken. We are really heartbroken by his passing, and we continue to extend our deepest sympathy and love to Matilda and their family. I hope it is a comfort to them that so many people in their own State, in the country, and, really, throughout the world mourn their loss and continue to pray for them and continue to be inspired by this great man. As Ecclesiasticus says: People will tell of his wisdom, and the congregation will continue to sing his praise. I thank Mr. Crowley for yielding. I thank him for bringing us together to sing the praises of Mario Cuomo. Mr. CROWLEY. Thank you. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Rochester, New York, Louise Slaughter. Ms. SLAUGHTER. I thank Mr. Crowley for yielding to me. There is so much on my mind as to what I could say about him. I knew him longer than the rest of the New Yorkers. I met him in 1973. I was a member of the Democratic State committee in Rochester, New York, and I was asked by the district attorney to come over to his house and meet a man from New York City who was thinking about running for Governor; so I joined my friends and sat in the [[Page H210]] living room for about an hour, awaiting the guest from New York to get off the telephone in the kitchen and come out and talk to us. He came out. He was perfectly charming, but he didn't know upstate New York. He started by telling us: ``A lot of people are talking to me about running for Governor, and I thought it would be a good idea if I came up here to see what all of you thought.'' I left the house that night, and I said to my friend that I was driving with: ``He is really a nice guy, and he is very smart, but, boy, he needs a lot of help.'' I was really pretty lucky, I think, that I got to do that. As it turns out, Governor Carey ran for Governor at that time, and Mr. Cuomo was appointed secretary of state. He had some great ideas for upstate New York. One of them was they were going to have an upstate coordinator, which is kind of an amorphous title, but I was very blessed that he let me try that job. I had been out of the workforce. I was home. My youngest child was about 12 years old. It was back in the day when one income could bring up a family and educate them. {time} 1945 And so trying to get back into work and to get back into all of that was pretty difficult for me. And I am not sure anybody else would have put up with me, other than Mario Cuomo, giving me every opportunity in the world to try to learn what it is we were trying to do. But, boy, did I ever teach him a few things. We had an old State car, a rattletrap. I drove him all over upstate New York, and the conversations we had would absolutely astound you. We stopped one day in one of our beautiful rural villages in upstate named Pavilion to get a cup of coffee. And a 16-year-old girl came out to wait on us. And here he was: a new person to speak to. Now, those of you who knew him know how exciting that would be. And he started in by asking her, What was the main business in Pavilion? What was the gross domestic product there? He was asking her all these questions. And all she wanted to do was get him a cup of coffee. And I felt a little sorry for her, so I said, ``He is the secretary of state.'' Unfortunately, I forgot the part to say secretary of state of New York. She went back into the kitchen, knowing this man was not Henry Kissinger, and never came back out. And as we rode around in this old red car, he would ask me about the cornfields. And I will tell you, if my agriculture people knew what a botch I made of trying to explain to him the life of the cornstalk, it was really awful. And he would say things like, How do they heat that house over there? What do you think they do? Where do they all go to school? Everything in the world interested him. He was the most extraordinary teacher that I have ever had. I just had those 2 years of showing him upstate New York. And then when he got elected lieutenant governor--I ran that upstate campaign--the State Police took over. But we still carried on all these great conversations we had. And I remember one of the policemen said once that no matter how upset Mario was, when he got off the plane and would go 10 miles or 10 rounds with Louise, they were off on a whole other subject. I learned so much from him. And I know that everybody thinks of him as a one-speech maker sort of a--but let me tell you, that was not it. The speech that he made at Notre Dame was so incredibly wonderful and so important and so instructive that everybody should read that as well. But one of my very favorites was when he made his speech about my hometown of Rochester on Lake Ontario. He described Rochester as a necklace of neighborhoods clustered around the lake. Now that is talking. And he also talked about life, that our life needed to be more than to just hope always to land on the safe squares. And we thought that was such an incredible thing to think about, that your life had to have more meaning than that. The people that we worked with at the secretary of state's office who were holdovers from the previous administration had said to me many, many times how wonderful it was for them to be able to work for such a first-rate lawyer. And believe me, he really was. He loved the country, as Nancy Pelosi pointed out. His love of his family was absolutely legendary. He was a man of deep conviction, of religious faith, who loved his family more than anything. But he also loved the great opportunity that this country had given to him. He talked so admiringly of his father and the strength that his father and mother had, coming here with literally nothing. And it was the manual labor that his father did to lift himself up and, consequently, his family to a better life, and the country. He loved New York. He loved its people. He loved its history more than anything. He loved the institution of governing. So I speak of him as somebody that maybe other people didn't get to know the way I did, but I admired him always. And I am pretty sure I would not be in elected office at all had I not had the opportunity to learn from him, the wonderful opportunity to represent our neighbors and to come down and to try to make law and to make some changes. So I thank you very much for the time, Mr. Crowley. We will not see his like again. Mr. CROWLEY. I thank the gentlelady. I now yield to the gentleman from the Bronx, Mr. Serrano. (Mr. SERRANO asked and was given permission to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. SERRANO. I thank my colleague, Mr. Crowley. This week in 1975, I became a member of the New York State Assembly. This week in 1975, Mario Cuomo became secretary of state. I left to come to Congress in 1990, so I am fortunate to have served in the legislature 16 of the 20 years that he served in the executive branch. And in 1983, when I became chairman of the Education Committee, I really got to know him and to speak to him and to understand what everyone that has spoken has already said. Above all, this man never forgot, and he understood how important it was for him to be the son of an immigrant family. So he wanted everyone else to have the same opportunity. Yes, he was eloquent. Yes, he had to be a great human being--after all, he was a minor league baseball player and was signed by the Pittsburgh Pirates, I believe, to play ball, that alone makes him a great guy. But he was an eloquent man who also remembered his humble beginnings in the grocery store, having to work to get through law school, to be able to understand. So when I stood in front of him as one who had been born an American citizen--but a lot of people forgot along the way that we were and treated us in a different way--he understood. There was that simpatico that he had with him, where he understood where we came from and what we needed. And I am just so honored to have served all those years with Mario Cuomo and to have considered him a friend. When I went to his funeral, Matilda was just so gracious because she wrote a book once where she asked people to write about who had influenced them. And I wrote about a certain gentleman in the Bronx who had played major role in my starting my public career. And she remembered that. And I, once again, offer my condolences to the Cuomo family. But we should not feel sorry that he is gone. We have been blessed with the fact that he lived among us. And for me, 16 of those 20 years, I learned so much from him, and hopefully I was able to help him along the way at times too. Mr. CROWLEY. I thank my friend from the Bronx. And I yield to the gentleman from Manhattan, Mr. Nadler. Mr. NADLER. I thank the gentleman for yielding. Mr. Speaker, I too came to the legislature and served for 16 years there. And for most of that time, Mario Cuomo was Governor. We all know that he was an eloquent philosopher in politics, someone who could express the goals and the principles of public office and of government more eloquently than almost anyone else. Mario Cuomo graduated first in his class from St. John's Law School in 1946. And despite sending out over 70 resumes, he couldn't get a response or an interview from a top law firm because he was Italian. And that was the [[Page H211]] state of prejudice in this country--or at least on Wall Street in 1946. He went on from there to become a major lawyer, to become the Governor of a State, to become a leader of a philosophy in American politics. But in doing so, he never forgot where he came from. He didn't forget his experiences, and he knew that other people were having similar experiences. He was a man of great principle. He vetoed the death penalty--though he knew that the death penalty was very popular in New York--12 times in a row, and he sustained those vetoes. Having not forgotten where he came from, he always wanted to use government to help defenseless people who needed the help of government, and he did. We all know many of the things he did. I am not going to repeat them here. But I want to just mention a couple of things that didn't get great publicity but that I saw as a member of the legislature. When he became Governor, he set up a commission. I forget the exact title--Commission on Child Support, Commission on Day Care, whatever it was. But every year for years, that commission came up with legislation which he supported and pushed, and some of us in the legislature worked on that. And he passed--we passed pioneering legislation, pioneering in this country on child support enforcement, which was considered a radical idea in the early 1980s. We passed the Child Support Standards Act so that judges couldn't leave women and their children without adequate support. He passed day care resource and referral legislation and family day care, all of which came from the initiatives of Governor Cuomo, none of which got a lot of publicity, which was focused on so- called bigger items. But these helped people. These were vital for people living their lives without a lot of money, without a lot of resources. But government became a helper and a friend because of Governor Cuomo. Mr. CROWLEY. Thank you, Mr. Nadler. I now yield to the gentlelady from Brooklyn, Queens, and Manhattan, Ms. Nydia Velaazquez. Ms. VELAAZQUEZ. I thank the gentleman for yielding. Mr. Speaker, I rise to honor a leader who inspired not only New Yorkers but who also captured the imagination of progressives across the Nation. At a time when our national dialogue was dominated by those seeking to leave working families to fend for themselves, Governor Cuomo outlined a different vision. Through his policies as Governor and his evocative speaking abilities, he articulated our moral obligation to care for one another while working toward a society that benefits all Americans, not only the affluent and powerful. All of us remember his famous words from the Democratic convention in San Francisco. Questioning conservatives' rose-colored view of the Nation, he noted we were becoming too much a ``tale of two cities,'' rather than a ``shining city on a hill.'' That speech crystallized the differences in competing philosophies between those who believe Americans can do more to help one another and those who think our Nation has already reached its greatest heights and cannot further improve. However, just as he was serving as an intellectual lodestar for progressive and liberals nationally, Mario Cuomo remained dedicated to improving New Yorkers' lives. A son of Queens, in many ways, he reflected the aspirations and dreams of that borough's residents. Today, Queens is where families of all backgrounds--Latinos, Asian, Italian, and Greek immigrants--converge to secure a decent, affordable place to live. In today's political landscape, we could all benefit from remembering those words. In today's cynical environment, many have forgotten the tremendous good our government can achieve in pursuing justice, creating opportunity, and caring for neighbors in need. Governor Cuomo made many contributions, but that may be among his most important. He provided the intellectual framework to remind us that we have more to do, that our Nation can be better, and that we cannot afford to leave our fellow New Yorkers and Americans behind. For ensuring these ideas remain part of our national conversation, all of us owe him a debt and all of us appreciate his decades of steadfast service. I send my thoughts and my prayers to his family, including his son, Governor Andrew Cuomo. I hope they can take comfort in knowing that all of us join in mourning with them. {time} 2000 Mr. CROWLEY. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlelady from Brooklyn, Queens, and Manhattan. I now yield to the gentlelady from Queens and Manhattan and Brooklyn, Mrs. Carolyn Maloney. Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding and for his leadership in so many ways, and I thank the leader of the Democratic Party for leading us in this tribute to our great Governor. We appreciate very much your presence and support of Mario Cuomo on the floor. It seems only fitting and proper for us to pay tribute to the late Mario Cuomo here in this historic Chamber, here where some of the most powerful and eloquent speakers in our Nation's history have changed the course of human events, not with swords but with words and ideas. Mario Cuomo, the former Governor of New York, the liberal lion of the Empire State, the conscience of the Democratic Party, and a cherished friend, had few peers when it came to making the power of ideas and ideals irresistible forces for good. His faith, his passion, his values, and his unique gifts produced in him an unrivaled ability to articulate the plight, defend the rights, and engage the hopes of ordinary citizens. I had the great fortune to be a delegate when he gave one of the most storied speeches at the National Democratic Convention in 1984. I will never forget it. When Mario Cuomo spoke, it electrified the whole convention. We were transfixed by the power of his appeal right to the deepest reaches of our common humanity. He made all of us feel like we needed to do more, work harder, and help others because that is what really came through when Mario Cuomo spoke: his deep, unwavering commitment to fundamental decency, justice, and humanity. He spoke to a sitting President on behalf of the forgotten and the dispossessed. He spoke to the powerful on behalf of the powerless. ``There is despair,'' he said, ``in the faces you don't see and the places you don't visit.'' Mario Cuomo was right. He spent his life working and looking out for the hardworking people who build our shining cities, who supply our food, who teach our children, who staff our hospitals, people who are too often overworked, overlooked, and underserved. His own family had owned a store in Jamaica, Queens, and he knew full well the value of hard work and of education. He lived the American Dream and spent his life trying to build the American Dream for others. Mario Cuomo worked his way into St. John's University. He attended St. John's University School of Law in New York and graduated first in his class. He first rose to public attention when he came roaring out of Queens back in the 1970s to challenge city hall's condemnation of a working class neighborhood in Corona. People quickly began to appreciate that Mario Cuomo had the transformative power to inspire others to demand for themselves a more just and humane society and a better government. He insisted that representative government should be just that: a government for all the people. Whenever he was on the ballot--and I remember as an active Democrat then--Democrat registration went up because everybody wanted to vote for and help elect Mario Cuomo. They knew he would do everything in his power to give them a fair shake. He once told me--and I always had these terrible elections. He would always tell me that he was my fairy godfather, and he would grant me three wishes to win the election, but only on one condition, that I would go out and grant three wishes to someone else and help them do a better job in what they wanted to do. He was a wonderful friend and a mentor, a husband, a wonderful father. As a parent, there is no question he did a remarkable job. One son is a Governor, another is a news anchor, one daughter [[Page H212]] is a physician, another active in continuing the family work in housing the homeless, and another is an attorney. If that was all that he ever did, that would be plenty for one lifetime. Mario Cuomo did much more. He was secretary of state of the great State of New York, then Lieutenant Governor, and finally Governor for three terms. He led New York to provide health care for children. He began the Decade of the Child, an effort that used multiple health care and educational strategies to better the lives of our most vulnerable. He passed the child support enforcement bill. Under his leadership, the most intense public health plan in the Nation was put in place to take on the AIDS epidemic. Under Mario Cuomo, New York State became the first State in the Nation to enact a seatbelt law. He was a great man, and I am proud beyond all telling to be able to say that he was a friend, a mentor, and a supporter. I grieve his passing, and I send my most heartfelt condolences to his family and his friends. I shall miss the singular and remarkable man until the end of time. To know him was to love him. Mr. CROWLEY. Mr. Speaker, I now yield to the gentleman from Queens and part of Nassau, Mr. Meeks. Mr. MEEKS. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding. When I think of Governor Mario Cuomo, many talk about his great oratory, many talk about some of the fantastic speeches that he made, but when I think about Mario Cuomo, he didn't just talk the talk; he walked the walk. His speeches were not made just because it was a political gathering or forum. His speeches were made because that is what he truly believed. It came from his heart. It is how he lived his life, and you could see that in how he dealt with his family because that was his foundation. From that foundation, he was able to build--and starting with that little place in Jamaica, Queens, that I am now proud to represent, he looked at Queens and then, by extension, the city of New York and then, by extension, the State of New York as the foundation of which he could make a difference, learning from his growing up with his parents. As a result, you found individuals falling in love with Mario Cuomo, and you could see that by the people that were around him who became completely loyal to him because he had a real great leadership. Once you became infected with the spirit of Mario Cuomo, you continued to stay around him, and you would see in the visuals who were with Mario Cuomo until the day that he died folks loyal to him. In this business in this day and age, sometimes, if you don't have that kind of character, people come, and people go. Lastly, because I know that we have got so many members of the New York delegation that are here that want to speak, let me just say that he was competitive. I can think about those days when--I thank him first because he talked about getting into politics, he allowed me to cut my teeth by appointing me first to the New York State Workers' Compensation Board as a judge, then later appointed me to become the supervising judge in the State, having me going all over the State, and then encouraging me to run for the State assembly and, once I got elected to the State assembly, working very closely with him. Once I got into the assembly, I thought he was a nice guy until you got on the basketball court. How competitive was he on that basketball court? Elbows--I look at some of the players now when they are complaining, et cetera, well, you need to go play old school basketball with Governor Mario Cuomo. I close by saying that I thank God--because he was a very religious man, Mario Cuomo, too, but God could have sent him to California; he didn't. He could have had him in Illinois or in Texas or in Florida; no. We were fortunate because God had him, through his parents, who emigrated from Italy to come to a place where the Statue of Liberty was, who believed ``Give me your tired, give me your weary,'' who believed in family, and we had him in the great State of New York. Thank you, Governor Mario Cuomo. Mr. CROWLEY. Mr. Speaker, I thank my good friend. I now yield to the gentleman from Buffalo, New York (Mr. Higgins). Mario Cuomo was known all over New York State, obviously, as the Governor, but my colleague Brian Higgins knew him well. Mr. HIGGINS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today, along with my colleagues, to honor the life and legacy of Governor Mario Cuomo who passed away on January 1 at the age of 82. When we think of Governor Cuomo, we think of him along with his son-- now Governor Andrew Cuomo--and then his counsel Tim Russert from Buffalo driving in a car, riding from the airport to the Moscone Center in San Francisco, still writing new sections of his historic keynote address at the 1984 Democratic National Convention which catapulted him forever as a prominent figure within the Democratic Party. Less remembered than his speeches but just as admirable were his writings. He wrote extensively on the American Dream his immigrant parents achieved, and the numerous causes that he cared about, ``Diaries of Mario M. Cuomo,'' ``Reason to Believe,'' ``Why Lincoln Matters,'' and ``More Than Words,'' which is a collection of 31 speeches he wrote going back to 1974. As a student of government, a teacher of government, and now as a practitioner, in 2006, I went to see Governor Cuomo, former Governor Cuomo, who was practicing law in Manhattan at a place called Willkie, Farr, and Gallagher. Remember, I had 15 minutes scheduled with him and left 2 hours later. I told him that his writings, going back to 1974, were as relevant today as they were when they were written. They were timeless; they were classics. My favorite story is the one that he told about how he came to edit the book, ``Lincoln on Democracy.'' In 1988, Governor Cuomo met in Albany with a delegation from the teacher section of Poland's Solidarity Union, which was the leading advocate for bringing democracy to Poland when it was under Communist rule. The teachers told the Governor that they were building an archive of influential and insightful writings on democracy. They asked if he could recommend writings by American thinkers that had influenced his approach to public service and democracy. Cuomo immediately identified Abraham Lincoln as his favorite source of wisdom. The Polish delegation said, ``Governor, Lincoln's writings and speeches are not available in Poland.'' In fact, they were banned. Cuomo promised to give them the speeches that they needed in order to appreciate what he had come to appreciate in Lincoln. Cuomo says, ``Delegation, come over here.'' He pulled out the 378- page index of the collected works of Abraham Lincoln--not one mention of democracy in those works; so together with Lincoln scholar Harold Holzer, he wrote, edited, and published ``Lincoln on Democracy,'' a book that to this day is essential reading for anyone wishing to understand the uniquely American approach to democracy and governance. True to his word, the Polish version of the book appeared in Warsaw in early 1990 before its English version was available in the United States. Mario Cuomo's gift was that he forced us to think for ourselves. He forced us to consider our history, and he forced us to recognize our responsibility to build a foundation that is better than the foundation that those who came before us built for us. That is the true meaning of the American Dream, and it was embodied by a unique individual who was an unlikely successful lawyer, an unlikely Governor of New York, Mario M. Cuomo. Mr. CROWLEY. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his comments on Governor Cuomo. I now yield to my colleague and friend from the upstate region, Mr. Paul Tonko, who also served in the State assembly while Mario Cuomo was Governor. Mr. TONKO. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Queens, State of New York, for the opportunity to share some thoughts here this evening with our leader, Nancy Pelosi, and members of the New York delegation, as we pay tribute to the life of Mario Matthew Cuomo, the greatest of Governors in New York, and certainly a true [[Page H213]] statesman, a bold and great individual, a humble giant, and a roaring voice, a lion voice for social, economic, and environmental justice. This evening, what I recall about the life of Mario Cuomo is that as I entered the New York State Assembly in 1983, that was the same year that he entered into the office of Governor, and for my first 12 years of service in the New York State Assembly, it was guided and nurtured and impacted by the strength and the passion of Mario Cuomo. {time} 2015 The walk with him and with Matilda Raffa Cuomo as a first couple of New York was a joyous one but a challenging one to pay tribute to the greatness, the foundation of family, and the passion of immigrants. Those two guiding dynamics drove the principles, the integrity, and the message of Mario Cuomo. As a member of his upstate cabinet informing and alerting the Governor to various strengths, vitalities, contributions, and history of upstate New York, we were able to connect in a very meaningful way; the work with him very deliberate and very challenging. I will forever be grateful for the learning curve that was developed by working alongside this person of greatness. I think, also, we need to understand that, as his son Governor Andrew Cuomo eulogized at his funeral service, he made mention very deliberately, Mario Cuomo would not offer, render his words of speeches to an audience telling them what they choose to hear but, rather, what he needed to share. That, I think, speaks to the humble greatness of this individual, one who had a vision not only for his State, but for his country and, for that matter, the world. I was also touched by the Governor's sharing about his dad, the eloquence of his speech, the eloquence of his speaking, his public speaking that reached so many people throughout the world. He talked about those words and put it into an analogy of a fine bit of jewelry where each word seen as a gem would be deliberately chosen, strategically placed, and majestically clustered in a way where that array would reach our senses, would speak to our senses about what is correct, what is socially just and morally sound. That is true leadership. And it is no wonder through that speech in San Francisco that he lit within the minds, hearts, and souls of Americans the best within us, how we could assume this level of greatness by understanding that we are at our best when we incorporate in an inclusive set of principles in our world of politics. Mario Cuomo impacted all of us, myself included, by his reverence for his parents' journey as immigrants. That journey, which was a pathway to freedom, that journey which settled into a grocery story, a corner grocery store, became the pulse of the American Dream for his family that was tethered into this country called the United States of America. He never forgot that. He revered it. He was guided by it. The light that he brought to his field of politics was immense, and it was driven by fairness and inclusion. So this evening, it is an honor to join with my colleagues to speak to a humble man, a great individual, who, with his wife alongside him, Matilda, brought to this State of New York a sense of hope when there was despair. As was said at the funeral, he will continue to live. His voice may have been silenced, but his integrity, his spirit, and his principles will long live in the lives of those who struggle and reach to America, to her government, for a better tomorrow. May he rest in peace. Mr. CROWLEY. I thank the gentleman. Mr. Speaker, at this time, I ask the gentleman from Brooklyn and from Queens, Mr. Jeffries, for his comments. Mr. JEFFRIES. I thank my good friend, the distinguished gentleman from Queens, for anchoring this Special Order hour and for yielding a few moments for me to reflect on the passing of our great Governor, Mario Cuomo. Mr. Speaker, like many other members of the New York delegation, I also served in the New York State Assembly. But unlike most, I didn't get the opportunity to serve alongside Governor Mario Cuomo. I arrived several years after he had completed his three terms in office. So I speak today not from the perspective of someone who served in government alongside Mario Cuomo, but as a young man who grew up in Mario Cuomo's New York. What an opportunity to be able to come of age in the 1980s with a Governor, a leader, who articulated such an eloquent vision of equal protection under the law for everyone. What an opportunity to be able to come of age under a Governor who believed in opportunity for everyone, who recognized that New York State's greatest strength was our diversity from every community, every perspective, and every religious background. It was great to be able to come of age and look up at a Governor who, notwithstanding the political potential pitfalls, stood on principle, was ahead of his time as it relates to his firm opposition to the death penalty at a time when that was not a popular position to take. He was a great leader, a charismatic intellectual, a wonderful family man, a tremendous lawyer, and a wonderful statesman and Governor. I can only imagine that when Mario Cuomo arrived up in Heaven he was prepared to get to work. But I think that there was probably a greeting committee that was there at the gates of Heaven, one of whom was FDR, a former Governor of the State of New York, the other of whom was FDR's cousin, Teddy Roosevelt, two former great Governors of the State of New York. And I think they probably ushered Mario Cuomo to a place in front of the throne of glory where Almighty God Himself may have said to Governor Cuomo: Listen, you can take your suit off and put this robe on. Governor Cuomo, you can rest now. You have been faithful over a few things. You can rest now. Well done, My good and faithful servant, well done. Mr. CROWLEY. Well done, my friend from Brooklyn and Queens. Mr. Speaker, I now would like to yield to the gentlewoman from Flushing, Queens, New York, Ms. Grace Meng. Ms. MENG. Thank you to the gentleman for yielding. Mr. Speaker. Governor Mario Cuomo's legacy is important for all of us to remember here in Congress. Although the late Governor Cuomo is most well known nationally as an eloquent orator and bastion of liberalism, he first received public attention for his career creatively merging the values of social justice and access to affordable housing while protecting family values in my home borough of Queens. Governor Cuomo's life is a personal inspiration as he was also raised in Queens and born to immigrant parents. Perhaps it was this background that allowed him to regard himself as a progressive pragmatist who upheld the idea that government should be a positive source for good. This is best seen through Governor Cuomo's advocacy for an activist government that provides shelter for the homeless, work for the idle, and care for the elderly and infirm even in times of austerity. This belief in a dynamic government met some opposition, but Governor Cuomo recognized the crucial safety net and that government investment is the foundation for a strong economy, an understanding that is imperative in today's political and economic climate. As a mom of two young children, I am particularly touched by his launching of the Decade of the Child to enact educational and health care reforms affecting children. He deeply understood that improving children's lives ultimately betters our communities and empowers our future. Under his leadership, New York was the very first State to enact seatbelt laws, and today we continue focusing on making sure that children's toys and car seats are safe and effective. This academic year, New York City implemented universal pre-K, a concept that the late-Governor Mario Cuomo championed and the current Governor Andrew Cuomo aptly budgeted for success. I believe in what Hubert Humphrey said: The moral test of a government is how it treats those who are at the dawn of life, the children; those who are in the twilight of life, the aged; and those who are in the shadow of life, the sick, the needy, and the handicapped. I think that Hubert Humphrey would have found Governor Cuomo to be a [[Page H214]] strong, moral leader and, like the rest of us, would have mourned the loss of an inspired beacon of progressive ideology. I join my colleagues today from the New York delegation in sending condolences and sympathy to the entire Cuomo family, and know that Governor Cuomo's respected legacy will be a blessing to us all. Mr. CROWLEY. I thank the gentlelady for her remarks. I thank all the members of the New York delegation, as well as Ms. Pelosi, the Democratic leader, for their remarks today and remembrance of the great Governor of the State of New York, Mario Cuomo. Mr. Speaker, I had the opportunity at the early age of 15 years of age to be engaged in, really, my first political campaign. My then- Uncle Walter Crowley, who was one of my political idols in life, along with a fellow by the name of Michael Dowd, were in charge of a portion of Queens County in terms of making sure that, I think, the Catholic vote came out for Mario Cuomo during the 1977 race for mayor of New York, which was famously won in that primary by Ed Koch. But that was not the only election that Mario Cuomo--and storied election--that Mario Cuomo was a part of. He had been a part of elections before that, and, lo and behold, in 1982 he once again found himself in a matchup between himself and Ed Koch, and Mario Cuomo prevailing in that statewide election. At 15 years of age, I remember handing out literature at the churches in western Queens and southern Queens, and it really was my entree into a political life. Then, in 1984, as a student at Queens College, I interned in the office of then-Governor Cuomo. And what an experience that was to be working with Bob Sullivan, his storied pollster, but officially, on the official side, was working in the statistics office with Dick Starkey, a former reporter, a storied reporter in New York City; Marty Steadman; to have Tim Russert walk into the room. We all died because Tim Russert just walked into the room. I can remember in 1986 when I was elected to the State assembly how supportive Mario Cuomo was to me as a young man, recommending me to travel around the world with ACYPL, to come here to Washington to get my feet wet as well, to get that Washington sense. I remember being on the second floor in 1988 in the Blue Room, what is known as the Blue Room where the Governor would give his budgets, anticipating his delving into, diving into the 1988 Presidential elections, only to have my heart broken when Mario Cuomo said he would not run in that election. Mario Cuomo was tough. He had one of the biggest hearts I have ever come to know. He had also gone to law school, my Uncle Walter, and there was an intimacy between the Crowleys and the Cuomo family in Queens County politics, one that exists to this day with his son Andrew, as Governor, and my family as well. Mario Cuomo always did the right thing. He always did the right thing. And Mario Cuomo had an incredible magnetism about him. I have never seen, outside of people who are Presidents of the United States, the kind of magnetic sense that Mario Cuomo emitted. People wanted to be around him. Whenever he was publicly out, he was walking in the street or at an event, it was hard to get near Mario Cuomo because everyone wanted to be around Mario Cuomo. I was always nervous around Mario Cuomo, a healthy nervousness, but I was excited to be around him. I always wanted to be around him. I loved the man. I loved him dearly, although I never had enough time to be with him. As Paul Tonko had said at the funeral--and what a beautiful funeral Mario Cuomo had, what an incredibly beautiful funeral--simple, yet elegant. That is how I describe it. His son Andrew and his entire family, how respectful they were of their father. And I think of the people who attended that funeral had to walk away knowing that these children, all of them, were raised so well: Andrew, Margaret, Madeline, Maria, and Christopher. And all their grandchildren, how they behaved. It was just remarkable, just wonderful to see the respect they had for their father and their grandfather, for their in-law. But Andrew had said that his father told him you don't tell people what they want to hear--and I am paraphrasing. He told them you tell them what they need to hear. You told them what you wanted to tell them, the message you wanted to get across. It wasn't always popular, the message of Mario Cuomo; but I do know that people, even when they disagreed with him, they respected him and they admired him because of his tenacity, because he believed in what he was saying. {time} 2030 I think what they respected about him was he was always consistent as well in his thoughts. We will miss Mario Cuomo. Queens County, his home borough, will miss him. The city of New York and the State of New York, and, I think, the country have lost a great statesman, someone who didn't look to the next election but looked to the next great issue that needed to be tackled, not only in New York, because New York in many respects is the leader of State legislators in the country; he was thinking nationally, he was thinking globally as well. Mario Cuomo will forever be one of my heroes, as is Lincoln. Mario Cuomo was bipartisan. He loved Lincoln, a Republican, but was true to his own democratic principles and his party as well. There is not enough time to say everything about him. But, Mr. Speaker, I once again want to thank the delegation for their loyalty this evening and being here for as long as they were, and the indulgence of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. ____________________","Congressional Record, Volume 161 Issue 5 (Monday, January 12, 2015) [Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 5 (Monday, January 12, 2015)] [House] [Pages H209-H214] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] COMMEMORATING THE LIFE OF MARIO CUOMO The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under the Speaker's announced policy of January 6, 2015, the gentleman from New York (Mr. Crowley) is recognized for the remainder of the hour as the designee of the minority leader. Mr. CROWLEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from California (Ms. Pelosi), the minority leader of the House. Ms. PELOSI. I thank the gentleman for yielding. I thank the distinguished member and longest-serving member--I don't want to say ``senior member''--in the New York delegation for getting us off to a start to sing the praises of Mario Cuomo. It is my honor to join the New York delegation. I feel honored to do so. Four of our children were born in New York, so that gives me some standing on the subject. Mr. Speaker, I come to the floor to join the New York delegation in paying tribute to the memory of Governor Mario Cuomo. I am reminded of Ecclesiasticus. We all know this, but just think of how appropriate it is for Mario Cuomo. In Ecclesiasticus, it says: Now let us praise great men, the heroes of our Nation. They led the people by their counsel and their knowledge of the laws. From their font of wisdom, they gave instruction. These are godly men whose righteous deeds have not been forgotten. Their wealth is their descendants, and their inheritance is their children's children. Their bodies are buried in peace, and their names will live forever. The people will tell of their wisdom, and the congregation will continue to sing their praise. Does that remind you of Mario Cuomo? Is that perfectly appropriate for him? Surely, those words apply to the life and legacy of our great departed friend, Mario. As a fellow Italian American, I have always taken great pride in his leadership. As a San Franciscan who hosted the Democratic Convention, we in California had some kind of claim on Mario Cuomo because of the great speech that he made at that convention which Mr. Rangel referenced, but my observing of his greatness goes farther back than that. It was during a trip to Italy that we were invited by President Carter in 1980 to bring the sympathy and support of the American people to Italy at the time of the earthquake, when they lost 2,700 lives and which left 265,000 people homeless. I mention that because we went by helicopter from village to village to village. Villages were devastated. Mario Cuomo, here was this person who had such a large spirit and a good soul, who could sympathize with these people in English and Italian. For example, in a village where a First Communion class was rehearsing for First Communion, all of the 7-year-olds in that village were in that church when the earthquake hit. The roof came down, and every 7-year-old in the village was lost. Imagine the grief of those individual families and of that community to lose those children, but as you would expect, he was up to the task, knowing that words were completely inadequate and that no sympathy could meet the pain that they were feeling; nonetheless, there was this beautiful, sympathetic man identifying with these people from a region from which his family had come in southern Italy. Mario Cuomo was a pillar of strength through his community, his State, and our Nation. His values, his vision, and his effectiveness for the people of New York were an inspiration around the world. He was a man of principle and eloquence--that was good--and all the world saw, again, that manifested in the ``shining city on a hill'' speech at the 1984 Democratic Convention. With those soaring words, Governor Cuomo summoned the best of America and called us to empower the working people and middle class families who are the backbone of our Nation. He asked us to remember how futures are built. We know Mario Cuomo's language and leadership will echo through the ages just as vital, just as urgent, just as energizing as his words were that day. In word and deed, Governor Cuomo challenged us to make real the American Dream. He had it for his family. He wanted it for everyone else, for all who strived to realize it, and opened the doors of opportunity for every American family. Family meant everything to him. He was a proud Governor of New York for three terms, but his proudest achievement was his beautiful family. No one could miss the pride and inspiration he found in his immigrant parents and how he talked about them so beautifully or in his boundless dedication to Matilda and his children. Our country has lost a great leader, but his family has lost a devoted husband to his wife of over 60 years, to Matilda. He was a loving father to five children--Margaret, Andrew, Maria, Madeline, and Christopher--and was a doting grandfather to some really lovely grandchildren. My husband, Paul, and I and our entire family are heartbroken. We are really heartbroken by his passing, and we continue to extend our deepest sympathy and love to Matilda and their family. I hope it is a comfort to them that so many people in their own State, in the country, and, really, throughout the world mourn their loss and continue to pray for them and continue to be inspired by this great man. As Ecclesiasticus says: People will tell of his wisdom, and the congregation will continue to sing his praise. I thank Mr. Crowley for yielding. I thank him for bringing us together to sing the praises of Mario Cuomo. Mr. CROWLEY. Thank you. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Rochester, New York, Louise Slaughter. Ms. SLAUGHTER. I thank Mr. Crowley for yielding to me. There is so much on my mind as to what I could say about him. I knew him longer than the rest of the New Yorkers. I met him in 1973. I was a member of the Democratic State committee in Rochester, New York, and I was asked by the district attorney to come over to his house and meet a man from New York City who was thinking about running for Governor; so I joined my friends and sat in the [[Page H210]] living room for about an hour, awaiting the guest from New York to get off the telephone in the kitchen and come out and talk to us. He came out. He was perfectly charming, but he didn't know upstate New York. He started by telling us: ``A lot of people are talking to me about running for Governor, and I thought it would be a good idea if I came up here to see what all of you thought.'' I left the house that night, and I said to my friend that I was driving with: ``He is really a nice guy, and he is very smart, but, boy, he needs a lot of help.'' I was really pretty lucky, I think, that I got to do that. As it turns out, Governor Carey ran for Governor at that time, and Mr. Cuomo was appointed secretary of state. He had some great ideas for upstate New York. One of them was they were going to have an upstate coordinator, which is kind of an amorphous title, but I was very blessed that he let me try that job. I had been out of the workforce. I was home. My youngest child was about 12 years old. It was back in the day when one income could bring up a family and educate them. {time} 1945 And so trying to get back into work and to get back into all of that was pretty difficult for me. And I am not sure anybody else would have put up with me, other than Mario Cuomo, giving me every opportunity in the world to try to learn what it is we were trying to do. But, boy, did I ever teach him a few things. We had an old State car, a rattletrap. I drove him all over upstate New York, and the conversations we had would absolutely astound you. We stopped one day in one of our beautiful rural villages in upstate named Pavilion to get a cup of coffee. And a 16-year-old girl came out to wait on us. And here he was: a new person to speak to. Now, those of you who knew him know how exciting that would be. And he started in by asking her, What was the main business in Pavilion? What was the gross domestic product there? He was asking her all these questions. And all she wanted to do was get him a cup of coffee. And I felt a little sorry for her, so I said, ``He is the secretary of state.'' Unfortunately, I forgot the part to say secretary of state of New York. She went back into the kitchen, knowing this man was not Henry Kissinger, and never came back out. And as we rode around in this old red car, he would ask me about the cornfields. And I will tell you, if my agriculture people knew what a botch I made of trying to explain to him the life of the cornstalk, it was really awful. And he would say things like, How do they heat that house over there? What do you think they do? Where do they all go to school? Everything in the world interested him. He was the most extraordinary teacher that I have ever had. I just had those 2 years of showing him upstate New York. And then when he got elected lieutenant governor--I ran that upstate campaign--the State Police took over. But we still carried on all these great conversations we had. And I remember one of the policemen said once that no matter how upset Mario was, when he got off the plane and would go 10 miles or 10 rounds with Louise, they were off on a whole other subject. I learned so much from him. And I know that everybody thinks of him as a one-speech maker sort of a--but let me tell you, that was not it. The speech that he made at Notre Dame was so incredibly wonderful and so important and so instructive that everybody should read that as well. But one of my very favorites was when he made his speech about my hometown of Rochester on Lake Ontario. He described Rochester as a necklace of neighborhoods clustered around the lake. Now that is talking. And he also talked about life, that our life needed to be more than to just hope always to land on the safe squares. And we thought that was such an incredible thing to think about, that your life had to have more meaning than that. The people that we worked with at the secretary of state's office who were holdovers from the previous administration had said to me many, many times how wonderful it was for them to be able to work for such a first-rate lawyer. And believe me, he really was. He loved the country, as Nancy Pelosi pointed out. His love of his family was absolutely legendary. He was a man of deep conviction, of religious faith, who loved his family more than anything. But he also loved the great opportunity that this country had given to him. He talked so admiringly of his father and the strength that his father and mother had, coming here with literally nothing. And it was the manual labor that his father did to lift himself up and, consequently, his family to a better life, and the country. He loved New York. He loved its people. He loved its history more than anything. He loved the institution of governing. So I speak of him as somebody that maybe other people didn't get to know the way I did, but I admired him always. And I am pretty sure I would not be in elected office at all had I not had the opportunity to learn from him, the wonderful opportunity to represent our neighbors and to come down and to try to make law and to make some changes. So I thank you very much for the time, Mr. Crowley. We will not see his like again. Mr. CROWLEY. I thank the gentlelady. I now yield to the gentleman from the Bronx, Mr. Serrano. (Mr. SERRANO asked and was given permission to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. SERRANO. I thank my colleague, Mr. Crowley. This week in 1975, I became a member of the New York State Assembly. This week in 1975, Mario Cuomo became secretary of state. I left to come to Congress in 1990, so I am fortunate to have served in the legislature 16 of the 20 years that he served in the executive branch. And in 1983, when I became chairman of the Education Committee, I really got to know him and to speak to him and to understand what everyone that has spoken has already said. Above all, this man never forgot, and he understood how important it was for him to be the son of an immigrant family. So he wanted everyone else to have the same opportunity. Yes, he was eloquent. Yes, he had to be a great human being--after all, he was a minor league baseball player and was signed by the Pittsburgh Pirates, I believe, to play ball, that alone makes him a great guy. But he was an eloquent man who also remembered his humble beginnings in the grocery store, having to work to get through law school, to be able to understand. So when I stood in front of him as one who had been born an American citizen--but a lot of people forgot along the way that we were and treated us in a different way--he understood. There was that simpatico that he had with him, where he understood where we came from and what we needed. And I am just so honored to have served all those years with Mario Cuomo and to have considered him a friend. When I went to his funeral, Matilda was just so gracious because she wrote a book once where she asked people to write about who had influenced them. And I wrote about a certain gentleman in the Bronx who had played major role in my starting my public career. And she remembered that. And I, once again, offer my condolences to the Cuomo family. But we should not feel sorry that he is gone. We have been blessed with the fact that he lived among us. And for me, 16 of those 20 years, I learned so much from him, and hopefully I was able to help him along the way at times too. Mr. CROWLEY. I thank my friend from the Bronx. And I yield to the gentleman from Manhattan, Mr. Nadler. Mr. NADLER. I thank the gentleman for yielding. Mr. Speaker, I too came to the legislature and served for 16 years there. And for most of that time, Mario Cuomo was Governor. We all know that he was an eloquent philosopher in politics, someone who could express the goals and the principles of public office and of government more eloquently than almost anyone else. Mario Cuomo graduated first in his class from St. John's Law School in 1946. And despite sending out over 70 resumes, he couldn't get a response or an interview from a top law firm because he was Italian. And that was the [[Page H211]] state of prejudice in this country--or at least on Wall Street in 1946. He went on from there to become a major lawyer, to become the Governor of a State, to become a leader of a philosophy in American politics. But in doing so, he never forgot where he came from. He didn't forget his experiences, and he knew that other people were having similar experiences. He was a man of great principle. He vetoed the death penalty--though he knew that the death penalty was very popular in New York--12 times in a row, and he sustained those vetoes. Having not forgotten where he came from, he always wanted to use government to help defenseless people who needed the help of government, and he did. We all know many of the things he did. I am not going to repeat them here. But I want to just mention a couple of things that didn't get great publicity but that I saw as a member of the legislature. When he became Governor, he set up a commission. I forget the exact title--Commission on Child Support, Commission on Day Care, whatever it was. But every year for years, that commission came up with legislation which he supported and pushed, and some of us in the legislature worked on that. And he passed--we passed pioneering legislation, pioneering in this country on child support enforcement, which was considered a radical idea in the early 1980s. We passed the Child Support Standards Act so that judges couldn't leave women and their children without adequate support. He passed day care resource and referral legislation and family day care, all of which came from the initiatives of Governor Cuomo, none of which got a lot of publicity, which was focused on so- called bigger items. But these helped people. These were vital for people living their lives without a lot of money, without a lot of resources. But government became a helper and a friend because of Governor Cuomo. Mr. CROWLEY. Thank you, Mr. Nadler. I now yield to the gentlelady from Brooklyn, Queens, and Manhattan, Ms. Nydia Velaazquez. Ms. VELAAZQUEZ. I thank the gentleman for yielding. Mr. Speaker, I rise to honor a leader who inspired not only New Yorkers but who also captured the imagination of progressives across the Nation. At a time when our national dialogue was dominated by those seeking to leave working families to fend for themselves, Governor Cuomo outlined a different vision. Through his policies as Governor and his evocative speaking abilities, he articulated our moral obligation to care for one another while working toward a society that benefits all Americans, not only the affluent and powerful. All of us remember his famous words from the Democratic convention in San Francisco. Questioning conservatives' rose-colored view of the Nation, he noted we were becoming too much a ``tale of two cities,'' rather than a ``shining city on a hill.'' That speech crystallized the differences in competing philosophies between those who believe Americans can do more to help one another and those who think our Nation has already reached its greatest heights and cannot further improve. However, just as he was serving as an intellectual lodestar for progressive and liberals nationally, Mario Cuomo remained dedicated to improving New Yorkers' lives. A son of Queens, in many ways, he reflected the aspirations and dreams of that borough's residents. Today, Queens is where families of all backgrounds--Latinos, Asian, Italian, and Greek immigrants--converge to secure a decent, affordable place to live. In today's political landscape, we could all benefit from remembering those words. In today's cynical environment, many have forgotten the tremendous good our government can achieve in pursuing justice, creating opportunity, and caring for neighbors in need. Governor Cuomo made many contributions, but that may be among his most important. He provided the intellectual framework to remind us that we have more to do, that our Nation can be better, and that we cannot afford to leave our fellow New Yorkers and Americans behind. For ensuring these ideas remain part of our national conversation, all of us owe him a debt and all of us appreciate his decades of steadfast service. I send my thoughts and my prayers to his family, including his son, Governor Andrew Cuomo. I hope they can take comfort in knowing that all of us join in mourning with them. {time} 2000 Mr. CROWLEY. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlelady from Brooklyn, Queens, and Manhattan. I now yield to the gentlelady from Queens and Manhattan and Brooklyn, Mrs. Carolyn Maloney. Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding and for his leadership in so many ways, and I thank the leader of the Democratic Party for leading us in this tribute to our great Governor. We appreciate very much your presence and support of Mario Cuomo on the floor. It seems only fitting and proper for us to pay tribute to the late Mario Cuomo here in this historic Chamber, here where some of the most powerful and eloquent speakers in our Nation's history have changed the course of human events, not with swords but with words and ideas. Mario Cuomo, the former Governor of New York, the liberal lion of the Empire State, the conscience of the Democratic Party, and a cherished friend, had few peers when it came to making the power of ideas and ideals irresistible forces for good. His faith, his passion, his values, and his unique gifts produced in him an unrivaled ability to articulate the plight, defend the rights, and engage the hopes of ordinary citizens. I had the great fortune to be a delegate when he gave one of the most storied speeches at the National Democratic Convention in 1984. I will never forget it. When Mario Cuomo spoke, it electrified the whole convention. We were transfixed by the power of his appeal right to the deepest reaches of our common humanity. He made all of us feel like we needed to do more, work harder, and help others because that is what really came through when Mario Cuomo spoke: his deep, unwavering commitment to fundamental decency, justice, and humanity. He spoke to a sitting President on behalf of the forgotten and the dispossessed. He spoke to the powerful on behalf of the powerless. ``There is despair,'' he said, ``in the faces you don't see and the places you don't visit.'' Mario Cuomo was right. He spent his life working and looking out for the hardworking people who build our shining cities, who supply our food, who teach our children, who staff our hospitals, people who are too often overworked, overlooked, and underserved. His own family had owned a store in Jamaica, Queens, and he knew full well the value of hard work and of education. He lived the American Dream and spent his life trying to build the American Dream for others. Mario Cuomo worked his way into St. John's University. He attended St. John's University School of Law in New York and graduated first in his class. He first rose to public attention when he came roaring out of Queens back in the 1970s to challenge city hall's condemnation of a working class neighborhood in Corona. People quickly began to appreciate that Mario Cuomo had the transformative power to inspire others to demand for themselves a more just and humane society and a better government. He insisted that representative government should be just that: a government for all the people. Whenever he was on the ballot--and I remember as an active Democrat then--Democrat registration went up because everybody wanted to vote for and help elect Mario Cuomo. They knew he would do everything in his power to give them a fair shake. He once told me--and I always had these terrible elections. He would always tell me that he was my fairy godfather, and he would grant me three wishes to win the election, but only on one condition, that I would go out and grant three wishes to someone else and help them do a better job in what they wanted to do. He was a wonderful friend and a mentor, a husband, a wonderful father. As a parent, there is no question he did a remarkable job. One son is a Governor, another is a news anchor, one daughter [[Page H212]] is a physician, another active in continuing the family work in housing the homeless, and another is an attorney. If that was all that he ever did, that would be plenty for one lifetime. Mario Cuomo did much more. He was secretary of state of the great State of New York, then Lieutenant Governor, and finally Governor for three terms. He led New York to provide health care for children. He began the Decade of the Child, an effort that used multiple health care and educational strategies to better the lives of our most vulnerable. He passed the child support enforcement bill. Under his leadership, the most intense public health plan in the Nation was put in place to take on the AIDS epidemic. Under Mario Cuomo, New York State became the first State in the Nation to enact a seatbelt law. He was a great man, and I am proud beyond all telling to be able to say that he was a friend, a mentor, and a supporter. I grieve his passing, and I send my most heartfelt condolences to his family and his friends. I shall miss the singular and remarkable man until the end of time. To know him was to love him. Mr. CROWLEY. Mr. Speaker, I now yield to the gentleman from Queens and part of Nassau, Mr. Meeks. Mr. MEEKS. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding. When I think of Governor Mario Cuomo, many talk about his great oratory, many talk about some of the fantastic speeches that he made, but when I think about Mario Cuomo, he didn't just talk the talk; he walked the walk. His speeches were not made just because it was a political gathering or forum. His speeches were made because that is what he truly believed. It came from his heart. It is how he lived his life, and you could see that in how he dealt with his family because that was his foundation. From that foundation, he was able to build--and starting with that little place in Jamaica, Queens, that I am now proud to represent, he looked at Queens and then, by extension, the city of New York and then, by extension, the State of New York as the foundation of which he could make a difference, learning from his growing up with his parents. As a result, you found individuals falling in love with Mario Cuomo, and you could see that by the people that were around him who became completely loyal to him because he had a real great leadership. Once you became infected with the spirit of Mario Cuomo, you continued to stay around him, and you would see in the visuals who were with Mario Cuomo until the day that he died folks loyal to him. In this business in this day and age, sometimes, if you don't have that kind of character, people come, and people go. Lastly, because I know that we have got so many members of the New York delegation that are here that want to speak, let me just say that he was competitive. I can think about those days when--I thank him first because he talked about getting into politics, he allowed me to cut my teeth by appointing me first to the New York State Workers' Compensation Board as a judge, then later appointed me to become the supervising judge in the State, having me going all over the State, and then encouraging me to run for the State assembly and, once I got elected to the State assembly, working very closely with him. Once I got into the assembly, I thought he was a nice guy until you got on the basketball court. How competitive was he on that basketball court? Elbows--I look at some of the players now when they are complaining, et cetera, well, you need to go play old school basketball with Governor Mario Cuomo. I close by saying that I thank God--because he was a very religious man, Mario Cuomo, too, but God could have sent him to California; he didn't. He could have had him in Illinois or in Texas or in Florida; no. We were fortunate because God had him, through his parents, who emigrated from Italy to come to a place where the Statue of Liberty was, who believed ``Give me your tired, give me your weary,'' who believed in family, and we had him in the great State of New York. Thank you, Governor Mario Cuomo. Mr. CROWLEY. Mr. Speaker, I thank my good friend. I now yield to the gentleman from Buffalo, New York (Mr. Higgins). Mario Cuomo was known all over New York State, obviously, as the Governor, but my colleague Brian Higgins knew him well. Mr. HIGGINS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today, along with my colleagues, to honor the life and legacy of Governor Mario Cuomo who passed away on January 1 at the age of 82. When we think of Governor Cuomo, we think of him along with his son-- now Governor Andrew Cuomo--and then his counsel Tim Russert from Buffalo driving in a car, riding from the airport to the Moscone Center in San Francisco, still writing new sections of his historic keynote address at the 1984 Democratic National Convention which catapulted him forever as a prominent figure within the Democratic Party. Less remembered than his speeches but just as admirable were his writings. He wrote extensively on the American Dream his immigrant parents achieved, and the numerous causes that he cared about, ``Diaries of Mario M. Cuomo,'' ``Reason to Believe,'' ``Why Lincoln Matters,'' and ``More Than Words,'' which is a collection of 31 speeches he wrote going back to 1974. As a student of government, a teacher of government, and now as a practitioner, in 2006, I went to see Governor Cuomo, former Governor Cuomo, who was practicing law in Manhattan at a place called Willkie, Farr, and Gallagher. Remember, I had 15 minutes scheduled with him and left 2 hours later. I told him that his writings, going back to 1974, were as relevant today as they were when they were written. They were timeless; they were classics. My favorite story is the one that he told about how he came to edit the book, ``Lincoln on Democracy.'' In 1988, Governor Cuomo met in Albany with a delegation from the teacher section of Poland's Solidarity Union, which was the leading advocate for bringing democracy to Poland when it was under Communist rule. The teachers told the Governor that they were building an archive of influential and insightful writings on democracy. They asked if he could recommend writings by American thinkers that had influenced his approach to public service and democracy. Cuomo immediately identified Abraham Lincoln as his favorite source of wisdom. The Polish delegation said, ``Governor, Lincoln's writings and speeches are not available in Poland.'' In fact, they were banned. Cuomo promised to give them the speeches that they needed in order to appreciate what he had come to appreciate in Lincoln. Cuomo says, ``Delegation, come over here.'' He pulled out the 378- page index of the collected works of Abraham Lincoln--not one mention of democracy in those works; so together with Lincoln scholar Harold Holzer, he wrote, edited, and published ``Lincoln on Democracy,'' a book that to this day is essential reading for anyone wishing to understand the uniquely American approach to democracy and governance. True to his word, the Polish version of the book appeared in Warsaw in early 1990 before its English version was available in the United States. Mario Cuomo's gift was that he forced us to think for ourselves. He forced us to consider our history, and he forced us to recognize our responsibility to build a foundation that is better than the foundation that those who came before us built for us. That is the true meaning of the American Dream, and it was embodied by a unique individual who was an unlikely successful lawyer, an unlikely Governor of New York, Mario M. Cuomo. Mr. CROWLEY. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his comments on Governor Cuomo. I now yield to my colleague and friend from the upstate region, Mr. Paul Tonko, who also served in the State assembly while Mario Cuomo was Governor. Mr. TONKO. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Queens, State of New York, for the opportunity to share some thoughts here this evening with our leader, Nancy Pelosi, and members of the New York delegation, as we pay tribute to the life of Mario Matthew Cuomo, the greatest of Governors in New York, and certainly a true [[Page H213]] statesman, a bold and great individual, a humble giant, and a roaring voice, a lion voice for social, economic, and environmental justice. This evening, what I recall about the life of Mario Cuomo is that as I entered the New York State Assembly in 1983, that was the same year that he entered into the office of Governor, and for my first 12 years of service in the New York State Assembly, it was guided and nurtured and impacted by the strength and the passion of Mario Cuomo. {time} 2015 The walk with him and with Matilda Raffa Cuomo as a first couple of New York was a joyous one but a challenging one to pay tribute to the greatness, the foundation of family, and the passion of immigrants. Those two guiding dynamics drove the principles, the integrity, and the message of Mario Cuomo. As a member of his upstate cabinet informing and alerting the Governor to various strengths, vitalities, contributions, and history of upstate New York, we were able to connect in a very meaningful way; the work with him very deliberate and very challenging. I will forever be grateful for the learning curve that was developed by working alongside this person of greatness. I think, also, we need to understand that, as his son Governor Andrew Cuomo eulogized at his funeral service, he made mention very deliberately, Mario Cuomo would not offer, render his words of speeches to an audience telling them what they choose to hear but, rather, what he needed to share. That, I think, speaks to the humble greatness of this individual, one who had a vision not only for his State, but for his country and, for that matter, the world. I was also touched by the Governor's sharing about his dad, the eloquence of his speech, the eloquence of his speaking, his public speaking that reached so many people throughout the world. He talked about those words and put it into an analogy of a fine bit of jewelry where each word seen as a gem would be deliberately chosen, strategically placed, and majestically clustered in a way where that array would reach our senses, would speak to our senses about what is correct, what is socially just and morally sound. That is true leadership. And it is no wonder through that speech in San Francisco that he lit within the minds, hearts, and souls of Americans the best within us, how we could assume this level of greatness by understanding that we are at our best when we incorporate in an inclusive set of principles in our world of politics. Mario Cuomo impacted all of us, myself included, by his reverence for his parents' journey as immigrants. That journey, which was a pathway to freedom, that journey which settled into a grocery story, a corner grocery store, became the pulse of the American Dream for his family that was tethered into this country called the United States of America. He never forgot that. He revered it. He was guided by it. The light that he brought to his field of politics was immense, and it was driven by fairness and inclusion. So this evening, it is an honor to join with my colleagues to speak to a humble man, a great individual, who, with his wife alongside him, Matilda, brought to this State of New York a sense of hope when there was despair. As was said at the funeral, he will continue to live. His voice may have been silenced, but his integrity, his spirit, and his principles will long live in the lives of those who struggle and reach to America, to her government, for a better tomorrow. May he rest in peace. Mr. CROWLEY. I thank the gentleman. Mr. Speaker, at this time, I ask the gentleman from Brooklyn and from Queens, Mr. Jeffries, for his comments. Mr. JEFFRIES. I thank my good friend, the distinguished gentleman from Queens, for anchoring this Special Order hour and for yielding a few moments for me to reflect on the passing of our great Governor, Mario Cuomo. Mr. Speaker, like many other members of the New York delegation, I also served in the New York State Assembly. But unlike most, I didn't get the opportunity to serve alongside Governor Mario Cuomo. I arrived several years after he had completed his three terms in office. So I speak today not from the perspective of someone who served in government alongside Mario Cuomo, but as a young man who grew up in Mario Cuomo's New York. What an opportunity to be able to come of age in the 1980s with a Governor, a leader, who articulated such an eloquent vision of equal protection under the law for everyone. What an opportunity to be able to come of age under a Governor who believed in opportunity for everyone, who recognized that New York State's greatest strength was our diversity from every community, every perspective, and every religious background. It was great to be able to come of age and look up at a Governor who, notwithstanding the political potential pitfalls, stood on principle, was ahead of his time as it relates to his firm opposition to the death penalty at a time when that was not a popular position to take. He was a great leader, a charismatic intellectual, a wonderful family man, a tremendous lawyer, and a wonderful statesman and Governor. I can only imagine that when Mario Cuomo arrived up in Heaven he was prepared to get to work. But I think that there was probably a greeting committee that was there at the gates of Heaven, one of whom was FDR, a former Governor of the State of New York, the other of whom was FDR's cousin, Teddy Roosevelt, two former great Governors of the State of New York. And I think they probably ushered Mario Cuomo to a place in front of the throne of glory where Almighty God Himself may have said to Governor Cuomo: Listen, you can take your suit off and put this robe on. Governor Cuomo, you can rest now. You have been faithful over a few things. You can rest now. Well done, My good and faithful servant, well done. Mr. CROWLEY. Well done, my friend from Brooklyn and Queens. Mr. Speaker, I now would like to yield to the gentlewoman from Flushing, Queens, New York, Ms. Grace Meng. Ms. MENG. Thank you to the gentleman for yielding. Mr. Speaker. Governor Mario Cuomo's legacy is important for all of us to remember here in Congress. Although the late Governor Cuomo is most well known nationally as an eloquent orator and bastion of liberalism, he first received public attention for his career creatively merging the values of social justice and access to affordable housing while protecting family values in my home borough of Queens. Governor Cuomo's life is a personal inspiration as he was also raised in Queens and born to immigrant parents. Perhaps it was this background that allowed him to regard himself as a progressive pragmatist who upheld the idea that government should be a positive source for good. This is best seen through Governor Cuomo's advocacy for an activist government that provides shelter for the homeless, work for the idle, and care for the elderly and infirm even in times of austerity. This belief in a dynamic government met some opposition, but Governor Cuomo recognized the crucial safety net and that government investment is the foundation for a strong economy, an understanding that is imperative in today's political and economic climate. As a mom of two young children, I am particularly touched by his launching of the Decade of the Child to enact educational and health care reforms affecting children. He deeply understood that improving children's lives ultimately betters our communities and empowers our future. Under his leadership, New York was the very first State to enact seatbelt laws, and today we continue focusing on making sure that children's toys and car seats are safe and effective. This academic year, New York City implemented universal pre-K, a concept that the late-Governor Mario Cuomo championed and the current Governor Andrew Cuomo aptly budgeted for success. I believe in what Hubert Humphrey said: The moral test of a government is how it treats those who are at the dawn of life, the children; those who are in the twilight of life, the aged; and those who are in the shadow of life, the sick, the needy, and the handicapped. I think that Hubert Humphrey would have found Governor Cuomo to be a [[Page H214]] strong, moral leader and, like the rest of us, would have mourned the loss of an inspired beacon of progressive ideology. I join my colleagues today from the New York delegation in sending condolences and sympathy to the entire Cuomo family, and know that Governor Cuomo's respected legacy will be a blessing to us all. Mr. CROWLEY. I thank the gentlelady for her remarks. I thank all the members of the New York delegation, as well as Ms. Pelosi, the Democratic leader, for their remarks today and remembrance of the great Governor of the State of New York, Mario Cuomo. Mr. Speaker, I had the opportunity at the early age of 15 years of age to be engaged in, really, my first political campaign. My then- Uncle Walter Crowley, who was one of my political idols in life, along with a fellow by the name of Michael Dowd, were in charge of a portion of Queens County in terms of making sure that, I think, the Catholic vote came out for Mario Cuomo during the 1977 race for mayor of New York, which was famously won in that primary by Ed Koch. But that was not the only election that Mario Cuomo--and storied election--that Mario Cuomo was a part of. He had been a part of elections before that, and, lo and behold, in 1982 he once again found himself in a matchup between himself and Ed Koch, and Mario Cuomo prevailing in that statewide election. At 15 years of age, I remember handing out literature at the churches in western Queens and southern Queens, and it really was my entree into a political life. Then, in 1984, as a student at Queens College, I interned in the office of then-Governor Cuomo. And what an experience that was to be working with Bob Sullivan, his storied pollster, but officially, on the official side, was working in the statistics office with Dick Starkey, a former reporter, a storied reporter in New York City; Marty Steadman; to have Tim Russert walk into the room. We all died because Tim Russert just walked into the room. I can remember in 1986 when I was elected to the State assembly how supportive Mario Cuomo was to me as a young man, recommending me to travel around the world with ACYPL, to come here to Washington to get my feet wet as well, to get that Washington sense. I remember being on the second floor in 1988 in the Blue Room, what is known as the Blue Room where the Governor would give his budgets, anticipating his delving into, diving into the 1988 Presidential elections, only to have my heart broken when Mario Cuomo said he would not run in that election. Mario Cuomo was tough. He had one of the biggest hearts I have ever come to know. He had also gone to law school, my Uncle Walter, and there was an intimacy between the Crowleys and the Cuomo family in Queens County politics, one that exists to this day with his son Andrew, as Governor, and my family as well. Mario Cuomo always did the right thing. He always did the right thing. And Mario Cuomo had an incredible magnetism about him. I have never seen, outside of people who are Presidents of the United States, the kind of magnetic sense that Mario Cuomo emitted. People wanted to be around him. Whenever he was publicly out, he was walking in the street or at an event, it was hard to get near Mario Cuomo because everyone wanted to be around Mario Cuomo. I was always nervous around Mario Cuomo, a healthy nervousness, but I was excited to be around him. I always wanted to be around him. I loved the man. I loved him dearly, although I never had enough time to be with him. As Paul Tonko had said at the funeral--and what a beautiful funeral Mario Cuomo had, what an incredibly beautiful funeral--simple, yet elegant. That is how I describe it. His son Andrew and his entire family, how respectful they were of their father. And I think of the people who attended that funeral had to walk away knowing that these children, all of them, were raised so well: Andrew, Margaret, Madeline, Maria, and Christopher. And all their grandchildren, how they behaved. It was just remarkable, just wonderful to see the respect they had for their father and their grandfather, for their in-law. But Andrew had said that his father told him you don't tell people what they want to hear--and I am paraphrasing. He told them you tell them what they need to hear. You told them what you wanted to tell them, the message you wanted to get across. It wasn't always popular, the message of Mario Cuomo; but I do know that people, even when they disagreed with him, they respected him and they admired him because of his tenacity, because he believed in what he was saying. {time} 2030 I think what they respected about him was he was always consistent as well in his thoughts. We will miss Mario Cuomo. Queens County, his home borough, will miss him. The city of New York and the State of New York, and, I think, the country have lost a great statesman, someone who didn't look to the next election but looked to the next great issue that needed to be tackled, not only in New York, because New York in many respects is the leader of State legislators in the country; he was thinking nationally, he was thinking globally as well. Mario Cuomo will forever be one of my heroes, as is Lincoln. Mario Cuomo was bipartisan. He loved Lincoln, a Republican, but was true to his own democratic principles and his party as well. There is not enough time to say everything about him. But, Mr. Speaker, I once again want to thank the delegation for their loyalty this evening and being here for as long as they were, and the indulgence of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. ____________________",package_114_129.csv,44353,44353,44421,"[congressional record volume 161, number 5 (monday, january 12, 2015)] [house] [pages h209-h214] from the congressional record online through the government publishing office [ www.gpo.gov ] commemorating the life of mario cuomo the speaker pro tempore. under the speaker's announced policy of january 6, 2015, the gentleman from new york (mr. crowley) is recognized for the remainder of the hour as the designee of the minority leader. mr. crowley. mr. speaker, i yield to the gentlewoman from california (ms. pelosi), the minority leader of the house. ms. pelosi. i thank the gentleman for yielding. i thank the distinguished member and longest-serving member--i don't want to say ``senior member''--in the new york delegation for getting us off to a start to sing the praises of mario cuomo. it is my honor to join the new york delegation. i feel honored to do so. four of our children were born in new york, so that gives me some standing on the subject. mr. speaker, i come to the floor to join the new york delegation in paying tribute to the memory of governor mario cuomo. i am reminded of ecclesiasticus. we all know this, but just think of how appropriate it is for mario cuomo. in ecclesiasticus, it says: now let us praise great men, the heroes of our nation. they led the people by their counsel and their knowledge of the laws. from their font of wisdom, they gave instruction. these are godly men whose righteous deeds have not been forgotten. their wealth is their descendants, and their inheritance is their children's children. their bodies are buried in peace, and their names will live forever. the people will tell of their wisdom, and the congregation will continue to sing their praise. does that remind you of mario cuomo? is that perfectly appropriate for him? surely, those words apply to the life and legacy of our great departed friend, mario. as a fellow italian american, i have always taken great pride in his leadership. as a san franciscan who hosted the democratic convention, we in california had some kind of claim on mario cuomo because of the great speech that he made at that convention which mr. rangel referenced, but my observing of his greatness goes farther back than that. it was during a trip to italy that we were invited by president carter in 1980 to bring the sympathy and support of the american people to italy at the time of the earthquake, when they lost 2,700 lives and which left 265,000 people homeless. i mention that because we went by helicopter from village to village to village. villages were devastated. mario cuomo, here was this person who had such a large spirit and a good soul, who could sympathize with these people in english and italian. for example, in a village where a first communion class was rehearsing for first communion, all of the 7-year-olds in that village were in that church when the earthquake hit. the roof came down, and every 7-year-old in the village was lost. imagine the grief of those individual families and of that community to lose those children, but as you would expect, he was up to the task, knowing that words were completely inadequate and that no sympathy could meet the pain that they were feeling; nonetheless, there was this beautiful, sympathetic man identifying with these people from a region from which his family had come in southern italy. mario cuomo was a pillar of strength through his community, his state, and our nation. his values, his vision, and his effectiveness for the people of new york were an inspiration around the world. he was a man of principle and eloquence--that was good--and all the world saw, again, that manifested in the ``shining city on a hill'' speech at the 1984 democratic convention. with those soaring words, governor cuomo summoned the best of america and called us to empower the working people and middle class families who are the backbone of our nation. he asked us to remember how futures are built. we know mario cuomo's language and leadership will echo through the ages just as vital, just as urgent, just as energizing as his words were that day. in word and deed, governor cuomo challenged us to make real the american dream. he had it for his family. he wanted it for everyone else, for all who strived to realize it, and opened the doors of opportunity for every american family. family meant everything to him. he was a proud governor of new york for three terms, but his proudest achievement was his beautiful family. no one could miss the pride and inspiration he found in his immigrant parents and how he talked about them so beautifully or in his boundless dedication to matilda and his children. our country has lost a great leader, but his family has lost a devoted husband to his wife of over 60 years, to matilda. he was a loving father to five children--margaret, andrew, maria, madeline, and christopher--and was a doting grandfather to some really lovely grandchildren. my husband, paul, and i and our entire family are heartbroken. we are really heartbroken by his passing, and we continue to extend our deepest sympathy and love to matilda and their family. i hope it is a comfort to them that so many people in their own state, in the country, and, really, throughout the world mourn their loss and continue to pray for them and continue to be inspired by this great man. as ecclesiasticus says: people will tell of his wisdom, and the congregation will continue to sing his praise. i thank mr. crowley for yielding. i thank him for bringing us together to sing the praises of mario cuomo. mr. crowley. thank you. mr. speaker, i yield to the gentlewoman from rochester, new york, louise slaughter. ms. slaughter. i thank mr. crowley for yielding to me. there is so much on my mind as to what i could say about him. i knew him longer than the rest of the new yorkers. i met him in 1973. i was a member of the democratic state committee in rochester, new york, and i was asked by the district attorney to come over to his house and meet a man from new york city who was thinking about running for governor; so i joined my friends and sat in the [[page h210]] living room for about an hour, awaiting the guest from new york to get off the telephone in the kitchen and come out and talk to us. he came out. he was perfectly charming, but he didn't know upstate new york. he started by telling us: ``a lot of people are talking to me about running for governor, and i thought it would be a good idea if i came up here to see what all of you thought.'' i left the house that night, and i said to my friend that i was driving with: ``he is really a nice guy, and he is very smart, but, boy, he needs a lot of help.'' i was really pretty lucky, i think, that i got to do that. as it turns out, governor carey ran for governor at that time, and mr. cuomo was appointed secretary of state. he had some great ideas for upstate new york. one of them was they were going to have an upstate coordinator, which is kind of an amorphous title, but i was very blessed that he let me try that job. i had been out of the workforce. i was home. my youngest child was about 12 years old. it was back in the day when one income could bring up a family and educate them. {time} 1945 and so trying to get back into work and to get back into all of that was pretty difficult for me. and i am not sure anybody else would have put up with me, other than mario cuomo, giving me every opportunity in the world to try to learn what it is we were trying to do. but, boy, did i ever teach him a few things. we had an old state car, a rattletrap. i drove him all over upstate new york, and the conversations we had would absolutely astound you. we stopped one day in one of our beautiful rural villages in upstate named pavilion to get a cup of coffee. and a 16-year-old girl came out to wait on us. and here he was: a new person to speak to. now, those of you who knew him know how exciting that would be. and he started in by asking her, what was the main business in pavilion? what was the gross domestic product there? he was asking her all these questions. and all she wanted to do was get him a cup of coffee. and i felt a little sorry for her, so i said, ``he is the secretary of state.'' unfortunately, i forgot the part to say secretary of state of new york. she went back into the kitchen, knowing this man was not henry kissinger, and never came back out. and as we rode around in this old red car, he would ask me about the cornfields. and i will tell you, if my agriculture people knew what a botch i made of trying to explain to him the life of the cornstalk, it was really awful. and he would say things like, how do they heat that house over there? what do you think they do? where do they all go to school? everything in the world interested him. he was the most extraordinary teacher that i have ever had. i just had those 2 years of showing him upstate new york. and then when he got elected lieutenant governor--i ran that upstate campaign--the state police took over. but we still carried on all these great conversations we had. and i remember one of the policemen said once that no matter how upset mario was, when he got off the plane and would go 10 miles or 10 rounds with louise, they were off on a whole other subject. i learned so much from him. and i know that everybody thinks of him as a one-speech maker sort of a--but let me tell you, that was not it. the speech that he made at notre dame was so incredibly wonderful and so important and so instructive that everybody should read that as well. but one of my very favorites was when he made his speech about my hometown of rochester on lake ontario. he described rochester as a necklace of neighborhoods clustered around the lake. now that is talking. and he also talked about life, that our life needed to be more than to just hope always to land on the safe squares. and we thought that was such an incredible thing to think about, that your life had to have more meaning than that. the people that we worked with at the secretary of state's office who were holdovers from the previous administration had said to me many, many times how wonderful it was for them to be able to work for such a first-rate lawyer. and believe me, he really was. he loved the country, as nancy pelosi pointed out. his love of his family was absolutely legendary. he was a man of deep conviction, of religious faith, who loved his family more than anything. but he also loved the great opportunity that this country had given to him. he talked so admiringly of his father and the strength that his father and mother had, coming here with literally nothing. and it was the manual labor that his father did to lift himself up and, consequently, his family to a better life, and the country. he loved new york. he loved its people. he loved its history more than anything. he loved the institution of governing. so i speak of him as somebody that maybe other people didn't get to know the way i did, but i admired him always. and i am pretty sure i would not be in elected office at all had i not had the opportunity to learn from him, the wonderful opportunity to represent our neighbors and to come down and to try to make law and to make some changes. so i thank you very much for the time, mr. crowley. we will not see his like again. mr. crowley. i thank the gentlelady. i now yield to the gentleman from the bronx, mr. serrano. (mr. serrano asked and was given permission to revise and extend his remarks.) mr. serrano. i thank my colleague, mr. crowley. this week in 1975, i became a member of the new york state assembly. this week in 1975, mario cuomo became secretary of state. i left to come to congress in 1990, so i am fortunate to have served in the legislature 16 of the 20 years that he served in the executive branch. and in 1983, when i became chairman of the education committee, i really got to know him and to speak to him and to understand what everyone that has spoken has already said. above all, this man never forgot, and he understood how important it was for him to be the son of an immigrant family. so he wanted everyone else to have the same opportunity. yes, he was eloquent. yes, he had to be a great human being--after all, he was a minor league baseball player and was signed by the pittsburgh pirates, i believe, to play ball, that alone makes him a great guy. but he was an eloquent man who also remembered his humble beginnings in the grocery store, having to work to get through law school, to be able to understand. so when i stood in front of him as one who had been born an american citizen--but a lot of people forgot along the way that we were and treated us in a different way--he understood. there was that simpatico that he had with him, where he understood where we came from and what we needed. and i am just so honored to have served all those years with mario cuomo and to have considered him a friend. when i went to his funeral, matilda was just so gracious because she wrote a book once where she asked people to write about who had influenced them. and i wrote about a certain gentleman in the bronx who had played major role in my starting my public career. and she remembered that. and i, once again, offer my condolences to the cuomo family. but we should not feel sorry that he is gone. we have been blessed with the fact that he lived among us. and for me, 16 of those 20 years, i learned so much from him, and hopefully i was able to help him along the way at times too. mr. crowley. i thank my friend from the bronx. and i yield to the gentleman from manhattan, mr. nadler. mr. nadler. i thank the gentleman for yielding. mr. speaker, i too came to the legislature and served for 16 years there. and for most of that time, mario cuomo was governor. we all know that he was an eloquent philosopher in politics, someone who could express the goals and the principles of public office and of government more eloquently than almost anyone else. mario cuomo graduated first in his class from st. john's law school in 1946. and despite sending out over 70 resumes, he couldn't get a response or an interview from a top law firm because he was italian. and that was the [[page h211]] state of prejudice in this country--or at least on wall street in 1946. he went on from there to become a major lawyer, to become the governor of a state, to become a leader of a philosophy in american politics. but in doing so, he never forgot where he came from. he didn't forget his experiences, and he knew that other people were having similar experiences. he was a man of great principle. he vetoed the death penalty--though he knew that the death penalty was very popular in new york--12 times in a row, and he sustained those vetoes. having not forgotten where he came from, he always wanted to use government to help defenseless people who needed the help of government, and he did. we all know many of the things he did. i am not going to repeat them here. but i want to just mention a couple of things that didn't get great publicity but that i saw as a member of the legislature. when he became governor, he set up a commission. i forget the exact title--commission on child support, commission on day care, whatever it was. but every year for years, that commission came up with legislation which he supported and pushed, and some of us in the legislature worked on that. and he passed--we passed pioneering legislation, pioneering in this country on child support enforcement, which was considered a radical idea in the early 1980s. we passed the child support standards act so that judges couldn't leave women and their children without adequate support. he passed day care resource and referral legislation and family day care, all of which came from the initiatives of governor cuomo, none of which got a lot of publicity, which was focused on so- called bigger items. but these helped people. these were vital for people living their lives without a lot of money, without a lot of resources. but government became a helper and a friend because of governor cuomo. mr. crowley. thank you, mr. nadler. i now yield to the gentlelady from brooklyn, queens, and manhattan, ms. nydia velaazquez. ms. velaazquez. i thank the gentleman for yielding. mr. speaker, i rise to honor a leader who inspired not only new yorkers but who also captured the imagination of progressives across the nation. at a time when our national dialogue was dominated by those seeking to leave working families to fend for themselves, governor cuomo outlined a different vision. through his policies as governor and his evocative speaking abilities, he articulated our moral obligation to care for one another while working toward a society that benefits all americans, not only the affluent and powerful. all of us remember his famous words from the democratic convention in san francisco. questioning conservatives' rose-colored view of the nation, he noted we were becoming too much a ``tale of two cities,'' rather than a ``shining city on a hill.'' that speech crystallized the differences in competing philosophies between those who believe americans can do more to help one another and those who think our nation has already reached its greatest heights and cannot further improve. however, just as he was serving as an intellectual lodestar for progressive and liberals nationally, mario cuomo remained dedicated to improving new yorkers' lives. a son of queens, in many ways, he reflected the aspirations and dreams of that borough's residents. today, queens is where families of all backgrounds--latinos, asian, italian, and greek immigrants--converge to secure a decent, affordable place to live. in today's political landscape, we could all benefit from remembering those words. in today's cynical environment, many have forgotten the tremendous good our government can achieve in pursuing justice, creating opportunity, and caring for neighbors in need. governor cuomo made many contributions, but that may be among his most important. he provided the intellectual framework to remind us that we have more to do, that our nation can be better, and that we cannot afford to leave our fellow new yorkers and americans behind. for ensuring these ideas remain part of our national conversation, all of us owe him a debt and all of us appreciate his decades of steadfast service. i send my thoughts and my prayers to his family, including his son, governor andrew cuomo. i hope they can take comfort in knowing that all of us join in mourning with them. {time} 2000 mr. crowley. mr. speaker, i thank the gentlelady from brooklyn, queens, and manhattan. i now yield to the gentlelady from queens and manhattan and brooklyn, mrs. carolyn maloney. mrs. carolyn b. maloney of new york. mr. speaker, i thank the gentleman for yielding and for his leadership in so many ways, and i thank the leader of the democratic party for leading us in this tribute to our great governor. we appreciate very much your presence and support of mario cuomo on the floor. it seems only fitting and proper for us to pay tribute to the late mario cuomo here in this historic chamber, here where some of the most powerful and eloquent speakers in our nation's history have changed the course of human events, not with swords but with words and ideas. mario cuomo, the former governor of new york, the liberal lion of the empire state, the conscience of the democratic party, and a cherished friend, had few peers when it came to making the power of ideas and ideals irresistible forces for good. his faith, his passion, his values, and his unique gifts produced in him an unrivaled ability to articulate the plight, defend the rights, and engage the hopes of ordinary citizens. i had the great fortune to be a delegate when he gave one of the most storied speeches at the national democratic convention in 1984. i will never forget it. when mario cuomo spoke, it electrified the whole convention. we were transfixed by the power of his appeal right to the deepest reaches of our common humanity. he made all of us feel like we needed to do more, work harder, and help others because that is what really came through when mario cuomo spoke: his deep, unwavering commitment to fundamental decency, justice, and humanity. he spoke to a sitting president on behalf of the forgotten and the dispossessed. he spoke to the powerful on behalf of the powerless. ``there is despair,'' he said, ``in the faces you don't see and the places you don't visit.'' mario cuomo was right. he spent his life working and looking out for the hardworking people who build our shining cities, who supply our food, who teach our children, who staff our hospitals, people who are too often overworked, overlooked, and underserved. his own family had owned a store in jamaica, queens, and he knew full well the value of hard work and of education. he lived the american dream and spent his life trying to build the american dream for others. mario cuomo worked his way into st. john's university. he attended st. john's university school of law in new york and graduated first in his class. he first rose to public attention when he came roaring out of queens back in the 1970s to challenge city hall's condemnation of a working class neighborhood in corona. people quickly began to appreciate that mario cuomo had the transformative power to inspire others to demand for themselves a more just and humane society and a better government. he insisted that representative government should be just that: a government for all the people. whenever he was on the ballot--and i remember as an active democrat then--democrat registration went up because everybody wanted to vote for and help elect mario cuomo. they knew he would do everything in his power to give them a fair shake. he once told me--and i always had these terrible elections. he would always tell me that he was my fairy godfather, and he would grant me three wishes to win the election, but only on one condition, that i would go out and grant three wishes to someone else and help them do a better job in what they wanted to do. he was a wonderful friend and a mentor, a husband, a wonderful father. as a parent, there is no question he did a remarkable job. one son is a governor, another is a news anchor, one daughter [[page h212]] is a physician, another active in continuing the family work in housing the homeless, and another is an attorney. if that was all that he ever did, that would be plenty for one lifetime. mario cuomo did much more. he was secretary of state of the great state of new york, then lieutenant governor, and finally governor for three terms. he led new york to provide health care for children. he began the decade of the child, an effort that used multiple health care and educational strategies to better the lives of our most vulnerable. he passed the child support enforcement bill. under his leadership, the most intense public health plan in the nation was put in place to take on the aids epidemic. under mario cuomo, new york state became the first state in the nation to enact a seatbelt law. he was a great man, and i am proud beyond all telling to be able to say that he was a friend, a mentor, and a supporter. i grieve his passing, and i send my most heartfelt condolences to his family and his friends. i shall miss the singular and remarkable man until the end of time. to know him was to love him. mr. crowley. mr. speaker, i now yield to the gentleman from queens and part of nassau, mr. meeks. mr. meeks. mr. speaker, i thank the gentleman for yielding. when i think of governor mario cuomo, many talk about his great oratory, many talk about some of the fantastic speeches that he made, but when i think about mario cuomo, he didn't just talk the talk; he walked the walk. his speeches were not made just because it was a political gathering or forum. his speeches were made because that is what he truly believed. it came from his heart. it is how he lived his life, and you could see that in how he dealt with his family because that was his foundation. from that foundation, he was able to build--and starting with that little place in jamaica, queens, that i am now proud to represent, he looked at queens and then, by extension, the city of new york and then, by extension, the state of new york as the foundation of which he could make a difference, learning from his growing up with his parents. as a result, you found individuals falling in love with mario cuomo, and you could see that by the people that were around him who became completely loyal to him because he had a real great leadership. once you became infected with the spirit of mario cuomo, you continued to stay around him, and you would see in the visuals who were with mario cuomo until the day that he died folks loyal to him. in this business in this day and age, sometimes, if you don't have that kind of character, people come, and people go. lastly, because i know that we have got so many members of the new york delegation that are here that want to speak, let me just say that he was competitive. i can think about those days when--i thank him first because he talked about getting into politics, he allowed me to cut my teeth by appointing me first to the new york state workers' compensation board as a judge, then later appointed me to become the supervising judge in the state, having me going all over the state, and then encouraging me to run for the state assembly and, once i got elected to the state assembly, working very closely with him. once i got into the assembly, i thought he was a nice guy until you got on the basketball court. how competitive was he on that basketball court? elbows--i look at some of the players now when they are complaining, et cetera, well, you need to go play old school basketball with governor mario cuomo. i close by saying that i thank god--because he was a very religious man, mario cuomo, too, but god could have sent him to california; he didn't. he could have had him in illinois or in texas or in florida; no. we were fortunate because god had him, through his parents, who emigrated from italy to come to a place where the statue of liberty was, who believed ``give me your tired, give me your weary,'' who believed in family, and we had him in the great state of new york. thank you, governor mario cuomo. mr. crowley. mr. speaker, i thank my good friend. i now yield to the gentleman from buffalo, new york (mr. higgins). mario cuomo was known all over new york state, obviously, as the governor, but my colleague brian higgins knew him well. mr. higgins. mr. speaker, i rise today, along with my colleagues, to honor the life and legacy of governor mario cuomo who passed away on january 1 at the age of 82. when we think of governor cuomo, we think of him along with his son-- now governor andrew cuomo--and then his counsel tim russert from buffalo driving in a car, riding from the airport to the moscone center in san francisco, still writing new sections of his historic keynote address at the 1984 democratic national convention which catapulted him forever as a prominent figure within the democratic party. less remembered than his speeches but just as admirable were his writings. he wrote extensively on the american dream his immigrant parents achieved, and the numerous causes that he cared about, ``diaries of mario m. cuomo,'' ``reason to believe,'' ``why lincoln matters,'' and ``more than words,'' which is a collection of 31 speeches he wrote going back to 1974. as a student of government, a teacher of government, and now as a practitioner, in 2006, i went to see governor cuomo, former governor cuomo, who was practicing law in manhattan at a place called willkie, farr, and gallagher. remember, i had 15 minutes scheduled with him and left 2 hours later. i told him that his writings, going back to 1974, were as relevant today as they were when they were written. they were timeless; they were classics. my favorite story is the one that he told about how he came to edit the book, ``lincoln on democracy.'' in 1988, governor cuomo met in albany with a delegation from the teacher section of poland's solidarity union, which was the leading advocate for bringing democracy to poland when it was under communist rule. the teachers told the governor that they were building an archive of influential and insightful writings on democracy. they asked if he could recommend writings by american thinkers that had influenced his approach to public service and democracy. cuomo immediately identified abraham lincoln as his favorite source of wisdom. the polish delegation said, ``governor, lincoln's writings and speeches are not available in poland.'' in fact, they were banned. cuomo promised to give them the speeches that they needed in order to appreciate what he had come to appreciate in lincoln. cuomo says, ``delegation, come over here.'' he pulled out the 378- page index of the collected works of abraham lincoln--not one mention of democracy in those works; so together with lincoln scholar harold holzer, he wrote, edited, and published ``lincoln on democracy,'' a book that to this day is essential reading for anyone wishing to understand the uniquely american approach to democracy and governance. true to his word, the polish version of the book appeared in warsaw in early 1990 before its english version was available in the united states. mario cuomo's gift was that he forced us to think for ourselves. he forced us to consider our history, and he forced us to recognize our responsibility to build a foundation that is better than the foundation that those who came before us built for us. that is the true meaning of the american dream, and it was embodied by a unique individual who was an unlikely successful lawyer, an unlikely governor of new york, mario m. cuomo. mr. crowley. mr. speaker, i thank the gentleman for his comments on governor cuomo. i now yield to my colleague and friend from the upstate region, mr. paul tonko, who also served in the state assembly while mario cuomo was governor. mr. tonko. mr. speaker, i thank the gentleman from queens, state of new york, for the opportunity to share some thoughts here this evening with our leader, nancy pelosi, and members of the new york delegation, as we pay tribute to the life of mario matthew cuomo, the greatest of governors in new york, and certainly a true [[page h213]] statesman, a bold and great individual, a humble giant, and a roaring voice, a lion voice for social, economic, and environmental justice. this evening, what i recall about the life of mario cuomo is that as i entered the new york state assembly in 1983, that was the same year that he entered into the office of governor, and for my first 12 years of service in the new york state assembly, it was guided and nurtured and impacted by the strength and the passion of mario cuomo. {time} 2015 the walk with him and with matilda raffa cuomo as a first couple of new york was a joyous one but a challenging one to pay tribute to the greatness, the foundation of family, and the passion of immigrants. those two guiding dynamics drove the principles, the integrity, and the message of mario cuomo. as a member of his upstate cabinet informing and alerting the governor to various strengths, vitalities, contributions, and history of upstate new york, we were able to connect in a very meaningful way; the work with him very deliberate and very challenging. i will forever be grateful for the learning curve that was developed by working alongside this person of greatness. i think, also, we need to understand that, as his son governor andrew cuomo eulogized at his funeral service, he made mention very deliberately, mario cuomo would not offer, render his words of speeches to an audience telling them what they choose to hear but, rather, what he needed to share. that, i think, speaks to the humble greatness of this individual, one who had a vision not only for his state, but for his country and, for that matter, the world. i was also touched by the governor's sharing about his dad, the eloquence of his speech, the eloquence of his speaking, his public speaking that reached so many people throughout the world. he talked about those words and put it into an analogy of a fine bit of jewelry where each word seen as a gem would be deliberately chosen, strategically placed, and majestically clustered in a way where that array would reach our senses, would speak to our senses about what is correct, what is socially just and morally sound. that is true leadership. and it is no wonder through that speech in san francisco that he lit within the minds, hearts, and souls of americans the best within us, how we could assume this level of greatness by understanding that we are at our best when we incorporate in an inclusive set of principles in our world of politics. mario cuomo impacted all of us, myself included, by his reverence for his parents' journey as immigrants. that journey, which was a pathway to freedom, that journey which settled into a grocery story, a corner grocery store, became the pulse of the american dream for his family that was tethered into this country called the united states of america. he never forgot that. he revered it. he was guided by it. the light that he brought to his field of politics was immense, and it was driven by fairness and inclusion. so this evening, it is an honor to join with my colleagues to speak to a humble man, a great individual, who, with his wife alongside him, matilda, brought to this state of new york a sense of hope when there was despair. as was said at the funeral, he will continue to live. his voice may have been silenced, but his integrity, his spirit, and his principles will long live in the lives of those who struggle and reach to america, to her government, for a better tomorrow. may he rest in peace. mr. crowley. i thank the gentleman. mr. speaker, at this time, i ask the gentleman from brooklyn and from queens, mr. jeffries, for his comments. mr. jeffries. i thank my good friend, the distinguished gentleman from queens, for anchoring this special order hour and for yielding a few moments for me to reflect on the passing of our great governor, mario cuomo. mr. speaker, like many other members of the new york delegation, i also served in the new york state assembly. but unlike most, i didn't get the opportunity to serve alongside governor mario cuomo. i arrived several years after he had completed his three terms in office. so i speak today not from the perspective of someone who served in government alongside mario cuomo, but as a young man who grew up in mario cuomo's new york. what an opportunity to be able to come of age in the 1980s with a governor, a leader, who articulated such an eloquent vision of equal protection under the law for everyone. what an opportunity to be able to come of age under a governor who believed in opportunity for everyone, who recognized that new york state's greatest strength was our diversity from every community, every perspective, and every religious background. it was great to be able to come of age and look up at a governor who, notwithstanding the political potential pitfalls, stood on principle, was ahead of his time as it relates to his firm opposition to the death penalty at a time when that was not a popular position to take. he was a great leader, a charismatic intellectual, a wonderful family man, a tremendous lawyer, and a wonderful statesman and governor. i can only imagine that when mario cuomo arrived up in heaven he was prepared to get to work. but i think that there was probably a greeting committee that was there at the gates of heaven, one of whom was fdr, a former governor of the state of new york, the other of whom was fdr's cousin, teddy roosevelt, two former great governors of the state of new york. and i think they probably ushered mario cuomo to a place in front of the throne of glory where almighty god himself may have said to governor cuomo: listen, you can take your suit off and put this robe on. governor cuomo, you can rest now. you have been faithful over a few things. you can rest now. well done, my good and faithful servant, well done. mr. crowley. well done, my friend from brooklyn and queens. mr. speaker, i now would like to yield to the gentlewoman from flushing, queens, new york, ms. grace meng. ms. meng. thank you to the gentleman for yielding. mr. speaker. governor mario cuomo's legacy is important for all of us to remember here in congress. although the late governor cuomo is most well known nationally as an eloquent orator and bastion of liberalism, he first received public attention for his career creatively merging the values of social justice and access to affordable housing while protecting family values in my home borough of queens. governor cuomo's life is a personal inspiration as he was also raised in queens and born to immigrant parents. perhaps it was this background that allowed him to regard himself as a progressive pragmatist who upheld the idea that government should be a positive source for good. this is best seen through governor cuomo's advocacy for an activist government that provides shelter for the homeless, work for the idle, and care for the elderly and infirm even in times of austerity. this belief in a dynamic government met some opposition, but governor cuomo recognized the crucial safety net and that government investment is the foundation for a strong economy, an understanding that is imperative in today's political and economic climate. as a mom of two young children, i am particularly touched by his launching of the decade of the child to enact educational and health care reforms affecting children. he deeply understood that improving children's lives ultimately betters our communities and empowers our future. under his leadership, new york was the very first state to enact seatbelt laws, and today we continue focusing on making sure that children's toys and car seats are safe and effective. this academic year, new york city implemented universal pre-k, a concept that the late-governor mario cuomo championed and the current governor andrew cuomo aptly budgeted for success. i believe in what hubert humphrey said: the moral test of a government is how it treats those who are at the dawn of life, the children; those who are in the twilight of life, the aged; and those who are in the shadow of life, the sick, the needy, and the handicapped. i think that hubert humphrey would have found governor cuomo to be a [[page h214]] strong, moral leader and, like the rest of us, would have mourned the loss of an inspired beacon of progressive ideology. i join my colleagues today from the new york delegation in sending condolences and sympathy to the entire cuomo family, and know that governor cuomo's respected legacy will be a blessing to us all. mr. crowley. i thank the gentlelady for her remarks. i thank all the members of the new york delegation, as well as ms. pelosi, the democratic leader, for their remarks today and remembrance of the great governor of the state of new york, mario cuomo. mr. speaker, i had the opportunity at the early age of 15 years of age to be engaged in, really, my first political campaign. my then- uncle walter crowley, who was one of my political idols in life, along with a fellow by the name of michael dowd, were in charge of a portion of queens county in terms of making sure that, i think, the catholic vote came out for mario cuomo during the 1977 race for mayor of new york, which was famously won in that primary by ed koch. but that was not the only election that mario cuomo--and storied election--that mario cuomo was a part of. he had been a part of elections before that, and, lo and behold, in 1982 he once again found himself in a matchup between himself and ed koch, and mario cuomo prevailing in that statewide election. at 15 years of age, i remember handing out literature at the churches in western queens and southern queens, and it really was my entree into a political life. then, in 1984, as a student at queens college, i interned in the office of then-governor cuomo. and what an experience that was to be working with bob sullivan, his storied pollster, but officially, on the official side, was working in the statistics office with dick starkey, a former reporter, a storied reporter in new york city; marty steadman; to have tim russert walk into the room. we all died because tim russert just walked into the room. i can remember in 1986 when i was elected to the state assembly how supportive mario cuomo was to me as a young man, recommending me to travel around the world with acypl, to come here to washington to get my feet wet as well, to get that washington sense. i remember being on the second floor in 1988 in the blue room, what is known as the blue room where the governor would give his budgets, anticipating his delving into, diving into the 1988 presidential elections, only to have my heart broken when mario cuomo said he would not run in that election. mario cuomo was tough. he had one of the biggest hearts i have ever come to know. he had also gone to law school, my uncle walter, and there was an intimacy between the crowleys and the cuomo family in queens county politics, one that exists to this day with his son andrew, as governor, and my family as well. mario cuomo always did the right thing. he always did the right thing. and mario cuomo had an incredible magnetism about him. i have never seen, outside of people who are presidents of the united states, the kind of magnetic sense that mario cuomo emitted. people wanted to be around him. whenever he was publicly out, he was walking in the street or at an event, it was hard to get near mario cuomo because everyone wanted to be around mario cuomo. i was always nervous around mario cuomo, a healthy nervousness, but i was excited to be around him. i always wanted to be around him. i loved the man. i loved him dearly, although i never had enough time to be with him. as paul tonko had said at the funeral--and what a beautiful funeral mario cuomo had, what an incredibly beautiful funeral--simple, yet elegant. that is how i describe it. his son andrew and his entire family, how respectful they were of their father. and i think of the people who attended that funeral had to walk away knowing that these children, all of them, were raised so well: andrew, margaret, madeline, maria, and christopher. and all their grandchildren, how they behaved. it was just remarkable, just wonderful to see the respect they had for their father and their grandfather, for their in-law. but andrew had said that his father told him you don't tell people what they want to hear--and i am paraphrasing. he told them you tell them what they need to hear. you told them what you wanted to tell them, the message you wanted to get across. it wasn't always popular, the message of mario cuomo; but i do know that people, even when they disagreed with him, they respected him and they admired him because of his tenacity, because he believed in what he was saying. {time} 2030 i think what they respected about him was he was always consistent as well in his thoughts. we will miss mario cuomo. queens county, his home borough, will miss him. the city of new york and the state of new york, and, i think, the country have lost a great statesman, someone who didn't look to the next election but looked to the next great issue that needed to be tackled, not only in new york, because new york in many respects is the leader of state legislators in the country; he was thinking nationally, he was thinking globally as well. mario cuomo will forever be one of my heroes, as is lincoln. mario cuomo was bipartisan. he loved lincoln, a republican, but was true to his own democratic principles and his party as well. there is not enough time to say everything about him. but, mr. speaker, i once again want to thank the delegation for their loyalty this evening and being here for as long as they were, and the indulgence of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle. mr. speaker, i yield back the balance of my time. ____________________",44353

Under the Speaker's announced policy of January 6, 2015, the gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. Ros-Lehtinen) is recognized for 60 minutes as the designee of the majority leader. Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, I am so humbled and pleased to see my colleagues who have turned out tonight at this late hour in a bipartisan manner to say that we reject the President's ill-advised treatment of the policy of rapprochement with the Cuban regime, and no one is better able and better equipped to talk about freedom and democracy and our fight for justice than Mr. Chabot. I yield to the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Chabot), a senior member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee and chairman of the House Small Business Committee. Mr. CHABOT. Mr. Speaker, I rise this evening to join with my colleague and friend, Congresswoman Ros-Lehtinen, in opposition to the December 17 announcement by President Obama to change U.S. policy toward Cuba. We will also be joined by some of our other colleagues, and I want to particularly thank Congresswoman Ros-Lehtinen for her leadership on all issues regarding Cuba. She has been a leader on this issue for a long, long time and will continue to be, I am sure. This policy change was a unilateral decision made without consulting Congress and with complete disregard of long-term national security consequences. Similarly, the so-called prisoner exchange was terribly flawed. In 2013, Secretary Kerry stated that swapping convicted Cuban spies for Alan Gross was off the table, testifying before Congress that since Mr. Gross was wrongly imprisoned, there was no equivalency to pursue a spy for spy tradeoff. Let us be clear: the freedom of Alan Gross is welcome news, but this exchange was totally one-sided. It was tragically flawed. It was not in the best interest of the people of the United States, and it was not in the best interest of the people of Cuba. As my colleague, Representative Ros-Lehtinen, has rightly highlighted these past few weeks since the decision and the prisoner exchange occurred, Cuban spies have been responsible for the deaths of American lives. It is absolutely true that they have been. And they have been released. Those are the people who were responsible for American deaths. Cuban patriots who have risked their lives every day to fight for basic rights and freedoms feel betrayed. The exchange was flawed. The policy itself is flawed, and the announcement [[Page H215]] has also let down one of the United States' strongest ally in the world, Israel. Year after year, Israel has stood at the United States' side--one of the very few--supporting the United States at the United Nations in 98 percent of all votes, including votes that the world's worst actors pushed through to condemn the U.S. embargo on Cuba. Unfortunately, those who have long nourished and fostered cozy relationships with Cuba, most notably Russia and Venezuela and various terrorist organizations around the world, are welcoming the policy changes with open arms. We need to be honest about the implications of President Obama's new policy. His unilateral decision to change Cuba policy poses a threat to U.S. national security. If the trade embargo is lifted, money will flow into the hands of the Castro brothers, allowing them to financially support surreptitious espionage activities with terrorist groups like Hezbollah and nations like North Korea. Since the President made his public announcement, nearly 100 Cubans have already been detained. The United States should always stand for democracy and freedom around the world. We should demand that the Castro regime release all political prisoners and hold free and fair elections before establishing diplomatic relations. I once again thank the gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. Ros-Lehtinen) for her leadership in this area for many, many years, and it is an honor to speak this evening with her. Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. I thank the gentleman from Ohio very much, and thank you for looking out for our U.S. national security, and thank you for trying to uphold the values of freedom throughout the world. Mr. Chabot brought up the fact that Mr. Kerry, speaking before our committee, said that we would not release spies for Alan Gross' life. And that came because of a question posed by our next speaker, and I am pleased to yield to the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Sires), the ranking member of the House Subcommittee on the Western Hemisphere. Mr. SIRES. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for allowing me to speak tonight. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to express my disappointment and deep concerns regarding the administration's plan for loosening the sanctions and initiating diplomatic discussions with the Cuban dictatorship. It is naive and misguided to think that this is going to give us the long-desired political and economic changes that the Cuban people deserve. In fact, just a few days after the announcement, Raul Castro made sure to dispel any misgivings and brazenly declared that the regime would not abandon its communist path, let alone loosen its stranglehold over the people of Cuba. I feel that the administration has abandoned all those Cuban people for all those years who fought for human rights and democracy in Cuba. I feel that those people who are still lingering in the Cuban jails are so disappointed in this administration's efforts. You know, the Alan Gross release should have been something joyous. And we all wanted Alan Gross released because he was incarcerated for no reason other than he was foreign. But to release three Cuban spies or a network of spies that exists in this country currently is just not acceptable. Alan Gross should have been released on his own. He did nothing. He just went to Cuba to establish some sort of communication for this community. The other thing that is troubling me, coming from New Jersey, is the fact that there was no discussion about any extradition of the criminals that are currently in Cuba. There are over 100 criminals in Cuba, including Joanne Chesimard, who killed a State trooper in New Jersey point blank 30 years ago. She escaped to Cuba. She has been enjoying the sun, she has been enjoying the beach. Meanwhile, Trooper Werner Foerster's family for over 30 years grew up without a father. And yet we can't seem to get this government to think that it is important that we bring these people to justice. As a matter of fact, the FBI has named Joanne Chesimard as number one in the list of terrorists that they want back. So to me it was very disappointing because the people of New Jersey, after all these years, are still trying to bring this woman to justice. People tell me, well, we negotiate and we trade with Vietnam, we trade with China. We trade with other countries. And I say this: that is not the island that I want in Cuba. We haven't helped Vietnam's people at all. There is still no freedom, and there are human rights abuses. You look at China, it is the same thing. You look at North Korea, it is the same thing. I don't want that for the island where I was born. And I surely don't want that kind of government 90 miles away from this country. You know, the history of Cuba, all in the past 50 years of this dictatorship, has been one to try to hurt this country as much as it can, and I certainly don't want that 90 miles from this country. The administration with this effort has taken away what we believe was a pressure point on a communist dictatorship 90 miles from this country. It has taken away how we can pressure this island. First of all, Russia can't help them any more. Russia used to help Cuba to the tune of $4 billion a year. Venezuela can't any more. Venezuela is falling apart. There are 30,000 Cubans in Venezuela trying to create the same type of country that we have in Cuba. And at this point, we take away this pressure and basically give millions of dollars to this dictatorship. People may not know it, but any time anybody sends any money to Cuba, the Cuban government keeps 30 percent of it. So if you raised it from $500 to $2,000, you tell me how many millions that is going to be. When you go to all of the beaches and to the restaurants, that is all government owned. In Cuba, if you want to set up a business, you have to negotiate with the government. If I want to set up a business and I need 100 workers, I don't go out and get 100 workers, I go out and speak to the government and the government tells me you have to pay $15 an hour. They in turn give those workers $2-3 an hour. That is not helping the Cuban people in their economics. That is not helping them move forward. So I think it is really naive to think that these kinds of changes are going to help. You know, I can only think back when I was young, and I came to this country at the age of 11. I remember when they took all of the books out of the school system and started the indoctrination process. I remember the military coming into my house and they took inventory. My mother and father were poor people, but they took inventory of everything that was in the house. And they threatened my parents that if anything was missing at the time we got our visa, it would be revoked. This is not the country that I want for Cuba. I want a country with democracy. I want a country where human rights are observed. And yet, for 50 years this dictatorship has been killing. People talk about Raul Castro as some sort of a changer. People forget that Raul Castro and Che Guevara were the ones who set up the firing squads in Cuba that killed thousands of people. Thousands of people were killed by the firing squads. So I rise today in total disappointment, and I hope that this administration sees that this is not the way forward, that this is a hardened dictatorship, and that the only way we can deal with this dictatorship is through pressure. Through pressure is the only way to deal with these people, especially at this time. There is nobody that is going to come out and bail out Cuba. {time} 2045 Just last year, they were funneling arms to North Korea right in our backyard. Is this the kind of government we want 90 miles from our shores? I thank my good friends for having this hour, allowing me to express my sentiments, and I thank all my colleagues who are here speaking with the same approach. Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, as you heard from Mr. Sires, he was born and reared in Cuba, but you don't have to be a Cuban American to understand the principles that are at stake here. One person who knows that is a wonderful congressman from our great State of Florida. So I am proud to yield to the gentleman from Florida, Gus Bilirakis. Mr. BILIRAKIS. Thank you for holding this very important Special Order. [[Page H216]] Way back in the Florida Legislature, when I was a member of the Cuban Caucus, so proud to be a member of the Cuban Caucus, I started speaking out against the Castro brothers' brand of oppression. Over the past 5 years, I joined with all of you to decry Alan Gross' arrest. I am thankful for his recent release. Alan Gross' freedom was long overdue, we all agree. I am glad he is safely on U.S. soil, but a large injustice remains: the plights of Cuban citizens, who have suffered for over five decades under the Castro regime in search of basic human rights and political freedoms that we as Americans, frankly, take for granted. Then, almost out of nowhere, the Obama administration decides to normalize relations with Cuba. This will allow American dollars to the rescue of the Castro brothers at a critical time. Their normal economic benefactors--Russia and Venezuela--cannot afford to help. Now, more than ever, economic sanctions can be used as an effective tool to force the Castro regime to afford basic human rights and political freedoms to all of Cuba's citizens. Scholars have noted that normalizing our economic policy with oppressive countries, like China or Vietnam, have produced no significant improvements in human rights treatment. Given the precedent, there is no reason to believe the situation with Cuba will yield significant different results. In fact, we already know that the suffering for Cuba's citizens will continue, unfortunately. Raul Castro proclaimed that there would be no renunciation of any of their principles. Cuban restrictions on free speech, assembly, and press will remain. They proved it just this last week. Travel and tourism will remain strictly controlled by the Castro regime. Tourism dollars that Americans will spend will go directly to the oppressors. We cannot ignore the sense of betrayal that Cuban defectors feel in response to the President's plan. We should be demanding genuine freedom: release of all political prisoners, universal human rights, Democratic principles, and a free market for the Cuban people. In order to ensure the citizens of Cuba stand a chance to benefit from this ill-advised agreement, Cuba's despots must relinquish control and eradicate their tools of tyranny. Actual human rights reforms must occur before any commercial or political normalization takes place. I will continue to monitor the actions on the island in search of positive movement. Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Mr. Bilirakis, I thank you for your clear and consistent message that restrictions should not be lifted against the Castro regime until those conditions are met. Our next speaker, Mr. Speaker, is the gentleman from Alabama, Congressman Bradley Byrne, who so understands that good trade is based on free and fair countries that cherish the principles upon which our great country was founded--freedom, democracy, respect for the rule of law--all of which are missing in today's Cuba. His great city of Mobile, Alabama, will greatly benefit once we have free trade and fair trade with a Democratic Cuba. I yield to the gentleman from Mobile, Alabama. Mr. BYRNE. I thank the gentlewoman, both for your time and for your leadership on this very important issue. As she said, I represent Mobile, Alabama. If you go and look at a map, it is a straight shot north from Havana to Mobile. For over three centuries, Mobile has been a major port for the export of goods and import of goods back and forth between Cuba and the United States. It is in the economic best interest of the people in my district for us to get to the point where we have normalized relations and trade with Cuba. I should be ardently in favor of this deal that the President is pursuing, but I am not. This is not the time, these are not the circumstances, and--to put it simply--this is not the way to do this. Let me address the way for a moment. It has been alluded to previously that we have done deals with China and with Vietnam. In both cases, the Presidents involved worked with Congress. That is critically important to whatever success they have had in both of those deals. In this circumstance, the President has refused to work with Congress. You can't reach the sort of agreement that he is looking for without Congress. You can't have an embassy unless we are willing to pay for it. You can't have an ambassador unless the Senate approves the ambassador. He is pursuing what, in essence, is an errand that cannot result in success that he is looking for, but he is pursuing it anyway without us because this is just another example of these efforts to make these unilateral, executive-type decisions, leaving Congress to decide to try to keep itself relevant as he becomes a lameduck President. That is no way to do this. Let me address the circumstances. I can't say it any better than the prior speakers have said it. This is a brutally oppressive regime that cannot change, and until they change, until they put in motion the things that we are talking about for change, I don't see how a country like the United States can seriously engage in negotiations with them. Most importantly, for me, from my perspective, I serve on the House Armed Services Committee--I don't think I have to tell everybody here the history of this country--this country with this regime in charge allowed the then-Soviet Union to put nuclear missiles aimed at the United States on their soil. They have never apologized for that; they have never renounced that. As we heard earlier, just a year ago, they were caught redhanded in an arms deal with the North Koreans, who are presently enemies of the United States. What sort of assurance do we have as part of this deal that Cuba is not going to be a staging ground for military activity, terrorist activity, against the people and the security of the United States of America? Nothing, nothing; yet we engaged in this deal, a very bad deal from my perspective--and I don't want to take anything away from the American citizen who we were able to bring back home--but look who we traded in return for that. It reminds me of the Bergdahl deal we had last year that was so very controversial. This administration doesn't know how to make a good deal. They know how to give everything away and get very little back. I want to normalize relationships with Cuba. I want us to open up that trade again because it is going to benefit my district. I am willing to do anything I can to help make that happen, but this country should never give in to people like the Castro brothers until there is a change in that regime, until there is a change in the Government of Cuba, until they renounce their activities that have been against the security of the United States, until we know that we have a good faith trading partner and a good faith partner, period, in this hemisphere. I look forward to the day when I can stand at the Port of Mobile and welcome goods coming in from Cuba and goods going out from Mobile to Cuba as part of a deal that is made in the right way, under the right circumstances, for the right reason. I hope and pray that that day comes, but that day is not today. I thank the gentlewoman for her leadership. I look forward to continuing to follow that leadership in the days to come. Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Thank you very much. I am so thankful to my good friend from Mobile, Alabama, for his words, because he understands that American principles are not for sale. I would like to point out, Mr. Speaker, that every country with whom the Castro brothers do business is a country to whom they owe a lot of money. They have not paid all of their bills to any businesses, and they have not paid what they owe to any country, and it would be all the same for Mobile, Alabama. Thank you for standing up for U.S. values. Now, I am so pleased to yield to my good friend from South Carolina, a gentleman who understands the threat to our hemisphere. Why? Because he is the chairman of the Subcommittee on Western Hemisphere, the gentleman from South Carolina (Mr. Duncan), my good friend. Mr. DUNCAN of South Carolina. I thank the gentlewoman from Florida for her leadership on this issue, not just today, but for her whole tenure in Congress. [[Page H217]] As the new chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on the Western Hemisphere, I was grateful to see the return of Alan Gross to the United States last month after 5 years of unjust imprisonment in Cuba. The announcement over this past weekend that the Cubans freed 53 prisoners was also welcome news. Nevertheless, I have major concerns with the way this administration, the Obama administration, conducted negotiations and the way the decision was made to radically alter longstanding U.S. policy towards Cuba. The administration failed to consult Congress, failed to consult any Cuban dissidents or civil society in its decision to embark on its new course in Cuba. The administration says this decision will empower the Cuban people; yet softening U.S. policy without concrete Cuban reforms will only boost the Castro regime and government and facilitate the survival of the communist regime. We need to focus not on what is best for the Cuban Government, the Castro regime, we need to focus on what is best for the Cuban people. I ask you this: Will this deal mean more self-governance for the Cuban people? Will it mean more economic freedom for those who strive to innovate, those that are entrepreneurial within the Cuban society? Will they be able to start more businesses and have economic freedom? Will there be more religious freedom for the Cuban people? Will there be more rights to free speech? Are the Cuban people seeing this debate tonight on Cuban TV? Are the Cuban people able to access the Internet and watch what we are doing via YouTube or any other media? These are rhetorical questions, but I answer them with ``no,'' based on my understanding. I recall it was only 1 week after the announcement of this U.S.-Cuba deal that the Cuban Government cracked down on peaceful protestors in Havana's Revolutionary Square. I point to that as evidence that it is still a closed communistic society. In conclusion, the administration's decision is a reward to the communist dictatorship at the expense of the Cuban people. This action is especially disgraceful when we consider the administration's disrespect toward our friend and ally in Canada by vowing to veto legislation approving the construction of the Keystone pipeline. These are issues that require vigorous congressional oversight. I look forward to working with the ranking member, Mr. Sires, that you just heard from, as we hold hearings in the Subcommittee on the Western Hemisphere in the coming weeks and month. Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Thank you so much, Mr. Duncan. We are so pleased that we have this dynamic duo of the chairman and the ranking member of Western Hemisphere. You are so right to point out, Mr. Duncan, that there is no freedom of the press in Cuba. That is one of the many freedoms that Cuban people are denied. Now, I yield to my colleague from Florida, Congressman Ron DeSantis, who is a war veteran, but who understands that the war for freedom and democracy takes on many fronts, a member of our House Foreign Affairs Committee. Mr. DeSANTIS. Mr. Speaker, I would just like to recognize my colleague from Florida because she is just not only on the House floor fighting for freedom for the Cuban people, with whom she obviously has ancestral relations, she fights for freedom for everybody. Whether it is in Venezuela or Iran, she is there; you can set your clock to it. When I first heard about these concessions, I was really scratching my head. I texted some of my colleagues, and I was like: ``We are not really getting anything for this.'' Sure enough, Raul Castro goes out, talks to the people, and says: ``We are not changing. We are not changing anything.'' They are staying exactly with the values that they have been with from the beginning, which are antagonistic to freedom, antagonistic to everything we hold dear in the United States. {time} 2100 You know, when you look at countries like Cuba, a lot of times you don't even need to get into the nitty-gritty. There are just certain signs where you know the nature of the regime. For example, when you look at communism in Eastern Europe, you don't have to look at the daily life or any of that. You just look at the fact that there was a Berlin Wall that kept people in like caged animals. If you look at the differences between North and South Korea, all you have to do is look at that satellite photo at night, where South Korea is lit up like a Christmas tree and North Korea is a land of darkness and despair. For me, when I think of what is the nature of the Cuban regime, I think all you need to know is that you have tens of thousands of people living in Cuba. It is a nice island, it has great weather, and they are suffocated so much that they are willing to swim across 90 miles of shark-infested waters--the Florida Straits--knowing that they are probably going to die. That is all you need to know. This is a Stalinist regime. And as my colleague from Alabama mentioned, the Cuban missile crisis wasn't even just that there were nuclear weapons in Cuba pointed at the United States. Fidel Castro was telling Khrushchev to fire them into the United States. We actually were fortunate that Nikita Khrushchev was actually the cooler head in that. So if Castro had his way, there would have been nuclear weapons sent here. And so this is the nature of the regime. So what are you doing with this policy? To me, I look at it very simply. I think this fact is true. Every single dollar spent in Cuba benefits the Castro regime. Every single dollar. Europe doesn't have restrictions. Most of the other world doesn't have restrictions. Have the Cuban people benefited from that? Has their standard of living gone up? No. This all goes to benefit the government. To me, this is the worst possible time to throw the Castro regime a lifeline. If you look at what is happening in Caracas, if you look at what is happening in Moscow, these regimes are buckling because of the decline in the price of oil. So this is a moment of profound weakness for the Castro regime. And giving them these concessions is exactly what the Castro regime wants. I am scratching my head trying to figure out: What do we get in return for this? The Americans who had property seized when Castro took power, are any of them getting their property back? No. What about the Cuban Americans who had to flee? They had their businesses taken, property taken. Are any of them going to get any type of recompense? Of course, not. What about freedom of speech, political rights, the ability to participate in political life and criticize those in power? Is that being extended to the Cuban people? Not on your life. Nothing. I will say, it is interesting--and my colleague from Florida mentioned this--the dismal credit rating that Cuba has. They don't pay back any loans. Are we then going to extend Export-Import Bank loans that are backed by the taxpayer to do business in Cuba? The American taxpayer is going to have to end up paying for that. That is not a good source of business for our taxpayers. The tragedy of this is we have given away leverage that could have come in handy. These Castro brothers are on their last legs. When they finally leave the scene, we want to use the leverage we have to leverage a democratic transition. Instead, we are essentially normalizing status quo. So if the Stalinist dictatorship survives beyond the Castros due to U.S. support, you are going to have 11 million Cubans who are consigned to another generation of tyranny. I will just say one more thing. When I read the media coverage--and I think I can say this because I am not from south Florida--the coverage is so negative about Cuban Americans who fled Castro. They say: Oh, they're living in the past. This is anachronistic, all this stuff. For me, the people that I want to talk to to know the true nature of the regime are the people who suffered under the regime, the people who were forced to flee and who had family members killed, had family members in prison. That, to me, is the number one source of information that I would look to. [[Page H218]] And so the media frames it as if somehow the American policy is anachronistic. I think it is the Castro regime, based on Stalinist principles, that is anachronistic, and yet it continues to lumber on. And the tragedy of this is that we are giving them a critical lifeline so that they can continue having their country governed like a political prison. So I appreciate you organizing this, my colleague in Florida. We are giving speeches here tonight, but we need to act in this body, and we need to show that this policy does not represent the will of the American people and does not represent what is best for people in Cuba that are struggling for freedom. Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Thank you so much, Mr. DeSantis. You are so right when you categorized this unilateral bad deal as an economic lifeline to the Castro regime. A person who understands that just as well as you do is our next speaker, the gentleman from Iowa, a senior member of the House Committee on Agriculture, Congressman Steve King. He can say: Hey, my State is going to benefit a lot by this deal. The sad reality, as Mr. King and I know, is that Castro doesn't pay his debt. As we had just said with the other speaker, he owes everybody money. This deal will not strengthen U.S. national security. It will not be good for America's farmers, and it will not be good for the people of Cuba. Congressman King. Mr. KING of Iowa. I thank the gentlewoman from Florida for organizing this Special Order, and I associate myself with her words and her position and also that of the gentleman from Florida (Mr. DeSantis). I didn't, Mr. Speaker, realize how much was in him about this issue. It was instructive for me to listen to that stream forward. I have had the privilege of serving here in this Congress with a good number of Members that do a great job of representing the interests of the Cuban people, and I also had the privilege of going to Cuba on a legal trip some years ago before I came to this Congress. But I would take you back, Mr. Speaker, to a time in 1959 and trace some of this history. The revolution against Batista in 1959 was back before we had as many replays on television as we have today. And I recall watching the revolution in Cuba, and as Castro took over, as the promise came that they were going to bring democracy to Cuba--that was the promise. It was going to be democracy; it was going to be free and fair elections, a government of, by, and for the people of Cuba; and they were going to choose their leadership. But I remember seeing on television the videos of the people who were lined up against the wall and executed without a proper trial, executed without true justice. I remember in particular--it is branded in my memory--a man who insisted: If you are to shoot me here in front of this wall, let me give the order for my own execution. And he stood there in a Cuban shirt down to here--white pants, white shirt--and he raised his hand and faced the firing squad and dropped his own hand. That was the signal to the firing squad. They fired. He was shot to death in front of that wall, along with many, many others. We don't know at this point how many political prisoners have been executed, how many have died in custody. We have got a list of some; we don't have a list of all. But we know this: it has never been, since that time in 1959, a government of, by, and for the people of Cuba. And the hope that there will be the day that the Cuban people would be free was manifested--or at least attempted to be manifested--at the Bay of Pigs. I would have liked to have seen the air cover that would have made that be successful. We didn't get that. But we look for the day to come ever since that the Cuban people could be free. The Cuban people could be free. Since that time, there has been the nationalization of the real property, which we heard from Mr. DeSantis. At the time that Castro took control of Cuba, 25 percent of the real estate in Cuba was owned by Americans. They held deeds to that property. There was other land in Cuba that was owned by people from other nationalities. Every other country was compensated for their real estate, except Americans. No American that I know of has been compensated for their real estate. They hold those deeds to this today, sometimes a second generation. Before I came to this Congress, while I was there, there was also a situation where the exchange rate for Cuban peso to dollar was 21 to 1 at that time. And so if anyone achieved an American dollar, they could take it into a dollar store and they would get one peso's worth of goods for it or they could deposit it into a Cuban bank and they would get one peso for that. That is a 20-peso difference. And that is one of the things that supported the Castro regime financially. Another thing that happened was sugar was 6 cents a pound. The Russians paid them 52 cents a pound in oil for the sugar. That was a subsidy of Cuba. When the Soviet Union--it was the Soviet Union rather than just the Russians--collapsed, then the subsidy for Cuba also collapsed and the Cuban economy was no longer propped up. You saw Russian tractors sitting out there, having been stripped for parts, in the only country in the world I know that had gone from mechanized agriculture to animal husbandry agriculture because their machines no longer worked. And the taxicabs are driven by doctors, with a five-cylinder Russian diesel under the hood of a 1954 Chevrolet. This country has been frozen in time. It has a collapsed and failed economy. It has been propped up by the subsidy of, first, the Soviet Union, and then later on, the Venezuelans, who are collapsing, themselves, today. This is a country of people that are vigorous people. They are an outgoing, hardworking, I will say, gregarious people. I thought I would see people down there that had the thousand-yard hopeless stare. I am sure that exists. But I also saw people that worked hard and they kept their chin up and they kept a smile on their face. I thought, If these people could be unleashed, if they could be unleashed by the heartbeat of freedom, if we could just get them that opportunity to be who they are, they would become a very, very successful island and trading partner and a nation unto themselves and, one day, an ally of the United States. So my dream has been to help them with that opportunity, and my dream has been to one day swim ashore at the Bay of Pigs and walk out and wade onto a free Cuba, with a free Cuban. But, Mr. Speaker, the Cuban people have been burdened with more than five decades of Marxist slavery that they have had to face. And this policy of the President's that comes right on the cusp of what is likely the biological solution in Cuba, which would be the end of the Castro brothers that would come along naturally and the opportunity to bring about a regime change in Cuba, the President of the United States may well have handed Cuba another 50 years of living in Marxist slavery when he had just the opportunity for them to be free. So our policy here in this Congress, I am hopeful, is the policy that says: regime change in Cuba and a government of, by, and for the people of Cuba. And I, one day, hope and pray to do what I have said with my colleagues here and many others, and that is swim ashore at the Bay of Pigs and wade out on the shore of a free Cuba. God bless them all. Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Thank you so much, Mr. King. That is our fervent hope as well. And we work and we pray every day for that dream of a free Cuba to come alive. We thank you for your voice here tonight. Thank you, my good friend from Iowa. Mr. Speaker, many people talk about the last generation of Cuban exiles and how this is really not the dream of young Cuban Americans who were born here in the United States, reared here in the United States. They come from Cuban families, but they really don't much care about freedom and democracy and the land of their ancestors. This next speaker, Mr. Speaker, is a newly elected gentleman who understands that that search for a free and democratic Cuba is a yearning that lives very fervently in his heart, and that is the Congressman from West Virginia, Congressman Alex Mooney, who was born here, as American as apple pie, but comes from a proud lineage of Cuban American heritage. Thank you, Mr. Mooney. Mr. MOONEY of West Virginia. I want to thank Congresswoman Ileana [[Page H219]] Ros-Lehtinen for arranging this important Special Order to show solidarity with the Cuban people as they continue to live under an oppressive regime. Mr. Speaker, President Obama has senselessly yielded ground, with no stipulations for reform, to the Cuban regime, with the announcements of a secret deal going around Congress to ``normalize'' relations. This misguided grab for a legacy item has cost our country and the Cuban people a valuable bargaining chip for their freedom. Of course, this is yet another foreign policy failure or, more accurately, unilateral surrender from this administration. From the bright red line in Syria, which was crossed with impunity, to sending a secret message to President Putin that, ``After the election, I will be more flexible,'' to now rewarding tyrants in Cuba who continue to deny basic human rights to their oppressed citizens, President Obama has chosen wrong policies. The despotic government the President would normalize relations with has, for decades, sought to subjugate the Cuban people's appetite for freedom. The many realized American Dreams of Cuban refugees, including my mother, are a great testament to the greatness of the United States and our constitutional rights. As the beacon of freedom in the world, America must continue to use sensible policy to protect our values around the world and in our own backyard. {time} 2115 Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Thank you so much, Mr. Mooney. We are a better Congress for you being a part of it. Thank you so much for being proud of your American heritage and your Cuban American ancestry as well. So, welcome to Congress, sir. Mr. Speaker, I am about to introduce another millennial, another one of this younger generation of Cuban Americans who the press continues to say don't represent the desires of this new generation. Well, Carlos Curbelo is one of our newest elected officials. He was born here in the United States, doesn't know Cuba, and is less than 35 years old but understands that yearning for a free Cuba. We are so pleased as punch to have him here as a Member of our Congress. I yield to the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Curbelo). Mr. CURBELO of Florida. I thank the gentlelady for yielding, and I thank her for her tireless advocacy and work on this very, very important cause. Mr. Speaker, during the 56 years of the Cuban tragedy, also known as the Cuban Revolution, there had always been two constants. First, the nature of the Castro regime, a dictatorship that brutally represses its own people, and that aggressively opposes U.S. national security interests throughout the globe. That has not changed. The second was that, to varying degrees, the occupant of the White House had always been on the side of the Cuban people and in opposition to their oppressors, who for decades have collaborated with America's most dangerous allies. Today, this is, regrettably, no longer the case. By trading an American hostage, cruelly held by Cuba's dictators for 5 years, for three criminals convicted of spying against our government, including one who was serving a lifetime sentence for conspiring to murder American citizens, the President sent a message to our enemies that the United States can be extorted. What was the Cuban government's reward for holding an American hostage for 5 years? Three convicted spies and full diplomatic relations, plus an economic bailout for a financially and morally bankrupt regime. The men who rule Cuba today are the same men who had nuclear missiles installed on the island and pointed them at the United States, as my colleague from Alabama stated earlier. When they were cash-rich, they ran a robust military and deployed troops throughout the world to fight alongside our most dangerous enemies. They have trained and supported terrorist groups such as Colombia's FARC. They ordered three American citizens and one resident blown out of the sky in the tragic shootdown of February 24, 1996. A few months ago, they were caught shipping arms illegally to North Korea, and they collaborated with the Venezuelan government in last year's brutal crackdown, which resulted in the death of over 40 students. Human rights atrocities by the dictatorship against its people continue. The Castro regime consistently resorts to violence because they know it is the only way they can maintain control since the Cuban people are desperate to be free. The President's decision to ease sanctions only serves to bolster the dictatorship and its apparatus of repression. There is virtually no private sector in Cuba. More than 85 percent of Cubans work for government controlled-enterprises and earn less than $20 a month. Foreign investment doesn't benefit the average Cuban. Cubans that work for corporations with foreign capital are only allowed to keep 8 percent of their salaries. Cuban workers are, in effect, slaves of the dictatorship. Now, it is important to note, Mr. Speaker, President Obama's administration approved sanctions in recent months against Venezuela and North Korea. Why, then, is it rewarding an enemy of the United States just 90 miles from our shores that actively collaborates with both of these regimes? Why does the President insist on an incoherent foreign policy that too often rewards our enemies and punishes our allies? As other American Presidents have shown us in the past, peace through weakness and appeasement is not an effective strategy for dealing with Cuba's military dictatorship. We also have to ask ourselves, what kind of neighborhood do we want to live in? The Americas, the Western Hemisphere, is the American neighborhood of the world. What kind of standards do we want for this part of the world? Do we want to endorse the chronic abuse of human rights, the imprisonment of people who disagree? That is the nature of the Cuban government, and we, the United States of America and, by the way, the other nations of this hemisphere, have agreed that we support a democratic form of government, and that we want this part of the world to be free without exception. There is one glaring exception, and it is Cuba. Our sanctions policy, some say, well, it hasn't worked. Of course the sanctions have worked. The sanctions have denied billions and billions and billions of dollars to a regime that would use those profits to oppose our interests throughout the world. What did the regime do when it had resources? It had troops all over the world. It exported revolution. And if you don't know what exporting revolution means, in the context of Cuba, it means aggressively opposing American interests throughout the world. Today, we remember in a very special way, Mario Manuel de la Pena, Carlos Costa, Armando Alejandre, and Pablo Morales. These were the men who were brutally assassinated by the Cuban regime on February 24 of 1996. One of the spies was convicted of conspiring to murder these young men, three of whom were American citizens, and the other was a resident of our country. These four men are dead, and the Cuban spies are free. But it isn't too late, Mr. Speaker. The President still has time to get back on the right side of this issue and on the right side of history by standing against Cuba's dictators, with the victims of their brutality, and for a strong American foreign policy that advances our national security interests. Again, I want to thank my distinguished colleague from south Florida for her leadership. We have admired her for so many years for her work on this issue. Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Thank you so much, Mr. Curbelo. You are a fresh young voice, and I thank you and Mr. Mooney for being here tonight. Mr. Speaker I am so pleased to yield to a gentleman who understands what freedom is all about. He was one of the speech writers for our great President, Ronald Reagan. He is a senior member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee. In fact, he is the chairman of the Europe Subcommittee, and he is here tonight with one of his triplets, Christian, who wants to be an author and an inventor. I look at Christian, this new generation, and I think, what kind of life [[Page H220]] would he have under the communist tyranny of Cuba, as opposed to the freedom and democracy that we enjoy here? So with that, I am pleased as punch to yield to my good friend from California (Mr. Rohrabacher). Mr. ROHRABACHER. Thank you very much. America is about to send a message to the world exactly on whose side are we on, and I am very proud to stand here with my colleagues, standing on the side of liberty, of justice, of treating people decently, of government that serves the people rather than a systematic government that requires the people to serve them, the bureaucracy, the tyrants that hold power. That is what this is all about. Let's get an understanding of who this Castro gang is. Castro murdered the freedom fighters who overthrew the dictatorial government of Batista back in the 1950s. Castro, himself, took people out who had fought against the dictatorship of Batista and shot them in the head. These were people that risked their lives to bring democracy to Cuba, and this man co- opted their revolution. He has allied himself, over the years, with gangsters and tyrants throughout the world. He has had a safe haven for the drug dealers of Latin America, who look to him as the moderator of any disputes between these monstrous gangsters who murder each other and murder anyone who gets in their way. He has allied with these drug dealers. But also, during the cold war he was allied to the hilt to the communist movement throughout the world. He wanted his country to become a nuclear base to attack and drop nuclear bombs on the people of the United States. Let's not forget that. This is the man who wanted to kill Americans by the millions. For us now, oh, well, that is history; let bygones be bygones. Are you kidding me? This is the guy that we need to send a message to. When people have that much hatred of the United States, undermine the freedom of the people in of the world, we are not just going to sit aside and forgive him of these things. Oh, by the way, he is not even asking for forgiveness. The Castro regime is just saying, accept us as we are, a country that has had more political prisoners than almost any other country of this hemisphere, and we are just going to accept them as they are. Well, remember, when people were struggling during the cold war against communism, Castro was on the wrong side. During the cold war, he was the one who wanted to kill Americans by the millions by having Soviet missiles in his country. Finally, what does this agreement that this administration--what will be the effect of it? Oh, yeah, they say, we have been told, well, if you just have free trade people are going to get better. There is going to be liberalism. I call this the ``hug a Nazi, make a liberal'' theory. The fact is that Fidel Castro, just like the Chinese Communists, I might add, no matter how much trade we have, they will manipulate it so that the clique that is in power, the clique that has been able to monstrously oppress their own people, take that wealth, manipulate that wealth that is coming into the country to cement their own power. It is very clear what this man has and his clique have in mind, and that is continuing their oppression of the Cuban people. Let's not be partners to that. Let us again, stand for liberty, stand for justice. The Soviet Union has fallen. It is time for Castro and communism in Cuba to fall as well. Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Thank you so much, Mr. Rohrabacher. And you so rightly point out that hours after President Obama announced, in a shocking way, that we would resume diplomatic relations with Cuba and the Castro regime does not have to change, Raul Castro put on his military uniform and spoke to the oppressed island nation and said, hey, don't worry. We are not changing a thing. It is still the same failed regime. We got nothing from that deal. Mr. Speaker, I am so pleased to yield to the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Diaz-Balart), the chairman of the Appropriations Subcommittee on Transportation, Housing and Urban Development. I had the honor of serving with his older brother. I have the honor of serving with his youngest brother now, Mario. Born in the United States and, just like Carlos and Alex Mooney, Mr. Curbelo and Mr. Mooney, a gentleman who is 100 percent American and so proud of 100 percent of his Cuban ancestry. Thank you, Mario. Mr. DIAZ-BALART. Let me first thank you, Madam Chairwoman, for your leadership. As we heard tonight, your leadership in the cause of freedom does not stop at the shores of Cuba. Wherever there is repression and oppression, there is the clear concise voice of Chairwoman Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, as we have heard again tonight. Mr. Speaker, we have heard a lot. And I know that the time is getting short, but I want to quote somebody whom we have not quoted, as far as I remember here tonight, and this is President Obama. When Mr. Obama was running for President he stated what the right policy, what his policy would be to deal with the Cuban tyranny. He said: ``My policy towards Cuba will be guided by one word, `libertad'--freedom. And the road to freedom for all Cubans must begin with justice for Cuba's political prisoners, the right of free speech, a free press, freedom assembly, and it must lead to elections that are free and fair.'' Mr. Obama went on to say: ``I will maintain the embargo. It provides us with the leverage to present the regime with a clear choice. If you take significant steps towards democracy, beginning with the freedom of all--all--political prisoners,'' Mr. Obama said, ``we will take steps to begin normalizing relations. That is the way to bring about real change in Cuba,'' Mr. Obama said, ``through strong, smart principled democracy.'' {time} 2130 Mr. Speaker, in essence, that day, then-candidate Obama, Senator Obama, and now-President Obama drew a red line about what the right policy was to deal with the Cuban regime; sadly, on December 17, President Obama announced that he was breaking that promise, that he was, once again, crossing--breaking--his own red line. We have heard tonight that we have also heard from the vast majority of the pro-democracy leaders within the island who are struggling. They have objected to President Obama's change of policy. Mr. Speaker, if President Obama doesn't want to do it for the sake of a future of freedom for the Cuban people, he should stand firm for the sake of the national security interests of the United States. As we have heard today--right now, as we speak, not 50 years ago--the Cuban regime harbors fugitives from American law, including cop killers and terrorists. What is President Obama's answer? ``No problem, we will normalize relations.'' The Cuban regime has an active espionage network against the interests of the United States. What is the President's answer to that? ``No problem, we will normalize. You can continue to do that.'' The Cuban regime shot down two American airplanes in international airspace; and for the people who are in prison, including one who was in prison for conspiracy to murder, not only is it okay--no problem, we will normalize--but no. We will send them back. You can go back home. Mr. Speaker, the night is late, but I know and I am confident that, unlike President Obama, this Congress will continue to stand firm with the cause of freedom and the cause of a free Cuba, even while President Obama does not. Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Thank you so much, Mr. Diaz-Balart. You so eloquently stated that. We have so much to say, and we have run out of time. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair will remind Members not to refer to guests on the floor of the House. [[Page H221]] ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 5 (Monday, January 12, 2015)] [House] [Pages H214-H221] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] OPPOSING RAPPROCHEMENT WITH CUBA The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Carter of Georgia). Under the Speaker's announced policy of January 6, 2015, the gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. Ros-Lehtinen) is recognized for 60 minutes as the designee of the majority leader. Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, I am so humbled and pleased to see my colleagues who have turned out tonight at this late hour in a bipartisan manner to say that we reject the President's ill-advised treatment of the policy of rapprochement with the Cuban regime, and no one is better able and better equipped to talk about freedom and democracy and our fight for justice than Mr. Chabot. I yield to the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Chabot), a senior member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee and chairman of the House Small Business Committee. Mr. CHABOT. Mr. Speaker, I rise this evening to join with my colleague and friend, Congresswoman Ros-Lehtinen, in opposition to the December 17 announcement by President Obama to change U.S. policy toward Cuba. We will also be joined by some of our other colleagues, and I want to particularly thank Congresswoman Ros-Lehtinen for her leadership on all issues regarding Cuba. She has been a leader on this issue for a long, long time and will continue to be, I am sure. This policy change was a unilateral decision made without consulting Congress and with complete disregard of long-term national security consequences. Similarly, the so-called prisoner exchange was terribly flawed. In 2013, Secretary Kerry stated that swapping convicted Cuban spies for Alan Gross was off the table, testifying before Congress that since Mr. Gross was wrongly imprisoned, there was no equivalency to pursue a spy for spy tradeoff. Let us be clear: the freedom of Alan Gross is welcome news, but this exchange was totally one-sided. It was tragically flawed. It was not in the best interest of the people of the United States, and it was not in the best interest of the people of Cuba. As my colleague, Representative Ros-Lehtinen, has rightly highlighted these past few weeks since the decision and the prisoner exchange occurred, Cuban spies have been responsible for the deaths of American lives. It is absolutely true that they have been. And they have been released. Those are the people who were responsible for American deaths. Cuban patriots who have risked their lives every day to fight for basic rights and freedoms feel betrayed. The exchange was flawed. The policy itself is flawed, and the announcement [[Page H215]] has also let down one of the United States' strongest ally in the world, Israel. Year after year, Israel has stood at the United States' side--one of the very few--supporting the United States at the United Nations in 98 percent of all votes, including votes that the world's worst actors pushed through to condemn the U.S. embargo on Cuba. Unfortunately, those who have long nourished and fostered cozy relationships with Cuba, most notably Russia and Venezuela and various terrorist organizations around the world, are welcoming the policy changes with open arms. We need to be honest about the implications of President Obama's new policy. His unilateral decision to change Cuba policy poses a threat to U.S. national security. If the trade embargo is lifted, money will flow into the hands of the Castro brothers, allowing them to financially support surreptitious espionage activities with terrorist groups like Hezbollah and nations like North Korea. Since the President made his public announcement, nearly 100 Cubans have already been detained. The United States should always stand for democracy and freedom around the world. We should demand that the Castro regime release all political prisoners and hold free and fair elections before establishing diplomatic relations. I once again thank the gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. Ros-Lehtinen) for her leadership in this area for many, many years, and it is an honor to speak this evening with her. Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. I thank the gentleman from Ohio very much, and thank you for looking out for our U.S. national security, and thank you for trying to uphold the values of freedom throughout the world. Mr. Chabot brought up the fact that Mr. Kerry, speaking before our committee, said that we would not release spies for Alan Gross' life. And that came because of a question posed by our next speaker, and I am pleased to yield to the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Sires), the ranking member of the House Subcommittee on the Western Hemisphere. Mr. SIRES. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for allowing me to speak tonight. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to express my disappointment and deep concerns regarding the administration's plan for loosening the sanctions and initiating diplomatic discussions with the Cuban dictatorship. It is naive and misguided to think that this is going to give us the long-desired political and economic changes that the Cuban people deserve. In fact, just a few days after the announcement, Raul Castro made sure to dispel any misgivings and brazenly declared that the regime would not abandon its communist path, let alone loosen its stranglehold over the people of Cuba. I feel that the administration has abandoned all those Cuban people for all those years who fought for human rights and democracy in Cuba. I feel that those people who are still lingering in the Cuban jails are so disappointed in this administration's efforts. You know, the Alan Gross release should have been something joyous. And we all wanted Alan Gross released because he was incarcerated for no reason other than he was foreign. But to release three Cuban spies or a network of spies that exists in this country currently is just not acceptable. Alan Gross should have been released on his own. He did nothing. He just went to Cuba to establish some sort of communication for this community. The other thing that is troubling me, coming from New Jersey, is the fact that there was no discussion about any extradition of the criminals that are currently in Cuba. There are over 100 criminals in Cuba, including Joanne Chesimard, who killed a State trooper in New Jersey point blank 30 years ago. She escaped to Cuba. She has been enjoying the sun, she has been enjoying the beach. Meanwhile, Trooper Werner Foerster's family for over 30 years grew up without a father. And yet we can't seem to get this government to think that it is important that we bring these people to justice. As a matter of fact, the FBI has named Joanne Chesimard as number one in the list of terrorists that they want back. So to me it was very disappointing because the people of New Jersey, after all these years, are still trying to bring this woman to justice. People tell me, well, we negotiate and we trade with Vietnam, we trade with China. We trade with other countries. And I say this: that is not the island that I want in Cuba. We haven't helped Vietnam's people at all. There is still no freedom, and there are human rights abuses. You look at China, it is the same thing. You look at North Korea, it is the same thing. I don't want that for the island where I was born. And I surely don't want that kind of government 90 miles away from this country. You know, the history of Cuba, all in the past 50 years of this dictatorship, has been one to try to hurt this country as much as it can, and I certainly don't want that 90 miles from this country. The administration with this effort has taken away what we believe was a pressure point on a communist dictatorship 90 miles from this country. It has taken away how we can pressure this island. First of all, Russia can't help them any more. Russia used to help Cuba to the tune of $4 billion a year. Venezuela can't any more. Venezuela is falling apart. There are 30,000 Cubans in Venezuela trying to create the same type of country that we have in Cuba. And at this point, we take away this pressure and basically give millions of dollars to this dictatorship. People may not know it, but any time anybody sends any money to Cuba, the Cuban government keeps 30 percent of it. So if you raised it from $500 to $2,000, you tell me how many millions that is going to be. When you go to all of the beaches and to the restaurants, that is all government owned. In Cuba, if you want to set up a business, you have to negotiate with the government. If I want to set up a business and I need 100 workers, I don't go out and get 100 workers, I go out and speak to the government and the government tells me you have to pay $15 an hour. They in turn give those workers $2-3 an hour. That is not helping the Cuban people in their economics. That is not helping them move forward. So I think it is really naive to think that these kinds of changes are going to help. You know, I can only think back when I was young, and I came to this country at the age of 11. I remember when they took all of the books out of the school system and started the indoctrination process. I remember the military coming into my house and they took inventory. My mother and father were poor people, but they took inventory of everything that was in the house. And they threatened my parents that if anything was missing at the time we got our visa, it would be revoked. This is not the country that I want for Cuba. I want a country with democracy. I want a country where human rights are observed. And yet, for 50 years this dictatorship has been killing. People talk about Raul Castro as some sort of a changer. People forget that Raul Castro and Che Guevara were the ones who set up the firing squads in Cuba that killed thousands of people. Thousands of people were killed by the firing squads. So I rise today in total disappointment, and I hope that this administration sees that this is not the way forward, that this is a hardened dictatorship, and that the only way we can deal with this dictatorship is through pressure. Through pressure is the only way to deal with these people, especially at this time. There is nobody that is going to come out and bail out Cuba. {time} 2045 Just last year, they were funneling arms to North Korea right in our backyard. Is this the kind of government we want 90 miles from our shores? I thank my good friends for having this hour, allowing me to express my sentiments, and I thank all my colleagues who are here speaking with the same approach. Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, as you heard from Mr. Sires, he was born and reared in Cuba, but you don't have to be a Cuban American to understand the principles that are at stake here. One person who knows that is a wonderful congressman from our great State of Florida. So I am proud to yield to the gentleman from Florida, Gus Bilirakis. Mr. BILIRAKIS. Thank you for holding this very important Special Order. [[Page H216]] Way back in the Florida Legislature, when I was a member of the Cuban Caucus, so proud to be a member of the Cuban Caucus, I started speaking out against the Castro brothers' brand of oppression. Over the past 5 years, I joined with all of you to decry Alan Gross' arrest. I am thankful for his recent release. Alan Gross' freedom was long overdue, we all agree. I am glad he is safely on U.S. soil, but a large injustice remains: the plights of Cuban citizens, who have suffered for over five decades under the Castro regime in search of basic human rights and political freedoms that we as Americans, frankly, take for granted. Then, almost out of nowhere, the Obama administration decides to normalize relations with Cuba. This will allow American dollars to the rescue of the Castro brothers at a critical time. Their normal economic benefactors--Russia and Venezuela--cannot afford to help. Now, more than ever, economic sanctions can be used as an effective tool to force the Castro regime to afford basic human rights and political freedoms to all of Cuba's citizens. Scholars have noted that normalizing our economic policy with oppressive countries, like China or Vietnam, have produced no significant improvements in human rights treatment. Given the precedent, there is no reason to believe the situation with Cuba will yield significant different results. In fact, we already know that the suffering for Cuba's citizens will continue, unfortunately. Raul Castro proclaimed that there would be no renunciation of any of their principles. Cuban restrictions on free speech, assembly, and press will remain. They proved it just this last week. Travel and tourism will remain strictly controlled by the Castro regime. Tourism dollars that Americans will spend will go directly to the oppressors. We cannot ignore the sense of betrayal that Cuban defectors feel in response to the President's plan. We should be demanding genuine freedom: release of all political prisoners, universal human rights, Democratic principles, and a free market for the Cuban people. In order to ensure the citizens of Cuba stand a chance to benefit from this ill-advised agreement, Cuba's despots must relinquish control and eradicate their tools of tyranny. Actual human rights reforms must occur before any commercial or political normalization takes place. I will continue to monitor the actions on the island in search of positive movement. Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Mr. Bilirakis, I thank you for your clear and consistent message that restrictions should not be lifted against the Castro regime until those conditions are met. Our next speaker, Mr. Speaker, is the gentleman from Alabama, Congressman Bradley Byrne, who so understands that good trade is based on free and fair countries that cherish the principles upon which our great country was founded--freedom, democracy, respect for the rule of law--all of which are missing in today's Cuba. His great city of Mobile, Alabama, will greatly benefit once we have free trade and fair trade with a Democratic Cuba. I yield to the gentleman from Mobile, Alabama. Mr. BYRNE. I thank the gentlewoman, both for your time and for your leadership on this very important issue. As she said, I represent Mobile, Alabama. If you go and look at a map, it is a straight shot north from Havana to Mobile. For over three centuries, Mobile has been a major port for the export of goods and import of goods back and forth between Cuba and the United States. It is in the economic best interest of the people in my district for us to get to the point where we have normalized relations and trade with Cuba. I should be ardently in favor of this deal that the President is pursuing, but I am not. This is not the time, these are not the circumstances, and--to put it simply--this is not the way to do this. Let me address the way for a moment. It has been alluded to previously that we have done deals with China and with Vietnam. In both cases, the Presidents involved worked with Congress. That is critically important to whatever success they have had in both of those deals. In this circumstance, the President has refused to work with Congress. You can't reach the sort of agreement that he is looking for without Congress. You can't have an embassy unless we are willing to pay for it. You can't have an ambassador unless the Senate approves the ambassador. He is pursuing what, in essence, is an errand that cannot result in success that he is looking for, but he is pursuing it anyway without us because this is just another example of these efforts to make these unilateral, executive-type decisions, leaving Congress to decide to try to keep itself relevant as he becomes a lameduck President. That is no way to do this. Let me address the circumstances. I can't say it any better than the prior speakers have said it. This is a brutally oppressive regime that cannot change, and until they change, until they put in motion the things that we are talking about for change, I don't see how a country like the United States can seriously engage in negotiations with them. Most importantly, for me, from my perspective, I serve on the House Armed Services Committee--I don't think I have to tell everybody here the history of this country--this country with this regime in charge allowed the then-Soviet Union to put nuclear missiles aimed at the United States on their soil. They have never apologized for that; they have never renounced that. As we heard earlier, just a year ago, they were caught redhanded in an arms deal with the North Koreans, who are presently enemies of the United States. What sort of assurance do we have as part of this deal that Cuba is not going to be a staging ground for military activity, terrorist activity, against the people and the security of the United States of America? Nothing, nothing; yet we engaged in this deal, a very bad deal from my perspective--and I don't want to take anything away from the American citizen who we were able to bring back home--but look who we traded in return for that. It reminds me of the Bergdahl deal we had last year that was so very controversial. This administration doesn't know how to make a good deal. They know how to give everything away and get very little back. I want to normalize relationships with Cuba. I want us to open up that trade again because it is going to benefit my district. I am willing to do anything I can to help make that happen, but this country should never give in to people like the Castro brothers until there is a change in that regime, until there is a change in the Government of Cuba, until they renounce their activities that have been against the security of the United States, until we know that we have a good faith trading partner and a good faith partner, period, in this hemisphere. I look forward to the day when I can stand at the Port of Mobile and welcome goods coming in from Cuba and goods going out from Mobile to Cuba as part of a deal that is made in the right way, under the right circumstances, for the right reason. I hope and pray that that day comes, but that day is not today. I thank the gentlewoman for her leadership. I look forward to continuing to follow that leadership in the days to come. Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Thank you very much. I am so thankful to my good friend from Mobile, Alabama, for his words, because he understands that American principles are not for sale. I would like to point out, Mr. Speaker, that every country with whom the Castro brothers do business is a country to whom they owe a lot of money. They have not paid all of their bills to any businesses, and they have not paid what they owe to any country, and it would be all the same for Mobile, Alabama. Thank you for standing up for U.S. values. Now, I am so pleased to yield to my good friend from South Carolina, a gentleman who understands the threat to our hemisphere. Why? Because he is the chairman of the Subcommittee on Western Hemisphere, the gentleman from South Carolina (Mr. Duncan), my good friend. Mr. DUNCAN of South Carolina. I thank the gentlewoman from Florida for her leadership on this issue, not just today, but for her whole tenure in Congress. [[Page H217]] As the new chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on the Western Hemisphere, I was grateful to see the return of Alan Gross to the United States last month after 5 years of unjust imprisonment in Cuba. The announcement over this past weekend that the Cubans freed 53 prisoners was also welcome news. Nevertheless, I have major concerns with the way this administration, the Obama administration, conducted negotiations and the way the decision was made to radically alter longstanding U.S. policy towards Cuba. The administration failed to consult Congress, failed to consult any Cuban dissidents or civil society in its decision to embark on its new course in Cuba. The administration says this decision will empower the Cuban people; yet softening U.S. policy without concrete Cuban reforms will only boost the Castro regime and government and facilitate the survival of the communist regime. We need to focus not on what is best for the Cuban Government, the Castro regime, we need to focus on what is best for the Cuban people. I ask you this: Will this deal mean more self-governance for the Cuban people? Will it mean more economic freedom for those who strive to innovate, those that are entrepreneurial within the Cuban society? Will they be able to start more businesses and have economic freedom? Will there be more religious freedom for the Cuban people? Will there be more rights to free speech? Are the Cuban people seeing this debate tonight on Cuban TV? Are the Cuban people able to access the Internet and watch what we are doing via YouTube or any other media? These are rhetorical questions, but I answer them with ``no,'' based on my understanding. I recall it was only 1 week after the announcement of this U.S.-Cuba deal that the Cuban Government cracked down on peaceful protestors in Havana's Revolutionary Square. I point to that as evidence that it is still a closed communistic society. In conclusion, the administration's decision is a reward to the communist dictatorship at the expense of the Cuban people. This action is especially disgraceful when we consider the administration's disrespect toward our friend and ally in Canada by vowing to veto legislation approving the construction of the Keystone pipeline. These are issues that require vigorous congressional oversight. I look forward to working with the ranking member, Mr. Sires, that you just heard from, as we hold hearings in the Subcommittee on the Western Hemisphere in the coming weeks and month. Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Thank you so much, Mr. Duncan. We are so pleased that we have this dynamic duo of the chairman and the ranking member of Western Hemisphere. You are so right to point out, Mr. Duncan, that there is no freedom of the press in Cuba. That is one of the many freedoms that Cuban people are denied. Now, I yield to my colleague from Florida, Congressman Ron DeSantis, who is a war veteran, but who understands that the war for freedom and democracy takes on many fronts, a member of our House Foreign Affairs Committee. Mr. DeSANTIS. Mr. Speaker, I would just like to recognize my colleague from Florida because she is just not only on the House floor fighting for freedom for the Cuban people, with whom she obviously has ancestral relations, she fights for freedom for everybody. Whether it is in Venezuela or Iran, she is there; you can set your clock to it. When I first heard about these concessions, I was really scratching my head. I texted some of my colleagues, and I was like: ``We are not really getting anything for this.'' Sure enough, Raul Castro goes out, talks to the people, and says: ``We are not changing. We are not changing anything.'' They are staying exactly with the values that they have been with from the beginning, which are antagonistic to freedom, antagonistic to everything we hold dear in the United States. {time} 2100 You know, when you look at countries like Cuba, a lot of times you don't even need to get into the nitty-gritty. There are just certain signs where you know the nature of the regime. For example, when you look at communism in Eastern Europe, you don't have to look at the daily life or any of that. You just look at the fact that there was a Berlin Wall that kept people in like caged animals. If you look at the differences between North and South Korea, all you have to do is look at that satellite photo at night, where South Korea is lit up like a Christmas tree and North Korea is a land of darkness and despair. For me, when I think of what is the nature of the Cuban regime, I think all you need to know is that you have tens of thousands of people living in Cuba. It is a nice island, it has great weather, and they are suffocated so much that they are willing to swim across 90 miles of shark-infested waters--the Florida Straits--knowing that they are probably going to die. That is all you need to know. This is a Stalinist regime. And as my colleague from Alabama mentioned, the Cuban missile crisis wasn't even just that there were nuclear weapons in Cuba pointed at the United States. Fidel Castro was telling Khrushchev to fire them into the United States. We actually were fortunate that Nikita Khrushchev was actually the cooler head in that. So if Castro had his way, there would have been nuclear weapons sent here. And so this is the nature of the regime. So what are you doing with this policy? To me, I look at it very simply. I think this fact is true. Every single dollar spent in Cuba benefits the Castro regime. Every single dollar. Europe doesn't have restrictions. Most of the other world doesn't have restrictions. Have the Cuban people benefited from that? Has their standard of living gone up? No. This all goes to benefit the government. To me, this is the worst possible time to throw the Castro regime a lifeline. If you look at what is happening in Caracas, if you look at what is happening in Moscow, these regimes are buckling because of the decline in the price of oil. So this is a moment of profound weakness for the Castro regime. And giving them these concessions is exactly what the Castro regime wants. I am scratching my head trying to figure out: What do we get in return for this? The Americans who had property seized when Castro took power, are any of them getting their property back? No. What about the Cuban Americans who had to flee? They had their businesses taken, property taken. Are any of them going to get any type of recompense? Of course, not. What about freedom of speech, political rights, the ability to participate in political life and criticize those in power? Is that being extended to the Cuban people? Not on your life. Nothing. I will say, it is interesting--and my colleague from Florida mentioned this--the dismal credit rating that Cuba has. They don't pay back any loans. Are we then going to extend Export-Import Bank loans that are backed by the taxpayer to do business in Cuba? The American taxpayer is going to have to end up paying for that. That is not a good source of business for our taxpayers. The tragedy of this is we have given away leverage that could have come in handy. These Castro brothers are on their last legs. When they finally leave the scene, we want to use the leverage we have to leverage a democratic transition. Instead, we are essentially normalizing status quo. So if the Stalinist dictatorship survives beyond the Castros due to U.S. support, you are going to have 11 million Cubans who are consigned to another generation of tyranny. I will just say one more thing. When I read the media coverage--and I think I can say this because I am not from south Florida--the coverage is so negative about Cuban Americans who fled Castro. They say: Oh, they're living in the past. This is anachronistic, all this stuff. For me, the people that I want to talk to to know the true nature of the regime are the people who suffered under the regime, the people who were forced to flee and who had family members killed, had family members in prison. That, to me, is the number one source of information that I would look to. [[Page H218]] And so the media frames it as if somehow the American policy is anachronistic. I think it is the Castro regime, based on Stalinist principles, that is anachronistic, and yet it continues to lumber on. And the tragedy of this is that we are giving them a critical lifeline so that they can continue having their country governed like a political prison. So I appreciate you organizing this, my colleague in Florida. We are giving speeches here tonight, but we need to act in this body, and we need to show that this policy does not represent the will of the American people and does not represent what is best for people in Cuba that are struggling for freedom. Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Thank you so much, Mr. DeSantis. You are so right when you categorized this unilateral bad deal as an economic lifeline to the Castro regime. A person who understands that just as well as you do is our next speaker, the gentleman from Iowa, a senior member of the House Committee on Agriculture, Congressman Steve King. He can say: Hey, my State is going to benefit a lot by this deal. The sad reality, as Mr. King and I know, is that Castro doesn't pay his debt. As we had just said with the other speaker, he owes everybody money. This deal will not strengthen U.S. national security. It will not be good for America's farmers, and it will not be good for the people of Cuba. Congressman King. Mr. KING of Iowa. I thank the gentlewoman from Florida for organizing this Special Order, and I associate myself with her words and her position and also that of the gentleman from Florida (Mr. DeSantis). I didn't, Mr. Speaker, realize how much was in him about this issue. It was instructive for me to listen to that stream forward. I have had the privilege of serving here in this Congress with a good number of Members that do a great job of representing the interests of the Cuban people, and I also had the privilege of going to Cuba on a legal trip some years ago before I came to this Congress. But I would take you back, Mr. Speaker, to a time in 1959 and trace some of this history. The revolution against Batista in 1959 was back before we had as many replays on television as we have today. And I recall watching the revolution in Cuba, and as Castro took over, as the promise came that they were going to bring democracy to Cuba--that was the promise. It was going to be democracy; it was going to be free and fair elections, a government of, by, and for the people of Cuba; and they were going to choose their leadership. But I remember seeing on television the videos of the people who were lined up against the wall and executed without a proper trial, executed without true justice. I remember in particular--it is branded in my memory--a man who insisted: If you are to shoot me here in front of this wall, let me give the order for my own execution. And he stood there in a Cuban shirt down to here--white pants, white shirt--and he raised his hand and faced the firing squad and dropped his own hand. That was the signal to the firing squad. They fired. He was shot to death in front of that wall, along with many, many others. We don't know at this point how many political prisoners have been executed, how many have died in custody. We have got a list of some; we don't have a list of all. But we know this: it has never been, since that time in 1959, a government of, by, and for the people of Cuba. And the hope that there will be the day that the Cuban people would be free was manifested--or at least attempted to be manifested--at the Bay of Pigs. I would have liked to have seen the air cover that would have made that be successful. We didn't get that. But we look for the day to come ever since that the Cuban people could be free. The Cuban people could be free. Since that time, there has been the nationalization of the real property, which we heard from Mr. DeSantis. At the time that Castro took control of Cuba, 25 percent of the real estate in Cuba was owned by Americans. They held deeds to that property. There was other land in Cuba that was owned by people from other nationalities. Every other country was compensated for their real estate, except Americans. No American that I know of has been compensated for their real estate. They hold those deeds to this today, sometimes a second generation. Before I came to this Congress, while I was there, there was also a situation where the exchange rate for Cuban peso to dollar was 21 to 1 at that time. And so if anyone achieved an American dollar, they could take it into a dollar store and they would get one peso's worth of goods for it or they could deposit it into a Cuban bank and they would get one peso for that. That is a 20-peso difference. And that is one of the things that supported the Castro regime financially. Another thing that happened was sugar was 6 cents a pound. The Russians paid them 52 cents a pound in oil for the sugar. That was a subsidy of Cuba. When the Soviet Union--it was the Soviet Union rather than just the Russians--collapsed, then the subsidy for Cuba also collapsed and the Cuban economy was no longer propped up. You saw Russian tractors sitting out there, having been stripped for parts, in the only country in the world I know that had gone from mechanized agriculture to animal husbandry agriculture because their machines no longer worked. And the taxicabs are driven by doctors, with a five-cylinder Russian diesel under the hood of a 1954 Chevrolet. This country has been frozen in time. It has a collapsed and failed economy. It has been propped up by the subsidy of, first, the Soviet Union, and then later on, the Venezuelans, who are collapsing, themselves, today. This is a country of people that are vigorous people. They are an outgoing, hardworking, I will say, gregarious people. I thought I would see people down there that had the thousand-yard hopeless stare. I am sure that exists. But I also saw people that worked hard and they kept their chin up and they kept a smile on their face. I thought, If these people could be unleashed, if they could be unleashed by the heartbeat of freedom, if we could just get them that opportunity to be who they are, they would become a very, very successful island and trading partner and a nation unto themselves and, one day, an ally of the United States. So my dream has been to help them with that opportunity, and my dream has been to one day swim ashore at the Bay of Pigs and walk out and wade onto a free Cuba, with a free Cuban. But, Mr. Speaker, the Cuban people have been burdened with more than five decades of Marxist slavery that they have had to face. And this policy of the President's that comes right on the cusp of what is likely the biological solution in Cuba, which would be the end of the Castro brothers that would come along naturally and the opportunity to bring about a regime change in Cuba, the President of the United States may well have handed Cuba another 50 years of living in Marxist slavery when he had just the opportunity for them to be free. So our policy here in this Congress, I am hopeful, is the policy that says: regime change in Cuba and a government of, by, and for the people of Cuba. And I, one day, hope and pray to do what I have said with my colleagues here and many others, and that is swim ashore at the Bay of Pigs and wade out on the shore of a free Cuba. God bless them all. Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Thank you so much, Mr. King. That is our fervent hope as well. And we work and we pray every day for that dream of a free Cuba to come alive. We thank you for your voice here tonight. Thank you, my good friend from Iowa. Mr. Speaker, many people talk about the last generation of Cuban exiles and how this is really not the dream of young Cuban Americans who were born here in the United States, reared here in the United States. They come from Cuban families, but they really don't much care about freedom and democracy and the land of their ancestors. This next speaker, Mr. Speaker, is a newly elected gentleman who understands that that search for a free and democratic Cuba is a yearning that lives very fervently in his heart, and that is the Congressman from West Virginia, Congressman Alex Mooney, who was born here, as American as apple pie, but comes from a proud lineage of Cuban American heritage. Thank you, Mr. Mooney. Mr. MOONEY of West Virginia. I want to thank Congresswoman Ileana [[Page H219]] Ros-Lehtinen for arranging this important Special Order to show solidarity with the Cuban people as they continue to live under an oppressive regime. Mr. Speaker, President Obama has senselessly yielded ground, with no stipulations for reform, to the Cuban regime, with the announcements of a secret deal going around Congress to ``normalize'' relations. This misguided grab for a legacy item has cost our country and the Cuban people a valuable bargaining chip for their freedom. Of course, this is yet another foreign policy failure or, more accurately, unilateral surrender from this administration. From the bright red line in Syria, which was crossed with impunity, to sending a secret message to President Putin that, ``After the election, I will be more flexible,'' to now rewarding tyrants in Cuba who continue to deny basic human rights to their oppressed citizens, President Obama has chosen wrong policies. The despotic government the President would normalize relations with has, for decades, sought to subjugate the Cuban people's appetite for freedom. The many realized American Dreams of Cuban refugees, including my mother, are a great testament to the greatness of the United States and our constitutional rights. As the beacon of freedom in the world, America must continue to use sensible policy to protect our values around the world and in our own backyard. {time} 2115 Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Thank you so much, Mr. Mooney. We are a better Congress for you being a part of it. Thank you so much for being proud of your American heritage and your Cuban American ancestry as well. So, welcome to Congress, sir. Mr. Speaker, I am about to introduce another millennial, another one of this younger generation of Cuban Americans who the press continues to say don't represent the desires of this new generation. Well, Carlos Curbelo is one of our newest elected officials. He was born here in the United States, doesn't know Cuba, and is less than 35 years old but understands that yearning for a free Cuba. We are so pleased as punch to have him here as a Member of our Congress. I yield to the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Curbelo). Mr. CURBELO of Florida. I thank the gentlelady for yielding, and I thank her for her tireless advocacy and work on this very, very important cause. Mr. Speaker, during the 56 years of the Cuban tragedy, also known as the Cuban Revolution, there had always been two constants. First, the nature of the Castro regime, a dictatorship that brutally represses its own people, and that aggressively opposes U.S. national security interests throughout the globe. That has not changed. The second was that, to varying degrees, the occupant of the White House had always been on the side of the Cuban people and in opposition to their oppressors, who for decades have collaborated with America's most dangerous allies. Today, this is, regrettably, no longer the case. By trading an American hostage, cruelly held by Cuba's dictators for 5 years, for three criminals convicted of spying against our government, including one who was serving a lifetime sentence for conspiring to murder American citizens, the President sent a message to our enemies that the United States can be extorted. What was the Cuban government's reward for holding an American hostage for 5 years? Three convicted spies and full diplomatic relations, plus an economic bailout for a financially and morally bankrupt regime. The men who rule Cuba today are the same men who had nuclear missiles installed on the island and pointed them at the United States, as my colleague from Alabama stated earlier. When they were cash-rich, they ran a robust military and deployed troops throughout the world to fight alongside our most dangerous enemies. They have trained and supported terrorist groups such as Colombia's FARC. They ordered three American citizens and one resident blown out of the sky in the tragic shootdown of February 24, 1996. A few months ago, they were caught shipping arms illegally to North Korea, and they collaborated with the Venezuelan government in last year's brutal crackdown, which resulted in the death of over 40 students. Human rights atrocities by the dictatorship against its people continue. The Castro regime consistently resorts to violence because they know it is the only way they can maintain control since the Cuban people are desperate to be free. The President's decision to ease sanctions only serves to bolster the dictatorship and its apparatus of repression. There is virtually no private sector in Cuba. More than 85 percent of Cubans work for government controlled-enterprises and earn less than $20 a month. Foreign investment doesn't benefit the average Cuban. Cubans that work for corporations with foreign capital are only allowed to keep 8 percent of their salaries. Cuban workers are, in effect, slaves of the dictatorship. Now, it is important to note, Mr. Speaker, President Obama's administration approved sanctions in recent months against Venezuela and North Korea. Why, then, is it rewarding an enemy of the United States just 90 miles from our shores that actively collaborates with both of these regimes? Why does the President insist on an incoherent foreign policy that too often rewards our enemies and punishes our allies? As other American Presidents have shown us in the past, peace through weakness and appeasement is not an effective strategy for dealing with Cuba's military dictatorship. We also have to ask ourselves, what kind of neighborhood do we want to live in? The Americas, the Western Hemisphere, is the American neighborhood of the world. What kind of standards do we want for this part of the world? Do we want to endorse the chronic abuse of human rights, the imprisonment of people who disagree? That is the nature of the Cuban government, and we, the United States of America and, by the way, the other nations of this hemisphere, have agreed that we support a democratic form of government, and that we want this part of the world to be free without exception. There is one glaring exception, and it is Cuba. Our sanctions policy, some say, well, it hasn't worked. Of course the sanctions have worked. The sanctions have denied billions and billions and billions of dollars to a regime that would use those profits to oppose our interests throughout the world. What did the regime do when it had resources? It had troops all over the world. It exported revolution. And if you don't know what exporting revolution means, in the context of Cuba, it means aggressively opposing American interests throughout the world. Today, we remember in a very special way, Mario Manuel de la Pena, Carlos Costa, Armando Alejandre, and Pablo Morales. These were the men who were brutally assassinated by the Cuban regime on February 24 of 1996. One of the spies was convicted of conspiring to murder these young men, three of whom were American citizens, and the other was a resident of our country. These four men are dead, and the Cuban spies are free. But it isn't too late, Mr. Speaker. The President still has time to get back on the right side of this issue and on the right side of history by standing against Cuba's dictators, with the victims of their brutality, and for a strong American foreign policy that advances our national security interests. Again, I want to thank my distinguished colleague from south Florida for her leadership. We have admired her for so many years for her work on this issue. Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Thank you so much, Mr. Curbelo. You are a fresh young voice, and I thank you and Mr. Mooney for being here tonight. Mr. Speaker I am so pleased to yield to a gentleman who understands what freedom is all about. He was one of the speech writers for our great President, Ronald Reagan. He is a senior member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee. In fact, he is the chairman of the Europe Subcommittee, and he is here tonight with one of his triplets, Christian, who wants to be an author and an inventor. I look at Christian, this new generation, and I think, what kind of life [[Page H220]] would he have under the communist tyranny of Cuba, as opposed to the freedom and democracy that we enjoy here? So with that, I am pleased as punch to yield to my good friend from California (Mr. Rohrabacher). Mr. ROHRABACHER. Thank you very much. America is about to send a message to the world exactly on whose side are we on, and I am very proud to stand here with my colleagues, standing on the side of liberty, of justice, of treating people decently, of government that serves the people rather than a systematic government that requires the people to serve them, the bureaucracy, the tyrants that hold power. That is what this is all about. Let's get an understanding of who this Castro gang is. Castro murdered the freedom fighters who overthrew the dictatorial government of Batista back in the 1950s. Castro, himself, took people out who had fought against the dictatorship of Batista and shot them in the head. These were people that risked their lives to bring democracy to Cuba, and this man co- opted their revolution. He has allied himself, over the years, with gangsters and tyrants throughout the world. He has had a safe haven for the drug dealers of Latin America, who look to him as the moderator of any disputes between these monstrous gangsters who murder each other and murder anyone who gets in their way. He has allied with these drug dealers. But also, during the cold war he was allied to the hilt to the communist movement throughout the world. He wanted his country to become a nuclear base to attack and drop nuclear bombs on the people of the United States. Let's not forget that. This is the man who wanted to kill Americans by the millions. For us now, oh, well, that is history; let bygones be bygones. Are you kidding me? This is the guy that we need to send a message to. When people have that much hatred of the United States, undermine the freedom of the people in of the world, we are not just going to sit aside and forgive him of these things. Oh, by the way, he is not even asking for forgiveness. The Castro regime is just saying, accept us as we are, a country that has had more political prisoners than almost any other country of this hemisphere, and we are just going to accept them as they are. Well, remember, when people were struggling during the cold war against communism, Castro was on the wrong side. During the cold war, he was the one who wanted to kill Americans by the millions by having Soviet missiles in his country. Finally, what does this agreement that this administration--what will be the effect of it? Oh, yeah, they say, we have been told, well, if you just have free trade people are going to get better. There is going to be liberalism. I call this the ``hug a Nazi, make a liberal'' theory. The fact is that Fidel Castro, just like the Chinese Communists, I might add, no matter how much trade we have, they will manipulate it so that the clique that is in power, the clique that has been able to monstrously oppress their own people, take that wealth, manipulate that wealth that is coming into the country to cement their own power. It is very clear what this man has and his clique have in mind, and that is continuing their oppression of the Cuban people. Let's not be partners to that. Let us again, stand for liberty, stand for justice. The Soviet Union has fallen. It is time for Castro and communism in Cuba to fall as well. Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Thank you so much, Mr. Rohrabacher. And you so rightly point out that hours after President Obama announced, in a shocking way, that we would resume diplomatic relations with Cuba and the Castro regime does not have to change, Raul Castro put on his military uniform and spoke to the oppressed island nation and said, hey, don't worry. We are not changing a thing. It is still the same failed regime. We got nothing from that deal. Mr. Speaker, I am so pleased to yield to the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Diaz-Balart), the chairman of the Appropriations Subcommittee on Transportation, Housing and Urban Development. I had the honor of serving with his older brother. I have the honor of serving with his youngest brother now, Mario. Born in the United States and, just like Carlos and Alex Mooney, Mr. Curbelo and Mr. Mooney, a gentleman who is 100 percent American and so proud of 100 percent of his Cuban ancestry. Thank you, Mario. Mr. DIAZ-BALART. Let me first thank you, Madam Chairwoman, for your leadership. As we heard tonight, your leadership in the cause of freedom does not stop at the shores of Cuba. Wherever there is repression and oppression, there is the clear concise voice of Chairwoman Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, as we have heard again tonight. Mr. Speaker, we have heard a lot. And I know that the time is getting short, but I want to quote somebody whom we have not quoted, as far as I remember here tonight, and this is President Obama. When Mr. Obama was running for President he stated what the right policy, what his policy would be to deal with the Cuban tyranny. He said: ``My policy towards Cuba will be guided by one word, `libertad'--freedom. And the road to freedom for all Cubans must begin with justice for Cuba's political prisoners, the right of free speech, a free press, freedom assembly, and it must lead to elections that are free and fair.'' Mr. Obama went on to say: ``I will maintain the embargo. It provides us with the leverage to present the regime with a clear choice. If you take significant steps towards democracy, beginning with the freedom of all--all--political prisoners,'' Mr. Obama said, ``we will take steps to begin normalizing relations. That is the way to bring about real change in Cuba,'' Mr. Obama said, ``through strong, smart principled democracy.'' {time} 2130 Mr. Speaker, in essence, that day, then-candidate Obama, Senator Obama, and now-President Obama drew a red line about what the right policy was to deal with the Cuban regime; sadly, on December 17, President Obama announced that he was breaking that promise, that he was, once again, crossing--breaking--his own red line. We have heard tonight that we have also heard from the vast majority of the pro-democracy leaders within the island who are struggling. They have objected to President Obama's change of policy. Mr. Speaker, if President Obama doesn't want to do it for the sake of a future of freedom for the Cuban people, he should stand firm for the sake of the national security interests of the United States. As we have heard today--right now, as we speak, not 50 years ago--the Cuban regime harbors fugitives from American law, including cop killers and terrorists. What is President Obama's answer? ``No problem, we will normalize relations.'' The Cuban regime has an active espionage network against the interests of the United States. What is the President's answer to that? ``No problem, we will normalize. You can continue to do that.'' The Cuban regime shot down two American airplanes in international airspace; and for the people who are in prison, including one who was in prison for conspiracy to murder, not only is it okay--no problem, we will normalize--but no. We will send them back. You can go back home. Mr. Speaker, the night is late, but I know and I am confident that, unlike President Obama, this Congress will continue to stand firm with the cause of freedom and the cause of a free Cuba, even while President Obama does not. Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Thank you so much, Mr. Diaz-Balart. You so eloquently stated that. We have so much to say, and we have run out of time. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair will remind Members not to refer to guests on the floor of the House. [[Page H221]] ____________________","Congressional Record, Volume 161 Issue 5 (Monday, January 12, 2015) [Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 5 (Monday, January 12, 2015)] [House] [Pages H214-H221] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] OPPOSING RAPPROCHEMENT WITH CUBA The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Carter of Georgia). Under the Speaker's announced policy of January 6, 2015, the gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. Ros-Lehtinen) is recognized for 60 minutes as the designee of the majority leader. Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, I am so humbled and pleased to see my colleagues who have turned out tonight at this late hour in a bipartisan manner to say that we reject the President's ill-advised treatment of the policy of rapprochement with the Cuban regime, and no one is better able and better equipped to talk about freedom and democracy and our fight for justice than Mr. Chabot. I yield to the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Chabot), a senior member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee and chairman of the House Small Business Committee. Mr. CHABOT. Mr. Speaker, I rise this evening to join with my colleague and friend, Congresswoman Ros-Lehtinen, in opposition to the December 17 announcement by President Obama to change U.S. policy toward Cuba. We will also be joined by some of our other colleagues, and I want to particularly thank Congresswoman Ros-Lehtinen for her leadership on all issues regarding Cuba. She has been a leader on this issue for a long, long time and will continue to be, I am sure. This policy change was a unilateral decision made without consulting Congress and with complete disregard of long-term national security consequences. Similarly, the so-called prisoner exchange was terribly flawed. In 2013, Secretary Kerry stated that swapping convicted Cuban spies for Alan Gross was off the table, testifying before Congress that since Mr. Gross was wrongly imprisoned, there was no equivalency to pursue a spy for spy tradeoff. Let us be clear: the freedom of Alan Gross is welcome news, but this exchange was totally one-sided. It was tragically flawed. It was not in the best interest of the people of the United States, and it was not in the best interest of the people of Cuba. As my colleague, Representative Ros-Lehtinen, has rightly highlighted these past few weeks since the decision and the prisoner exchange occurred, Cuban spies have been responsible for the deaths of American lives. It is absolutely true that they have been. And they have been released. Those are the people who were responsible for American deaths. Cuban patriots who have risked their lives every day to fight for basic rights and freedoms feel betrayed. The exchange was flawed. The policy itself is flawed, and the announcement [[Page H215]] has also let down one of the United States' strongest ally in the world, Israel. Year after year, Israel has stood at the United States' side--one of the very few--supporting the United States at the United Nations in 98 percent of all votes, including votes that the world's worst actors pushed through to condemn the U.S. embargo on Cuba. Unfortunately, those who have long nourished and fostered cozy relationships with Cuba, most notably Russia and Venezuela and various terrorist organizations around the world, are welcoming the policy changes with open arms. We need to be honest about the implications of President Obama's new policy. His unilateral decision to change Cuba policy poses a threat to U.S. national security. If the trade embargo is lifted, money will flow into the hands of the Castro brothers, allowing them to financially support surreptitious espionage activities with terrorist groups like Hezbollah and nations like North Korea. Since the President made his public announcement, nearly 100 Cubans have already been detained. The United States should always stand for democracy and freedom around the world. We should demand that the Castro regime release all political prisoners and hold free and fair elections before establishing diplomatic relations. I once again thank the gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. Ros-Lehtinen) for her leadership in this area for many, many years, and it is an honor to speak this evening with her. Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. I thank the gentleman from Ohio very much, and thank you for looking out for our U.S. national security, and thank you for trying to uphold the values of freedom throughout the world. Mr. Chabot brought up the fact that Mr. Kerry, speaking before our committee, said that we would not release spies for Alan Gross' life. And that came because of a question posed by our next speaker, and I am pleased to yield to the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Sires), the ranking member of the House Subcommittee on the Western Hemisphere. Mr. SIRES. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for allowing me to speak tonight. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to express my disappointment and deep concerns regarding the administration's plan for loosening the sanctions and initiating diplomatic discussions with the Cuban dictatorship. It is naive and misguided to think that this is going to give us the long-desired political and economic changes that the Cuban people deserve. In fact, just a few days after the announcement, Raul Castro made sure to dispel any misgivings and brazenly declared that the regime would not abandon its communist path, let alone loosen its stranglehold over the people of Cuba. I feel that the administration has abandoned all those Cuban people for all those years who fought for human rights and democracy in Cuba. I feel that those people who are still lingering in the Cuban jails are so disappointed in this administration's efforts. You know, the Alan Gross release should have been something joyous. And we all wanted Alan Gross released because he was incarcerated for no reason other than he was foreign. But to release three Cuban spies or a network of spies that exists in this country currently is just not acceptable. Alan Gross should have been released on his own. He did nothing. He just went to Cuba to establish some sort of communication for this community. The other thing that is troubling me, coming from New Jersey, is the fact that there was no discussion about any extradition of the criminals that are currently in Cuba. There are over 100 criminals in Cuba, including Joanne Chesimard, who killed a State trooper in New Jersey point blank 30 years ago. She escaped to Cuba. She has been enjoying the sun, she has been enjoying the beach. Meanwhile, Trooper Werner Foerster's family for over 30 years grew up without a father. And yet we can't seem to get this government to think that it is important that we bring these people to justice. As a matter of fact, the FBI has named Joanne Chesimard as number one in the list of terrorists that they want back. So to me it was very disappointing because the people of New Jersey, after all these years, are still trying to bring this woman to justice. People tell me, well, we negotiate and we trade with Vietnam, we trade with China. We trade with other countries. And I say this: that is not the island that I want in Cuba. We haven't helped Vietnam's people at all. There is still no freedom, and there are human rights abuses. You look at China, it is the same thing. You look at North Korea, it is the same thing. I don't want that for the island where I was born. And I surely don't want that kind of government 90 miles away from this country. You know, the history of Cuba, all in the past 50 years of this dictatorship, has been one to try to hurt this country as much as it can, and I certainly don't want that 90 miles from this country. The administration with this effort has taken away what we believe was a pressure point on a communist dictatorship 90 miles from this country. It has taken away how we can pressure this island. First of all, Russia can't help them any more. Russia used to help Cuba to the tune of $4 billion a year. Venezuela can't any more. Venezuela is falling apart. There are 30,000 Cubans in Venezuela trying to create the same type of country that we have in Cuba. And at this point, we take away this pressure and basically give millions of dollars to this dictatorship. People may not know it, but any time anybody sends any money to Cuba, the Cuban government keeps 30 percent of it. So if you raised it from $500 to $2,000, you tell me how many millions that is going to be. When you go to all of the beaches and to the restaurants, that is all government owned. In Cuba, if you want to set up a business, you have to negotiate with the government. If I want to set up a business and I need 100 workers, I don't go out and get 100 workers, I go out and speak to the government and the government tells me you have to pay $15 an hour. They in turn give those workers $2-3 an hour. That is not helping the Cuban people in their economics. That is not helping them move forward. So I think it is really naive to think that these kinds of changes are going to help. You know, I can only think back when I was young, and I came to this country at the age of 11. I remember when they took all of the books out of the school system and started the indoctrination process. I remember the military coming into my house and they took inventory. My mother and father were poor people, but they took inventory of everything that was in the house. And they threatened my parents that if anything was missing at the time we got our visa, it would be revoked. This is not the country that I want for Cuba. I want a country with democracy. I want a country where human rights are observed. And yet, for 50 years this dictatorship has been killing. People talk about Raul Castro as some sort of a changer. People forget that Raul Castro and Che Guevara were the ones who set up the firing squads in Cuba that killed thousands of people. Thousands of people were killed by the firing squads. So I rise today in total disappointment, and I hope that this administration sees that this is not the way forward, that this is a hardened dictatorship, and that the only way we can deal with this dictatorship is through pressure. Through pressure is the only way to deal with these people, especially at this time. There is nobody that is going to come out and bail out Cuba. {time} 2045 Just last year, they were funneling arms to North Korea right in our backyard. Is this the kind of government we want 90 miles from our shores? I thank my good friends for having this hour, allowing me to express my sentiments, and I thank all my colleagues who are here speaking with the same approach. Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, as you heard from Mr. Sires, he was born and reared in Cuba, but you don't have to be a Cuban American to understand the principles that are at stake here. One person who knows that is a wonderful congressman from our great State of Florida. So I am proud to yield to the gentleman from Florida, Gus Bilirakis. Mr. BILIRAKIS. Thank you for holding this very important Special Order. [[Page H216]] Way back in the Florida Legislature, when I was a member of the Cuban Caucus, so proud to be a member of the Cuban Caucus, I started speaking out against the Castro brothers' brand of oppression. Over the past 5 years, I joined with all of you to decry Alan Gross' arrest. I am thankful for his recent release. Alan Gross' freedom was long overdue, we all agree. I am glad he is safely on U.S. soil, but a large injustice remains: the plights of Cuban citizens, who have suffered for over five decades under the Castro regime in search of basic human rights and political freedoms that we as Americans, frankly, take for granted. Then, almost out of nowhere, the Obama administration decides to normalize relations with Cuba. This will allow American dollars to the rescue of the Castro brothers at a critical time. Their normal economic benefactors--Russia and Venezuela--cannot afford to help. Now, more than ever, economic sanctions can be used as an effective tool to force the Castro regime to afford basic human rights and political freedoms to all of Cuba's citizens. Scholars have noted that normalizing our economic policy with oppressive countries, like China or Vietnam, have produced no significant improvements in human rights treatment. Given the precedent, there is no reason to believe the situation with Cuba will yield significant different results. In fact, we already know that the suffering for Cuba's citizens will continue, unfortunately. Raul Castro proclaimed that there would be no renunciation of any of their principles. Cuban restrictions on free speech, assembly, and press will remain. They proved it just this last week. Travel and tourism will remain strictly controlled by the Castro regime. Tourism dollars that Americans will spend will go directly to the oppressors. We cannot ignore the sense of betrayal that Cuban defectors feel in response to the President's plan. We should be demanding genuine freedom: release of all political prisoners, universal human rights, Democratic principles, and a free market for the Cuban people. In order to ensure the citizens of Cuba stand a chance to benefit from this ill-advised agreement, Cuba's despots must relinquish control and eradicate their tools of tyranny. Actual human rights reforms must occur before any commercial or political normalization takes place. I will continue to monitor the actions on the island in search of positive movement. Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Mr. Bilirakis, I thank you for your clear and consistent message that restrictions should not be lifted against the Castro regime until those conditions are met. Our next speaker, Mr. Speaker, is the gentleman from Alabama, Congressman Bradley Byrne, who so understands that good trade is based on free and fair countries that cherish the principles upon which our great country was founded--freedom, democracy, respect for the rule of law--all of which are missing in today's Cuba. His great city of Mobile, Alabama, will greatly benefit once we have free trade and fair trade with a Democratic Cuba. I yield to the gentleman from Mobile, Alabama. Mr. BYRNE. I thank the gentlewoman, both for your time and for your leadership on this very important issue. As she said, I represent Mobile, Alabama. If you go and look at a map, it is a straight shot north from Havana to Mobile. For over three centuries, Mobile has been a major port for the export of goods and import of goods back and forth between Cuba and the United States. It is in the economic best interest of the people in my district for us to get to the point where we have normalized relations and trade with Cuba. I should be ardently in favor of this deal that the President is pursuing, but I am not. This is not the time, these are not the circumstances, and--to put it simply--this is not the way to do this. Let me address the way for a moment. It has been alluded to previously that we have done deals with China and with Vietnam. In both cases, the Presidents involved worked with Congress. That is critically important to whatever success they have had in both of those deals. In this circumstance, the President has refused to work with Congress. You can't reach the sort of agreement that he is looking for without Congress. You can't have an embassy unless we are willing to pay for it. You can't have an ambassador unless the Senate approves the ambassador. He is pursuing what, in essence, is an errand that cannot result in success that he is looking for, but he is pursuing it anyway without us because this is just another example of these efforts to make these unilateral, executive-type decisions, leaving Congress to decide to try to keep itself relevant as he becomes a lameduck President. That is no way to do this. Let me address the circumstances. I can't say it any better than the prior speakers have said it. This is a brutally oppressive regime that cannot change, and until they change, until they put in motion the things that we are talking about for change, I don't see how a country like the United States can seriously engage in negotiations with them. Most importantly, for me, from my perspective, I serve on the House Armed Services Committee--I don't think I have to tell everybody here the history of this country--this country with this regime in charge allowed the then-Soviet Union to put nuclear missiles aimed at the United States on their soil. They have never apologized for that; they have never renounced that. As we heard earlier, just a year ago, they were caught redhanded in an arms deal with the North Koreans, who are presently enemies of the United States. What sort of assurance do we have as part of this deal that Cuba is not going to be a staging ground for military activity, terrorist activity, against the people and the security of the United States of America? Nothing, nothing; yet we engaged in this deal, a very bad deal from my perspective--and I don't want to take anything away from the American citizen who we were able to bring back home--but look who we traded in return for that. It reminds me of the Bergdahl deal we had last year that was so very controversial. This administration doesn't know how to make a good deal. They know how to give everything away and get very little back. I want to normalize relationships with Cuba. I want us to open up that trade again because it is going to benefit my district. I am willing to do anything I can to help make that happen, but this country should never give in to people like the Castro brothers until there is a change in that regime, until there is a change in the Government of Cuba, until they renounce their activities that have been against the security of the United States, until we know that we have a good faith trading partner and a good faith partner, period, in this hemisphere. I look forward to the day when I can stand at the Port of Mobile and welcome goods coming in from Cuba and goods going out from Mobile to Cuba as part of a deal that is made in the right way, under the right circumstances, for the right reason. I hope and pray that that day comes, but that day is not today. I thank the gentlewoman for her leadership. I look forward to continuing to follow that leadership in the days to come. Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Thank you very much. I am so thankful to my good friend from Mobile, Alabama, for his words, because he understands that American principles are not for sale. I would like to point out, Mr. Speaker, that every country with whom the Castro brothers do business is a country to whom they owe a lot of money. They have not paid all of their bills to any businesses, and they have not paid what they owe to any country, and it would be all the same for Mobile, Alabama. Thank you for standing up for U.S. values. Now, I am so pleased to yield to my good friend from South Carolina, a gentleman who understands the threat to our hemisphere. Why? Because he is the chairman of the Subcommittee on Western Hemisphere, the gentleman from South Carolina (Mr. Duncan), my good friend. Mr. DUNCAN of South Carolina. I thank the gentlewoman from Florida for her leadership on this issue, not just today, but for her whole tenure in Congress. [[Page H217]] As the new chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on the Western Hemisphere, I was grateful to see the return of Alan Gross to the United States last month after 5 years of unjust imprisonment in Cuba. The announcement over this past weekend that the Cubans freed 53 prisoners was also welcome news. Nevertheless, I have major concerns with the way this administration, the Obama administration, conducted negotiations and the way the decision was made to radically alter longstanding U.S. policy towards Cuba. The administration failed to consult Congress, failed to consult any Cuban dissidents or civil society in its decision to embark on its new course in Cuba. The administration says this decision will empower the Cuban people; yet softening U.S. policy without concrete Cuban reforms will only boost the Castro regime and government and facilitate the survival of the communist regime. We need to focus not on what is best for the Cuban Government, the Castro regime, we need to focus on what is best for the Cuban people. I ask you this: Will this deal mean more self-governance for the Cuban people? Will it mean more economic freedom for those who strive to innovate, those that are entrepreneurial within the Cuban society? Will they be able to start more businesses and have economic freedom? Will there be more religious freedom for the Cuban people? Will there be more rights to free speech? Are the Cuban people seeing this debate tonight on Cuban TV? Are the Cuban people able to access the Internet and watch what we are doing via YouTube or any other media? These are rhetorical questions, but I answer them with ``no,'' based on my understanding. I recall it was only 1 week after the announcement of this U.S.-Cuba deal that the Cuban Government cracked down on peaceful protestors in Havana's Revolutionary Square. I point to that as evidence that it is still a closed communistic society. In conclusion, the administration's decision is a reward to the communist dictatorship at the expense of the Cuban people. This action is especially disgraceful when we consider the administration's disrespect toward our friend and ally in Canada by vowing to veto legislation approving the construction of the Keystone pipeline. These are issues that require vigorous congressional oversight. I look forward to working with the ranking member, Mr. Sires, that you just heard from, as we hold hearings in the Subcommittee on the Western Hemisphere in the coming weeks and month. Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Thank you so much, Mr. Duncan. We are so pleased that we have this dynamic duo of the chairman and the ranking member of Western Hemisphere. You are so right to point out, Mr. Duncan, that there is no freedom of the press in Cuba. That is one of the many freedoms that Cuban people are denied. Now, I yield to my colleague from Florida, Congressman Ron DeSantis, who is a war veteran, but who understands that the war for freedom and democracy takes on many fronts, a member of our House Foreign Affairs Committee. Mr. DeSANTIS. Mr. Speaker, I would just like to recognize my colleague from Florida because she is just not only on the House floor fighting for freedom for the Cuban people, with whom she obviously has ancestral relations, she fights for freedom for everybody. Whether it is in Venezuela or Iran, she is there; you can set your clock to it. When I first heard about these concessions, I was really scratching my head. I texted some of my colleagues, and I was like: ``We are not really getting anything for this.'' Sure enough, Raul Castro goes out, talks to the people, and says: ``We are not changing. We are not changing anything.'' They are staying exactly with the values that they have been with from the beginning, which are antagonistic to freedom, antagonistic to everything we hold dear in the United States. {time} 2100 You know, when you look at countries like Cuba, a lot of times you don't even need to get into the nitty-gritty. There are just certain signs where you know the nature of the regime. For example, when you look at communism in Eastern Europe, you don't have to look at the daily life or any of that. You just look at the fact that there was a Berlin Wall that kept people in like caged animals. If you look at the differences between North and South Korea, all you have to do is look at that satellite photo at night, where South Korea is lit up like a Christmas tree and North Korea is a land of darkness and despair. For me, when I think of what is the nature of the Cuban regime, I think all you need to know is that you have tens of thousands of people living in Cuba. It is a nice island, it has great weather, and they are suffocated so much that they are willing to swim across 90 miles of shark-infested waters--the Florida Straits--knowing that they are probably going to die. That is all you need to know. This is a Stalinist regime. And as my colleague from Alabama mentioned, the Cuban missile crisis wasn't even just that there were nuclear weapons in Cuba pointed at the United States. Fidel Castro was telling Khrushchev to fire them into the United States. We actually were fortunate that Nikita Khrushchev was actually the cooler head in that. So if Castro had his way, there would have been nuclear weapons sent here. And so this is the nature of the regime. So what are you doing with this policy? To me, I look at it very simply. I think this fact is true. Every single dollar spent in Cuba benefits the Castro regime. Every single dollar. Europe doesn't have restrictions. Most of the other world doesn't have restrictions. Have the Cuban people benefited from that? Has their standard of living gone up? No. This all goes to benefit the government. To me, this is the worst possible time to throw the Castro regime a lifeline. If you look at what is happening in Caracas, if you look at what is happening in Moscow, these regimes are buckling because of the decline in the price of oil. So this is a moment of profound weakness for the Castro regime. And giving them these concessions is exactly what the Castro regime wants. I am scratching my head trying to figure out: What do we get in return for this? The Americans who had property seized when Castro took power, are any of them getting their property back? No. What about the Cuban Americans who had to flee? They had their businesses taken, property taken. Are any of them going to get any type of recompense? Of course, not. What about freedom of speech, political rights, the ability to participate in political life and criticize those in power? Is that being extended to the Cuban people? Not on your life. Nothing. I will say, it is interesting--and my colleague from Florida mentioned this--the dismal credit rating that Cuba has. They don't pay back any loans. Are we then going to extend Export-Import Bank loans that are backed by the taxpayer to do business in Cuba? The American taxpayer is going to have to end up paying for that. That is not a good source of business for our taxpayers. The tragedy of this is we have given away leverage that could have come in handy. These Castro brothers are on their last legs. When they finally leave the scene, we want to use the leverage we have to leverage a democratic transition. Instead, we are essentially normalizing status quo. So if the Stalinist dictatorship survives beyond the Castros due to U.S. support, you are going to have 11 million Cubans who are consigned to another generation of tyranny. I will just say one more thing. When I read the media coverage--and I think I can say this because I am not from south Florida--the coverage is so negative about Cuban Americans who fled Castro. They say: Oh, they're living in the past. This is anachronistic, all this stuff. For me, the people that I want to talk to to know the true nature of the regime are the people who suffered under the regime, the people who were forced to flee and who had family members killed, had family members in prison. That, to me, is the number one source of information that I would look to. [[Page H218]] And so the media frames it as if somehow the American policy is anachronistic. I think it is the Castro regime, based on Stalinist principles, that is anachronistic, and yet it continues to lumber on. And the tragedy of this is that we are giving them a critical lifeline so that they can continue having their country governed like a political prison. So I appreciate you organizing this, my colleague in Florida. We are giving speeches here tonight, but we need to act in this body, and we need to show that this policy does not represent the will of the American people and does not represent what is best for people in Cuba that are struggling for freedom. Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Thank you so much, Mr. DeSantis. You are so right when you categorized this unilateral bad deal as an economic lifeline to the Castro regime. A person who understands that just as well as you do is our next speaker, the gentleman from Iowa, a senior member of the House Committee on Agriculture, Congressman Steve King. He can say: Hey, my State is going to benefit a lot by this deal. The sad reality, as Mr. King and I know, is that Castro doesn't pay his debt. As we had just said with the other speaker, he owes everybody money. This deal will not strengthen U.S. national security. It will not be good for America's farmers, and it will not be good for the people of Cuba. Congressman King. Mr. KING of Iowa. I thank the gentlewoman from Florida for organizing this Special Order, and I associate myself with her words and her position and also that of the gentleman from Florida (Mr. DeSantis). I didn't, Mr. Speaker, realize how much was in him about this issue. It was instructive for me to listen to that stream forward. I have had the privilege of serving here in this Congress with a good number of Members that do a great job of representing the interests of the Cuban people, and I also had the privilege of going to Cuba on a legal trip some years ago before I came to this Congress. But I would take you back, Mr. Speaker, to a time in 1959 and trace some of this history. The revolution against Batista in 1959 was back before we had as many replays on television as we have today. And I recall watching the revolution in Cuba, and as Castro took over, as the promise came that they were going to bring democracy to Cuba--that was the promise. It was going to be democracy; it was going to be free and fair elections, a government of, by, and for the people of Cuba; and they were going to choose their leadership. But I remember seeing on television the videos of the people who were lined up against the wall and executed without a proper trial, executed without true justice. I remember in particular--it is branded in my memory--a man who insisted: If you are to shoot me here in front of this wall, let me give the order for my own execution. And he stood there in a Cuban shirt down to here--white pants, white shirt--and he raised his hand and faced the firing squad and dropped his own hand. That was the signal to the firing squad. They fired. He was shot to death in front of that wall, along with many, many others. We don't know at this point how many political prisoners have been executed, how many have died in custody. We have got a list of some; we don't have a list of all. But we know this: it has never been, since that time in 1959, a government of, by, and for the people of Cuba. And the hope that there will be the day that the Cuban people would be free was manifested--or at least attempted to be manifested--at the Bay of Pigs. I would have liked to have seen the air cover that would have made that be successful. We didn't get that. But we look for the day to come ever since that the Cuban people could be free. The Cuban people could be free. Since that time, there has been the nationalization of the real property, which we heard from Mr. DeSantis. At the time that Castro took control of Cuba, 25 percent of the real estate in Cuba was owned by Americans. They held deeds to that property. There was other land in Cuba that was owned by people from other nationalities. Every other country was compensated for their real estate, except Americans. No American that I know of has been compensated for their real estate. They hold those deeds to this today, sometimes a second generation. Before I came to this Congress, while I was there, there was also a situation where the exchange rate for Cuban peso to dollar was 21 to 1 at that time. And so if anyone achieved an American dollar, they could take it into a dollar store and they would get one peso's worth of goods for it or they could deposit it into a Cuban bank and they would get one peso for that. That is a 20-peso difference. And that is one of the things that supported the Castro regime financially. Another thing that happened was sugar was 6 cents a pound. The Russians paid them 52 cents a pound in oil for the sugar. That was a subsidy of Cuba. When the Soviet Union--it was the Soviet Union rather than just the Russians--collapsed, then the subsidy for Cuba also collapsed and the Cuban economy was no longer propped up. You saw Russian tractors sitting out there, having been stripped for parts, in the only country in the world I know that had gone from mechanized agriculture to animal husbandry agriculture because their machines no longer worked. And the taxicabs are driven by doctors, with a five-cylinder Russian diesel under the hood of a 1954 Chevrolet. This country has been frozen in time. It has a collapsed and failed economy. It has been propped up by the subsidy of, first, the Soviet Union, and then later on, the Venezuelans, who are collapsing, themselves, today. This is a country of people that are vigorous people. They are an outgoing, hardworking, I will say, gregarious people. I thought I would see people down there that had the thousand-yard hopeless stare. I am sure that exists. But I also saw people that worked hard and they kept their chin up and they kept a smile on their face. I thought, If these people could be unleashed, if they could be unleashed by the heartbeat of freedom, if we could just get them that opportunity to be who they are, they would become a very, very successful island and trading partner and a nation unto themselves and, one day, an ally of the United States. So my dream has been to help them with that opportunity, and my dream has been to one day swim ashore at the Bay of Pigs and walk out and wade onto a free Cuba, with a free Cuban. But, Mr. Speaker, the Cuban people have been burdened with more than five decades of Marxist slavery that they have had to face. And this policy of the President's that comes right on the cusp of what is likely the biological solution in Cuba, which would be the end of the Castro brothers that would come along naturally and the opportunity to bring about a regime change in Cuba, the President of the United States may well have handed Cuba another 50 years of living in Marxist slavery when he had just the opportunity for them to be free. So our policy here in this Congress, I am hopeful, is the policy that says: regime change in Cuba and a government of, by, and for the people of Cuba. And I, one day, hope and pray to do what I have said with my colleagues here and many others, and that is swim ashore at the Bay of Pigs and wade out on the shore of a free Cuba. God bless them all. Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Thank you so much, Mr. King. That is our fervent hope as well. And we work and we pray every day for that dream of a free Cuba to come alive. We thank you for your voice here tonight. Thank you, my good friend from Iowa. Mr. Speaker, many people talk about the last generation of Cuban exiles and how this is really not the dream of young Cuban Americans who were born here in the United States, reared here in the United States. They come from Cuban families, but they really don't much care about freedom and democracy and the land of their ancestors. This next speaker, Mr. Speaker, is a newly elected gentleman who understands that that search for a free and democratic Cuba is a yearning that lives very fervently in his heart, and that is the Congressman from West Virginia, Congressman Alex Mooney, who was born here, as American as apple pie, but comes from a proud lineage of Cuban American heritage. Thank you, Mr. Mooney. Mr. MOONEY of West Virginia. I want to thank Congresswoman Ileana [[Page H219]] Ros-Lehtinen for arranging this important Special Order to show solidarity with the Cuban people as they continue to live under an oppressive regime. Mr. Speaker, President Obama has senselessly yielded ground, with no stipulations for reform, to the Cuban regime, with the announcements of a secret deal going around Congress to ``normalize'' relations. This misguided grab for a legacy item has cost our country and the Cuban people a valuable bargaining chip for their freedom. Of course, this is yet another foreign policy failure or, more accurately, unilateral surrender from this administration. From the bright red line in Syria, which was crossed with impunity, to sending a secret message to President Putin that, ``After the election, I will be more flexible,'' to now rewarding tyrants in Cuba who continue to deny basic human rights to their oppressed citizens, President Obama has chosen wrong policies. The despotic government the President would normalize relations with has, for decades, sought to subjugate the Cuban people's appetite for freedom. The many realized American Dreams of Cuban refugees, including my mother, are a great testament to the greatness of the United States and our constitutional rights. As the beacon of freedom in the world, America must continue to use sensible policy to protect our values around the world and in our own backyard. {time} 2115 Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Thank you so much, Mr. Mooney. We are a better Congress for you being a part of it. Thank you so much for being proud of your American heritage and your Cuban American ancestry as well. So, welcome to Congress, sir. Mr. Speaker, I am about to introduce another millennial, another one of this younger generation of Cuban Americans who the press continues to say don't represent the desires of this new generation. Well, Carlos Curbelo is one of our newest elected officials. He was born here in the United States, doesn't know Cuba, and is less than 35 years old but understands that yearning for a free Cuba. We are so pleased as punch to have him here as a Member of our Congress. I yield to the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Curbelo). Mr. CURBELO of Florida. I thank the gentlelady for yielding, and I thank her for her tireless advocacy and work on this very, very important cause. Mr. Speaker, during the 56 years of the Cuban tragedy, also known as the Cuban Revolution, there had always been two constants. First, the nature of the Castro regime, a dictatorship that brutally represses its own people, and that aggressively opposes U.S. national security interests throughout the globe. That has not changed. The second was that, to varying degrees, the occupant of the White House had always been on the side of the Cuban people and in opposition to their oppressors, who for decades have collaborated with America's most dangerous allies. Today, this is, regrettably, no longer the case. By trading an American hostage, cruelly held by Cuba's dictators for 5 years, for three criminals convicted of spying against our government, including one who was serving a lifetime sentence for conspiring to murder American citizens, the President sent a message to our enemies that the United States can be extorted. What was the Cuban government's reward for holding an American hostage for 5 years? Three convicted spies and full diplomatic relations, plus an economic bailout for a financially and morally bankrupt regime. The men who rule Cuba today are the same men who had nuclear missiles installed on the island and pointed them at the United States, as my colleague from Alabama stated earlier. When they were cash-rich, they ran a robust military and deployed troops throughout the world to fight alongside our most dangerous enemies. They have trained and supported terrorist groups such as Colombia's FARC. They ordered three American citizens and one resident blown out of the sky in the tragic shootdown of February 24, 1996. A few months ago, they were caught shipping arms illegally to North Korea, and they collaborated with the Venezuelan government in last year's brutal crackdown, which resulted in the death of over 40 students. Human rights atrocities by the dictatorship against its people continue. The Castro regime consistently resorts to violence because they know it is the only way they can maintain control since the Cuban people are desperate to be free. The President's decision to ease sanctions only serves to bolster the dictatorship and its apparatus of repression. There is virtually no private sector in Cuba. More than 85 percent of Cubans work for government controlled-enterprises and earn less than $20 a month. Foreign investment doesn't benefit the average Cuban. Cubans that work for corporations with foreign capital are only allowed to keep 8 percent of their salaries. Cuban workers are, in effect, slaves of the dictatorship. Now, it is important to note, Mr. Speaker, President Obama's administration approved sanctions in recent months against Venezuela and North Korea. Why, then, is it rewarding an enemy of the United States just 90 miles from our shores that actively collaborates with both of these regimes? Why does the President insist on an incoherent foreign policy that too often rewards our enemies and punishes our allies? As other American Presidents have shown us in the past, peace through weakness and appeasement is not an effective strategy for dealing with Cuba's military dictatorship. We also have to ask ourselves, what kind of neighborhood do we want to live in? The Americas, the Western Hemisphere, is the American neighborhood of the world. What kind of standards do we want for this part of the world? Do we want to endorse the chronic abuse of human rights, the imprisonment of people who disagree? That is the nature of the Cuban government, and we, the United States of America and, by the way, the other nations of this hemisphere, have agreed that we support a democratic form of government, and that we want this part of the world to be free without exception. There is one glaring exception, and it is Cuba. Our sanctions policy, some say, well, it hasn't worked. Of course the sanctions have worked. The sanctions have denied billions and billions and billions of dollars to a regime that would use those profits to oppose our interests throughout the world. What did the regime do when it had resources? It had troops all over the world. It exported revolution. And if you don't know what exporting revolution means, in the context of Cuba, it means aggressively opposing American interests throughout the world. Today, we remember in a very special way, Mario Manuel de la Pena, Carlos Costa, Armando Alejandre, and Pablo Morales. These were the men who were brutally assassinated by the Cuban regime on February 24 of 1996. One of the spies was convicted of conspiring to murder these young men, three of whom were American citizens, and the other was a resident of our country. These four men are dead, and the Cuban spies are free. But it isn't too late, Mr. Speaker. The President still has time to get back on the right side of this issue and on the right side of history by standing against Cuba's dictators, with the victims of their brutality, and for a strong American foreign policy that advances our national security interests. Again, I want to thank my distinguished colleague from south Florida for her leadership. We have admired her for so many years for her work on this issue. Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Thank you so much, Mr. Curbelo. You are a fresh young voice, and I thank you and Mr. Mooney for being here tonight. Mr. Speaker I am so pleased to yield to a gentleman who understands what freedom is all about. He was one of the speech writers for our great President, Ronald Reagan. He is a senior member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee. In fact, he is the chairman of the Europe Subcommittee, and he is here tonight with one of his triplets, Christian, who wants to be an author and an inventor. I look at Christian, this new generation, and I think, what kind of life [[Page H220]] would he have under the communist tyranny of Cuba, as opposed to the freedom and democracy that we enjoy here? So with that, I am pleased as punch to yield to my good friend from California (Mr. Rohrabacher). Mr. ROHRABACHER. Thank you very much. America is about to send a message to the world exactly on whose side are we on, and I am very proud to stand here with my colleagues, standing on the side of liberty, of justice, of treating people decently, of government that serves the people rather than a systematic government that requires the people to serve them, the bureaucracy, the tyrants that hold power. That is what this is all about. Let's get an understanding of who this Castro gang is. Castro murdered the freedom fighters who overthrew the dictatorial government of Batista back in the 1950s. Castro, himself, took people out who had fought against the dictatorship of Batista and shot them in the head. These were people that risked their lives to bring democracy to Cuba, and this man co- opted their revolution. He has allied himself, over the years, with gangsters and tyrants throughout the world. He has had a safe haven for the drug dealers of Latin America, who look to him as the moderator of any disputes between these monstrous gangsters who murder each other and murder anyone who gets in their way. He has allied with these drug dealers. But also, during the cold war he was allied to the hilt to the communist movement throughout the world. He wanted his country to become a nuclear base to attack and drop nuclear bombs on the people of the United States. Let's not forget that. This is the man who wanted to kill Americans by the millions. For us now, oh, well, that is history; let bygones be bygones. Are you kidding me? This is the guy that we need to send a message to. When people have that much hatred of the United States, undermine the freedom of the people in of the world, we are not just going to sit aside and forgive him of these things. Oh, by the way, he is not even asking for forgiveness. The Castro regime is just saying, accept us as we are, a country that has had more political prisoners than almost any other country of this hemisphere, and we are just going to accept them as they are. Well, remember, when people were struggling during the cold war against communism, Castro was on the wrong side. During the cold war, he was the one who wanted to kill Americans by the millions by having Soviet missiles in his country. Finally, what does this agreement that this administration--what will be the effect of it? Oh, yeah, they say, we have been told, well, if you just have free trade people are going to get better. There is going to be liberalism. I call this the ``hug a Nazi, make a liberal'' theory. The fact is that Fidel Castro, just like the Chinese Communists, I might add, no matter how much trade we have, they will manipulate it so that the clique that is in power, the clique that has been able to monstrously oppress their own people, take that wealth, manipulate that wealth that is coming into the country to cement their own power. It is very clear what this man has and his clique have in mind, and that is continuing their oppression of the Cuban people. Let's not be partners to that. Let us again, stand for liberty, stand for justice. The Soviet Union has fallen. It is time for Castro and communism in Cuba to fall as well. Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Thank you so much, Mr. Rohrabacher. And you so rightly point out that hours after President Obama announced, in a shocking way, that we would resume diplomatic relations with Cuba and the Castro regime does not have to change, Raul Castro put on his military uniform and spoke to the oppressed island nation and said, hey, don't worry. We are not changing a thing. It is still the same failed regime. We got nothing from that deal. Mr. Speaker, I am so pleased to yield to the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Diaz-Balart), the chairman of the Appropriations Subcommittee on Transportation, Housing and Urban Development. I had the honor of serving with his older brother. I have the honor of serving with his youngest brother now, Mario. Born in the United States and, just like Carlos and Alex Mooney, Mr. Curbelo and Mr. Mooney, a gentleman who is 100 percent American and so proud of 100 percent of his Cuban ancestry. Thank you, Mario. Mr. DIAZ-BALART. Let me first thank you, Madam Chairwoman, for your leadership. As we heard tonight, your leadership in the cause of freedom does not stop at the shores of Cuba. Wherever there is repression and oppression, there is the clear concise voice of Chairwoman Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, as we have heard again tonight. Mr. Speaker, we have heard a lot. And I know that the time is getting short, but I want to quote somebody whom we have not quoted, as far as I remember here tonight, and this is President Obama. When Mr. Obama was running for President he stated what the right policy, what his policy would be to deal with the Cuban tyranny. He said: ``My policy towards Cuba will be guided by one word, `libertad'--freedom. And the road to freedom for all Cubans must begin with justice for Cuba's political prisoners, the right of free speech, a free press, freedom assembly, and it must lead to elections that are free and fair.'' Mr. Obama went on to say: ``I will maintain the embargo. It provides us with the leverage to present the regime with a clear choice. If you take significant steps towards democracy, beginning with the freedom of all--all--political prisoners,'' Mr. Obama said, ``we will take steps to begin normalizing relations. That is the way to bring about real change in Cuba,'' Mr. Obama said, ``through strong, smart principled democracy.'' {time} 2130 Mr. Speaker, in essence, that day, then-candidate Obama, Senator Obama, and now-President Obama drew a red line about what the right policy was to deal with the Cuban regime; sadly, on December 17, President Obama announced that he was breaking that promise, that he was, once again, crossing--breaking--his own red line. We have heard tonight that we have also heard from the vast majority of the pro-democracy leaders within the island who are struggling. They have objected to President Obama's change of policy. Mr. Speaker, if President Obama doesn't want to do it for the sake of a future of freedom for the Cuban people, he should stand firm for the sake of the national security interests of the United States. As we have heard today--right now, as we speak, not 50 years ago--the Cuban regime harbors fugitives from American law, including cop killers and terrorists. What is President Obama's answer? ``No problem, we will normalize relations.'' The Cuban regime has an active espionage network against the interests of the United States. What is the President's answer to that? ``No problem, we will normalize. You can continue to do that.'' The Cuban regime shot down two American airplanes in international airspace; and for the people who are in prison, including one who was in prison for conspiracy to murder, not only is it okay--no problem, we will normalize--but no. We will send them back. You can go back home. Mr. Speaker, the night is late, but I know and I am confident that, unlike President Obama, this Congress will continue to stand firm with the cause of freedom and the cause of a free Cuba, even while President Obama does not. Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Thank you so much, Mr. Diaz-Balart. You so eloquently stated that. We have so much to say, and we have run out of time. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair will remind Members not to refer to guests on the floor of the House. [[Page H221]] ____________________",package_114_129.csv,51576,51576,51644,"[congressional record volume 161, number 5 (monday, january 12, 2015)] [house] [pages h214-h221] from the congressional record online through the government publishing office [ www.gpo.gov ] opposing rapprochement with cuba the speaker pro tempore (mr. carter of georgia). under the speaker's announced policy of january 6, 2015, the gentlewoman from florida (ms. ros-lehtinen) is recognized for 60 minutes as the designee of the majority leader. ms. ros-lehtinen. mr. speaker, i am so humbled and pleased to see my colleagues who have turned out tonight at this late hour in a bipartisan manner to say that we reject the president's ill-advised treatment of the policy of rapprochement with the cuban regime, and no one is better able and better equipped to talk about freedom and democracy and our fight for justice than mr. chabot. i yield to the gentleman from ohio (mr. chabot), a senior member of the house foreign affairs committee and chairman of the house small business committee. mr. chabot. mr. speaker, i rise this evening to join with my colleague and friend, congresswoman ros-lehtinen, in opposition to the december 17 announcement by president obama to change u.s. policy toward cuba. we will also be joined by some of our other colleagues, and i want to particularly thank congresswoman ros-lehtinen for her leadership on all issues regarding cuba. she has been a leader on this issue for a long, long time and will continue to be, i am sure. this policy change was a unilateral decision made without consulting congress and with complete disregard of long-term national security consequences. similarly, the so-called prisoner exchange was terribly flawed. in 2013, secretary kerry stated that swapping convicted cuban spies for alan gross was off the table, testifying before congress that since mr. gross was wrongly imprisoned, there was no equivalency to pursue a spy for spy tradeoff. let us be clear: the freedom of alan gross is welcome news, but this exchange was totally one-sided. it was tragically flawed. it was not in the best interest of the people of the united states, and it was not in the best interest of the people of cuba. as my colleague, representative ros-lehtinen, has rightly highlighted these past few weeks since the decision and the prisoner exchange occurred, cuban spies have been responsible for the deaths of american lives. it is absolutely true that they have been. and they have been released. those are the people who were responsible for american deaths. cuban patriots who have risked their lives every day to fight for basic rights and freedoms feel betrayed. the exchange was flawed. the policy itself is flawed, and the announcement [[page h215]] has also let down one of the united states' strongest ally in the world, israel. year after year, israel has stood at the united states' side--one of the very few--supporting the united states at the united nations in 98 percent of all votes, including votes that the world's worst actors pushed through to condemn the u.s. embargo on cuba. unfortunately, those who have long nourished and fostered cozy relationships with cuba, most notably russia and venezuela and various terrorist organizations around the world, are welcoming the policy changes with open arms. we need to be honest about the implications of president obama's new policy. his unilateral decision to change cuba policy poses a threat to u.s. national security. if the trade embargo is lifted, money will flow into the hands of the castro brothers, allowing them to financially support surreptitious espionage activities with terrorist groups like hezbollah and nations like north korea. since the president made his public announcement, nearly 100 cubans have already been detained. the united states should always stand for democracy and freedom around the world. we should demand that the castro regime release all political prisoners and hold free and fair elections before establishing diplomatic relations. i once again thank the gentlewoman from florida (ms. ros-lehtinen) for her leadership in this area for many, many years, and it is an honor to speak this evening with her. ms. ros-lehtinen. i thank the gentleman from ohio very much, and thank you for looking out for our u.s. national security, and thank you for trying to uphold the values of freedom throughout the world. mr. chabot brought up the fact that mr. kerry, speaking before our committee, said that we would not release spies for alan gross' life. and that came because of a question posed by our next speaker, and i am pleased to yield to the gentleman from new jersey (mr. sires), the ranking member of the house subcommittee on the western hemisphere. mr. sires. mr. speaker, i thank the gentlewoman for allowing me to speak tonight. mr. speaker, i rise today to express my disappointment and deep concerns regarding the administration's plan for loosening the sanctions and initiating diplomatic discussions with the cuban dictatorship. it is naive and misguided to think that this is going to give us the long-desired political and economic changes that the cuban people deserve. in fact, just a few days after the announcement, raul castro made sure to dispel any misgivings and brazenly declared that the regime would not abandon its communist path, let alone loosen its stranglehold over the people of cuba. i feel that the administration has abandoned all those cuban people for all those years who fought for human rights and democracy in cuba. i feel that those people who are still lingering in the cuban jails are so disappointed in this administration's efforts. you know, the alan gross release should have been something joyous. and we all wanted alan gross released because he was incarcerated for no reason other than he was foreign. but to release three cuban spies or a network of spies that exists in this country currently is just not acceptable. alan gross should have been released on his own. he did nothing. he just went to cuba to establish some sort of communication for this community. the other thing that is troubling me, coming from new jersey, is the fact that there was no discussion about any extradition of the criminals that are currently in cuba. there are over 100 criminals in cuba, including joanne chesimard, who killed a state trooper in new jersey point blank 30 years ago. she escaped to cuba. she has been enjoying the sun, she has been enjoying the beach. meanwhile, trooper werner foerster's family for over 30 years grew up without a father. and yet we can't seem to get this government to think that it is important that we bring these people to justice. as a matter of fact, the fbi has named joanne chesimard as number one in the list of terrorists that they want back. so to me it was very disappointing because the people of new jersey, after all these years, are still trying to bring this woman to justice. people tell me, well, we negotiate and we trade with vietnam, we trade with china. we trade with other countries. and i say this: that is not the island that i want in cuba. we haven't helped vietnam's people at all. there is still no freedom, and there are human rights abuses. you look at china, it is the same thing. you look at north korea, it is the same thing. i don't want that for the island where i was born. and i surely don't want that kind of government 90 miles away from this country. you know, the history of cuba, all in the past 50 years of this dictatorship, has been one to try to hurt this country as much as it can, and i certainly don't want that 90 miles from this country. the administration with this effort has taken away what we believe was a pressure point on a communist dictatorship 90 miles from this country. it has taken away how we can pressure this island. first of all, russia can't help them any more. russia used to help cuba to the tune of $4 billion a year. venezuela can't any more. venezuela is falling apart. there are 30,000 cubans in venezuela trying to create the same type of country that we have in cuba. and at this point, we take away this pressure and basically give millions of dollars to this dictatorship. people may not know it, but any time anybody sends any money to cuba, the cuban government keeps 30 percent of it. so if you raised it from $500 to $2,000, you tell me how many millions that is going to be. when you go to all of the beaches and to the restaurants, that is all government owned. in cuba, if you want to set up a business, you have to negotiate with the government. if i want to set up a business and i need 100 workers, i don't go out and get 100 workers, i go out and speak to the government and the government tells me you have to pay $15 an hour. they in turn give those workers $2-3 an hour. that is not helping the cuban people in their economics. that is not helping them move forward. so i think it is really naive to think that these kinds of changes are going to help. you know, i can only think back when i was young, and i came to this country at the age of 11. i remember when they took all of the books out of the school system and started the indoctrination process. i remember the military coming into my house and they took inventory. my mother and father were poor people, but they took inventory of everything that was in the house. and they threatened my parents that if anything was missing at the time we got our visa, it would be revoked. this is not the country that i want for cuba. i want a country with democracy. i want a country where human rights are observed. and yet, for 50 years this dictatorship has been killing. people talk about raul castro as some sort of a changer. people forget that raul castro and che guevara were the ones who set up the firing squads in cuba that killed thousands of people. thousands of people were killed by the firing squads. so i rise today in total disappointment, and i hope that this administration sees that this is not the way forward, that this is a hardened dictatorship, and that the only way we can deal with this dictatorship is through pressure. through pressure is the only way to deal with these people, especially at this time. there is nobody that is going to come out and bail out cuba. {time} 2045 just last year, they were funneling arms to north korea right in our backyard. is this the kind of government we want 90 miles from our shores? i thank my good friends for having this hour, allowing me to express my sentiments, and i thank all my colleagues who are here speaking with the same approach. ms. ros-lehtinen. mr. speaker, as you heard from mr. sires, he was born and reared in cuba, but you don't have to be a cuban american to understand the principles that are at stake here. one person who knows that is a wonderful congressman from our great state of florida. so i am proud to yield to the gentleman from florida, gus bilirakis. mr. bilirakis. thank you for holding this very important special order. [[page h216]] way back in the florida legislature, when i was a member of the cuban caucus, so proud to be a member of the cuban caucus, i started speaking out against the castro brothers' brand of oppression. over the past 5 years, i joined with all of you to decry alan gross' arrest. i am thankful for his recent release. alan gross' freedom was long overdue, we all agree. i am glad he is safely on u.s. soil, but a large injustice remains: the plights of cuban citizens, who have suffered for over five decades under the castro regime in search of basic human rights and political freedoms that we as americans, frankly, take for granted. then, almost out of nowhere, the obama administration decides to normalize relations with cuba. this will allow american dollars to the rescue of the castro brothers at a critical time. their normal economic benefactors--russia and venezuela--cannot afford to help. now, more than ever, economic sanctions can be used as an effective tool to force the castro regime to afford basic human rights and political freedoms to all of cuba's citizens. scholars have noted that normalizing our economic policy with oppressive countries, like china or vietnam, have produced no significant improvements in human rights treatment. given the precedent, there is no reason to believe the situation with cuba will yield significant different results. in fact, we already know that the suffering for cuba's citizens will continue, unfortunately. raul castro proclaimed that there would be no renunciation of any of their principles. cuban restrictions on free speech, assembly, and press will remain. they proved it just this last week. travel and tourism will remain strictly controlled by the castro regime. tourism dollars that americans will spend will go directly to the oppressors. we cannot ignore the sense of betrayal that cuban defectors feel in response to the president's plan. we should be demanding genuine freedom: release of all political prisoners, universal human rights, democratic principles, and a free market for the cuban people. in order to ensure the citizens of cuba stand a chance to benefit from this ill-advised agreement, cuba's despots must relinquish control and eradicate their tools of tyranny. actual human rights reforms must occur before any commercial or political normalization takes place. i will continue to monitor the actions on the island in search of positive movement. ms. ros-lehtinen. mr. bilirakis, i thank you for your clear and consistent message that restrictions should not be lifted against the castro regime until those conditions are met. our next speaker, mr. speaker, is the gentleman from alabama, congressman bradley byrne, who so understands that good trade is based on free and fair countries that cherish the principles upon which our great country was founded--freedom, democracy, respect for the rule of law--all of which are missing in today's cuba. his great city of mobile, alabama, will greatly benefit once we have free trade and fair trade with a democratic cuba. i yield to the gentleman from mobile, alabama. mr. byrne. i thank the gentlewoman, both for your time and for your leadership on this very important issue. as she said, i represent mobile, alabama. if you go and look at a map, it is a straight shot north from havana to mobile. for over three centuries, mobile has been a major port for the export of goods and import of goods back and forth between cuba and the united states. it is in the economic best interest of the people in my district for us to get to the point where we have normalized relations and trade with cuba. i should be ardently in favor of this deal that the president is pursuing, but i am not. this is not the time, these are not the circumstances, and--to put it simply--this is not the way to do this. let me address the way for a moment. it has been alluded to previously that we have done deals with china and with vietnam. in both cases, the presidents involved worked with congress. that is critically important to whatever success they have had in both of those deals. in this circumstance, the president has refused to work with congress. you can't reach the sort of agreement that he is looking for without congress. you can't have an embassy unless we are willing to pay for it. you can't have an ambassador unless the senate approves the ambassador. he is pursuing what, in essence, is an errand that cannot result in success that he is looking for, but he is pursuing it anyway without us because this is just another example of these efforts to make these unilateral, executive-type decisions, leaving congress to decide to try to keep itself relevant as he becomes a lameduck president. that is no way to do this. let me address the circumstances. i can't say it any better than the prior speakers have said it. this is a brutally oppressive regime that cannot change, and until they change, until they put in motion the things that we are talking about for change, i don't see how a country like the united states can seriously engage in negotiations with them. most importantly, for me, from my perspective, i serve on the house armed services committee--i don't think i have to tell everybody here the history of this country--this country with this regime in charge allowed the then-soviet union to put nuclear missiles aimed at the united states on their soil. they have never apologized for that; they have never renounced that. as we heard earlier, just a year ago, they were caught redhanded in an arms deal with the north koreans, who are presently enemies of the united states. what sort of assurance do we have as part of this deal that cuba is not going to be a staging ground for military activity, terrorist activity, against the people and the security of the united states of america? nothing, nothing; yet we engaged in this deal, a very bad deal from my perspective--and i don't want to take anything away from the american citizen who we were able to bring back home--but look who we traded in return for that. it reminds me of the bergdahl deal we had last year that was so very controversial. this administration doesn't know how to make a good deal. they know how to give everything away and get very little back. i want to normalize relationships with cuba. i want us to open up that trade again because it is going to benefit my district. i am willing to do anything i can to help make that happen, but this country should never give in to people like the castro brothers until there is a change in that regime, until there is a change in the government of cuba, until they renounce their activities that have been against the security of the united states, until we know that we have a good faith trading partner and a good faith partner, period, in this hemisphere. i look forward to the day when i can stand at the port of mobile and welcome goods coming in from cuba and goods going out from mobile to cuba as part of a deal that is made in the right way, under the right circumstances, for the right reason. i hope and pray that that day comes, but that day is not today. i thank the gentlewoman for her leadership. i look forward to continuing to follow that leadership in the days to come. ms. ros-lehtinen. thank you very much. i am so thankful to my good friend from mobile, alabama, for his words, because he understands that american principles are not for sale. i would like to point out, mr. speaker, that every country with whom the castro brothers do business is a country to whom they owe a lot of money. they have not paid all of their bills to any businesses, and they have not paid what they owe to any country, and it would be all the same for mobile, alabama. thank you for standing up for u.s. values. now, i am so pleased to yield to my good friend from south carolina, a gentleman who understands the threat to our hemisphere. why? because he is the chairman of the subcommittee on western hemisphere, the gentleman from south carolina (mr. duncan), my good friend. mr. duncan of south carolina. i thank the gentlewoman from florida for her leadership on this issue, not just today, but for her whole tenure in congress. [[page h217]] as the new chairman of the house foreign affairs subcommittee on the western hemisphere, i was grateful to see the return of alan gross to the united states last month after 5 years of unjust imprisonment in cuba. the announcement over this past weekend that the cubans freed 53 prisoners was also welcome news. nevertheless, i have major concerns with the way this administration, the obama administration, conducted negotiations and the way the decision was made to radically alter longstanding u.s. policy towards cuba. the administration failed to consult congress, failed to consult any cuban dissidents or civil society in its decision to embark on its new course in cuba. the administration says this decision will empower the cuban people; yet softening u.s. policy without concrete cuban reforms will only boost the castro regime and government and facilitate the survival of the communist regime. we need to focus not on what is best for the cuban government, the castro regime, we need to focus on what is best for the cuban people. i ask you this: will this deal mean more self-governance for the cuban people? will it mean more economic freedom for those who strive to innovate, those that are entrepreneurial within the cuban society? will they be able to start more businesses and have economic freedom? will there be more religious freedom for the cuban people? will there be more rights to free speech? are the cuban people seeing this debate tonight on cuban tv? are the cuban people able to access the internet and watch what we are doing via youtube or any other media? these are rhetorical questions, but i answer them with ``no,'' based on my understanding. i recall it was only 1 week after the announcement of this u.s.-cuba deal that the cuban government cracked down on peaceful protestors in havana's revolutionary square. i point to that as evidence that it is still a closed communistic society. in conclusion, the administration's decision is a reward to the communist dictatorship at the expense of the cuban people. this action is especially disgraceful when we consider the administration's disrespect toward our friend and ally in canada by vowing to veto legislation approving the construction of the keystone pipeline. these are issues that require vigorous congressional oversight. i look forward to working with the ranking member, mr. sires, that you just heard from, as we hold hearings in the subcommittee on the western hemisphere in the coming weeks and month. ms. ros-lehtinen. thank you so much, mr. duncan. we are so pleased that we have this dynamic duo of the chairman and the ranking member of western hemisphere. you are so right to point out, mr. duncan, that there is no freedom of the press in cuba. that is one of the many freedoms that cuban people are denied. now, i yield to my colleague from florida, congressman ron desantis, who is a war veteran, but who understands that the war for freedom and democracy takes on many fronts, a member of our house foreign affairs committee. mr. desantis. mr. speaker, i would just like to recognize my colleague from florida because she is just not only on the house floor fighting for freedom for the cuban people, with whom she obviously has ancestral relations, she fights for freedom for everybody. whether it is in venezuela or iran, she is there; you can set your clock to it. when i first heard about these concessions, i was really scratching my head. i texted some of my colleagues, and i was like: ``we are not really getting anything for this.'' sure enough, raul castro goes out, talks to the people, and says: ``we are not changing. we are not changing anything.'' they are staying exactly with the values that they have been with from the beginning, which are antagonistic to freedom, antagonistic to everything we hold dear in the united states. {time} 2100 you know, when you look at countries like cuba, a lot of times you don't even need to get into the nitty-gritty. there are just certain signs where you know the nature of the regime. for example, when you look at communism in eastern europe, you don't have to look at the daily life or any of that. you just look at the fact that there was a berlin wall that kept people in like caged animals. if you look at the differences between north and south korea, all you have to do is look at that satellite photo at night, where south korea is lit up like a christmas tree and north korea is a land of darkness and despair. for me, when i think of what is the nature of the cuban regime, i think all you need to know is that you have tens of thousands of people living in cuba. it is a nice island, it has great weather, and they are suffocated so much that they are willing to swim across 90 miles of shark-infested waters--the florida straits--knowing that they are probably going to die. that is all you need to know. this is a stalinist regime. and as my colleague from alabama mentioned, the cuban missile crisis wasn't even just that there were nuclear weapons in cuba pointed at the united states. fidel castro was telling khrushchev to fire them into the united states. we actually were fortunate that nikita khrushchev was actually the cooler head in that. so if castro had his way, there would have been nuclear weapons sent here. and so this is the nature of the regime. so what are you doing with this policy? to me, i look at it very simply. i think this fact is true. every single dollar spent in cuba benefits the castro regime. every single dollar. europe doesn't have restrictions. most of the other world doesn't have restrictions. have the cuban people benefited from that? has their standard of living gone up? no. this all goes to benefit the government. to me, this is the worst possible time to throw the castro regime a lifeline. if you look at what is happening in caracas, if you look at what is happening in moscow, these regimes are buckling because of the decline in the price of oil. so this is a moment of profound weakness for the castro regime. and giving them these concessions is exactly what the castro regime wants. i am scratching my head trying to figure out: what do we get in return for this? the americans who had property seized when castro took power, are any of them getting their property back? no. what about the cuban americans who had to flee? they had their businesses taken, property taken. are any of them going to get any type of recompense? of course, not. what about freedom of speech, political rights, the ability to participate in political life and criticize those in power? is that being extended to the cuban people? not on your life. nothing. i will say, it is interesting--and my colleague from florida mentioned this--the dismal credit rating that cuba has. they don't pay back any loans. are we then going to extend export-import bank loans that are backed by the taxpayer to do business in cuba? the american taxpayer is going to have to end up paying for that. that is not a good source of business for our taxpayers. the tragedy of this is we have given away leverage that could have come in handy. these castro brothers are on their last legs. when they finally leave the scene, we want to use the leverage we have to leverage a democratic transition. instead, we are essentially normalizing status quo. so if the stalinist dictatorship survives beyond the castros due to u.s. support, you are going to have 11 million cubans who are consigned to another generation of tyranny. i will just say one more thing. when i read the media coverage--and i think i can say this because i am not from south florida--the coverage is so negative about cuban americans who fled castro. they say: oh, they're living in the past. this is anachronistic, all this stuff. for me, the people that i want to talk to to know the true nature of the regime are the people who suffered under the regime, the people who were forced to flee and who had family members killed, had family members in prison. that, to me, is the number one source of information that i would look to. [[page h218]] and so the media frames it as if somehow the american policy is anachronistic. i think it is the castro regime, based on stalinist principles, that is anachronistic, and yet it continues to lumber on. and the tragedy of this is that we are giving them a critical lifeline so that they can continue having their country governed like a political prison. so i appreciate you organizing this, my colleague in florida. we are giving speeches here tonight, but we need to act in this body, and we need to show that this policy does not represent the will of the american people and does not represent what is best for people in cuba that are struggling for freedom. ms. ros-lehtinen. thank you so much, mr. desantis. you are so right when you categorized this unilateral bad deal as an economic lifeline to the castro regime. a person who understands that just as well as you do is our next speaker, the gentleman from iowa, a senior member of the house committee on agriculture, congressman steve king. he can say: hey, my state is going to benefit a lot by this deal. the sad reality, as mr. king and i know, is that castro doesn't pay his debt. as we had just said with the other speaker, he owes everybody money. this deal will not strengthen u.s. national security. it will not be good for america's farmers, and it will not be good for the people of cuba. congressman king. mr. king of iowa. i thank the gentlewoman from florida for organizing this special order, and i associate myself with her words and her position and also that of the gentleman from florida (mr. desantis). i didn't, mr. speaker, realize how much was in him about this issue. it was instructive for me to listen to that stream forward. i have had the privilege of serving here in this congress with a good number of members that do a great job of representing the interests of the cuban people, and i also had the privilege of going to cuba on a legal trip some years ago before i came to this congress. but i would take you back, mr. speaker, to a time in 1959 and trace some of this history. the revolution against batista in 1959 was back before we had as many replays on television as we have today. and i recall watching the revolution in cuba, and as castro took over, as the promise came that they were going to bring democracy to cuba--that was the promise. it was going to be democracy; it was going to be free and fair elections, a government of, by, and for the people of cuba; and they were going to choose their leadership. but i remember seeing on television the videos of the people who were lined up against the wall and executed without a proper trial, executed without true justice. i remember in particular--it is branded in my memory--a man who insisted: if you are to shoot me here in front of this wall, let me give the order for my own execution. and he stood there in a cuban shirt down to here--white pants, white shirt--and he raised his hand and faced the firing squad and dropped his own hand. that was the signal to the firing squad. they fired. he was shot to death in front of that wall, along with many, many others. we don't know at this point how many political prisoners have been executed, how many have died in custody. we have got a list of some; we don't have a list of all. but we know this: it has never been, since that time in 1959, a government of, by, and for the people of cuba. and the hope that there will be the day that the cuban people would be free was manifested--or at least attempted to be manifested--at the bay of pigs. i would have liked to have seen the air cover that would have made that be successful. we didn't get that. but we look for the day to come ever since that the cuban people could be free. the cuban people could be free. since that time, there has been the nationalization of the real property, which we heard from mr. desantis. at the time that castro took control of cuba, 25 percent of the real estate in cuba was owned by americans. they held deeds to that property. there was other land in cuba that was owned by people from other nationalities. every other country was compensated for their real estate, except americans. no american that i know of has been compensated for their real estate. they hold those deeds to this today, sometimes a second generation. before i came to this congress, while i was there, there was also a situation where the exchange rate for cuban peso to dollar was 21 to 1 at that time. and so if anyone achieved an american dollar, they could take it into a dollar store and they would get one peso's worth of goods for it or they could deposit it into a cuban bank and they would get one peso for that. that is a 20-peso difference. and that is one of the things that supported the castro regime financially. another thing that happened was sugar was 6 cents a pound. the russians paid them 52 cents a pound in oil for the sugar. that was a subsidy of cuba. when the soviet union--it was the soviet union rather than just the russians--collapsed, then the subsidy for cuba also collapsed and the cuban economy was no longer propped up. you saw russian tractors sitting out there, having been stripped for parts, in the only country in the world i know that had gone from mechanized agriculture to animal husbandry agriculture because their machines no longer worked. and the taxicabs are driven by doctors, with a five-cylinder russian diesel under the hood of a 1954 chevrolet. this country has been frozen in time. it has a collapsed and failed economy. it has been propped up by the subsidy of, first, the soviet union, and then later on, the venezuelans, who are collapsing, themselves, today. this is a country of people that are vigorous people. they are an outgoing, hardworking, i will say, gregarious people. i thought i would see people down there that had the thousand-yard hopeless stare. i am sure that exists. but i also saw people that worked hard and they kept their chin up and they kept a smile on their face. i thought, if these people could be unleashed, if they could be unleashed by the heartbeat of freedom, if we could just get them that opportunity to be who they are, they would become a very, very successful island and trading partner and a nation unto themselves and, one day, an ally of the united states. so my dream has been to help them with that opportunity, and my dream has been to one day swim ashore at the bay of pigs and walk out and wade onto a free cuba, with a free cuban. but, mr. speaker, the cuban people have been burdened with more than five decades of marxist slavery that they have had to face. and this policy of the president's that comes right on the cusp of what is likely the biological solution in cuba, which would be the end of the castro brothers that would come along naturally and the opportunity to bring about a regime change in cuba, the president of the united states may well have handed cuba another 50 years of living in marxist slavery when he had just the opportunity for them to be free. so our policy here in this congress, i am hopeful, is the policy that says: regime change in cuba and a government of, by, and for the people of cuba. and i, one day, hope and pray to do what i have said with my colleagues here and many others, and that is swim ashore at the bay of pigs and wade out on the shore of a free cuba. god bless them all. ms. ros-lehtinen. thank you so much, mr. king. that is our fervent hope as well. and we work and we pray every day for that dream of a free cuba to come alive. we thank you for your voice here tonight. thank you, my good friend from iowa. mr. speaker, many people talk about the last generation of cuban exiles and how this is really not the dream of young cuban americans who were born here in the united states, reared here in the united states. they come from cuban families, but they really don't much care about freedom and democracy and the land of their ancestors. this next speaker, mr. speaker, is a newly elected gentleman who understands that that search for a free and democratic cuba is a yearning that lives very fervently in his heart, and that is the congressman from west virginia, congressman alex mooney, who was born here, as american as apple pie, but comes from a proud lineage of cuban american heritage. thank you, mr. mooney. mr. mooney of west virginia. i want to thank congresswoman ileana [[page h219]] ros-lehtinen for arranging this important special order to show solidarity with the cuban people as they continue to live under an oppressive regime. mr. speaker, president obama has senselessly yielded ground, with no stipulations for reform, to the cuban regime, with the announcements of a secret deal going around congress to ``normalize'' relations. this misguided grab for a legacy item has cost our country and the cuban people a valuable bargaining chip for their freedom. of course, this is yet another foreign policy failure or, more accurately, unilateral surrender from this administration. from the bright red line in syria, which was crossed with impunity, to sending a secret message to president putin that, ``after the election, i will be more flexible,'' to now rewarding tyrants in cuba who continue to deny basic human rights to their oppressed citizens, president obama has chosen wrong policies. the despotic government the president would normalize relations with has, for decades, sought to subjugate the cuban people's appetite for freedom. the many realized american dreams of cuban refugees, including my mother, are a great testament to the greatness of the united states and our constitutional rights. as the beacon of freedom in the world, america must continue to use sensible policy to protect our values around the world and in our own backyard. {time} 2115 ms. ros-lehtinen. thank you so much, mr. mooney. we are a better congress for you being a part of it. thank you so much for being proud of your american heritage and your cuban american ancestry as well. so, welcome to congress, sir. mr. speaker, i am about to introduce another millennial, another one of this younger generation of cuban americans who the press continues to say don't represent the desires of this new generation. well, carlos curbelo is one of our newest elected officials. he was born here in the united states, doesn't know cuba, and is less than 35 years old but understands that yearning for a free cuba. we are so pleased as punch to have him here as a member of our congress. i yield to the gentleman from florida (mr. curbelo). mr. curbelo of florida. i thank the gentlelady for yielding, and i thank her for her tireless advocacy and work on this very, very important cause. mr. speaker, during the 56 years of the cuban tragedy, also known as the cuban revolution, there had always been two constants. first, the nature of the castro regime, a dictatorship that brutally represses its own people, and that aggressively opposes u.s. national security interests throughout the globe. that has not changed. the second was that, to varying degrees, the occupant of the white house had always been on the side of the cuban people and in opposition to their oppressors, who for decades have collaborated with america's most dangerous allies. today, this is, regrettably, no longer the case. by trading an american hostage, cruelly held by cuba's dictators for 5 years, for three criminals convicted of spying against our government, including one who was serving a lifetime sentence for conspiring to murder american citizens, the president sent a message to our enemies that the united states can be extorted. what was the cuban government's reward for holding an american hostage for 5 years? three convicted spies and full diplomatic relations, plus an economic bailout for a financially and morally bankrupt regime. the men who rule cuba today are the same men who had nuclear missiles installed on the island and pointed them at the united states, as my colleague from alabama stated earlier. when they were cash-rich, they ran a robust military and deployed troops throughout the world to fight alongside our most dangerous enemies. they have trained and supported terrorist groups such as colombia's farc. they ordered three american citizens and one resident blown out of the sky in the tragic shootdown of february 24, 1996. a few months ago, they were caught shipping arms illegally to north korea, and they collaborated with the venezuelan government in last year's brutal crackdown, which resulted in the death of over 40 students. human rights atrocities by the dictatorship against its people continue. the castro regime consistently resorts to violence because they know it is the only way they can maintain control since the cuban people are desperate to be free. the president's decision to ease sanctions only serves to bolster the dictatorship and its apparatus of repression. there is virtually no private sector in cuba. more than 85 percent of cubans work for government controlled-enterprises and earn less than $20 a month. foreign investment doesn't benefit the average cuban. cubans that work for corporations with foreign capital are only allowed to keep 8 percent of their salaries. cuban workers are, in effect, slaves of the dictatorship. now, it is important to note, mr. speaker, president obama's administration approved sanctions in recent months against venezuela and north korea. why, then, is it rewarding an enemy of the united states just 90 miles from our shores that actively collaborates with both of these regimes? why does the president insist on an incoherent foreign policy that too often rewards our enemies and punishes our allies? as other american presidents have shown us in the past, peace through weakness and appeasement is not an effective strategy for dealing with cuba's military dictatorship. we also have to ask ourselves, what kind of neighborhood do we want to live in? the americas, the western hemisphere, is the american neighborhood of the world. what kind of standards do we want for this part of the world? do we want to endorse the chronic abuse of human rights, the imprisonment of people who disagree? that is the nature of the cuban government, and we, the united states of america and, by the way, the other nations of this hemisphere, have agreed that we support a democratic form of government, and that we want this part of the world to be free without exception. there is one glaring exception, and it is cuba. our sanctions policy, some say, well, it hasn't worked. of course the sanctions have worked. the sanctions have denied billions and billions and billions of dollars to a regime that would use those profits to oppose our interests throughout the world. what did the regime do when it had resources? it had troops all over the world. it exported revolution. and if you don't know what exporting revolution means, in the context of cuba, it means aggressively opposing american interests throughout the world. today, we remember in a very special way, mario manuel de la pena, carlos costa, armando alejandre, and pablo morales. these were the men who were brutally assassinated by the cuban regime on february 24 of 1996. one of the spies was convicted of conspiring to murder these young men, three of whom were american citizens, and the other was a resident of our country. these four men are dead, and the cuban spies are free. but it isn't too late, mr. speaker. the president still has time to get back on the right side of this issue and on the right side of history by standing against cuba's dictators, with the victims of their brutality, and for a strong american foreign policy that advances our national security interests. again, i want to thank my distinguished colleague from south florida for her leadership. we have admired her for so many years for her work on this issue. ms. ros-lehtinen. thank you so much, mr. curbelo. you are a fresh young voice, and i thank you and mr. mooney for being here tonight. mr. speaker i am so pleased to yield to a gentleman who understands what freedom is all about. he was one of the speech writers for our great president, ronald reagan. he is a senior member of the house foreign affairs committee. in fact, he is the chairman of the europe subcommittee, and he is here tonight with one of his triplets, christian, who wants to be an author and an inventor. i look at christian, this new generation, and i think, what kind of life [[page h220]] would he have under the communist tyranny of cuba, as opposed to the freedom and democracy that we enjoy here? so with that, i am pleased as punch to yield to my good friend from california (mr. rohrabacher). mr. rohrabacher. thank you very much. america is about to send a message to the world exactly on whose side are we on, and i am very proud to stand here with my colleagues, standing on the side of liberty, of justice, of treating people decently, of government that serves the people rather than a systematic government that requires the people to serve them, the bureaucracy, the tyrants that hold power. that is what this is all about. let's get an understanding of who this castro gang is. castro murdered the freedom fighters who overthrew the dictatorial government of batista back in the 1950s. castro, himself, took people out who had fought against the dictatorship of batista and shot them in the head. these were people that risked their lives to bring democracy to cuba, and this man co- opted their revolution. he has allied himself, over the years, with gangsters and tyrants throughout the world. he has had a safe haven for the drug dealers of latin america, who look to him as the moderator of any disputes between these monstrous gangsters who murder each other and murder anyone who gets in their way. he has allied with these drug dealers. but also, during the cold war he was allied to the hilt to the communist movement throughout the world. he wanted his country to become a nuclear base to attack and drop nuclear bombs on the people of the united states. let's not forget that. this is the man who wanted to kill americans by the millions. for us now, oh, well, that is history; let bygones be bygones. are you kidding me? this is the guy that we need to send a message to. when people have that much hatred of the united states, undermine the freedom of the people in of the world, we are not just going to sit aside and forgive him of these things. oh, by the way, he is not even asking for forgiveness. the castro regime is just saying, accept us as we are, a country that has had more political prisoners than almost any other country of this hemisphere, and we are just going to accept them as they are. well, remember, when people were struggling during the cold war against communism, castro was on the wrong side. during the cold war, he was the one who wanted to kill americans by the millions by having soviet missiles in his country. finally, what does this agreement that this administration--what will be the effect of it? oh, yeah, they say, we have been told, well, if you just have free trade people are going to get better. there is going to be liberalism. i call this the ``hug a nazi, make a liberal'' theory. the fact is that fidel castro, just like the chinese communists, i might add, no matter how much trade we have, they will manipulate it so that the clique that is in power, the clique that has been able to monstrously oppress their own people, take that wealth, manipulate that wealth that is coming into the country to cement their own power. it is very clear what this man has and his clique have in mind, and that is continuing their oppression of the cuban people. let's not be partners to that. let us again, stand for liberty, stand for justice. the soviet union has fallen. it is time for castro and communism in cuba to fall as well. ms. ros-lehtinen. thank you so much, mr. rohrabacher. and you so rightly point out that hours after president obama announced, in a shocking way, that we would resume diplomatic relations with cuba and the castro regime does not have to change, raul castro put on his military uniform and spoke to the oppressed island nation and said, hey, don't worry. we are not changing a thing. it is still the same failed regime. we got nothing from that deal. mr. speaker, i am so pleased to yield to the gentleman from florida (mr. diaz-balart), the chairman of the appropriations subcommittee on transportation, housing and urban development. i had the honor of serving with his older brother. i have the honor of serving with his youngest brother now, mario. born in the united states and, just like carlos and alex mooney, mr. curbelo and mr. mooney, a gentleman who is 100 percent american and so proud of 100 percent of his cuban ancestry. thank you, mario. mr. diaz-balart. let me first thank you, madam chairwoman, for your leadership. as we heard tonight, your leadership in the cause of freedom does not stop at the shores of cuba. wherever there is repression and oppression, there is the clear concise voice of chairwoman ileana ros-lehtinen, as we have heard again tonight. mr. speaker, we have heard a lot. and i know that the time is getting short, but i want to quote somebody whom we have not quoted, as far as i remember here tonight, and this is president obama. when mr. obama was running for president he stated what the right policy, what his policy would be to deal with the cuban tyranny. he said: ``my policy towards cuba will be guided by one word, `libertad'--freedom. and the road to freedom for all cubans must begin with justice for cuba's political prisoners, the right of free speech, a free press, freedom assembly, and it must lead to elections that are free and fair.'' mr. obama went on to say: ``i will maintain the embargo. it provides us with the leverage to present the regime with a clear choice. if you take significant steps towards democracy, beginning with the freedom of all--all--political prisoners,'' mr. obama said, ``we will take steps to begin normalizing relations. that is the way to bring about real change in cuba,'' mr. obama said, ``through strong, smart principled democracy.'' {time} 2130 mr. speaker, in essence, that day, then-candidate obama, senator obama, and now-president obama drew a red line about what the right policy was to deal with the cuban regime; sadly, on december 17, president obama announced that he was breaking that promise, that he was, once again, crossing--breaking--his own red line. we have heard tonight that we have also heard from the vast majority of the pro-democracy leaders within the island who are struggling. they have objected to president obama's change of policy. mr. speaker, if president obama doesn't want to do it for the sake of a future of freedom for the cuban people, he should stand firm for the sake of the national security interests of the united states. as we have heard today--right now, as we speak, not 50 years ago--the cuban regime harbors fugitives from american law, including cop killers and terrorists. what is president obama's answer? ``no problem, we will normalize relations.'' the cuban regime has an active espionage network against the interests of the united states. what is the president's answer to that? ``no problem, we will normalize. you can continue to do that.'' the cuban regime shot down two american airplanes in international airspace; and for the people who are in prison, including one who was in prison for conspiracy to murder, not only is it okay--no problem, we will normalize--but no. we will send them back. you can go back home. mr. speaker, the night is late, but i know and i am confident that, unlike president obama, this congress will continue to stand firm with the cause of freedom and the cause of a free cuba, even while president obama does not. ms. ros-lehtinen. thank you so much, mr. diaz-balart. you so eloquently stated that. we have so much to say, and we have run out of time. mr. speaker, i yield back the balance of my time. the speaker pro tempore. the chair will remind members not to refer to guests on the floor of the house.

CREC-2015-01-12-pt1-PgH221-2,CREC-2015-01-12,114,AMERICA'S FREE TRADE DEFICIT,"[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 5 (Monday, January 12, 2015)] [House] [Pages H221-H222] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] AMERICA'S FREE TRADE DEFICIT The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under the Speaker's announced policy of January 6, 2015, the Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Ohio (Ms. Kaptur) until 10 p.m. Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Speaker, I rise this evening to paint a picture of U.S. job loss resulting from our trade policies extending back now almost three decades. I rise because America has a huge ``good jobs'' deficit because we have a gigantic trade deficit. That means more imports come in here than our exports go out, largely because markets and other places are closed. Our workers and our communities have paid a tremendous price for this. I oppose any further NAFTA-like trade agreements, such as the Trans- Pacific Partnership, which the administration is proposing. That will ship out more U.S. jobs. We have had enough. The American people have had enough. Since 1975, when Wall Street's free trade job outsourcing roulette began, America has amassed a $9.3 trillion trade deficit with the world. If you look at this chart, we have on here every single trade agreement that was signed and all of the lost jobs that resulted from the growing trade deficits we are amassing with countries around the world. This has never happened before over our history in the United States of America. It is a very serious problem. The staggering loss of productivity associated with this deficit translates into a huge job loss here at home. In fact, that $9.3 trillion of accumulated trade deficit of more imports coming in here than exports going out has actually cost us over 47,500,000 lost American jobs. Most of those were really good jobs that paid living wages, jobs that just evaporated from our communities, jobs that were shipped to Mexico or to China, Korea, Bangladesh, Honduras, Guatemala, Turkey, El Salvador--everywhere in the world--largely to the Third World, and, frankly, to undemocratic countries where workers are treated like a bonded class. Our workers, no matter how loyal or hardworking, became expendable as this began. In fact, they were treated like expendable widgets. What is being hurt in the process is the belief of the public that the value of hard work has any meaning. There are some workers who have simply dropped out. Yes, American jobs are being outsourced year after year--for over a quarter century now--and workers are being treated like a game of musical chairs. Our jobs have been shipped out to penny-wage sweatshops hidden behind the Iron Curtain of anonymous towns in distant places most Americans will never visit. Anonymity, exploitation, and hidden squalor are as fundamental to free trade as the hollowing out of American jobs, our communities, and our middle class. Those who exploit workers in our country and globally believe they are so powerful that the American people won't be able to rein them in, and they think this Congress will continue to behave as it did before, despite the evidence that this doesn't work for the American people. Some of those very powerful interests are asking for another Fast Track trade deal to do it all over again in something called the Trans- Pacific Partnership, on an even bigger scale, including nations with the grossest violations of basic human rights. Let me turn first to the broken promises of NAFTA, which was really the fundamental agreement passed--over my objections--in the early 1990s and another agreement, CAFTA, that dealt with Central America. Fast-forward to this past summer when thousands of migrant children from Central America swarmed our southern border. Remember that? The American press acted surprised upon their arrival, and some people even threw tomatoes at buses that carried children from one detention facility to another. These children had lived under 20 years of NAFTA and CAFTA in Mexico, Guatemala, El Salvador, and Honduras. They had experience with the NAFTA trade agreement and the CAFTA trade agreement, which covers those countries, trade agreements that were sold as opportunities that would rise the tide of all boats, of all workers. What happened? Here in the United States, we had a huge loss of jobs to those countries, and Mexico's and Central America's infrastructures were not modernized. Their standard of living was not raised. In fact, the promise that those countries somehow would turn into stylistically rustic versions of the American consumer market never happened. They were told new jobs would abound, but our Nation began to hemorrhage jobs to Mexico as wages in Mexico and throughout Central America began to drop. Those deficits became part of the overall total. The problem is that in most of these countries where the free trade agreements were signed, what you see happening is more goods coming in here than our goods going out, a little trickle going to some places. In Mexico, what happened ever since NAFTA's passage was that we were promised trade balances. Every single year, it has gotten worse and worse and worse. This week, the broken promises sold to the American public and their elected officials is that these agreements would really work. The people who voted for those agreements should pay some attention to the debate of trying to withhold funding for the Department of Homeland Security because of the President's action on immigration. The stories of the youth being shipped back by the planeloads tell of families' lands being stolen from under them. The land was handed over to multinational corporate agricultural groups that come in and grow, for example, palm oil. Local displaced farmers were forced into urban settings--desperate, in search of food, in search of work at factories where jobs that were promised in return for the land--guess what--never materialized. Here on our own continent, the children became the refugees of transnational economic policies that harmed the entire continent. Hardly anyone even talked about that; but when you have this kind of disruption, when you have so much job loss, and when you have land, transferring title with millions of farmers disrupted from their way of life, what do we expect? Millions of displaced people in Mexico and Central America living in the shadow of border plants and urban factories exist in a state of peonage that makes older versions of slavery look positively beneficent, squatting on poisoned ground in jerry-rigged plywood and tar paper shacks. I have been in those shacks. I have gone to those places. When you do, you never forget it. Next door, water in gullies that surround these places is so polluted that communities smell of a rancid odor, and even chickens that they keep to try to feed themselves die from the drinking water. We have seen it. We have been there. The displaced population on the run is surging, thanks in large part to NAFTA and CAFTA's agricultural provisions, those very flawed provisions [[Page H222]] that provided no opportunity for adjustment as a First World nation met the economy of Third World nations. The terms of the agreement forced the revocation of land and allowed multinationals to begin buying up vast tracts in the interior, pushing untold millions of peasant farmers, who remain nameless, off their land and into the labor pool of the maquiladoras; yet we, as Americans, are surprised when their children, as migrants, flock to our southern border. If we seriously looked at the impact of our free trade agreements, we would easily see the havoc wrought on local economies throughout the lands on the other side of the border. Those who forced this to happen should know the consequences of their policies and what they reap: legions of desperate workers willing to do anything to survive. Now, let me turn to the Trans-Pacific Partnership that proposes to expand trade into regions with the worst labor violations and working conditions. We can't be fooled into thinking expanding trade agreements with 11 new nations in the Pacific rim will actually be the end to American jobs being shipped overseas. Of the 11 nations with which the United States is negotiating the Trans-Pacific Partnership, nine have wage levels significantly lower than our own. This will only intensify the already real reduction in wages American workers are experiencing year after year as our jobs are shipped overseas to increase profits of shareholders as they take advantage of impoverished laborers. Worse yet, for the immigration debate, as those who run the maquilas of Mexico and Central America realize, the next move will be to Vietnam for even cheaper labor. Factories on this continent will shut down, further exacerbating the poor economic conditions of our southern neighbors, leaving even fewer options other than for those individuals to flee north, seeking any economic opportunity to sustain themselves. I wanted to spend a moment looking at the Korean agreement because that was one of the latest ones they brought up here as a free trade agreement. They promised there would be thousands of jobs and that America would be able to sell 50,000 vehicles to Korea. {time} 2145 Well, guess what. We haven't even hit 10,000, while there have been over 561,000--half a million--vehicles sent from Korea here. So look at what is happening with the Korean agreement, another free trade agreement which just passed a couple of years ago. The proof is in the pudding. The Fast Track procedure, which allows no amendment here on the floor, yields this--more red ink for the United States. We were promised that the Korean agreement would create jobs and help balance our trade deficit in an effort to strengthen our economy and rebuild the American auto industry. Nothing could be further from the truth, as with every other agreement. We are in a deep trade deficit with Korea. The U.S.-Korean free trade agreement promised 70,000 jobs. In actuality, we have already lost 40,000. It is going in exactly the opposite direction. The U.S. Census Bureau recently revealed that the United States had a $2.8 billion monthly trade deficit with Korea just in November of last year, the highest monthly U.S. goods trade deficit with Korea on record. The historic U.S. trade deficit with Korea was driven by a record-setting $6.3 billion in imports from Korea and a lackluster $3.5 billion in exports to Korea from the United States. Auto sales did not surge, as we were promised. Exactly the reverse is true. And now we can look at China. You know, the story is no different. You would think we would have learned something. But if you look at trade with China--and China became a member of the World Trade Organization in 2001--Americans were promised, again, that that deal would expand market opportunities for United States companies, thereby increasing jobs here and American prosperity. How has this worked out? Let me share some specifics: The United States has lost over 64,000 manufacturing firms and at least 5.8 million manufacturing jobs to China. In the year 2013, the latest complete year of data, America actually racked up a $319 billion trade deficit with China. And you know this to be true because everything you buy--coffee cups, clothing, electronics, even solar panels--are all made in China. And the massive deficit we have racked up with China just in 1 year--that 1 year--amounted to a loss of 1.5 million American jobs. And that is just 1 year's damage. What America needs is not more of the same NAFTA-styled trade agreements. What America and American workers need is a trade policy that creates jobs, opportunity, and wealth in this country first. We need balanced trade accounts, not trade accounts that are in the red with every single country with which we have racked up these deficits. The American people--not just the global corporate elite--need to be in the driver's seat again, and that is where Congress has to do its job. Our Nation needs a trade policy that is results-oriented, that will yield jobs in America. We must open closed markets of the world. We must grow our exports. We must hold those who wrote these agreements accountable for the damage that they have done, and we must not create any more free trade agreements that dig the hole deeper. We must create jobs here in our country by moving our Nation toward economic independence--not dependence--by rebuilding our own manufacturing base here at home, by restoring our domestic energy security, and by making sure that these agreements result not in deficits, but in trade balances and, even more importantly, trade surpluses. Mr. Speaker, there are ways that a developed nation can trade with the developing world without gutting its own economy. America has got to figure out how to get there. And no trade deal should be brought up here under that Fast Track procedure where Congress can't amend until we fix what is wrong with these agreements. Haven't we learned in three decades that that flawed trade model just simply isn't working? Pushing huge trade agreements, like the Trans-Pacific Partnership, through Congress on a Fast Track course with no opportunity for amendment is not the way to create a strong middle class, rising wages, and real opportunity for the American people. Now is the time to hold this administration and this Congress accountable for changing course and start to invest in this country again and make sure that these trade partners with whom we do business open their markets. To do any less is to continue to harm the American people and continue to have this enormous downward pressure on job creation in this country and wage levels and benefit levels in this country, where the average American hasn't seen a raise in years. We have to change. This is too great a price for the American people to pay. So this evening, I thank those who are listening for their time. I thank the Speaker for the time this evening. I yield back the balance of my time. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 5 (Monday, January 12, 2015)] [House] [Pages H221-H222] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] AMERICA'S FREE TRADE DEFICIT The SPEAKER pro tempore.

Those who forced this to happen should know the consequences of their policies and what they reap: legions of desperate workers willing to do anything to survive. Now, let me turn to the Trans-Pacific Partnership that proposes to expand trade into regions with the worst labor violations and working conditions. We can't be fooled into thinking expanding trade agreements with 11 new nations in the Pacific rim will actually be the end to American jobs being shipped overseas. Of the 11 nations with which the United States is negotiating the Trans-Pacific Partnership, nine have wage levels significantly lower than our own. This will only intensify the already real reduction in wages American workers are experiencing year after year as our jobs are shipped overseas to increase profits of shareholders as they take advantage of impoverished laborers. Worse yet, for the immigration debate, as those who run the maquilas of Mexico and Central America realize, the next move will be to Vietnam for even cheaper labor. Factories on this continent will shut down, further exacerbating the poor economic conditions of our southern neighbors, leaving even fewer options other than for those individuals to flee north, seeking any economic opportunity to sustain themselves. I wanted to spend a moment looking at the Korean agreement because that was one of the latest ones they brought up here as a free trade agreement. They promised there would be thousands of jobs and that America would be able to sell 50,000 vehicles to Korea. {time} 2145 Well, guess what. We haven't even hit 10,000, while there have been over 561,000--half a million--vehicles sent from Korea here. So look at what is happening with the Korean agreement, another free trade agreement which just passed a couple of years ago. The proof is in the pudding. The Fast Track procedure, which allows no amendment here on the floor, yields this--more red ink for the United States. We were promised that the Korean agreement would create jobs and help balance our trade deficit in an effort to strengthen our economy and rebuild the American auto industry. Nothing could be further from the truth, as with every other agreement. We are in a deep trade deficit with Korea. The U.S.-Korean free trade agreement promised 70,000 jobs. In actuality, we have already lost 40,000. It is going in exactly the opposite direction. The U.S. Census Bureau recently revealed that the United States had a $2.8 billion monthly trade deficit with Korea just in November of last year, the highest monthly U.S. goods trade deficit with Korea on record. The historic U.S. trade deficit with Korea was driven by a record-setting $6.3 billion in imports from Korea and a lackluster $3.5 billion in exports to Korea from the United States. Auto sales did not surge, as we were promised. Exactly the reverse is true. And now we can look at China. You know, the story is no different. You would think we would have learned something. But if you look at trade with China--and China became a member of the World Trade Organization in 2001--Americans were promised, again, that that deal would expand market opportunities for United States companies, thereby increasing jobs here and American prosperity. How has this worked out? Let me share some specifics: The United States has lost over 64,000 manufacturing firms and at least 5.8 million manufacturing jobs to China. In the year 2013, the latest complete year of data, America actually racked up a $319 billion trade deficit with China. And you know this to be true because everything you buy--coffee cups, clothing, electronics, even solar panels--are all made in China. And the massive deficit we have racked up with China just in 1 year--that 1 year--amounted to a loss of 1.5 million American jobs. And that is just 1 year's damage. What America needs is not more of the same NAFTA-styled trade agreements. What America and American workers need is a trade policy that creates jobs, opportunity, and wealth in this country first. We need balanced trade accounts, not trade accounts that are in the red with every single country with which we have racked up these deficits. The American people--not just the global corporate elite--need to be in the driver's seat again, and that is where Congress has to do its job. Our Nation needs a trade policy that is results-oriented, that will yield jobs in America. We must open closed markets of the world. We must grow our exports. We must hold those who wrote these agreements accountable for the damage that they have done, and we must not create any more free trade agreements that dig the hole deeper. We must create jobs here in our country by moving our Nation toward economic independence--not dependence--by rebuilding our own manufacturing base here at home, by restoring our domestic energy security, and by making sure that these agreements result not in deficits, but in trade balances and, even more importantly, trade surpluses. Mr. Speaker, there are ways that a developed nation can trade with the developing world without gutting its own economy. America has got to figure out how to get there. And no trade deal should be brought up here under that Fast Track procedure where Congress can't amend until we fix what is wrong with these agreements. Haven't we learned in three decades that that flawed trade model just simply isn't working? Pushing huge trade agreements, like the Trans-Pacific Partnership, through Congress on a Fast Track course with no opportunity for amendment is not the way to create a strong middle class, rising wages, and real opportunity for the American people. Now is the time to hold this administration and this Congress accountable for changing course and start to invest in this country again and make sure that these trade partners with whom we do business open their markets. To do any less is to continue to harm the American people and continue to have this enormous downward pressure on job creation in this country and wage levels and benefit levels in this country, where the average American hasn't seen a raise in years. We have to change. This is too great a price for the American people to pay. So this evening, I thank those who are listening for their time. I thank the Speaker for the time this evening. I yield back the balance of my time. ____________________","Congressional Record, Volume 161 Issue 5 (Monday, January 12, 2015) [Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 5 (Monday, January 12, 2015)] [House] [Pages H221-H222] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] AMERICA'S FREE TRADE DEFICIT The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under the Speaker's announced policy of January 6, 2015, the Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Ohio (Ms. Kaptur) until 10 p.m. Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Speaker, I rise this evening to paint a picture of U.S. job loss resulting from our trade policies extending back now almost three decades. I rise because America has a huge ``good jobs'' deficit because we have a gigantic trade deficit. That means more imports come in here than our exports go out, largely because markets and other places are closed. Our workers and our communities have paid a tremendous price for this. I oppose any further NAFTA-like trade agreements, such as the Trans- Pacific Partnership, which the administration is proposing. That will ship out more U.S. jobs. We have had enough. The American people have had enough. Since 1975, when Wall Street's free trade job outsourcing roulette began, America has amassed a $9.3 trillion trade deficit with the world. If you look at this chart, we have on here every single trade agreement that was signed and all of the lost jobs that resulted from the growing trade deficits we are amassing with countries around the world. This has never happened before over our history in the United States of America. It is a very serious problem. The staggering loss of productivity associated with this deficit translates into a huge job loss here at home. In fact, that $9.3 trillion of accumulated trade deficit of more imports coming in here than exports going out has actually cost us over 47,500,000 lost American jobs. Most of those were really good jobs that paid living wages, jobs that just evaporated from our communities, jobs that were shipped to Mexico or to China, Korea, Bangladesh, Honduras, Guatemala, Turkey, El Salvador--everywhere in the world--largely to the Third World, and, frankly, to undemocratic countries where workers are treated like a bonded class. Our workers, no matter how loyal or hardworking, became expendable as this began. In fact, they were treated like expendable widgets. What is being hurt in the process is the belief of the public that the value of hard work has any meaning. There are some workers who have simply dropped out. Yes, American jobs are being outsourced year after year--for over a quarter century now--and workers are being treated like a game of musical chairs. Our jobs have been shipped out to penny-wage sweatshops hidden behind the Iron Curtain of anonymous towns in distant places most Americans will never visit. Anonymity, exploitation, and hidden squalor are as fundamental to free trade as the hollowing out of American jobs, our communities, and our middle class. Those who exploit workers in our country and globally believe they are so powerful that the American people won't be able to rein them in, and they think this Congress will continue to behave as it did before, despite the evidence that this doesn't work for the American people. Some of those very powerful interests are asking for another Fast Track trade deal to do it all over again in something called the Trans- Pacific Partnership, on an even bigger scale, including nations with the grossest violations of basic human rights. Let me turn first to the broken promises of NAFTA, which was really the fundamental agreement passed--over my objections--in the early 1990s and another agreement, CAFTA, that dealt with Central America. Fast-forward to this past summer when thousands of migrant children from Central America swarmed our southern border. Remember that? The American press acted surprised upon their arrival, and some people even threw tomatoes at buses that carried children from one detention facility to another. These children had lived under 20 years of NAFTA and CAFTA in Mexico, Guatemala, El Salvador, and Honduras. They had experience with the NAFTA trade agreement and the CAFTA trade agreement, which covers those countries, trade agreements that were sold as opportunities that would rise the tide of all boats, of all workers. What happened? Here in the United States, we had a huge loss of jobs to those countries, and Mexico's and Central America's infrastructures were not modernized. Their standard of living was not raised. In fact, the promise that those countries somehow would turn into stylistically rustic versions of the American consumer market never happened. They were told new jobs would abound, but our Nation began to hemorrhage jobs to Mexico as wages in Mexico and throughout Central America began to drop. Those deficits became part of the overall total. The problem is that in most of these countries where the free trade agreements were signed, what you see happening is more goods coming in here than our goods going out, a little trickle going to some places. In Mexico, what happened ever since NAFTA's passage was that we were promised trade balances. Every single year, it has gotten worse and worse and worse. This week, the broken promises sold to the American public and their elected officials is that these agreements would really work. The people who voted for those agreements should pay some attention to the debate of trying to withhold funding for the Department of Homeland Security because of the President's action on immigration. The stories of the youth being shipped back by the planeloads tell of families' lands being stolen from under them. The land was handed over to multinational corporate agricultural groups that come in and grow, for example, palm oil. Local displaced farmers were forced into urban settings--desperate, in search of food, in search of work at factories where jobs that were promised in return for the land--guess what--never materialized. Here on our own continent, the children became the refugees of transnational economic policies that harmed the entire continent. Hardly anyone even talked about that; but when you have this kind of disruption, when you have so much job loss, and when you have land, transferring title with millions of farmers disrupted from their way of life, what do we expect? Millions of displaced people in Mexico and Central America living in the shadow of border plants and urban factories exist in a state of peonage that makes older versions of slavery look positively beneficent, squatting on poisoned ground in jerry-rigged plywood and tar paper shacks. I have been in those shacks. I have gone to those places. When you do, you never forget it. Next door, water in gullies that surround these places is so polluted that communities smell of a rancid odor, and even chickens that they keep to try to feed themselves die from the drinking water. We have seen it. We have been there. The displaced population on the run is surging, thanks in large part to NAFTA and CAFTA's agricultural provisions, those very flawed provisions [[Page H222]] that provided no opportunity for adjustment as a First World nation met the economy of Third World nations. The terms of the agreement forced the revocation of land and allowed multinationals to begin buying up vast tracts in the interior, pushing untold millions of peasant farmers, who remain nameless, off their land and into the labor pool of the maquiladoras; yet we, as Americans, are surprised when their children, as migrants, flock to our southern border.

CREC-2015-01-12-pt1-PgS133-7,CREC-2015-01-12,114,KEYSTONE XL PIPELINE,"[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 5 (Monday, January 12, 2015)] [Senate] [Pages S133-S134] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] KEYSTONE XL PIPELINE Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, last week the House of Representatives voted on a bipartisan basis to pass a Keystone jobs and infrastructure bill. Meanwhile, the Senate energy committee got the process moving in this Chamber as it debated and approved a bipartisan Keystone measure as well. The committee consideration allows Senators from both parties to offer amendments and make their voices heard. It is the kind of serious legislating many Senators have been waiting a long time to see. It is the latest example of Congress getting back to work under a new Republican majority. Later this afternoon we will consider a cloture motion that will allow us to proceed to a similarly open debate here on the Senate floor. I know Senators from both sides are hungry for a real Senate debate. I know they want to offer amendments. I know they are anxious to finally have their voices and the voices of the people they represent heard here on the Senate floor. I expect the cloture motion to pass on a bipartisan basis. Of course, we originally hoped to start this process last Thursday. We wanted to spend Friday working on this bipartisan jobs bill, but the Senate lost that opportunity when some colleagues across the aisle objected to beginning the debate. Now, moving forward, what I would urge is for our Democratic friends to work with us as the new Republican majority continues to bring more openness to the Senate. The changes we are making are ones that many Democrats have indicated they want to see as well. The reforms we are implementing will give a real voice to constituents represented by Democratic Senators. We need to work together to ensure positive change takes hold. I am hopeful that will happen. Here is one consequence of that delay I mentioned. The Nebraska Supreme Court has since eliminated what has to be the last conceivable pretext to veto the Keystone jobs bill, so we will be starting the Senate's debate at a time when the rationale for building this pipeline has almost never been more obvious. I know the American people would welcome a change in posture from the President. I know supporters in both parties are determined to get a bipartisan jobs and infrastructure bill to his desk as soon as possible. We will take the next step in the process at 5:30 p.m. today, and then we will have an open floor debate on jobs, the middle class, [[Page S134]] infrastructure, and energy. At the end of this process, we will send a bipartisan jobs bill to the President. We will fulfill our pledge to stop protecting him from good ideas.

Mr. President, later today Members of the Senate family will have two opportunities to express our solidarity with the people of France in their hour of grief and to reaffirm our commitment to the principles of freedom and tolerance--values that have bound our nations together since the creation of the United States and the French Republic. In a short while the Senate will consider a resolution condemning the series of terrorist attacks that have shaken France, starting with the attack on the offices of the satirical newspaper Charlie Hebdo and ending with a siege Friday at a kosher supermarket in Paris. Our resolution expresses our condolences to the families of the victims and our solidarity with the people of France. It also expresses our deep commitment to the universal right of freedom of expression--a freedom for which the writers and artists of Charlie Hebdo gave their lives. I am honored to lead this resolution, along with Senators Murphy of Connecticut and Johnson of Wisconsin. Later this afternoon Senators and their staffs will have an opportunity to sign a condolence book expressing their sympathy and solidarity to the people of France. The book will be outside the Senate Foreign Relations Committee room on the first floor of the Capitol. In memory of the victims, we will welcome the French Ambassador to the United States, Ambassador Gerard Araud, in the committee room at 4:15 p.m. If the terrorists who attacked Charlie Hebdo and the kosher supermarket in Paris meant to frighten and divide freedom-loving people in France and around the world, they have failed utterly. Yesterday 4 million people marched in demonstrations in cities across the nation of France. A million and a half people marched in Paris alone. Authorities said it was the largest gathering in Paris since the end of World War II and the largest demonstration in the history of the nation of France. They marched to declare their solidarity with the victims of the Charlie Hebdo massacre and the supermarket murders and to demonstrate their unity. The marchers included Christians, Muslims, Jews, and many other religious faiths and nonbelievers. President Francois Hollande led the March. He was joined by European and African leaders, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas, America's Ambassador to France, and our Assistant Secretary of State. Marches were also held in other cities around the globe yesterday, from Washington to the West Bank. Tens of thousands of people showed their solidarity with the victims of these terrorist attacks in France. In Chicago hundreds of people turned out in the cold yesterday to rally at Daley Plaza under American and French flags. One of the organizers of the Chicago rally was a young woman named Eve Zuckerman who holds joint U.S. and French citizenship and has lived in Chicago for about 4 years. She said the spasm of violence that has shaken France is not simply an attack on France. In her words, ``What it really means is that anyone who is for freedom and for tolerance is also under attack.'' In our own country in the days after 9/11, our grief was made bearable by the countless acts of courage, kindness, and solidarity we witnessed amidst the carnage, and so it is within France today. One story that has touched many in France and around the world concerns a young man who worked at the kosher supermarket in Paris that was attacked on Friday. The young man risked his life to hide seven Jewish customers in the freezer in the supermarket's basement. He then risked his life again to slip out of the basement and tell the police there were people hidden downstairs. This young man described the layout of the supermarket and the location of the hostages--crucial details that enabled the police to save so many lives and end the standoff. This young man has been hailed as a hero by the citizens of France and by Israeli President Netanyahu. One more thing about this young French hero--he is a Muslim immigrant, born in Mali. Martin Luther King told us: We are bound together in a single garment of destiny. The millions of people in France and around the world who marched yesterday and freedom-loving people throughout the world understand this. Together in our unity and resolve, we will overcome this latest assault on our shared values. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 5 (Monday, January 12, 2015)] [Senate] [Page S134] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] TERRORIST ATTACKS IN PARIS Mr. DURBIN.

CREC-2015-01-12-pt1-PgS134-3,CREC-2015-01-12,114,HOMELAND SECURITY FUNDING,"[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 5 (Monday, January 12, 2015)] [Senate] [Pages S134-S136] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] HOMELAND SECURITY FUNDING Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, over the weekend, as I mentioned, as millions of people were marching on the streets of France and around the world to demonstrate the world's unity in the aftermath of the horrible terrorist attack in France, the President announced that he will convene a summit at the White House next month to discuss what can be done further to stop the threat of violent extremism. This is a time when we should all be focusing on what we can do to stop the threat of terrorism in our country as well as the rest of the world, so it is truly surprising, to say the least, that the House of Representatives will vote on a bill this week that threatens to shut down the Department of Homeland Security. That is our government agency that is responsible for protecting Americans from terrorism. What in the world would lead the House of Representatives to threaten to shut down this agency? We should not even be debating the Department of Homeland Security at this moment in history. Every other government agency--every single one of them--has already been funded through the end of this fiscal year, September 30, and that is normal when we fund the government. But the Republicans in the House and Senate insisted weeks ago that the Department of Homeland Security only be funded through the end of February. Why did they demand that this critical agency that is responsible for keeping us safe across America not be funded in the normal manner? Why did they put America at risk with this type of funding? Well, because they wanted an opportunity early in the year--early in the legislative session--to take a stand against President Obama's immigration policies. They feel so strongly about this, they are willing to put the Department of Homeland Security's budget at risk. So this week the House Republicans are preparing to pass legislation that would defund President Obama's immigration policies, including the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals Program, known as DACA. What is that program? It puts on hold the deportations of immigrant students and children who grew up in this country and allows these young people to live and work legally in America on a temporary basis. That is what DACA is. These young people are well known to me and to most. They are known as DREAMers. It was 13 years ago that I introduced the DREAM Act. For 13 years I have been trying to pass a bill into law which says that the sins of the parents should not be visited on the children. These young people who are affected by DACA and the DREAM Act--many of them were brought to the United States as infants and toddlers. They had no voice in this family decision to come here. They did not know, could not know, that one of their parents was undocumented. They grew up in America. They went to school in America. They participated in America. They went to the neighborhood churches and mosques and temples. They were the ones who were standing in their classroom every single day of their lives stopping for a solemn moment to [[Page S135]] pledge allegiance to the American flag--the only flag they have ever known. But the fact is, they were brought here as babies and children, and they were undocumented. They grew up in America. They identified this country as home. They envisioned this dream of living here. Yet they did not have a legal status. The DREAM Act said we would give these young people a chance. If they had a clean criminal record, if they would finish high school, if they would go on to college or even enlist in our military, we would allow them to move to legal status--give these DREAMers a chance. Time and again, we called this legislation. Sadly, it never passed the House and the Senate at the same time. Then President Obama decided 2 years ago that he would use his Executive authority to protect these young people from being deported. We estimate there are about 2 million of them across the United States. He said to them: If you will come forward, pay your fee, go through a background check--if you are prepared to do that and register with the government, we will spare you from deportation. That is what the DACA program is. Mr. President, 600,000 did. Mr. President, 600,000 came up with the money. I can recall in the city of Chicago when we had the sign up--the very first sign up for this DACA Executive order. It was amazing. We did not know if 200 people would show up or 400 or even 1,000. Well, the night before--at midnight, the night before we started signing them up--the first day they could sign up for DACA, the families started gathering, standing outside at Navy Pier in downtown Chicago. They stood there all night waiting for a chance to sign up for this program. Many of them were parents accompanying their children. The parents themselves were not going to get any direct benefit from this, but they wanted their kids to be spared the fear of deportation. They wanted to give their kids a chance. In the end, thousands came through the door--so many we could not even handle the volume with our volunteer attorneys and many others who were helping. But it was a clear indication that these families wanted their children to have a chance--a chance to earn their way into legal status in America. That is the DACA---- (Disturbance in the Visitors' Galleries.) The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator will suspend until the Sergeant at Arms has restored order in the galleries. The assistant Democratic leader. Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, the young people I have described are known as DREAMers. They were brought to the United States as children. They grew up in this country, and they have overcome great obstacles to continue to live here. They are the future doctors, engineers, teachers, and soldiers who will make America stronger. Now, in the last 2 years, as I mentioned, more than 600,000 DREAMers have received DACA--this Executive order by President Obama which allows them to stay as long as they are registered, pay their fee, and not be deported. What has happened to these young people now that they have their chance, they have gone to school? I met 10 of them who are now at Loyola's school of medicine. They are extraordinary students. They were the best of the best. They did not have a chance because they did not have that document that gave them an opportunity to enroll. Well, they are going to school now, and they have pledged to continue to serve this country as doctors, given that chance, in some of the poorest communities in my State and our Nation. In past speeches I have given on this floor--over 50 of them--I have highlighted the contributions that many DACA recipients already make to our country. They are working as engineers, small business owners, and public school teachers. The Center for American Progress and the Partnership for a New American Economy has found that giving legal status to DREAMers will add $329 billion to our economy and create 1.4 million new jobs by 2030. How can this be possible that 600,000 have that kind of impact? These are not ordinary young people or ordinary young graduates. These are extraordinary young people who want to be part of this Nation of immigrants. But the Republicans in the House of Representatives want to end DACA. They want to put an end to this program. They argue it was unconstitutional for the President to say he would suspend deportation for these young people. They want these young people to be deported, removed from this country, sent back to countries where many of them can never recall living, going to countries where they literally cannot speak the language. That is the House Republican position. They feel so strongly about deporting these young people, they are willing to hold the Homeland Security funding bill hostage to force the Democrats to agree. Well, let me be clear. Democrats will not be swayed by this kind of blackmail. We will insist the Department of Homeland Security be funded and that the President have the authority that every President has had to establish his own immigration policies within the limits of Executive authority. It is the height of unfairness. First congressional Republicans obstructed immigration reform legislation. Now they want to obstruct the very agency responsible for homeland security. It was more than a year and a half ago--the date was June 27, 2013-- on the floor of this Senate, we passed comprehensive immigration reform with a strong bipartisan vote of 68 to 32. This bill--which I joined seven other colleagues, Democrats and Republicans, working on it-- strengthened our border to a level even greater than today, cracked down on illegal immigration, protected American workers in a fair and humane manner, and addressed the challenges facing 11 million undocumented workers currently living in our country. But for the last year and a half, the House of Representatives, led by Speaker Boehner, has refused to allow a vote on the Senate's immigration reform bill. Not once would they allow this bill to come to the floor of the House for a vote. If Speaker Boehner had brought the bill to the floor, it would have passed with a strong bipartisan vote. He knew it and he was determined not to ever let that happen. It was only after the Speaker had demonstrated clearly to the President, to the Senate, and to the American people that he would not even participate in the debate on immigration reform that President Obama issued his second order. I have been involved in a lot of efforts to pass bipartisan immigration reform legislation. It is so frustrating for us to have finally passed a bill in the Senate--Democrats and Republicans; supported by the AFL-CIO, representing organized labor; supported by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, representing business; supported by virtually every major faith in this country--and then to see it ignored and stopped in the House of Representatives. So President Obama, after the election, announced that, having given the Republicans in the House a chance to legislate, he would use his powers to try to fix our broken immigration system, to put on temporary hold the deportations of individuals who are the parents of U.S. citizens or legal permanent residents, who have lived in our country for years, and who pose no threat to America's safety. This is clearly not amnesty, because at the end of the day, what the President has given is only a temporary reprieve to these people to stay and work in America--so long as they register and pay their fee, so long as they submit themselves regularly to criminal background checks, and so long as they pay their fair share of taxes. This deferred action status does not give them permanent status or citizenship. It is not amnesty by any definition. The President's Executive action will make America safer, bringing millions of immigrants out of the shadows to register with the government and to go through background checks. It will also help our economy and American workers. You see, these undocumented workers, working off the books, are many times paid much less than minimum wage, if they are paid at all, and they are competing with American workers. Once they are brought out of the shadows under the President's recent Executive order, they will need to [[Page S136]] be paid the ongoing wages, the minimum wage of America. By bringing these workers into the legal workforce, it will eliminate the unfair competition of the underground economy. And all of these workers will be paying their taxes, which will increase tax revenues by billions of dollars each year. The President's Executive action is also smart and realistic when it comes to enforcing our immigration laws. It is not humanly possible to deport all of the undocumented immigrants in this country. So every administration has had to set priorities on those who will be deported and those who will not. The government should not waste its limited resources to deport immigrants who have lived and worked here for years, who have children who are citizens or lawful permanent residents, and who do not pose any threat to America's future. Instead, the administration has made it a top priority to deport those who have committed serious crimes or are a threat to safety. Now, Executive action on deportation is clearly lawful. Every single President--Democrat and Republican--every one of them since President Dwight David Eisenhower has used his Executive authority to improve our immigration system. This argument that it is somehow unconstitutional just does not bear basic scrutiny. The Supreme Court has repeatedly affirmed that the Federal Government has broad authority to decide whom to deport. President Obama is acting well within his legal authority when he establishes policies about whom will be deported by this administration. The American people have elected us to solve problems. Because the House Republican leadership has failed to reform our immigration system, the President had no choice but to use his authority under the law to improve our economy and security and keep families together and at least do a small part toward solving America's broken immigration system problems. However you feel about the President's immigration policies, it is hypocritical and counterproductive--it is just wrong--to take out your frustration by putting at risk critical homeland security funding. I hope the House Republicans will somehow or another overcome this fit of pique that has led us to this moment and realize their first obligation is to this great Nation. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 5 (Monday, January 12, 2015)] [Senate] [Pages S134-S136] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] HOMELAND SECURITY FUNDING Mr. DURBIN.

But the fact is, they were brought here as babies and children, and they were undocumented. They grew up in America. They identified this country as home. They envisioned this dream of living here. Yet they did not have a legal status. The DREAM Act said we would give these young people a chance. If they had a clean criminal record, if they would finish high school, if they would go on to college or even enlist in our military, we would allow them to move to legal status--give these DREAMers a chance. Time and again, we called this legislation. Sadly, it never passed the House and the Senate at the same time. Then President Obama decided 2 years ago that he would use his Executive authority to protect these young people from being deported. We estimate there are about 2 million of them across the United States. He said to them: If you will come forward, pay your fee, go through a background check--if you are prepared to do that and register with the government, we will spare you from deportation. That is what the DACA program is. Mr. President, 600,000 did. Mr. President, 600,000 came up with the money. I can recall in the city of Chicago when we had the sign up--the very first sign up for this DACA Executive order. It was amazing. We did not know if 200 people would show up or 400 or even 1,000. Well, the night before--at midnight, the night before we started signing them up--the first day they could sign up for DACA, the families started gathering, standing outside at Navy Pier in downtown Chicago. They stood there all night waiting for a chance to sign up for this program. Many of them were parents accompanying their children. The parents themselves were not going to get any direct benefit from this, but they wanted their kids to be spared the fear of deportation. They wanted to give their kids a chance. In the end, thousands came through the door--so many we could not even handle the volume with our volunteer attorneys and many others who were helping. But it was a clear indication that these families wanted their children to have a chance--a chance to earn their way into legal status in America. That is the DACA---- (Disturbance in the Visitors' Galleries.) The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator will suspend until the Sergeant at Arms has restored order in the galleries. The assistant Democratic leader. Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, the young people I have described are known as DREAMers. They were brought to the United States as children. They grew up in this country, and they have overcome great obstacles to continue to live here. They are the future doctors, engineers, teachers, and soldiers who will make America stronger. Now, in the last 2 years, as I mentioned, more than 600,000 DREAMers have received DACA--this Executive order by President Obama which allows them to stay as long as they are registered, pay their fee, and not be deported. What has happened to these young people now that they have their chance, they have gone to school? I met 10 of them who are now at Loyola's school of medicine. They are extraordinary students. They were the best of the best. They did not have a chance because they did not have that document that gave them an opportunity to enroll. Well, they are going to school now, and they have pledged to continue to serve this country as doctors, given that chance, in some of the poorest communities in my State and our Nation. In past speeches I have given on this floor--over 50 of them--I have highlighted the contributions that many DACA recipients already make to our country. They are working as engineers, small business owners, and public school teachers. The Center for American Progress and the Partnership for a New American Economy has found that giving legal status to DREAMers will add $329 billion to our economy and create 1.4 million new jobs by 2030. How can this be possible that 600,000 have that kind of impact? These are not ordinary young people or ordinary young graduates. These are extraordinary young people who want to be part of this Nation of immigrants. But the Republicans in the House of Representatives want to end DACA. They want to put an end to this program. They argue it was unconstitutional for the President to say he would suspend deportation for these young people. They want these young people to be deported, removed from this country, sent back to countries where many of them can never recall living, going to countries where they literally cannot speak the language. That is the House Republican position. They feel so strongly about deporting these young people, they are willing to hold the Homeland Security funding bill hostage to force the Democrats to agree. Well, let me be clear. Democrats will not be swayed by this kind of blackmail. We will insist the Department of Homeland Security be funded and that the President have the authority that every President has had to establish his own immigration policies within the limits of Executive authority. It is the height of unfairness. First congressional Republicans obstructed immigration reform legislation. Now they want to obstruct the very agency responsible for homeland security. It was more than a year and a half ago--the date was June 27, 2013-- on the floor of this Senate, we passed comprehensive immigration reform with a strong bipartisan vote of 68 to 32. This bill--which I joined seven other colleagues, Democrats and Republicans, working on it-- strengthened our border to a level even greater than today, cracked down on illegal immigration, protected American workers in a fair and humane manner, and addressed the challenges facing 11 million undocumented workers currently living in our country. But for the last year and a half, the House of Representatives, led by Speaker Boehner, has refused to allow a vote on the Senate's immigration reform bill. Not once would they allow this bill to come to the floor of the House for a vote. If Speaker Boehner had brought the bill to the floor, it would have passed with a strong bipartisan vote. He knew it and he was determined not to ever let that happen. It was only after the Speaker had demonstrated clearly to the President, to the Senate, and to the American people that he would not even participate in the debate on immigration reform that President Obama issued his second order. I have been involved in a lot of efforts to pass bipartisan immigration reform legislation. It is so frustrating for us to have finally passed a bill in the Senate--Democrats and Republicans; supported by the AFL-CIO, representing organized labor; supported by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, representing business; supported by virtually every major faith in this country--and then to see it ignored and stopped in the House of Representatives. So President Obama, after the election, announced that, having given the Republicans in the House a chance to legislate, he would use his powers to try to fix our broken immigration system, to put on temporary hold the deportations of individuals who are the parents of U.S. citizens or legal permanent residents, who have lived in our country for years, and who pose no threat to America's safety. This is clearly not amnesty, because at the end of the day, what the President has given is only a temporary reprieve to these people to stay and work in America--so long as they register and pay their fee, so long as they submit themselves regularly to criminal background checks, and so long as they pay their fair share of taxes. This deferred action status does not give them permanent status or citizenship. It is not amnesty by any definition. The President's Executive action will make America safer, bringing millions of immigrants out of the shadows to register with the government and to go through background checks. It will also help our economy and American workers. You see, these undocumented workers, working off the books, are many times paid much less than minimum wage, if they are paid at all, and they are competing with American workers. Once they are brought out of the shadows under the President's recent Executive order, they will need to [[Page S136]] be paid the ongoing wages, the minimum wage of America. By bringing these workers into the legal workforce, it will eliminate the unfair competition of the underground economy. And all of these workers will be paying their taxes, which will increase tax revenues by billions of dollars each year. The President's Executive action is also smart and realistic when it comes to enforcing our immigration laws. It is not humanly possible to deport all of the undocumented immigrants in this country. So every administration has had to set priorities on those who will be deported and those who will not. The government should not waste its limited resources to deport immigrants who have lived and worked here for years, who have children who are citizens or lawful permanent residents, and who do not pose any threat to America's future. Instead, the administration has made it a top priority to deport those who have committed serious crimes or are a threat to safety. Now, Executive action on deportation is clearly lawful. Every single President--Democrat and Republican--every one of them since President Dwight David Eisenhower has used his Executive authority to improve our immigration system. This argument that it is somehow unconstitutional just does not bear basic scrutiny. The Supreme Court has repeatedly affirmed that the Federal Government has broad authority to decide whom to deport. President Obama is acting well within his legal authority when he establishes policies about whom will be deported by this administration. The American people have elected us to solve problems. Because the House Republican leadership has failed to reform our immigration system, the President had no choice but to use his authority under the law to improve our economy and security and keep families together and at least do a small part toward solving America's broken immigration system problems. However you feel about the President's immigration policies, it is hypocritical and counterproductive--it is just wrong--to take out your frustration by putting at risk critical homeland security funding. I hope the House Republicans will somehow or another overcome this fit of pique that has led us to this moment and realize their first obligation is to this great Nation.

through the government publishing office [ www.gpo.gov ] homeland security funding mr. durbin. mr. president, over the weekend, as i mentioned, as millions of people were marching on the streets of france and around the world to demonstrate the world's unity in the aftermath of the horrible terrorist attack in france, the president announced that he will convene a summit at the white house next month to discuss what can be done further to stop the threat of violent extremism. this is a time when we should all be focusing on what we can do to stop the threat of terrorism in our country as well as the rest of the world, so it is truly surprising, to say the least, that the house of representatives will vote on a bill this week that threatens to shut down the department of homeland security. that is our government agency that is responsible for protecting americans from terrorism. what in the world would lead the house of representatives to threaten to shut down this agency? we should not even be debating the department of homeland security at this moment in history. every other government agency--every single one of them--has already been funded through the end of this fiscal year, september 30, and that is normal when we fund the government. but the republicans in the house and senate insisted weeks ago that the department of homeland security only be funded through the end of february. why did they demand that this critical agency that is responsible for keeping us safe across america not be funded in the normal manner? why did they put america at risk with this type of funding? well, because they wanted an opportunity early in the year--early in the legislative session--to take a stand against president obama's immigration policies. they feel so strongly about this, they are willing to put the department of homeland security's budget at risk. so this week the house republicans are preparing to pass legislation that would defund president obama's immigration policies, including the deferred action for childhood arrivals program, known as daca. what is that program? it puts on hold the deportations of immigrant students and children who grew up in this country and allows these young people to live and work legally in america on a temporary basis. that is what daca is. these young people are well known to me and to most. they are known as dreamers. it was 13 years ago that i introduced the dream act. for 13 years i have been trying to pass a bill into law which says that the sins of the parents should not be visited on the children. these young people who are affected by daca and the dream act--many of them were brought to the united states as infants and toddlers. they had no voice in this family decision to come here. they did not know, could not know, that one of their parents was undocumented. they grew up in america. they went to school in america. they participated in america. they went to the neighborhood

CREC-2015-01-12-pt1-PgS136-3,CREC-2015-01-12,114,KEYSTONE XL PIPELINE ACT--MOTION TO PROCEED,"[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 5 (Monday, January 12, 2015)] [Senate] [Pages S136-S146] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] KEYSTONE XL PIPELINE ACT--MOTION TO PROCEED The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senate will resume consideration of the motion to proceed to S. 1, which the clerk will report. The bill clerk read as follows: Motion to proceed to Calendar No. 1, S. 1, a bill to approve the Keystone XL Pipeline. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the time until 5:30 p.m. will be equally divided and controlled in the usual form. The Senator from Maine. Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be permitted to proceed for up to 15 minutes as in morning business. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Ms. COLLINS. Thank you, Mr. President. I further request that the time not be charged to either side on the debate on the Keystone pipeline, if that is necessary. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, reserving the right to object--I am sorry, I was discussing with the staff. If the Senator will please repeat her request. Ms. COLLINS. I asked unanimous consent to proceed for up to 15 minutes as in morning business, and since my remarks do not pertain to the debate for the Keystone Pipeline, that the time not be charged to either side in that debate. Mr. DURBIN. I have no objection. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Priorities of Senate Special Committee on Aging Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, it has been my privilege to serve on the Senate Special Committee on Aging since my very first days in the Senate, and I am honored to have been elected to chair this committee for the 114th Congress. I wish to welcome the Presiding Officer, Senator Cotton of Arkansas, to the committee. He will be a new member on our committee, and I believe he will enjoy his service as much as I have. My service on the aging committee is particularly appropriate since Maine is the oldest State in the Nation by median age. Many people would guess that Florida would have that distinction, but, in fact, it is the great State of Maine. Throughout its history, the aging committee has spurred Congress to action on issues that are important to older Americans through its hearings, its investigations, and its reports. This is the first time a Maine Senator has chaired the committee since the 1990s, when my predecessor, mentor, and friend, Senator Bill Cohen, served as chairman. I wish to share with my colleagues today my priorities for the committee as we begin this new Congress. I have three major priorities for the committee's work: first, retirement security; second, investments in biomedical research targeting diseases that disproportionately affect older Americans, such as Alzheimer's and diabetes; and, third, protecting seniors against financial exploitation and scams. I am increasingly concerned that our seniors will not have adequate savings and other financial resources during their retirement years. The committee will, therefore, focus on retirement security and, in particular, on the need to encourage more savings and better financial planning. According to the nonpartisan Center for Retirement Research at Boston College, there currently is an estimated $6.6 trillion gap between the savings Americans have today and what they should have in order to maintain their standard of living during retirement. Nationally, one in four Americans has no source of income beyond Social Security. In the State of Maine, the number is one in three. Social Security provides an absolutely vital safety net. However, with an average benefit of just $16,000 a year, it certainly is not enough to finance a comfortable retirement for many Americans. According to a Gallup survey published in 2012, more than half of all Americans are worried they will not be able to maintain their standard of living in retirement. That is up sharply from 34 percent two decades ago, and the Boston College analysis demonstrates that their concern is warranted. There are many reasons for the decline in retirement security facing American seniors, including the demise of many defined benefit pension plans in the private sector; the severity of the recent financial crisis, which wiped out much of the net worth of many [[Page S137]] seniors, at least temporarily; rising health care costs; the need for long-term care; and, most of all, the simple fact that Americans are living far longer than we used to. Many Americans reaching retirement age also have more debt than retirees of previous generations. I remember when my parents paid off the mortgage on their home and had a mortgage-burning party. Well, today, people who are the age my parents were when they paid off their house are taking on new debt and new mortgages. We found in the aging committee that there are seniors who are still paying off their student loans or the student loans of their children. These are all issues I look forward to the committee exploring in depth in this new Congress. Another priority will be highlighting the importance of biomedical research on diseases such as Alzheimer's and diabetes, which take such a devastating toll on older Americans and their families. Investments in biomedical research not only improve the health and longevity of Americans but also provide benefits to our economy and to the Federal budget. For example, nearly one out of three Medicare dollars is spent treating people living with diabetes. According to multiple economic analyses, there is roughly a 2-to-1 return on investment in Federal support for biomedical research. This investment at the National Institutes of Health and at research centers across the country spur job creation and are critical to America's competitiveness in the global research environment. As the Senate cochair of the Congressional Task Force on Alzheimer's Disease, I am particularly committed to helping to spur breakthroughs in Alzheimer's disease, which has had such a devastating impact on 5.2 million Americans and their families. In addition to the suffering it causes, Alzheimer's costs the United States an astonishing $214 billion a year. That includes $150 billion in costs to the Medicare and Medicaid programs. These costs will only skyrocket as the baby boom generation ages. Fortunately, there is promising research that holds hope for Alzheimer's patients and their families. The research community is poised to make important advances through clinical trials and investigating new therapeutic targets. But adequate funding is critical to advance this research and to achieve these breakthroughs. At a time when the United States is spending more than $200 billion a year for Alzheimer's patients, we are spending less than three-tenths of 1 percent of that amount--about $600 million a year--on research. Surely, we can do more for Alzheimer's, given its tremendous human and economic price. The National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease has as its primary goal the prevention and effective treatment of Alzheimer's by the year 2025. To meet that goal, the chairman of the Federal Alzheimer's Advisory Council says that we need to devote $2 billion a year to Alzheimer's research. Well, think about that. That is only 1 percent-- in fact, it is less than 1 percent--of what we as a society are spending to care for people with Alzheimer's. That investment will lead to better treatments and ultimately to a means of prevention or even a cure for this awful and expensive disease. The aging committee will also continue its focus on scams that target our seniors, such as the Jamaican lottery phone scam we exposed in the last Congress. This nefarious scheme, which is estimated to have cost Americans as much as $300 million a year, particularly targeted seniors in the Northeast. Some seniors in my State lost tens of thousands of dollars to the scam which involved a con artist calling a victim to tell him or her that they had won the Jamaican lottery but needed to pay fees to process the winnings. I don't need to tell my colleagues that these seniors had won nothing of the sort. But this was a very sophisticated scheme. In addition to educating seniors to help them avoid becoming victims of such scams, the hearing resulted in the Jamaican Government passing new laws targeting the scammers and prompted Federal law enforcement to make several arrests. The aging committee will also continue its fraud hotline to help protect seniors from these kinds of scams and financial exploitation, and the phone number for that fraud hotline, which is toll-free, is 1-855-303-9470. In addition to these three major priorities, it is my hope our committee in the second year will also take a close look--really scrutinize--Federal programs designed to help our seniors, such as those authorized by the Older Americans Act. We want to make sure these programs are as effective and efficient as possible and that their benefits reach those seniors as intended. So we will be performing that oversight function and sharing our findings with the committee of jurisdiction--the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee--on which I am also privileged to serve. The Senate Special Committee on Aging has a long history and tradition of bipartisanship, and my work on this committee during the past Congress was particularly rewarding because of the strong partnership I forged with the committee chairman, the senior Senator from Florida, Bill Nelson. I look forward to continuing that bipartisan tradition with my good friend and close colleague, Senator Claire McCaskill of Missouri, who will be serving as the committee's ranking member in the 114th Congress. Finally, I encourage the Presiding Officer and all of the other members of the committee not only to be active participants in the committee but also to share with us their thoughts on issues that we should pursue. Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor, and seeing no one seeking recognition, I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. SCHATZ. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Ernst). Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. SCHATZ. Madam President, I rise today in opposition to S. 1, which will circumvent the administration's official review process for projects crossing international borders and approve construction of the Keystone XL Pipeline, a pipeline dedicated to increasing production of some of the dirtiest, most polluting, and most dangerous crude oil in the world. Supporters of this pipeline in Congress have been relentless. Over the last 2 Congresses they have held 44 votes in the House and Senate intended to approve Keystone. On Tuesday, the very first bill the new Republican majority introduced, traditionally reserved for a party's highest legislative priority, was Keystone. Think about this. Here we stand in what people still call the world's greatest deliberative body, and the first bill we are taking up is not infrastructure generally, not national energy policy, not even national laws as they relate to our pipeline infrastructure. No, we are legislating about a specific pipeline which will move oil from Canada through the United States to be primarily exported from our southern border. I understand there are people of good will and good faith, including the Presiding Officer, who are on both sides of this issue. But it is hard to imagine why this should be the first piece of legislation we take up in this Congress. We have yet to seriously consider or to clarify our policy with respect to the Islamic State. Income inequality is gutting the middle class. Our national infrastructure needs a jolt of investment. Our immigration policy is a failure and a mess. I do not understand why this would be S. 1. Supporters of this bill have stood up three main arguments in favor of Keystone and expanding drilling of tar sands oil reserves in Canada. One, they say it will increase energy security; two, they think it will lower oil and gas prices; third, they say it is a jobs bill. Let's examine these claims, because however tenuous they were, they have been undermined further by facts over the last couple of years. First, the United States has never during the modern age of global energy trade been more energy secure. We import far less oil from unstable regimes and unfriendly countries than we have in decades. We are continuing to build massive amounts of ever cheaper homegrown clean energy such as wind [[Page S138]] and solar, even as we use our energy more efficiently. The United States will add nearly 10 gigawatts of wind and solar capacity in the next year. Not including hydro, the United States has over 85,000 megawatts of renewable energy capacity and continues to build on that number year over year. The prices for solar have dropped 80 percent since 2008 and prices for wind power, which are already competitive with fossil fuels, have dropped 30 percent since 2008. These trends are creating jobs right here at home. For example, the wind industry has over 500 manufacturing facilities across 44 States that are responsible for making wind turbines with over 66 percent domestic content. Second, the recent collapse of crude oil and gasoline prices demonstrates two things. In my home State of Hawaii, energy prices remain far too high. But on the mainland, oil and gas prices are currently very low. The idea that Keystone would make a significant difference was never based in reality, but now it is just obvious. We have low prices and the project has not even started. Gasoline is now $2.21 a gallon. Crude oil prices have slipped below $50 a barrel. The last time gasoline prices were this low was in the aftermath of the financial crisis. As a practical matter, it is not clear to me, and it is certainly not clear to most energy experts, how moving oil from Canada through the United States and exporting refined crude from the Gulf of Mexico would significantly reduce energy prices for us in the United States. Finally, this is called a jobs bill by some. This is many things. It is anti-clean air; it is anti-clean water; it is anti-public health. It is a regulatory earmark. But it is not a jobs bill. It is not deserving of being the No. 1 priority of the 114th Congress. We have heard estimates ranging as high as 42,000 indirect or induced jobs during the construction phase. We know, and everyone seems to agree, that Keystone will employ approximately 35 full-time employees when construction is finished. That is not 3,500 employees. That is not 35,000 employees. That is the 35 full-time employees when construction is completed. If we want to do a real jobs bill worthy of the Senate, we should do a real jobs bill. An infrastructure bank, a highway bill, Shaheen- Portman--all would create orders of magnitude more jobs than this. The American economy added 353,000 jobs in November alone, which made 2014 the strongest year for job growth since 1999. If we pass a highway bill, we get millions of jobs. If we pass an infrastructure bank, we will get hundreds of thousands of jobs. If we pass the bipartisan Shaheen-Portman energy efficiency bill, we will also get hundreds of thousands of jobs. Look, even one new job is a good thing. But if we want to do a jobs bill, let's do a jobs bill. There is plenty of room for us to work together on infrastructure, on energy efficiency, and create hundreds of thousands and even millions of jobs. But this is an energy bill. It moves us in the wrong direction. There are colleagues, with whom I agree, who are arguing against this legislation primarily saying they want to allow the administration's process to play out and that we should not supersede the State Department review. I agree. It is fair to say this is unprecedented, even a little strange, for the Congress to legislate the specifics of a particular infrastructure project. But I want to be clear. This is not a process argument for me. I oppose Keystone because it is a bad idea. Whether it is done through the regular order or in an expedited fashion, whether it is done through the administrative process or the legislative process, I oppose any action, whether through legislation, litigation, or administrative action, that will enable the extraction of Canadian tar sands oil. My reasons are very simple--climate change and math. Climate change, because it is the greatest and most urgent challenge to the health of our families, to the economy, and to our way of life. I want to preserve the American way of life, not endanger it. Math, because we have crunched the numbers and we know we simply cannot afford to burn the oil from tar sands and put its pollution into the air. It is simple. We have a budget. Just as every family in this country must stick to its budget and live within its means, we have to do the same as a planet when it comes to carbon pollution. A new study published last week in the scientific journal Nature makes this clear. The authors asked the question: If we want to stay within our carbon budget and limit warming to 2 degrees Celsius, which is the limit 167 countries agree we must meet to avoid catastrophic effects of climate change, how much more coal, gas, and oil can we burn? The study finds that in order to meet this goal, the majority of the world's known reserves of fossil fuel must stay in the ground between now and 2050. This includes one-third of the world's current oil reserves and 80 percent of current coal reserves. It also finds, and this is critical, that: Any increase in unconventional oil production-- Which includes Canadian tar sands. --is incommensurate with efforts to limit average global warming to 2 degrees Celsius. As we learn more about climate change amidst a clean energy revolution, we find that moving toward clean energy, taking control of our future, is good for business. Our economy will do better. It will grow faster and it will be more resilient if we embrace the technologies and solutions at our fingertips and end our reliance on fossil fuel. We have a chance to embrace the future here. Our future is not tar sands oil. Our future is wind and solar and geothermal and energy efficiency. Our future is not in adding carbon pollution. Our future is in innovating our way out of this problem. Throughout our history, America always leads when we are needed the most. That is what we have to do, not in the direction of more carbon pollution but toward a clean energy economy. A report by New Climate Economy, a group chaired by former Mexican President Felipe Calderon, and including Bank of America chairman Chad Holliday, among others, marshals quantitative evidence to show that action on climate change is a requirement for future global economic growth. In other words, those who warn about the EPA regulation or prices on carbon killing jobs have it exactly backward. The truth is that in order to avoid major disruptions to our economy, we have to reduce carbon pollution and work with other countries such as Canada to ensure that they do the same. I am looking forward to the open amendment process on this bill that the majority leader has promised. It will be an opportunity for the American public to see where Members of the Senate stand on the facts of climate change. Anyone who looks at the facts and does the math ought to oppose this bill and oppose construction of the Keystone XL Pipeline. For me and for many Americans, a vote against this bill is a vote to preserve and protect the air we breathe and the water we drink. It is a vote to ensure that we continue to reduce carbon pollution and fight climate change. It is a vote to leave our children a healthy world. I urge my colleagues to oppose cloture on the motion to proceed. I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Entry-Exit Visa System Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, the attacks on the people of France demonstrate in the most chilling terms the threats posed to Western nations by those who are imbued with Islamic terrorism. While there are many factors that play into the spread of this jihadist ideology in the West, it is time for an honest and plain admission that our open immigration policies are ineffective and have failed to meet the minimum standards that are set by existing law in the United States. This is something I have been dealing with for quite a number of years--a decade really. We have laws that would improve dramatically our ability to identify and block terrorists from entering and staying in the country, but they are not funded and they are not [[Page S139]] carried out and it is unacceptable, as I will point out. Dozens of terrorists and terror plotters have been admitted to the United States on visas or are relying on broader networks to simply enter into our country, taking advantage of lax immigration policies. For instance, the 9/11 attackers all came here on visas. A visa is a document that allows an individual to come for a limited period of time and then return to their home country. This visa system is essential in a modern world, but it needs to be managed and carried out in an effective way. The Boston bombers came as asylees, people seeking asylum, while their mosque was linked to foreign nationals tied to ISIS and foreign terrorists. The individual behind the attempted Christmas bombing in Oregon was a refugee. We have a class of individuals we accept each year who claim to be refugees from foreign countries. This one was from Somalia. The recently foiled plot to bomb a courthouse and school in Connecticut was attempted by a Moroccan national who had a revoked student visa. Many individuals have visas to be students in the United States. We are not managing that well at all. This one had a revoked student visa. It was revoked because of information that came to the attention of officials, but no one made an effort or successfully attempted in any real way to find the individual so he might be deported. Al Qaeda operatives who were apprehended in Kentucky were on visas from Iraq. These are only some of the examples that are out there. These individuals use lax visa policies, flawed asylum policies, flawed refugee policies, and flawed border protection policies. In addition, we are not organized in a way that works effectively. In addition to that, the President of the United States has directed his ICE officers, his Citizenship and Immigration Services officers, and his Border Patrol officers, who are the key individuals in this system, to conduct their business in a way that guarantees failure. That is just the fact. The 9/11 Commission--we all remember that great Commission after the terrible attack on 9/11--zeroed in on our lax immigration policies. Among other things, the Commission demanded implementation of a biometric entry-exit visa system. What does that mean? That means a biometric system where people are identified effectively through fingerprints or some other identifier. I have been through this for years. Back when President Bush was President and we worked with Homeland Security, Governor Ridge was the Secretary of Homeland Security. I think at the end he was finally convinced, and I worked on him very hard. But he volunteered, the last day in office, to use a fingerprint biometric system. It should have already been done by the time President Bush left office, but it wasn't, and it hasn't been done yet. We need a system that works. By the way, police officers have in their cars all over America computer-type screens where they can stop someone on the road, they can ask them to put their hand on the screen, and it reads their fingerprints. It checks the National Crime Information Center to find out whether the person is wanted for murder in New York. He might have caught him in Texas. It lets the officer know whether there are warrants out for these individuals. This is the way the system works in our country, and we need to use it with regard to people who come here on visas. It is an outrage that this hasn't been done, completed fully, and made operational years ago. It is an outrage. It is in the law of the United States. Congress has funded money for this project and it has not yet been done. It will cost us in the future, as the 9/11 Commission has so warned. The 9/11 Commission demanded this system, and it is designed to track those entering and departing the United States on visas. By the way, almost half of the people, at least 40-plus percent now of individuals unlawfully in America entered on a visa. In other words, they didn't come across the border unlawfully. They came lawfully-- perhaps using false documents, but they got a visa. They came to the United States maybe lawfully, but they just did not return to their home country when the visa expired. My colleagues have to know no one is checking. We have no idea whether they left the country or stayed in the country. We do not have an operable exit visa system. This is so bizarre because it is not expensive. It can be implemented rapidly. It will work and give us valuable information that we must have if we are serious about this process, and we must be serious about the process. The individuals in France--I mentioned the ones in the United States--left the country, went through Yemen, apparently, were trained in some sort of terrorist camp, and came back and executed their violent acts in France. So we have to do a better job of this, and we can do it. President Obama's administration has refused to implement the entry- exit system as required by law. We have talked about this publicly and debated it for years. Just last year the co-chairs of the 9/11 Commission, in an evaluation of how well the recommendations they made back after 9/11 have been carried out--a 10-year review of how their report had been received and how much of it had been accomplished-- issued this written statement. Without exit-tracking, our government does not know when a foreign visitor admitted to the United States on a temporary basis has overstayed his or her admission. Here is the language. We put it on a chart because it is important that we understand this. Without exit-tracking, our government does not know when a foreign visitor admitted to the United States on a temporary basis has overstayed his or her admission. Had this system been in place before 9/11, we would have had a better chance of detecting the plotters before they struck. . . . There is no excuse for the fact that 13 years after 9/11 we do not have this much capability in place. Amen. That is exactly correct. That is from ``Reflections on the Tenth Anniversary of the 9/11 Commission Report,'' Thomas H. Kean and Lee H. Hamilton, in 2014. In fact, the original report said this: The Department of Homeland Security, properly supported by the Congress, should complete, as quickly as possible, a biometric entry-exit screening system. That was the report from 2004. It is a very important report. They went to great length to help this Nation figure out what is the responsible thing to do to protect ourselves better from those attackers on 9/11, many of whom were visa overstayers. They didn't come across the border unlawfully; they came across on a lawful visa. Some of them I think had false documentation to get that visa, but they came on a visa, for the most part lawfully, and did not go home as they were required to go home. They overstayed their visa. Nobody knew they had overstayed. Nobody made an inquiry about it. The ``Tenth Anniversary Report Card: The Status of the 9/11 Commission Recommendations,'' by Thomas H. Kean and Lee H. Hamilton, 2011, said this: Full deployment of the biometric exit component of US-VISIT should be a high priority. Such a capability would have assisted law enforcement and intelligence officials in August and September 2001 in conducting a search for two of the 9/11 hijackers that were in the U.S. on expired visas. This would have helped. Indeed, of course, those of us who have some experience in law enforcement know that when you get to one or two of the guys, the whole scheme may get disrupted, and we can penetrate the organization and break it up and stop crime from occurring. To me, it is mind boggling, as the commission leaders have told us, that we haven't completed this. I am told there are forces that don't like the exit visa system. They think it might slow things down a little bit. First, this is not correct. When you come into the country, you are clocked in and you are biometrically fingerprinted. What would you have to do when you leave? Go to the airport, go in a certain line, go through, show your ticket, show your passport, put your hand on a biometric screener, you are read, and you are approved to leave. It is not going to take any massive amounts of time. One excuse after the other has slowed this down, and it is not acceptable. We have to do better. In fact, the administration has suspended enforcement of the visa system almost entirely. We have to understand, colleagues: If we don't have even an exit visa system where we know [[Page S140]] who left the country, how do we know who overstayed and who stayed in the country? Unless somebody overstays their visa and they are caught for speeding and the police officer identified that, I will ask colleagues, what happens? Under the policy of this President of the United States, directed to the lowest officers in America, nothing happens. If the individual does not commit a serious felony, they will not be processed for deportation, even though they have come to the country on a promise to leave on a certain date and flatly refused to do so. This is not acceptable. If we don't have a system that has integrity, then everybody gets the message pretty soon: Just get a visa, come to America, you never have to leave. If you don't get a felony charge against you, you are never going to be deported. This is the policy of this government at this very moment. It is hard for anybody to believe, but that is the truth. We have approximately 5 million visa overstays in the United States. But as the National ICE-- Immigration Customs Enforcement--officers Council president Chris Crane has explained: ICE agents are now prohibited from arresting illegal aliens solely on charges of illegal entry or visa overstay. What a dramatic statement that is. And not only visa overstays, they are prohibited from arresting and removing people who came across the border illegally. That is what he means by illegal entry or visa overstays. This of course removes a cornerstone of integrity in any law system. If we can't look people in the eye and say: We give you a visa, you have a 6-month visa, but at 6 months you have to return to your home country, and mean it, and say: Eventually you will be apprehended and deported if you don't--then the system has no integrity. That is where we are today. Unsurprisingly, ABC News reported that the Obama administration had lost track of 6,000 foreign students who had overstayed their visas and were of ``heightened concern.'' In other words, these 6,000 had some special concern in their background that made us worry about them, whether it was drugs or terrorism or whatever. Of course they have lost sight of them. They are not attempting to find them. So the head of the union representing U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services officers, one of the three major components of the Department of Homeland Security dealing with immigration, Mr. Ken Palinkas, was explicit in his warning to us. It is remarkable what Mr. Crane has said and now what Mr. Palinkas has said: There is no doubt that there are already many individuals in the United States, on visas--expired or active--who are being targeted for radicalization or who already subscribe to radicalized views. Many millions come legally to the U.S. through our wide open immigration policy every year--whether as temporary visitors, lifetime immigrants, refugees, asylum- seekers, foreign students, or recipients of our ``visa waiver program'' which allows people to come and go freely. Yet our government cannot effectively track these foreign visitors and immigrants. This is the man whose officers do this job. They are the ones who approve the visas and manage this system. He went on to warn that the President's so-called Executive amnesty would make the situation radically worse, saying: I write today to warn the general public that this situation is about to get exponentially worse--and more dangerous. . . . Express your concern to your Senators and Congressmen before it is too late. It is a national security imperative to stop this Executive amnesty. It sends exactly the wrong message. What it says is that if you can get into America--through the border, by boat, by plane, on a visa--any way you get into this country and pass the border, you are not going to be asked to leave unless you commit some felony--some serious felony, for that matter. Many felonies don't qualify. And we have over 100,000 people who have committed serious felonies who have been released into America. We don't know where they are, and they are not going to be deported. We have to restore immigration enforcement, establish better controls and screening on immigration from high-risk regions of the world. We really should give more attention to that. It is perfectly legitimate. The visa system, the immigration system of the United States, should serve who? It should serve the interests of the American people. Somebody doesn't have a constitutional right to come to America. The decision is whether America feels like it is in its interests. We have always accepted a large number of people. In fact, we have the largest immigration numbers of any nation in the world. We admit 1 million a year lawfully. When they come from high-risk areas of the world, terrorist states, we should indeed give more scrutiny to those applicants. Census data shows that legal immigration to the United States from the Middle East is one of the largest and fastest growing categories of new admittances. For the national security of the United States, it is imperative that Congress block Executive amnesty and restore essential enforcement, basic bread-and-butter law enforcement. Anyone who claims to be concerned about our national security should be resolutely focused on this task. There is so much that can be done with relatively little difficulty if we have the leadership and will to get it done. It would be unthinkable for the President to veto the Homeland Security appropriations bill in order to continue this illegal and dangerous amnesty scheme during a time of growing threats abroad. Again, let me say that this: the entry-exit visa system is an unappreciated, important part of American immigration law. It is critical to the national security of the United States, as the 9/11 Commission has so stated on more than one occasion. We can do this. Why is it not being done? What forces, what special interests, are interceding between the people of the United States, the national interests, and their special interests that block this kind of system? We can make it work. It is not that hard. We need a biometric system, and that system should be founded on the fingerprint. It took us a number of years, but I think the government has finally concluded it must be the fingerprint for a lot of reasons, one of which is if somebody got a visa to the United States and they committed a murder, an armed robbery, a terrorist act, a major fraud, and a warrant was issued for their arrest--if you don't clock it in at the airport, who knows when they are leaving? So this would pick it up and would pick up any warrants that might be outstanding for those individuals anywhere in the United States that are put in the NCIC, National Crime Information Center. That is the way the system should work. It is long overdue. In the course of the discussions we will have in the weeks and months to come about the necessity of fixing a broken immigration system, the entry- exit visa system has to be implemented. It is long overdue. We can make it happen. It is not that expensive. It is relatively inexpensive, actually, and it will make us much safer in the process.

Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. COATS. Madam President, here we are at the beginning of a new year and a new Congress, and I think we all feel a responsibility to do what the American people voted for in the November 2014 election, which is to come together in this body and in this Congress and work together to find sensible solutions to the very real problems facing Americans. [[Page S141]] It is no secret that the last 6 years have been pretty tough for a lot of people who are out of work or doing part-time work; kids graduating from high school, graduating from college, graduating from community schools, 2-year schools; going back and getting new training and still unable to find meaningful jobs; finding jobs that are part time, two or three of those together; parents trying to save money, pay the mortgage, save money to send the kids to postgraduate school. It has not been easy. So we have come to a point where we have legislation in a new session of Congress, with commitments on a bipartisan basis to stand together, to work together, to try to find solutions, to get people back to work and get our economy moving again. Now we come to the very first issue up for discussion and debate and hopefully passage in this new Congress--the Keystone Pipeline. This is an issue that has been going on for 6 years. The President has been obstinate in his obstruction in letting this go forward, in making a decision. Yet here we are, finally, with an opportunity to not only pass legislation which has passed the House of Representatives, again, just last week with very significant bipartisan support--but now in the Senate to take up this legislation and to move it forward tonight with this vote, to start the process to allow amendments, to allow debate, and to move forward and hopefully enjoy bipartisan support with over 60 votes and then move it to final passage and then send it to the President for, hopefully, signing. This project is the largest, ready-to-build infrastructure project in the United States. It supports tens of thousands of jobs. The estimate has been well over 42,000. It invests billions of dollars in the American economy. It increases revenue to States and local governments, all without spending one dime of taxpayer money. This is a private sector initiative that can be of great benefit to our country. It can provide meaningful jobs and has many benefits for us in the future. It is supported by Democrats, by Republicans, and by a number of labor unions. For instance, the Indiana State Building and Construction Trade Council, which represents 75,000 working Hoosiers in my State, reached out to me recently and asked me to support construction of the Keystone Pipeline, calling it ``an important job creation and energy security issue.'' They are right on the mark. They know I have been a longtime supporter of this effort, but they wanted to put it in writing. I am not sure it was necessary, and they weren't weighing this on the basis of Republican or Democrat, liberal or conservative; they were saying that this is good for us and we hope all of our Senators can support it. We hope it passes. This is an initiative that puts our people to work. Other labor unions, including the North America's Building Trade Unions and the Laborers' International Union of North America support this project. I mentioned the President, for 6 years, has come up with more feeble excuses in terms of why he believes this should not go forward. The last excuse was: We are in a process here and the process has to go forward. That process was waiting, apparently, on the Nebraska Supreme Court approval of the pipeline route through Nebraska, and that was his excuse for why he would have to veto it. I am sure my colleagues now have the word that the Nebraska Supreme Court has upheld State approval of the Keystone Pipeline. In fact, the President's own State Department, in response to numerous calls for environmental studies-- all of which were used as an excuse for not going forward--the President's own State Department has repeatedly approved this, saying it will not have a negative environmental imprint. So what could possibly be the reason the President remains intransigent on this particular issue, because every other box has been checked? We have to come down to the inevitable conclusion that it is all political, that an extreme environmental wing of the President's own party is simply putting untold pressure on him to not go forward with anything having to do with fossil fuels or providing energy security for America from our own resources. After all, a significant portion comes from Montana and North Dakota--and the last time I checked they are in the United States--and from our friendly neighbor to the north, Canada. If this doesn't go through, we will keep importing large quantities of oil from the Middle East. We know what complications there are in terms of securing that oil and how much volatility occurs there based on what is happening today in the Middle East. So getting this product from our Northern States of North Dakota and Montana and getting this product from our friend to the north, Canada, simply makes a great deal of sense in terms of our energy security, our energy supplies, and lessening our reliance on the volatility that comes from getting oil from other sources. To conclude, let me just make it clear what it is we are trying to do. This will help the United States diversify its energy supply. It will offset our dependence on Middle East oil. It will support tens of thousands of American jobs in construction. It will invest billions of dollars in the American economy. It will increase revenue to State and local governments. It will not harm our environment, as numerous studies have indicated--all these benefits without spending a dime of taxpayer money. So after 6 years of delay, procrastination, and evermore feeble excuses, it is time for the President to make a decision. Soon he will have an opportunity to use that pen he so famously talked about not to sign a veto or to declare a veto but to sign a bill approving the Keystone Pipeline into law. I strongly support construction of this pipeline and I urge my colleagues to do the same. I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Will the Senator withhold his request? Mr. COATS. I certainly will. I didn't see my colleague. I am happy to do so. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia. Mr. KAINE. Madam President, I am happy I was here for the comments of my colleague from Indiana on the Keystone Pipeline and, similar to the Senator from Indiana, I am also happy to finally have this debate. The comments he made are very sincere and passionately believed. I accept that. I only challenge one aspect of the comments, which is the suggestion that opposition of Keystone is feeble or only for political reasons. I am a pro-energy Senator. The first bill I introduced in the 114th Congress was a bill I am cosponsoring with Senator Barrasso of Wyoming to expedite American exports of liquid natural gas, but I am an opponent of Keystone on environmental and economic grounds, and I wish to spend a few minutes describing why. To begin with, it can probably be summed up in a question: Why embrace dirty energy when America is in the midst of a clean energy revolution? That is a primary reason I oppose Keystone. The United States, thank goodness, is on a clean energy roll. Not only are we on a clean energy roll, we are on an energy production roll that is helping our economy, helping our trade deficit, and hurting some of our most significant global adversaries, notably Russia and Iran. We have embraced over the last few years a set of conservation and efficiency investments, probably most notably the increased CAFE standards that have saved energy use in the vehicle sector as well as helped the American auto industry significantly rebound. Our natural gas revolution, of which I am a strong supporter, has enabled American industry and consumers to get lower priced energy, and it has enabled us to lessen our dependence on dirtier fuels in the production of electric power and other aspects of our power usage. Wind and solar and other noncarbon energy developments have rocketed ahead. Nearly one- third of the energy that has been added to the American electricity grid since 2005 has been in the wind and solar area. We are one of the few nations in the world that in the period from 2005 to 2012 actually saw a reduction in our carbon emissions. We are on a clean energy roll. We are innovating for the world and we are selling technologies to the rest of the world and that is good for our economy as well as good for the environment. We are also asserting American energy leadership not just in the advances in clean energy but also in the significant advances in American energy production. I think we should feel [[Page S142]] good about the fact that we are a country that has gone from being one of the greatest net importers of energy in the world to now a country that is going to be one of the greatest energy producers in the world, and in many energy areas we are now a net exporter. So emissions are going down. Production and exports are going up. The other thing that is great for Americans is that prices are going down. A barrel of oil right now is in the $50-a-barrel range, which is putting about $1,000 a year back into the pockets of an American family. It is helping American businesses, and it is imposing, as I mentioned earlier, some significant harm upon two of our most persistent global adversaries--Iran and Russia--that rely on energy exports to drive their economy. This energy revolution--higher production, greater economic efficiency, greater cleanliness--has all been happening without the Keystone Pipeline. It has all been happening without the United States embracing tar sands oil. We are going in the right direction now. I oppose the Keystone Pipeline because accelerating the use of tar sands oil turns us around. Instead of going in the right direction to more production, more national security and greater emissions control, the Keystone Pipeline accelerates tar sands oil and takes us in the wrong direction. Simply put, tar sands oil and the exploitation of that resource is a bad bet for the environment and, I believe, a bad bet for the economy. Last month, December 2014, a magazine I really like that normally has a lot of articles about the outdoors, Outside magazine, ran a lengthy article on the area of Canada in Alberta where tar sands are mined. The article is called ``The High Cost of Oil.'' To anyone who is interested in this debate--pro, con or undecided--go online to Outside magazine, December 2014, ``The High Cost of Oil,'' and read what the mining of tar sands oil does to this part of Canada and to this planet. Tar sands oil is not like conventional gas or petroleum. Tar sands oil, the mining and refining and production of it, produces about 15 to 20 percent more greenhouse gas emissions per unit of energy than conventional petroleum. Natural gas produces dramatically less CO 2 than conventional petroleum, but tar sands oil produces dramatically more. If you care about the emissions of CO 2 -- and I think we should all care about the emissions of CO 2 because I accept the science that says CO 2 emissions cause significant climate effects--if you care about CO 2 emissions, then tar sands oil is absolutely the worst thing that can be done. Over the 2 years now that I have been in the Senate, I have had a lot of folks come to me and talk to me about Keystone. They never say a word about greenhouse gas or CO 2 emissions--not a word. Senator Coats didn't say a word in his comments about CO 2 or greenhouse gas emissions. I ask individuals, when they come and talk to me about Keystone: What do you think about CO 2 emissions? What do you think about the fact that tar sands oil is significantly more carbon dense than normal petroleum? The response I find myself getting is: I don't know; I am not a scientist. In fact, I heard that from an energy CEO who employs tons of scientists in his organizations: I don't know; I am not a scientist. The scientific consensus I believe is very clear. We have to do what we can--not drastically and dramatically but in an incremental way-- every day to bring down our CO 2 emissions. I believe we need to do that in smart ways. Yet, from an emissions standpoint, tar sands oil goes exactly in the wrong direction. It is not just CO 2 emissions. Tar sands oil also involves the mining of it. I would encourage you to read this article. It involves scraping up vast acreages of an arboreal forest in Alberta to get to the tar sands underneath. So far, an area about the size of the State of Rhode Island has been completely despoiled to look like a moonscape to get to tar sands, and this will significantly accelerate the more tar sands are built. In the area of Alberta where the mining and refining is taking place, there has been a dramatic increase in respiratory illness and other illnesses associated either with airborne emissions or with the contamination of the area's water supply. Probably one of the most powerful things about the article is not the lengthy analysis, not the words, it is the pictures. The pictures in that article are staggering. When you see what has to be done to these arboreal forests to mine tar sands oil, you come back to this question: Why would we embrace a dirtier technology when America is on a clean- energy revolution that is driving down prices, driving up production, and also driving down emissions. Tar sands oil takes us in the wrong direction. It is not so much about the pipeline. We rely on pipelines in this country, but it is about the acceleration of the development of a resource that, frankly, just doesn't need to be developed. I will conclude and say this. Some say--and I made this argument-- well, look, it is going to be mined anyway and refined anyway. If the pipeline doesn't go through the United States, it will go westward or eastward through Canada or another direction. I am not completely sure that is correct. The article in Outside discusses the fact that Canadians, who know this better than anybody because they live in the neighborhood, are fighting against pipelines being built in Canada. There is also the matter with oil now at a significantly lower price than it has been. Even the economics of this tar sands oil, which is pretty expensive because of what you have to do to refine it, may not make any sense. But even if we set those arguments aside and somebody says to me, why shouldn't the United States just give the big green light to tar sands oil because somebody is going to get it, the reason I think we shouldn't is the United States is showing the world right now what it means to be an energy leader. With increased production, lower emissions, lower prices through innovation--through American innovation--we are showing the world what it means to be an energy leader. We are a leader because we have embraced a simple effort. I am not an engineer, but as I look at what happened in innovation in the last decade, the ethic we have embraced is: Let's do it cleaner tomorrow than today. That is pretty simple. Let's do it cleaner tomorrow than today--not dramatically cleaner. It doesn't have to turn day and night from today to tomorrow. Let's just get a little bit cleaner tomorrow than today. That is what we have been doing as a Nation. It has been increasing supply. It has been driving down demand. It has been driving down prices. It has been helping us control emissions. That is what we should keep doing. I am a pro-energy Senator, but I am a deep skeptic about the use of tar sands oil. For that reason, I am glad we are going to have the debate. I think we should finally be at it. But I am going to oppose the Keystone Pipeline because tar sands oil is going backwards and not forwards. We are showing the world what it means to go forward, and that is the direction we should continue to go. I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll. Ms. CANTWELL. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coats). Without objection, it is so ordered Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, we are going to be voting shortly on the motion to proceed to S. 1, the Keystone XL Pipeline. I am here to urge my colleagues to vote no on that motion to proceed. We had a couple of chances to come to the Senate floor already today and last week and talk about the important issue of energy development in the United States and how we move our country forward with job creation and energy development. The President--we got to hear his remarks and certainly we respect people's points of view that this issue is an issue we have had a lot of time to discuss. Mr. President, the issue is whether the American public and people in affected States have had a lot of time to talk about this issue and whether they have had a transparent process to talk about this issue. I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record an article that [[Page S143]] was in USA TODAY whose headline is ``Permit problems plague Keystone XL pipeline's S.D. leg.'' There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows: [From USA Today, Jan. 7, 2015] Permit Problems Plague Keystone XL Pipeline's S.D. Leg (By John Hultjhult) The South Dakota Public Utilities Commission on Tuesday voted down a move by tribal and environmental groups to force a reboot to the Keystone XL pipeline's state-level permitting process. ( http://www .argusleader.com/story/news/2015/01/06/sd-permit-keystone-xl- still-question/21359367/ ) PUC commissioners said there are clear questions about whether South Dakota's stretch of the massive and controversial project is still due the construction permit it earned in 2010, given a series of changes to its original scope. The 2014 version of the pipeline would be able to carry crude from North Dakota, for example, along with the anticipated crude extracted from tar sands in Alberta, Canada. Even so, commissioners ruled that forcing pipeline owner TransCanada to start over without being offered a chance to explain how it could make those changes while meeting its old obligations would be a denial of due process. ``We need to go through the process to find out,'' Commissioner Chris Nelson said. TransCanada asked for re-certification of its 2010 construction permit in September. The company had to ask for re-certification because four years had passed since the permit was granted. The pipeline stalled as President Obama chose Tuesday to delay the issuance of a federal permit indefinitely, a move that has frustrated supporters, who say the project will add jobs and boost energy security. If completed, the Keystone XL pipeline would release more than 800,000 barrels of oil a day. The GOP-controlled Senate is expected to take up the issue this week. In a new application for the 313 miles of pipeline planned for South Dakota, the company notes 30 changes to the original project, including the addition of North Dakota oil, minor route changes, alterations to construction plans and costs. The Yankton Sioux Tribe filed a motion to dismiss the company's application based on those changes, saying the re- certification process is meant for projects that have been delayed, not those that have altered dramatically in scope. The permit was issued with a set of 50 conditions, which were based on the project as approved four years ago. Thomasina Real Bird, a lawyer for the Yankton Sioux Tribe, told commissioners that the changes to the pipeline are simply too significant to allow the company to apply for re- certification. The company isn't just asking to re-certify a stalled project, she said. ``They're going a step beyond, and that step is not allowed by law,'' Real Bird said. Several others spoke in support of the Yankton Sioux Tribe's motion to dismiss, including Kimberly Craven of the Indigenous Environmental Network. ``I would urge the commission to start over,'' Craven said. ``It's a new permit, a new ballgame.'' Bill Taylor, a lawyer for TransCanada, told commissioners that re-certification is meant to determine whether delayed projects still fall within the scope of an old permit. Dropping a re-certification request because a project changes renders the re-certification process pointless. Keystone XL has changed, but Taylor said the company is prepared to prove that it still meets each of the 50 conditions attached to its 2010 approval. The pipeline is still a pipeline, the product is the same, and the end result is more energy security for the U.S., Taylor said. ``The current iteration of the project can and will meeting the conditions upon which the permit is issued,'' Taylor said. The PUC voted 3-0 to deny the motions to dismiss the application brought by the Yankton Sioux Tribe and joined by others. The hearing on the merits of the re-certification is planned for May. Ms. CANTWELL. This is an article that just recently appeared in the paper about how South Dakota is bringing up objections to the pipeline, and they want to do due process with their public utility commission to make sure this project meets the criteria of environmental and safety concerns and security concerns that State wants to see met. The reason this is still an issue in South Dakota is because part of the pipeline will go through South Dakota. There have been many changes since the original proposal was put forth, and people in South Dakota want to know exactly what these changes are and exactly how they will go through the process. In fact, one Native American tribe representative who was objecting said: The company is not just asking to recertify its old project. They are going a step beyond that that is not allowed by law. So there are people who want them to go through the normal process because siting of a pipeline of this nature is of great concern to local residents, to property owners. I find it interesting that in the debate on this issue, we on this side of the aisle are the ones who are advocating and standing up for property owners to make sure there is not a taking of their property without a transparent process and input for that process because that is exactly what transpired here when the company, with the help of the State of Nebraska, did not continue to proceed through their public service commission, their public utility commission, and instead tried to pass a law saying that the environmental review and security issues and oversight could be done by the Governor. Now, my colleagues who are Governors know that when you are Governor, you do not have the most transparent process. It is not as if citizens are going to come to hearings in the Governor's office. It is not as though all of that is there for review. Certainly those citizens do not have the ability to object and make sure they are getting the right compensation for their property and make sure issues of safety and security are addressed. So that is why some private property owners sued. Because the legislature and the Governor did not have the right to act; the law taking the power away from the utility commission and giving it to the Governor was unconstitutional. The separation of powers is divided between the Governor and their public service commission. It is the job of those UTCs--utilities and transportation commissions around the country--to protect the interests of the public in the siting of these facilities. That this authority was now moved up through the legislature to the Governor to decide all of that was clearly something that was not constitutional. I find it very interesting that four of the seven supreme court justices said, in fact, yes, that law passed by the legislature was not constitutional. So my question is, What is the hurry? Now that this issue, based on standing and the other justices not deciding, has the process to move forward, Congress feels some sort of urgency to be a siting commission and site a pipeline that has, No. 1, failed to go through the public process in the State of Nebraska; No. 2, has a public process now being questioned in the State of South Dakota, raising concern and urgency that those issues of the public be addressed; and No. 3, goes over what the President of the United States has said he wants to follow as a due process and make sure all the issues are brought to the table. I will remind my colleagues that if everybody here had their way, the President would have approved the original Keystone XL pipeline route. Congress thought they should stick their hands in the middle of this siting and land use issue and put in legislative language on a passed bill by the Congress saying the President, if it was a national security interest, must decide and site the Keystone Pipeline. Thank God those at the State Department and the White House decided that was not such a smart idea because that current pipeline went through a major aquifer that served eight States and posed a great deal of concern to landowners, farmers, residents, and various individuals about that particular proposal. So if this body would have had its way before--those who support this pipeline--they would have pressured the President to approve what is now a defunct, horrible idea of what was proposed by TransCanada. So now I ask my colleagues, are you sure all of the issues have been addressed here at the local level? Because clearly there are people in Nebraska and people in South Dakota who do not think so. Last I checked, our job is not to site pipelines; our job is to move our country forward on an energy strategy that will produce jobs, diversify our resources, and make the United States a leader in energy. I know my colleagues feel as if we will get a chance to address a lot of issues if we do move forward in a debate, and I am sure there will be many on many sides. I question whether we shouldn't be spending our time focusing on a bipartisan energy bill with lots of support on a whole myriad of [[Page S144]] others issues we need to work on, as we did in 2007, to make sure we are helping in the transformation of energy policy moving forward that will produce a lot more jobs. This particular proposal, as many of my colleagues have pointed out, while there are some immediate construction jobs, the long-term jobs are very few compared to many of the other things we have been doing. I would also like to point out that since Keystone has undertaken more development in the United States, that part of that development in the United States has also come into question lately. The security of the welding on the pipeline that has been done in the southern part of that pipeline has come into question, even to the point where I think the State Department has said to the company: We are going to have a third-party validator approve whether you are actually meeting the standards we would like to see in the development of this pipeline in the United States. But there are many issues here about safety and security, as my colleagues can point out who have brought up these issues before. My colleague from Michigan suffered one of the most devastating oilspills in her area. That was a tar sands oilspill. My colleague from Michigan, Senator Stabenow, has actually flown over that oilspill and cited that it took 4 years and $1.2 billion to clean it up and that the tar sands sunk to the bottom of the river and the river had to be dredged. So this is something my colleagues may not quite understand, that the tar sands, even according to the Commandant of the Coast Guard--we do not really have a solution for its cleanup when it spills in water. That is why I want to make sure that tar sands pay into the oilspill liability trust fund, as any other oil source does, so that we can make sure we are planning for the future and for getting help and response for any of these oilspills that could occur in the future. But needless to say Michigan and the Kalamazoo spill taught our Nation how dangerous this oilspill process could be. So why are we prematurely trying to cut off the debate on this issue at the local government level and say that we in Congress know better than these utility and transportation commissions and their transparent siting process for the American public? Why do we somehow know better that this is where a pipeline should go and how the process should work? So I hope my colleagues will stop and think more about how TransCanada proposal. I know some of my colleagues like to talk about being a good neighbor, and I like to say, you know, we in the Pacific Northwest consider British Columbia a very big friend and neighbor. There are many times that people talk about two provinces and five States working together as an organization on economic issues. So that structure has been in place for many years in the Pacific Northwest. But the people of British Columbia have not been a big supporter of tar sands oil expansion. Something like 60 percent of the public of British Columbia opposes having a tar sands pipeline cross their province. TransCanada knows they are not going to be successful in getting this oil from Alberta across British Columbia out to the Pacific because the people of British Columbia do not want it. So, of course, why not come to the United States? Why not ask them if they want a pipeline going through the middle of their country? British Columbia Premier Christy Clark laid out five principles that ought to have been met in order to site a pipeline of tar sands. Those conditions have not been met, and the province is officially opposed to the pipeline. So there was a lot of opposition and concern there. I will note for my colleagues that when a public UTC--a utility commission or public service commission--when they evaluate a project, they have to look at the environmental impact, and that is water supply, wildlife, vegetation, plants, and they have to look at the economic and social impact. They need to look at alternative routes, the impact to future development near the pipeline, and the views of cities and counties. Again, I will note that I think all of those are a part of having a transparent process instead of a political process on siting. So I am not for moving forward on what I consider special interest legislation, Congress siting for a special interest--this TransCanada company--a project that even people in Canada have raised suspicion about. I hope that we will allow the President to still do due process on such an important issue of environmental concern and that we will not start setting a standard that if you want to short-circuit the eminent domain and protection rights of individuals, we will just bypass all of that at the local level and somehow go to Congress and they will get that done for you. I think that is a very bad message. I hope my colleagues will turn down this legislation, I hope that we can move on to other energy issues that will help our country diversify and move forward in the future. I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. HOEVEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. HOEVEN. Mr. President, I rise to again talk about the Keystone XL Pipeline approval bill. We will be voting on cloture on the motion to proceed in about 15 minutes or so. I believe we have a bipartisan majority. We have 60 sponsors of the legislation, and we will have some others join us in voting to proceed on the bill. That is important, not just because this is bipartisan legislation, important energy legislation for our country but, as I have said before, this is an opportunity for all the Members of this body-- Republican and Democrat--to come forward with their amendments in an open amendment process and really have an energy debate. Let's talk about the energy future of this country and let's bring forward amendments to this legislation that can be good amendments and help us build the right kind of energy plan for our country. What I would point out about this Keystone Pipeline approval bill is that as we work to build an energy plan for this country, as we work to produce more energy so we are truly energy secure--a lot of people call it energy independence--but the way I define it is energy security for our country where we produce more energy than we consume, so we control our destiny. If we produce more energy than we consume, then we control our destiny when it comes to energy. But to do that, we would not only have to produce that energy, we have to have the infrastructure to move it safely, cost effectively, and efficiently from where it is produced to where it is consumed. We have this incredible opportunity with Canada to have North American energy security. We are working with our closest friend and ally in the world. We together produce more energy than we consume, and we have the infrastructure in place to move it from where it is produced to where it is consumed in our country. Now we control our own destiny. When it comes to OPEC or when it comes to Russia or when it comes to China, when it comes to geopolitical events that affect the price of energy, we are in a strong situation. Look at what is going on in Western Europe right now. Look at what is going on in Ukraine. They are in a tremendously difficult situation because they are dependent on Russia for their energy, for their natural gas, at a time when Vladimir Putin is undertaking very aggressive action in Europe. He is invading Ukraine. He has taken Crimea. He continues his aggressive efforts. And at the same time the European Union is trying to support Ukraine, Ukraine is fighting with Russia. This is a situation where Ukraine is depending upon Russia for its energy. Does America really want to be in that kind of a situation in the future when we have real problems in the Middle East, when we have real problems with fundamentalists, Islamic jihadists conducting terror on our people and other freedom-loving people around the world? Do we want to be in a situation where we continue to depend upon the Middle East for our oil? Well, the answer to that is no. The American people resoundingly answer that question--no. [[Page S145]] Also, the American people well know that the reason gas prices at the pump today are lower is not because OPEC just decided to give us a Christmas present. They know the reason energy prices are low in this country, that when they pull up to the pump they are saving money, is because we are producing so much more energy in this country and we are getting more energy from Canada. Unless OPEC cuts back their production, more supply drives prices down. So it is not only about low prices now, it is about making sure we are able to control our energy destiny in the future. We have to take a long-term view. It is working. Of the 18 million barrels of oil a day this country consumes, we now produce 11 million barrels in this country. We are up to 11 million barrels that we produce in this country of the total we consume, so we are still importing about 7 million barrels a day. Canada is now up to 3 million of those 7 million barrels, so we are down to only importing about 4 million barrels a day, but if we keep working at this, we can continue to produce more in this country. Canada's production is continuing to grow. And if we build the infrastructure, we can make sure that we control that energy--North American energy security. That means not only now do our consumers and small businesses and our whole Nation benefit from lower energy prices, lower gas prices at the pump, but we have that ability to make sure we control our destiny and that we benefit in the future. Let's not repeat the mistakes of the past where we return to this dependency on OPEC down the road because we haven't built the infrastructure, we haven't worked with Canada, and we haven't brought our domestic industry to North America so that we truly are energy secure. If we don't build the necessary infrastructure, if we block the necessary infrastructure, we can't build that energy plan for the future. I have heard my counterparts, some of the critics, say: Well, it is not up to us to issue a building permit for infrastructure. Really? So you mean it is the President's job and it is Congress's job to block critical energy that will get us to energy security? Our job is to block it? Our job is to prevent the very infrastructure we need to build energy security for this country, to block the private investment, the $8 billion that private companies want to spend to build this infrastructure, to create jobs, to produce more energy in North America, and to help make this country's energy security? The President's job and this body's job is to block the ability of our country and Canada to build this necessary infrastructure? Well, I don't think so. If you want to put it in terms of: Oh, well, we are not supposed to issue a building permit--really? So our job is to prevent the building of critical infrastructure even when it does not cost one single penny--not one penny--of government money? This is almost $8 billion of private investment that will generate hundreds of millions of dollars of revenue--State, local, and Federal. Every State on the route has approved it. There is an idea somehow we are jumping the gun after 6 years? Let's see, it has been in process for 6 years. Every State on the route has approved it. We are not spending any Federal money. We are saying our job as a Congress and the President is to block that kind of investment, block that kind of job creation, block that kind of energy development, and block our ability to get to energy security for this country. Then there is this argument: Oh, well, it is TransCanada. It is one company. It is only one company, so it really doesn't matter. Really? Well, if you were a company--a Canadian company or a U.S. company--and you were about to build infrastructure so that we could continue to produce more energy in this country, would you do it? If, in spite of the process that the Federal Government has to approve this project, where all of the requirements have been met--not once, but over and over again--and Congress and the President continue to block your ability to build that infrastructure, are you going to jump up and spend billions of dollars and do it? I doubt it. And isn't that really what this is all about? That is what it is about, isn't it? It is for the folks, for the extreme environmental groups that don't want the development of fossil fuels--they are going to block it. This is sending the message and making sure they shut her down here. That has to be music to OPEC's ears. I have to believe that OPEC is going: Boy, that is great; they are not going to build the infrastructure in their country to produce the energy. That is going to keep OPEC in business. There is another country that I think will be very pleased, really excited, if this project gets blocked, and that is China. China is so anxious to get this oil, they are trying to buy that production in Canada. Because, make no mistake, if the energy doesn't come to the United States, it is going somewhere else, and it is most likely going to China. So when we get back in that situation down the road when oil prices move back up, energy demand goes back up, and we have prevented our industry from growing--and Canada is sending all the oil to China, and we have to go back hat in hand to OPEC, Venezuela, and all of these countries, remember---- The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired. Mr. HOEVEN. I ask unanimous consent to continue for 5 minutes. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Ms. CANTWELL. Reserving the right to object. Is the vote scheduled for 4 minutes from now? The PRESIDING OFFICER. Yes, the vote is scheduled for 5:30 p.m. Ms. CANTWELL. I am happy if the Senator speaks until the time of the vote, but I think we should keep to the vote schedule. Mr. HOEVEN. What time is the vote scheduled? The PRESIDING OFFICER. The vote is scheduled at 5:30 p.m. That would leave the Senator 2 minutes. Mr. HOEVEN. I note the presence of the chairman of the Energy Committee. I defer to her for some time if she wishes to speak before the vote. That would be my question, whether we could get maybe a couple of minutes for that purpose. I can certainly wrap up in a couple of minutes. Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I defer to my colleague, the sponsor of this legislation, Senator Hoeven from North Dakota, to conclude his remarks within the remaining time so that we can begin our vote at 5:30 p.m. We appreciate his leadership on this bill. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 1 minute remaining. Mr. HOEVEN. I will wrap up on this note. Let's not get back into the same predicament we have gotten ourselves into before. Let's build this vital energy infrastructure so we can develop energy security for our country, together with Canada. The other point I want to make is on the environmental point: No significant environmental impact. That is the finding of the Obama administration's environmental impact statement done by the State Department. That is their own report: No significant environmental impact. I look forward to having more discussion on the environmental aspects as well. I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of this legislation. Cloture Motion The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time having expired, pursuant to rule XXII, the Chair lays before the Senate the pending cloture motion, which the clerk will state. The assistant legislative clerk read as follows: Cloture Motion We, the undersigned Senators, in accordance with the provisions of rule XXII of the Standing Rules of the Senate, do hereby move to bring to a close debate on the pending motion to proceed to S. 1, a bill to approve the Keystone XL Pipeline.

Under the previous order, the Senate will resume consideration of the motion to proceed to S. 1, which the clerk will report. The bill clerk read as follows: Motion to proceed to Calendar No. 1, S. 1, a bill to approve the Keystone XL Pipeline. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the time until 5:30 p.m. will be equally divided and controlled in the usual form. The Senator from Maine. Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be permitted to proceed for up to 15 minutes as in morning business. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Ms. COLLINS. Thank you, Mr. President. I further request that the time not be charged to either side on the debate on the Keystone pipeline, if that is necessary. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, reserving the right to object--I am sorry, I was discussing with the staff. If the Senator will please repeat her request. Ms. COLLINS. I asked unanimous consent to proceed for up to 15 minutes as in morning business, and since my remarks do not pertain to the debate for the Keystone Pipeline, that the time not be charged to either side in that debate. Mr. DURBIN. I have no objection. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Priorities of Senate Special Committee on Aging Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, it has been my privilege to serve on the Senate Special Committee on Aging since my very first days in the Senate, and I am honored to have been elected to chair this committee for the 114th Congress. I wish to welcome the Presiding Officer, Senator Cotton of Arkansas, to the committee. He will be a new member on our committee, and I believe he will enjoy his service as much as I have. My service on the aging committee is particularly appropriate since Maine is the oldest State in the Nation by median age. Many people would guess that Florida would have that distinction, but, in fact, it is the great State of Maine. Throughout its history, the aging committee has spurred Congress to action on issues that are important to older Americans through its hearings, its investigations, and its reports. This is the first time a Maine Senator has chaired the committee since the 1990s, when my predecessor, mentor, and friend, Senator Bill Cohen, served as chairman. I wish to share with my colleagues today my priorities for the committee as we begin this new Congress. I have three major priorities for the committee's work: first, retirement security; second, investments in biomedical research targeting diseases that disproportionately affect older Americans, such as Alzheimer's and diabetes; and, third, protecting seniors against financial exploitation and scams. I am increasingly concerned that our seniors will not have adequate savings and other financial resources during their retirement years. The committee will, therefore, focus on retirement security and, in particular, on the need to encourage more savings and better financial planning. According to the nonpartisan Center for Retirement Research at Boston College, there currently is an estimated $6.6 trillion gap between the savings Americans have today and what they should have in order to maintain their standard of living during retirement. Nationally, one in four Americans has no source of income beyond Social Security. In the State of Maine, the number is one in three. Social Security provides an absolutely vital safety net. However, with an average benefit of just $16,000 a year, it certainly is not enough to finance a comfortable retirement for many Americans. According to a Gallup survey published in 2012, more than half of all Americans are worried they will not be able to maintain their standard of living in retirement. That is up sharply from 34 percent two decades ago, and the Boston College analysis demonstrates that their concern is warranted. There are many reasons for the decline in retirement security facing American seniors, including the demise of many defined benefit pension plans in the private sector; the severity of the recent financial crisis, which wiped out much of the net worth of many [[Page S137]] seniors, at least temporarily; rising health care costs; the need for long-term care; and, most of all, the simple fact that Americans are living far longer than we used to. Many Americans reaching retirement age also have more debt than retirees of previous generations. I remember when my parents paid off the mortgage on their home and had a mortgage-burning party. Well, today, people who are the age my parents were when they paid off their house are taking on new debt and new mortgages. We found in the aging committee that there are seniors who are still paying off their student loans or the student loans of their children. These are all issues I look forward to the committee exploring in depth in this new Congress. Another priority will be highlighting the importance of biomedical research on diseases such as Alzheimer's and diabetes, which take such a devastating toll on older Americans and their families. Investments in biomedical research not only improve the health and longevity of Americans but also provide benefits to our economy and to the Federal budget. For example, nearly one out of three Medicare dollars is spent treating people living with diabetes. According to multiple economic analyses, there is roughly a 2-to-1 return on investment in Federal support for biomedical research. This investment at the National Institutes of Health and at research centers across the country spur job creation and are critical to America's competitiveness in the global research environment. As the Senate cochair of the Congressional Task Force on Alzheimer's Disease, I am particularly committed to helping to spur breakthroughs in Alzheimer's disease, which has had such a devastating impact on 5.2 million Americans and their families. In addition to the suffering it causes, Alzheimer's costs the United States an astonishing $214 billion a year. That includes $150 billion in costs to the Medicare and Medicaid programs. These costs will only skyrocket as the baby boom generation ages. Fortunately, there is promising research that holds hope for Alzheimer's patients and their families. The research community is poised to make important advances through clinical trials and investigating new therapeutic targets. But adequate funding is critical to advance this research and to achieve these breakthroughs. At a time when the United States is spending more than $200 billion a year for Alzheimer's patients, we are spending less than three-tenths of 1 percent of that amount--about $600 million a year--on research. Surely, we can do more for Alzheimer's, given its tremendous human and economic price. The National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease has as its primary goal the prevention and effective treatment of Alzheimer's by the year 2025. To meet that goal, the chairman of the Federal Alzheimer's Advisory Council says that we need to devote $2 billion a year to Alzheimer's research. Well, think about that. That is only 1 percent-- in fact, it is less than 1 percent--of what we as a society are spending to care for people with Alzheimer's. That investment will lead to better treatments and ultimately to a means of prevention or even a cure for this awful and expensive disease. The aging committee will also continue its focus on scams that target our seniors, such as the Jamaican lottery phone scam we exposed in the last Congress. This nefarious scheme, which is estimated to have cost Americans as much as $300 million a year, particularly targeted seniors in the Northeast. Some seniors in my State lost tens of thousands of dollars to the scam which involved a con artist calling a victim to tell him or her that they had won the Jamaican lottery but needed to pay fees to process the winnings. I don't need to tell my colleagues that these seniors had won nothing of the sort. But this was a very sophisticated scheme. In addition to educating seniors to help them avoid becoming victims of such scams, the hearing resulted in the Jamaican Government passing new laws targeting the scammers and prompted Federal law enforcement to make several arrests. The aging committee will also continue its fraud hotline to help protect seniors from these kinds of scams and financial exploitation, and the phone number for that fraud hotline, which is toll-free, is 1-855-303-9470. In addition to these three major priorities, it is my hope our committee in the second year will also take a close look--really scrutinize--Federal programs designed to help our seniors, such as those authorized by the Older Americans Act. We want to make sure these programs are as effective and efficient as possible and that their benefits reach those seniors as intended. So we will be performing that oversight function and sharing our findings with the committee of jurisdiction--the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee--on which I am also privileged to serve. The Senate Special Committee on Aging has a long history and tradition of bipartisanship, and my work on this committee during the past Congress was particularly rewarding because of the strong partnership I forged with the committee chairman, the senior Senator from Florida, Bill Nelson. I look forward to continuing that bipartisan tradition with my good friend and close colleague, Senator Claire McCaskill of Missouri, who will be serving as the committee's ranking member in the 114th Congress. Finally, I encourage the Presiding Officer and all of the other members of the committee not only to be active participants in the committee but also to share with us their thoughts on issues that we should pursue. Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor, and seeing no one seeking recognition, I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. SCHATZ. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Ernst). Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. SCHATZ. Madam President, I rise today in opposition to S. 1, which will circumvent the administration's official review process for projects crossing international borders and approve construction of the Keystone XL Pipeline, a pipeline dedicated to increasing production of some of the dirtiest, most polluting, and most dangerous crude oil in the world. Supporters of this pipeline in Congress have been relentless. Over the last 2 Congresses they have held 44 votes in the House and Senate intended to approve Keystone. On Tuesday, the very first bill the new Republican majority introduced, traditionally reserved for a party's highest legislative priority, was Keystone. Think about this. Here we stand in what people still call the world's greatest deliberative body, and the first bill we are taking up is not infrastructure generally, not national energy policy, not even national laws as they relate to our pipeline infrastructure. No, we are legislating about a specific pipeline which will move oil from Canada through the United States to be primarily exported from our southern border. I understand there are people of good will and good faith, including the Presiding Officer, who are on both sides of this issue. But it is hard to imagine why this should be the first piece of legislation we take up in this Congress. We have yet to seriously consider or to clarify our policy with respect to the Islamic State. Income inequality is gutting the middle class. Our national infrastructure needs a jolt of investment. Our immigration policy is a failure and a mess. I do not understand why this would be S. 1. Supporters of this bill have stood up three main arguments in favor of Keystone and expanding drilling of tar sands oil reserves in Canada. One, they say it will increase energy security; two, they think it will lower oil and gas prices; third, they say it is a jobs bill. Let's examine these claims, because however tenuous they were, they have been undermined further by facts over the last couple of years. First, the United States has never during the modern age of global energy trade been more energy secure. We import far less oil from unstable regimes and unfriendly countries than we have in decades. We are continuing to build massive amounts of ever cheaper homegrown clean energy such as wind [[Page S138]] and solar, even as we use our energy more efficiently. The United States will add nearly 10 gigawatts of wind and solar capacity in the next year. Not including hydro, the United States has over 85,000 megawatts of renewable energy capacity and continues to build on that number year over year. The prices for solar have dropped 80 percent since 2008 and prices for wind power, which are already competitive with fossil fuels, have dropped 30 percent since 2008. These trends are creating jobs right here at home. For example, the wind industry has over 500 manufacturing facilities across 44 States that are responsible for making wind turbines with over 66 percent domestic content. Second, the recent collapse of crude oil and gasoline prices demonstrates two things. In my home State of Hawaii, energy prices remain far too high. But on the mainland, oil and gas prices are currently very low. The idea that Keystone would make a significant difference was never based in reality, but now it is just obvious. We have low prices and the project has not even started. Gasoline is now $2.21 a gallon. Crude oil prices have slipped below $50 a barrel. The last time gasoline prices were this low was in the aftermath of the financial crisis. As a practical matter, it is not clear to me, and it is certainly not clear to most energy experts, how moving oil from Canada through the United States and exporting refined crude from the Gulf of Mexico would significantly reduce energy prices for us in the United States. Finally, this is called a jobs bill by some. This is many things. It is anti-clean air; it is anti-clean water; it is anti-public health. It is a regulatory earmark. But it is not a jobs bill. It is not deserving of being the No. 1 priority of the 114th Congress. We have heard estimates ranging as high as 42,000 indirect or induced jobs during the construction phase. We know, and everyone seems to agree, that Keystone will employ approximately 35 full-time employees when construction is finished. That is not 3,500 employees. That is not 35,000 employees. That is the 35 full-time employees when construction is completed. If we want to do a real jobs bill worthy of the Senate, we should do a real jobs bill. An infrastructure bank, a highway bill, Shaheen- Portman--all would create orders of magnitude more jobs than this. The American economy added 353,000 jobs in November alone, which made 2014 the strongest year for job growth since 1999. If we pass a highway bill, we get millions of jobs. If we pass an infrastructure bank, we will get hundreds of thousands of jobs. If we pass the bipartisan Shaheen-Portman energy efficiency bill, we will also get hundreds of thousands of jobs. Look, even one new job is a good thing. But if we want to do a jobs bill, let's do a jobs bill. There is plenty of room for us to work together on infrastructure, on energy efficiency, and create hundreds of thousands and even millions of jobs. But this is an energy bill. It moves us in the wrong direction. There are colleagues, with whom I agree, who are arguing against this legislation primarily saying they want to allow the administration's process to play out and that we should not supersede the State Department review. I agree. It is fair to say this is unprecedented, even a little strange, for the Congress to legislate the specifics of a particular infrastructure project. But I want to be clear. This is not a process argument for me. I oppose Keystone because it is a bad idea. Whether it is done through the regular order or in an expedited fashion, whether it is done through the administrative process or the legislative process, I oppose any action, whether through legislation, litigation, or administrative action, that will enable the extraction of Canadian tar sands oil. My reasons are very simple--climate change and math. Climate change, because it is the greatest and most urgent challenge to the health of our families, to the economy, and to our way of life. I want to preserve the American way of life, not endanger it. Math, because we have crunched the numbers and we know we simply cannot afford to burn the oil from tar sands and put its pollution into the air. It is simple. We have a budget. Just as every family in this country must stick to its budget and live within its means, we have to do the same as a planet when it comes to carbon pollution. A new study published last week in the scientific journal Nature makes this clear. The authors asked the question: If we want to stay within our carbon budget and limit warming to 2 degrees Celsius, which is the limit 167 countries agree we must meet to avoid catastrophic effects of climate change, how much more coal, gas, and oil can we burn? The study finds that in order to meet this goal, the majority of the world's known reserves of fossil fuel must stay in the ground between now and 2050. This includes one-third of the world's current oil reserves and 80 percent of current coal reserves. It also finds, and this is critical, that: Any increase in unconventional oil production-- Which includes Canadian tar sands. --is incommensurate with efforts to limit average global warming to 2 degrees Celsius. As we learn more about climate change amidst a clean energy revolution, we find that moving toward clean energy, taking control of our future, is good for business. Our economy will do better. It will grow faster and it will be more resilient if we embrace the technologies and solutions at our fingertips and end our reliance on fossil fuel. We have a chance to embrace the future here. Our future is not tar sands oil. Our future is wind and solar and geothermal and energy efficiency. Our future is not in adding carbon pollution. Our future is in innovating our way out of this problem. Throughout our history, America always leads when we are needed the most. That is what we have to do, not in the direction of more carbon pollution but toward a clean energy economy. A report by New Climate Economy, a group chaired by former Mexican President Felipe Calderon, and including Bank of America chairman Chad Holliday, among others, marshals quantitative evidence to show that action on climate change is a requirement for future global economic growth. In other words, those who warn about the EPA regulation or prices on carbon killing jobs have it exactly backward. The truth is that in order to avoid major disruptions to our economy, we have to reduce carbon pollution and work with other countries such as Canada to ensure that they do the same. I am looking forward to the open amendment process on this bill that the majority leader has promised. It will be an opportunity for the American public to see where Members of the Senate stand on the facts of climate change. Anyone who looks at the facts and does the math ought to oppose this bill and oppose construction of the Keystone XL Pipeline. For me and for many Americans, a vote against this bill is a vote to preserve and protect the air we breathe and the water we drink. It is a vote to ensure that we continue to reduce carbon pollution and fight climate change. It is a vote to leave our children a healthy world. I urge my colleagues to oppose cloture on the motion to proceed. I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Entry-Exit Visa System Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, the attacks on the people of France demonstrate in the most chilling terms the threats posed to Western nations by those who are imbued with Islamic terrorism. While there are many factors that play into the spread of this jihadist ideology in the West, it is time for an honest and plain admission that our open immigration policies are ineffective and have failed to meet the minimum standards that are set by existing law in the United States. This is something I have been dealing with for quite a number of years--a decade really. We have laws that would improve dramatically our ability to identify and block terrorists from entering and staying in the country, but they are not funded and they are not [[Page S139]] carried out and it is unacceptable, as I will point out. Dozens of terrorists and terror plotters have been admitted to the United States on visas or are relying on broader networks to simply enter into our country, taking advantage of lax immigration policies. For instance, the 9/11 attackers all came here on visas. A visa is a document that allows an individual to come for a limited period of time and then return to their home country. This visa system is essential in a modern world, but it needs to be managed and carried out in an effective way. The Boston bombers came as asylees, people seeking asylum, while their mosque was linked to foreign nationals tied to ISIS and foreign terrorists. The individual behind the attempted Christmas bombing in Oregon was a refugee. We have a class of individuals we accept each year who claim to be refugees from foreign countries. This one was from Somalia. The recently foiled plot to bomb a courthouse and school in Connecticut was attempted by a Moroccan national who had a revoked student visa. Many individuals have visas to be students in the United States. We are not managing that well at all. This one had a revoked student visa. It was revoked because of information that came to the attention of officials, but no one made an effort or successfully attempted in any real way to find the individual so he might be deported. Al Qaeda operatives who were apprehended in Kentucky were on visas from Iraq. These are only some of the examples that are out there. These individuals use lax visa policies, flawed asylum policies, flawed refugee policies, and flawed border protection policies. In addition, we are not organized in a way that works effectively. In addition to that, the President of the United States has directed his ICE officers, his Citizenship and Immigration Services officers, and his Border Patrol officers, who are the key individuals in this system, to conduct their business in a way that guarantees failure. That is just the fact. The 9/11 Commission--we all remember that great Commission after the terrible attack on 9/11--zeroed in on our lax immigration policies. Among other things, the Commission demanded implementation of a biometric entry-exit visa system. What does that mean? That means a biometric system where people are identified effectively through fingerprints or some other identifier. I have been through this for years. Back when President Bush was President and we worked with Homeland Security, Governor Ridge was the Secretary of Homeland Security. I think at the end he was finally convinced, and I worked on him very hard. But he volunteered, the last day in office, to use a fingerprint biometric system. It should have already been done by the time President Bush left office, but it wasn't, and it hasn't been done yet. We need a system that works. By the way, police officers have in their cars all over America computer-type screens where they can stop someone on the road, they can ask them to put their hand on the screen, and it reads their fingerprints. It checks the National Crime Information Center to find out whether the person is wanted for murder in New York. He might have caught him in Texas. It lets the officer know whether there are warrants out for these individuals. This is the way the system works in our country, and we need to use it with regard to people who come here on visas. It is an outrage that this hasn't been done, completed fully, and made operational years ago. It is an outrage. It is in the law of the United States. Congress has funded money for this project and it has not yet been done. It will cost us in the future, as the 9/11 Commission has so warned. The 9/11 Commission demanded this system, and it is designed to track those entering and departing the United States on visas. By the way, almost half of the people, at least 40-plus percent now of individuals unlawfully in America entered on a visa. In other words, they didn't come across the border unlawfully. They came lawfully-- perhaps using false documents, but they got a visa. They came to the United States maybe lawfully, but they just did not return to their home country when the visa expired. My colleagues have to know no one is checking. We have no idea whether they left the country or stayed in the country. We do not have an operable exit visa system. This is so bizarre because it is not expensive. It can be implemented rapidly. It will work and give us valuable information that we must have if we are serious about this process, and we must be serious about the process. The individuals in France--I mentioned the ones in the United States--left the country, went through Yemen, apparently, were trained in some sort of terrorist camp, and came back and executed their violent acts in France. So we have to do a better job of this, and we can do it. President Obama's administration has refused to implement the entry- exit system as required by law. We have talked about this publicly and debated it for years. Just last year the co-chairs of the 9/11 Commission, in an evaluation of how well the recommendations they made back after 9/11 have been carried out--a 10-year review of how their report had been received and how much of it had been accomplished-- issued this written statement. Without exit-tracking, our government does not know when a foreign visitor admitted to the United States on a temporary basis has overstayed his or her admission. Here is the language. We put it on a chart because it is important that we understand this. Without exit-tracking, our government does not know when a foreign visitor admitted to the United States on a temporary basis has overstayed his or her admission. Had this system been in place before 9/11, we would have had a better chance of detecting the plotters before they struck. . . . There is no excuse for the fact that 13 years after 9/11 we do not have this much capability in place. Amen. That is exactly correct. That is from ``Reflections on the Tenth Anniversary of the 9/11 Commission Report,'' Thomas H. Kean and Lee H. Hamilton, in 2014. In fact, the original report said this: The Department of Homeland Security, properly supported by the Congress, should complete, as quickly as possible, a biometric entry-exit screening system. That was the report from 2004. It is a very important report. They went to great length to help this Nation figure out what is the responsible thing to do to protect ourselves better from those attackers on 9/11, many of whom were visa overstayers. They didn't come across the border unlawfully; they came across on a lawful visa. Some of them I think had false documentation to get that visa, but they came on a visa, for the most part lawfully, and did not go home as they were required to go home. They overstayed their visa. Nobody knew they had overstayed. Nobody made an inquiry about it. The ``Tenth Anniversary Report Card: The Status of the 9/11 Commission Recommendations,'' by Thomas H. Kean and Lee H. Hamilton, 2011, said this: Full deployment of the biometric exit component of US-VISIT should be a high priority. Such a capability would have assisted law enforcement and intelligence officials in August and September 2001 in conducting a search for two of the 9/11 hijackers that were in the U.S. on expired visas. This would have helped. Indeed, of course, those of us who have some experience in law enforcement know that when you get to one or two of the guys, the whole scheme may get disrupted, and we can penetrate the organization and break it up and stop crime from occurring. To me, it is mind boggling, as the commission leaders have told us, that we haven't completed this. I am told there are forces that don't like the exit visa system. They think it might slow things down a little bit. First, this is not correct. When you come into the country, you are clocked in and you are biometrically fingerprinted. What would you have to do when you leave? Go to the airport, go in a certain line, go through, show your ticket, show your passport, put your hand on a biometric screener, you are read, and you are approved to leave. It is not going to take any massive amounts of time. One excuse after the other has slowed this down, and it is not acceptable. We have to do better. In fact, the administration has suspended enforcement of the visa system almost entirely. We have to understand, colleagues: If we don't have even an exit visa system where we know [[Page S140]] who left the country, how do we know who overstayed and who stayed in the country? Unless somebody overstays their visa and they are caught for speeding and the police officer identified that, I will ask colleagues, what happens? Under the policy of this President of the United States, directed to the lowest officers in America, nothing happens. If the individual does not commit a serious felony, they will not be processed for deportation, even though they have come to the country on a promise to leave on a certain date and flatly refused to do so. This is not acceptable. If we don't have a system that has integrity, then everybody gets the message pretty soon: Just get a visa, come to America, you never have to leave. If you don't get a felony charge against you, you are never going to be deported. This is the policy of this government at this very moment. It is hard for anybody to believe, but that is the truth. We have approximately 5 million visa overstays in the United States. But as the National ICE-- Immigration Customs Enforcement--officers Council president Chris Crane has explained: ICE agents are now prohibited from arresting illegal aliens solely on charges of illegal entry or visa overstay. What a dramatic statement that is. And not only visa overstays, they are prohibited from arresting and removing people who came across the border illegally. That is what he means by illegal entry or visa overstays. This of course removes a cornerstone of integrity in any law system. If we can't look people in the eye and say: We give you a visa, you have a 6-month visa, but at 6 months you have to return to your home country, and mean it, and say: Eventually you will be apprehended and deported if you don't--then the system has no integrity. That is where we are today. Unsurprisingly, ABC News reported that the Obama administration had lost track of 6,000 foreign students who had overstayed their visas and were of ``heightened concern.'' In other words, these 6,000 had some special concern in their background that made us worry about them, whether it was drugs or terrorism or whatever. Of course they have lost sight of them. They are not attempting to find them. So the head of the union representing U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services officers, one of the three major components of the Department of Homeland Security dealing with immigration, Mr. Ken Palinkas, was explicit in his warning to us. It is remarkable what Mr. Crane has said and now what Mr. Palinkas has said: There is no doubt that there are already many individuals in the United States, on visas--expired or active--who are being targeted for radicalization or who already subscribe to radicalized views. Many millions come legally to the U.S. through our wide open immigration policy every year--whether as temporary visitors, lifetime immigrants, refugees, asylum- seekers, foreign students, or recipients of our ``visa waiver program'' which allows people to come and go freely. Yet our government cannot effectively track these foreign visitors and immigrants. This is the man whose officers do this job. They are the ones who approve the visas and manage this system. He went on to warn that the President's so-called Executive amnesty would make the situation radically worse, saying: I write today to warn the general public that this situation is about to get exponentially worse--and more dangerous. . . . Express your concern to your Senators and Congressmen before it is too late. It is a national security imperative to stop this Executive amnesty. It sends exactly the wrong message. What it says is that if you can get into America--through the border, by boat, by plane, on a visa--any way you get into this country and pass the border, you are not going to be asked to leave unless you commit some felony--some serious felony, for that matter. Many felonies don't qualify. And we have over 100,000 people who have committed serious felonies who have been released into America. We don't know where they are, and they are not going to be deported. We have to restore immigration enforcement, establish better controls and screening on immigration from high-risk regions of the world. We really should give more attention to that. It is perfectly legitimate. The visa system, the immigration system of the United States, should serve who? It should serve the interests of the American people. Somebody doesn't have a constitutional right to come to America. The decision is whether America feels like it is in its interests. We have always accepted a large number of people. In fact, we have the largest immigration numbers of any nation in the world. We admit 1 million a year lawfully. When they come from high-risk areas of the world, terrorist states, we should indeed give more scrutiny to those applicants. Census data shows that legal immigration to the United States from the Middle East is one of the largest and fastest growing categories of new admittances. For the national security of the United States, it is imperative that Congress block Executive amnesty and restore essential enforcement, basic bread-and-butter law enforcement. Anyone who claims to be concerned about our national security should be resolutely focused on this task. There is so much that can be done with relatively little difficulty if we have the leadership and will to get it done. It would be unthinkable for the President to veto the Homeland Security appropriations bill in order to continue this illegal and dangerous amnesty scheme during a time of growing threats abroad. Again, let me say that this: the entry-exit visa system is an unappreciated, important part of American immigration law. It is critical to the national security of the United States, as the 9/11 Commission has so stated on more than one occasion. We can do this. Why is it not being done? What forces, what special interests, are interceding between the people of the United States, the national interests, and their special interests that block this kind of system? We can make it work. It is not that hard. We need a biometric system, and that system should be founded on the fingerprint. It took us a number of years, but I think the government has finally concluded it must be the fingerprint for a lot of reasons, one of which is if somebody got a visa to the United States and they committed a murder, an armed robbery, a terrorist act, a major fraud, and a warrant was issued for their arrest--if you don't clock it in at the airport, who knows when they are leaving? So this would pick it up and would pick up any warrants that might be outstanding for those individuals anywhere in the United States that are put in the NCIC, National Crime Information Center. That is the way the system should work. It is long overdue. In the course of the discussions we will have in the weeks and months to come about the necessity of fixing a broken immigration system, the entry- exit visa system has to be implemented. It is long overdue. We can make it happen. It is not that expensive. It is relatively inexpensive, actually, and it will make us much safer in the process.

Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. COATS. Madam President, here we are at the beginning of a new year and a new Congress, and I think we all feel a responsibility to do what the American people voted for in the November 2014 election, which is to come together in this body and in this Congress and work together to find sensible solutions to the very real problems facing Americans. [[Page S141]] It is no secret that the last 6 years have been pretty tough for a lot of people who are out of work or doing part-time work; kids graduating from high school, graduating from college, graduating from community schools, 2-year schools; going back and getting new training and still unable to find meaningful jobs; finding jobs that are part time, two or three of those together; parents trying to save money, pay the mortgage, save money to send the kids to postgraduate school. It has not been easy. So we have come to a point where we have legislation in a new session of Congress, with commitments on a bipartisan basis to stand together, to work together, to try to find solutions, to get people back to work and get our economy moving again. Now we come to the very first issue up for discussion and debate and hopefully passage in this new Congress--the Keystone Pipeline. This is an issue that has been going on for 6 years. The President has been obstinate in his obstruction in letting this go forward, in making a decision. Yet here we are, finally, with an opportunity to not only pass legislation which has passed the House of Representatives, again, just last week with very significant bipartisan support--but now in the Senate to take up this legislation and to move it forward tonight with this vote, to start the process to allow amendments, to allow debate, and to move forward and hopefully enjoy bipartisan support with over 60 votes and then move it to final passage and then send it to the President for, hopefully, signing. This project is the largest, ready-to-build infrastructure project in the United States. It supports tens of thousands of jobs. The estimate has been well over 42,000. It invests billions of dollars in the American economy. It increases revenue to States and local governments, all without spending one dime of taxpayer money. This is a private sector initiative that can be of great benefit to our country. It can provide meaningful jobs and has many benefits for us in the future. It is supported by Democrats, by Republicans, and by a number of labor unions. For instance, the Indiana State Building and Construction Trade Council, which represents 75,000 working Hoosiers in my State, reached out to me recently and asked me to support construction of the Keystone Pipeline, calling it ``an important job creation and energy security issue.'' They are right on the mark. They know I have been a longtime supporter of this effort, but they wanted to put it in writing. I am not sure it was necessary, and they weren't weighing this on the basis of Republican or Democrat, liberal or conservative; they were saying that this is good for us and we hope all of our Senators can support it. We hope it passes. This is an initiative that puts our people to work. Other labor unions, including the North America's Building Trade Unions and the Laborers' International Union of North America support this project. I mentioned the President, for 6 years, has come up with more feeble excuses in terms of why he believes this should not go forward. The last excuse was: We are in a process here and the process has to go forward. That process was waiting, apparently, on the Nebraska Supreme Court approval of the pipeline route through Nebraska, and that was his excuse for why he would have to veto it. I am sure my colleagues now have the word that the Nebraska Supreme Court has upheld State approval of the Keystone Pipeline. In fact, the President's own State Department, in response to numerous calls for environmental studies-- all of which were used as an excuse for not going forward--the President's own State Department has repeatedly approved this, saying it will not have a negative environmental imprint. So what could possibly be the reason the President remains intransigent on this particular issue, because every other box has been checked? We have to come down to the inevitable conclusion that it is all political, that an extreme environmental wing of the President's own party is simply putting untold pressure on him to not go forward with anything having to do with fossil fuels or providing energy security for America from our own resources. After all, a significant portion comes from Montana and North Dakota--and the last time I checked they are in the United States--and from our friendly neighbor to the north, Canada. If this doesn't go through, we will keep importing large quantities of oil from the Middle East. We know what complications there are in terms of securing that oil and how much volatility occurs there based on what is happening today in the Middle East. So getting this product from our Northern States of North Dakota and Montana and getting this product from our friend to the north, Canada, simply makes a great deal of sense in terms of our energy security, our energy supplies, and lessening our reliance on the volatility that comes from getting oil from other sources. To conclude, let me just make it clear what it is we are trying to do. This will help the United States diversify its energy supply. It will offset our dependence on Middle East oil. It will support tens of thousands of American jobs in construction. It will invest billions of dollars in the American economy. It will increase revenue to State and local governments. It will not harm our environment, as numerous studies have indicated--all these benefits without spending a dime of taxpayer money. So after 6 years of delay, procrastination, and evermore feeble excuses, it is time for the President to make a decision. Soon he will have an opportunity to use that pen he so famously talked about not to sign a veto or to declare a veto but to sign a bill approving the Keystone Pipeline into law. I strongly support construction of this pipeline and I urge my colleagues to do the same. I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Will the Senator withhold his request? Mr. COATS. I certainly will. I didn't see my colleague. I am happy to do so. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia. Mr. KAINE. Madam President, I am happy I was here for the comments of my colleague from Indiana on the Keystone Pipeline and, similar to the Senator from Indiana, I am also happy to finally have this debate. The comments he made are very sincere and passionately believed. I accept that. I only challenge one aspect of the comments, which is the suggestion that opposition of Keystone is feeble or only for political reasons. I am a pro-energy Senator. The first bill I introduced in the 114th Congress was a bill I am cosponsoring with Senator Barrasso of Wyoming to expedite American exports of liquid natural gas, but I am an opponent of Keystone on environmental and economic grounds, and I wish to spend a few minutes describing why. To begin with, it can probably be summed up in a question: Why embrace dirty energy when America is in the midst of a clean energy revolution? That is a primary reason I oppose Keystone. The United States, thank goodness, is on a clean energy roll. Not only are we on a clean energy roll, we are on an energy production roll that is helping our economy, helping our trade deficit, and hurting some of our most significant global adversaries, notably Russia and Iran. We have embraced over the last few years a set of conservation and efficiency investments, probably most notably the increased CAFE standards that have saved energy use in the vehicle sector as well as helped the American auto industry significantly rebound. Our natural gas revolution, of which I am a strong supporter, has enabled American industry and consumers to get lower priced energy, and it has enabled us to lessen our dependence on dirtier fuels in the production of electric power and other aspects of our power usage. Wind and solar and other noncarbon energy developments have rocketed ahead. Nearly one- third of the energy that has been added to the American electricity grid since 2005 has been in the wind and solar area. We are one of the few nations in the world that in the period from 2005 to 2012 actually saw a reduction in our carbon emissions. We are on a clean energy roll. We are innovating for the world and we are selling technologies to the rest of the world and that is good for our economy as well as good for the environment. We are also asserting American energy leadership not just in the advances in clean energy but also in the significant advances in American energy production. I think we should feel [[Page S142]] good about the fact that we are a country that has gone from being one of the greatest net importers of energy in the world to now a country that is going to be one of the greatest energy producers in the world, and in many energy areas we are now a net exporter. So emissions are going down. Production and exports are going up. The other thing that is great for Americans is that prices are going down. A barrel of oil right now is in the $50-a-barrel range, which is putting about $1,000 a year back into the pockets of an American family. It is helping American businesses, and it is imposing, as I mentioned earlier, some significant harm upon two of our most persistent global adversaries--Iran and Russia--that rely on energy exports to drive their economy. This energy revolution--higher production, greater economic efficiency, greater cleanliness--has all been happening without the Keystone Pipeline. It has all been happening without the United States embracing tar sands oil. We are going in the right direction now. I oppose the Keystone Pipeline because accelerating the use of tar sands oil turns us around. Instead of going in the right direction to more production, more national security and greater emissions control, the Keystone Pipeline accelerates tar sands oil and takes us in the wrong direction. Simply put, tar sands oil and the exploitation of that resource is a bad bet for the environment and, I believe, a bad bet for the economy. Last month, December 2014, a magazine I really like that normally has a lot of articles about the outdoors, Outside magazine, ran a lengthy article on the area of Canada in Alberta where tar sands are mined. The article is called ``The High Cost of Oil.'' To anyone who is interested in this debate--pro, con or undecided--go online to Outside magazine, December 2014, ``The High Cost of Oil,'' and read what the mining of tar sands oil does to this part of Canada and to this planet. Tar sands oil is not like conventional gas or petroleum. Tar sands oil, the mining and refining and production of it, produces about 15 to 20 percent more greenhouse gas emissions per unit of energy than conventional petroleum. Natural gas produces dramatically less CO 2 than conventional petroleum, but tar sands oil produces dramatically more. If you care about the emissions of CO 2 -- and I think we should all care about the emissions of CO 2 because I accept the science that says CO 2 emissions cause significant climate effects--if you care about CO 2 emissions, then tar sands oil is absolutely the worst thing that can be done. Over the 2 years now that I have been in the Senate, I have had a lot of folks come to me and talk to me about Keystone. They never say a word about greenhouse gas or CO 2 emissions--not a word. Senator Coats didn't say a word in his comments about CO 2 or greenhouse gas emissions. I ask individuals, when they come and talk to me about Keystone: What do you think about CO 2 emissions? What do you think about the fact that tar sands oil is significantly more carbon dense than normal petroleum? The response I find myself getting is: I don't know; I am not a scientist. In fact, I heard that from an energy CEO who employs tons of scientists in his organizations: I don't know; I am not a scientist. The scientific consensus I believe is very clear. We have to do what we can--not drastically and dramatically but in an incremental way-- every day to bring down our CO 2 emissions. I believe we need to do that in smart ways. Yet, from an emissions standpoint, tar sands oil goes exactly in the wrong direction. It is not just CO 2 emissions. Tar sands oil also involves the mining of it. I would encourage you to read this article. It involves scraping up vast acreages of an arboreal forest in Alberta to get to the tar sands underneath. So far, an area about the size of the State of Rhode Island has been completely despoiled to look like a moonscape to get to tar sands, and this will significantly accelerate the more tar sands are built. In the area of Alberta where the mining and refining is taking place, there has been a dramatic increase in respiratory illness and other illnesses associated either with airborne emissions or with the contamination of the area's water supply. Probably one of the most powerful things about the article is not the lengthy analysis, not the words, it is the pictures. The pictures in that article are staggering. When you see what has to be done to these arboreal forests to mine tar sands oil, you come back to this question: Why would we embrace a dirtier technology when America is on a clean- energy revolution that is driving down prices, driving up production, and also driving down emissions. Tar sands oil takes us in the wrong direction. It is not so much about the pipeline. We rely on pipelines in this country, but it is about the acceleration of the development of a resource that, frankly, just doesn't need to be developed. I will conclude and say this. Some say--and I made this argument-- well, look, it is going to be mined anyway and refined anyway. If the pipeline doesn't go through the United States, it will go westward or eastward through Canada or another direction. I am not completely sure that is correct. The article in Outside discusses the fact that Canadians, who know this better than anybody because they live in the neighborhood, are fighting against pipelines being built in Canada. There is also the matter with oil now at a significantly lower price than it has been. Even the economics of this tar sands oil, which is pretty expensive because of what you have to do to refine it, may not make any sense. But even if we set those arguments aside and somebody says to me, why shouldn't the United States just give the big green light to tar sands oil because somebody is going to get it, the reason I think we shouldn't is the United States is showing the world right now what it means to be an energy leader. With increased production, lower emissions, lower prices through innovation--through American innovation--we are showing the world what it means to be an energy leader. We are a leader because we have embraced a simple effort. I am not an engineer, but as I look at what happened in innovation in the last decade, the ethic we have embraced is: Let's do it cleaner tomorrow than today. That is pretty simple. Let's do it cleaner tomorrow than today--not dramatically cleaner. It doesn't have to turn day and night from today to tomorrow. Let's just get a little bit cleaner tomorrow than today. That is what we have been doing as a Nation. It has been increasing supply. It has been driving down demand. It has been driving down prices. It has been helping us control emissions. That is what we should keep doing. I am a pro-energy Senator, but I am a deep skeptic about the use of tar sands oil. For that reason, I am glad we are going to have the debate. I think we should finally be at it. But I am going to oppose the Keystone Pipeline because tar sands oil is going backwards and not forwards. We are showing the world what it means to go forward, and that is the direction we should continue to go. I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll. Ms. CANTWELL. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coats). Without objection, it is so ordered Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, we are going to be voting shortly on the motion to proceed to S. 1, the Keystone XL Pipeline. I am here to urge my colleagues to vote no on that motion to proceed. We had a couple of chances to come to the Senate floor already today and last week and talk about the important issue of energy development in the United States and how we move our country forward with job creation and energy development. The President--we got to hear his remarks and certainly we respect people's points of view that this issue is an issue we have had a lot of time to discuss. Mr. President, the issue is whether the American public and people in affected States have had a lot of time to talk about this issue and whether they have had a transparent process to talk about this issue. I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record an article that [[Page S143]] was in USA TODAY whose headline is ``Permit problems plague Keystone XL pipeline's S.D. leg.'' There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows: [From USA Today, Jan. 7, 2015] Permit Problems Plague Keystone XL Pipeline's S.D. Leg (By John Hultjhult) The South Dakota Public Utilities Commission on Tuesday voted down a move by tribal and environmental groups to force a reboot to the Keystone XL pipeline's state-level permitting process. ( http://www .argusleader.com/story/news/2015/01/06/sd-permit-keystone-xl- still-question/21359367/ ) PUC commissioners said there are clear questions about whether South Dakota's stretch of the massive and controversial project is still due the construction permit it earned in 2010, given a series of changes to its original scope. The 2014 version of the pipeline would be able to carry crude from North Dakota, for example, along with the anticipated crude extracted from tar sands in Alberta, Canada. Even so, commissioners ruled that forcing pipeline owner TransCanada to start over without being offered a chance to explain how it could make those changes while meeting its old obligations would be a denial of due process. ``We need to go through the process to find out,'' Commissioner Chris Nelson said. TransCanada asked for re-certification of its 2010 construction permit in September. The company had to ask for re-certification because four years had passed since the permit was granted. The pipeline stalled as President Obama chose Tuesday to delay the issuance of a federal permit indefinitely, a move that has frustrated supporters, who say the project will add jobs and boost energy security. If completed, the Keystone XL pipeline would release more than 800,000 barrels of oil a day. The GOP-controlled Senate is expected to take up the issue this week. In a new application for the 313 miles of pipeline planned for South Dakota, the company notes 30 changes to the original project, including the addition of North Dakota oil, minor route changes, alterations to construction plans and costs. The Yankton Sioux Tribe filed a motion to dismiss the company's application based on those changes, saying the re- certification process is meant for projects that have been delayed, not those that have altered dramatically in scope. The permit was issued with a set of 50 conditions, which were based on the project as approved four years ago. Thomasina Real Bird, a lawyer for the Yankton Sioux Tribe, told commissioners that the changes to the pipeline are simply too significant to allow the company to apply for re- certification. The company isn't just asking to re-certify a stalled project, she said. ``They're going a step beyond, and that step is not allowed by law,'' Real Bird said. Several others spoke in support of the Yankton Sioux Tribe's motion to dismiss, including Kimberly Craven of the Indigenous Environmental Network. ``I would urge the commission to start over,'' Craven said. ``It's a new permit, a new ballgame.'' Bill Taylor, a lawyer for TransCanada, told commissioners that re-certification is meant to determine whether delayed projects still fall within the scope of an old permit. Dropping a re-certification request because a project changes renders the re-certification process pointless. Keystone XL has changed, but Taylor said the company is prepared to prove that it still meets each of the 50 conditions attached to its 2010 approval. The pipeline is still a pipeline, the product is the same, and the end result is more energy security for the U.S., Taylor said. ``The current iteration of the project can and will meeting the conditions upon which the permit is issued,'' Taylor said. The PUC voted 3-0 to deny the motions to dismiss the application brought by the Yankton Sioux Tribe and joined by others. The hearing on the merits of the re-certification is planned for May. Ms. CANTWELL. This is an article that just recently appeared in the paper about how South Dakota is bringing up objections to the pipeline, and they want to do due process with their public utility commission to make sure this project meets the criteria of environmental and safety concerns and security concerns that State wants to see met. The reason this is still an issue in South Dakota is because part of the pipeline will go through South Dakota. There have been many changes since the original proposal was put forth, and people in South Dakota want to know exactly what these changes are and exactly how they will go through the process. In fact, one Native American tribe representative who was objecting said: The company is not just asking to recertify its old project. They are going a step beyond that that is not allowed by law. So there are people who want them to go through the normal process because siting of a pipeline of this nature is of great concern to local residents, to property owners. I find it interesting that in the debate on this issue, we on this side of the aisle are the ones who are advocating and standing up for property owners to make sure there is not a taking of their property without a transparent process and input for that process because that is exactly what transpired here when the company, with the help of the State of Nebraska, did not continue to proceed through their public service commission, their public utility commission, and instead tried to pass a law saying that the environmental review and security issues and oversight could be done by the Governor. Now, my colleagues who are Governors know that when you are Governor, you do not have the most transparent process. It is not as if citizens are going to come to hearings in the Governor's office. It is not as though all of that is there for review. Certainly those citizens do not have the ability to object and make sure they are getting the right compensation for their property and make sure issues of safety and security are addressed. So that is why some private property owners sued. Because the legislature and the Governor did not have the right to act; the law taking the power away from the utility commission and giving it to the Governor was unconstitutional. The separation of powers is divided between the Governor and their public service commission. It is the job of those UTCs--utilities and transportation commissions around the country--to protect the interests of the public in the siting of these facilities. That this authority was now moved up through the legislature to the Governor to decide all of that was clearly something that was not constitutional. I find it very interesting that four of the seven supreme court justices said, in fact, yes, that law passed by the legislature was not constitutional. So my question is, What is the hurry? Now that this issue, based on standing and the other justices not deciding, has the process to move forward, Congress feels some sort of urgency to be a siting commission and site a pipeline that has, No. 1, failed to go through the public process in the State of Nebraska; No. 2, has a public process now being questioned in the State of South Dakota, raising concern and urgency that those issues of the public be addressed; and No. 3, goes over what the President of the United States has said he wants to follow as a due process and make sure all the issues are brought to the table. I will remind my colleagues that if everybody here had their way, the President would have approved the original Keystone XL pipeline route. Congress thought they should stick their hands in the middle of this siting and land use issue and put in legislative language on a passed bill by the Congress saying the President, if it was a national security interest, must decide and site the Keystone Pipeline. Thank God those at the State Department and the White House decided that was not such a smart idea because that current pipeline went through a major aquifer that served eight States and posed a great deal of concern to landowners, farmers, residents, and various individuals about that particular proposal. So if this body would have had its way before--those who support this pipeline--they would have pressured the President to approve what is now a defunct, horrible idea of what was proposed by TransCanada. So now I ask my colleagues, are you sure all of the issues have been addressed here at the local level? Because clearly there are people in Nebraska and people in South Dakota who do not think so. Last I checked, our job is not to site pipelines; our job is to move our country forward on an energy strategy that will produce jobs, diversify our resources, and make the United States a leader in energy. I know my colleagues feel as if we will get a chance to address a lot of issues if we do move forward in a debate, and I am sure there will be many on many sides. I question whether we shouldn't be spending our time focusing on a bipartisan energy bill with lots of support on a whole myriad of [[Page S144]] others issues we need to work on, as we did in 2007, to make sure we are helping in the transformation of energy policy moving forward that will produce a lot more jobs. This particular proposal, as many of my colleagues have pointed out, while there are some immediate construction jobs, the long-term jobs are very few compared to many of the other things we have been doing. I would also like to point out that since Keystone has undertaken more development in the United States, that part of that development in the United States has also come into question lately. The security of the welding on the pipeline that has been done in the southern part of that pipeline has come into question, even to the point where I think the State Department has said to the company: We are going to have a third-party validator approve whether you are actually meeting the standards we would like to see in the development of this pipeline in the United States. But there are many issues here about safety and security, as my colleagues can point out who have brought up these issues before. My colleague from Michigan suffered one of the most devastating oilspills in her area. That was a tar sands oilspill. My colleague from Michigan, Senator Stabenow, has actually flown over that oilspill and cited that it took 4 years and $1.2 billion to clean it up and that the tar sands sunk to the bottom of the river and the river had to be dredged. So this is something my colleagues may not quite understand, that the tar sands, even according to the Commandant of the Coast Guard--we do not really have a solution for its cleanup when it spills in water. That is why I want to make sure that tar sands pay into the oilspill liability trust fund, as any other oil source does, so that we can make sure we are planning for the future and for getting help and response for any of these oilspills that could occur in the future. But needless to say Michigan and the Kalamazoo spill taught our Nation how dangerous this oilspill process could be. So why are we prematurely trying to cut off the debate on this issue at the local government level and say that we in Congress know better than these utility and transportation commissions and their transparent siting process for the American public? Why do we somehow know better that this is where a pipeline should go and how the process should work? So I hope my colleagues will stop and think more about how TransCanada proposal. I know some of my colleagues like to talk about being a good neighbor, and I like to say, you know, we in the Pacific Northwest consider British Columbia a very big friend and neighbor. There are many times that people talk about two provinces and five States working together as an organization on economic issues. So that structure has been in place for many years in the Pacific Northwest. But the people of British Columbia have not been a big supporter of tar sands oil expansion. Something like 60 percent of the public of British Columbia opposes having a tar sands pipeline cross their province. TransCanada knows they are not going to be successful in getting this oil from Alberta across British Columbia out to the Pacific because the people of British Columbia do not want it. So, of course, why not come to the United States? Why not ask them if they want a pipeline going through the middle of their country? British Columbia Premier Christy Clark laid out five principles that ought to have been met in order to site a pipeline of tar sands. Those conditions have not been met, and the province is officially opposed to the pipeline. So there was a lot of opposition and concern there. I will note for my colleagues that when a public UTC--a utility commission or public service commission--when they evaluate a project, they have to look at the environmental impact, and that is water supply, wildlife, vegetation, plants, and they have to look at the economic and social impact. They need to look at alternative routes, the impact to future development near the pipeline, and the views of cities and counties. Again, I will note that I think all of those are a part of having a transparent process instead of a political process on siting. So I am not for moving forward on what I consider special interest legislation, Congress siting for a special interest--this TransCanada company--a project that even people in Canada have raised suspicion about. I hope that we will allow the President to still do due process on such an important issue of environmental concern and that we will not start setting a standard that if you want to short-circuit the eminent domain and protection rights of individuals, we will just bypass all of that at the local level and somehow go to Congress and they will get that done for you. I think that is a very bad message. I hope my colleagues will turn down this legislation, I hope that we can move on to other energy issues that will help our country diversify and move forward in the future. I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. HOEVEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. HOEVEN. Mr. President, I rise to again talk about the Keystone XL Pipeline approval bill. We will be voting on cloture on the motion to proceed in about 15 minutes or so. I believe we have a bipartisan majority. We have 60 sponsors of the legislation, and we will have some others join us in voting to proceed on the bill. That is important, not just because this is bipartisan legislation, important energy legislation for our country but, as I have said before, this is an opportunity for all the Members of this body-- Republican and Democrat--to come forward with their amendments in an open amendment process and really have an energy debate. Let's talk about the energy future of this country and let's bring forward amendments to this legislation that can be good amendments and help us build the right kind of energy plan for our country. What I would point out about this Keystone Pipeline approval bill is that as we work to build an energy plan for this country, as we work to produce more energy so we are truly energy secure--a lot of people call it energy independence--but the way I define it is energy security for our country where we produce more energy than we consume, so we control our destiny. If we produce more energy than we consume, then we control our destiny when it comes to energy. But to do that, we would not only have to produce that energy, we have to have the infrastructure to move it safely, cost effectively, and efficiently from where it is produced to where it is consumed. We have this incredible opportunity with Canada to have North American energy security. We are working with our closest friend and ally in the world. We together produce more energy than we consume, and we have the infrastructure in place to move it from where it is produced to where it is consumed in our country. Now we control our own destiny. When it comes to OPEC or when it comes to Russia or when it comes to China, when it comes to geopolitical events that affect the price of energy, we are in a strong situation. Look at what is going on in Western Europe right now. Look at what is going on in Ukraine. They are in a tremendously difficult situation because they are dependent on Russia for their energy, for their natural gas, at a time when Vladimir Putin is undertaking very aggressive action in Europe. He is invading Ukraine. He has taken Crimea. He continues his aggressive efforts. And at the same time the European Union is trying to support Ukraine, Ukraine is fighting with Russia. This is a situation where Ukraine is depending upon Russia for its energy. Does America really want to be in that kind of a situation in the future when we have real problems in the Middle East, when we have real problems with fundamentalists, Islamic jihadists conducting terror on our people and other freedom-loving people around the world? Do we want to be in a situation where we continue to depend upon the Middle East for our oil? Well, the answer to that is no. The American people resoundingly answer that question--no. [[Page S145]] Also, the American people well know that the reason gas prices at the pump today are lower is not because OPEC just decided to give us a Christmas present. They know the reason energy prices are low in this country, that when they pull up to the pump they are saving money, is because we are producing so much more energy in this country and we are getting more energy from Canada. Unless OPEC cuts back their production, more supply drives prices down. So it is not only about low prices now, it is about making sure we are able to control our energy destiny in the future. We have to take a long-term view. It is working. Of the 18 million barrels of oil a day this country consumes, we now produce 11 million barrels in this country. We are up to 11 million barrels that we produce in this country of the total we consume, so we are still importing about 7 million barrels a day. Canada is now up to 3 million of those 7 million barrels, so we are down to only importing about 4 million barrels a day, but if we keep working at this, we can continue to produce more in this country. Canada's production is continuing to grow. And if we build the infrastructure, we can make sure that we control that energy--North American energy security. That means not only now do our consumers and small businesses and our whole Nation benefit from lower energy prices, lower gas prices at the pump, but we have that ability to make sure we control our destiny and that we benefit in the future. Let's not repeat the mistakes of the past where we return to this dependency on OPEC down the road because we haven't built the infrastructure, we haven't worked with Canada, and we haven't brought our domestic industry to North America so that we truly are energy secure. If we don't build the necessary infrastructure, if we block the necessary infrastructure, we can't build that energy plan for the future. I have heard my counterparts, some of the critics, say: Well, it is not up to us to issue a building permit for infrastructure. Really? So you mean it is the President's job and it is Congress's job to block critical energy that will get us to energy security? Our job is to block it? Our job is to prevent the very infrastructure we need to build energy security for this country, to block the private investment, the $8 billion that private companies want to spend to build this infrastructure, to create jobs, to produce more energy in North America, and to help make this country's energy security? The President's job and this body's job is to block the ability of our country and Canada to build this necessary infrastructure? Well, I don't think so. If you want to put it in terms of: Oh, well, we are not supposed to issue a building permit--really? So our job is to prevent the building of critical infrastructure even when it does not cost one single penny--not one penny--of government money? This is almost $8 billion of private investment that will generate hundreds of millions of dollars of revenue--State, local, and Federal. Every State on the route has approved it. There is an idea somehow we are jumping the gun after 6 years? Let's see, it has been in process for 6 years. Every State on the route has approved it. We are not spending any Federal money. We are saying our job as a Congress and the President is to block that kind of investment, block that kind of job creation, block that kind of energy development, and block our ability to get to energy security for this country. Then there is this argument: Oh, well, it is TransCanada. It is one company. It is only one company, so it really doesn't matter. Really? Well, if you were a company--a Canadian company or a U.S. company--and you were about to build infrastructure so that we could continue to produce more energy in this country, would you do it? If, in spite of the process that the Federal Government has to approve this project, where all of the requirements have been met--not once, but over and over again--and Congress and the President continue to block your ability to build that infrastructure, are you going to jump up and spend billions of dollars and do it? I doubt it. And isn't that really what this is all about? That is what it is about, isn't it? It is for the folks, for the extreme environmental groups that don't want the development of fossil fuels--they are going to block it. This is sending the message and making sure they shut her down here. That has to be music to OPEC's ears. I have to believe that OPEC is going: Boy, that is great; they are not going to build the infrastructure in their country to produce the energy. That is going to keep OPEC in business. There is another country that I think will be very pleased, really excited, if this project gets blocked, and that is China. China is so anxious to get this oil, they are trying to buy that production in Canada. Because, make no mistake, if the energy doesn't come to the United States, it is going somewhere else, and it is most likely going to China. So when we get back in that situation down the road when oil prices move back up, energy demand goes back up, and we have prevented our industry from growing--and Canada is sending all the oil to China, and we have to go back hat in hand to OPEC, Venezuela, and all of these countries, remember---- The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired. Mr. HOEVEN. I ask unanimous consent to continue for 5 minutes. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Ms. CANTWELL. Reserving the right to object. Is the vote scheduled for 4 minutes from now? The PRESIDING OFFICER. Yes, the vote is scheduled for 5:30 p.m. Ms. CANTWELL. I am happy if the Senator speaks until the time of the vote, but I think we should keep to the vote schedule. Mr. HOEVEN. What time is the vote scheduled? The PRESIDING OFFICER. The vote is scheduled at 5:30 p.m. That would leave the Senator 2 minutes. Mr. HOEVEN. I note the presence of the chairman of the Energy Committee. I defer to her for some time if she wishes to speak before the vote. That would be my question, whether we could get maybe a couple of minutes for that purpose. I can certainly wrap up in a couple of minutes. Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I defer to my colleague, the sponsor of this legislation, Senator Hoeven from North Dakota, to conclude his remarks within the remaining time so that we can begin our vote at 5:30 p.m. We appreciate his leadership on this bill. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 1 minute remaining. Mr. HOEVEN. I will wrap up on this note. Let's not get back into the same predicament we have gotten ourselves into before. Let's build this vital energy infrastructure so we can develop energy security for our country, together with Canada. The other point I want to make is on the environmental point: No significant environmental impact. That is the finding of the Obama administration's environmental impact statement done by the State Department. That is their own report: No significant environmental impact. I look forward to having more discussion on the environmental aspects as well. I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of this legislation. Cloture Motion The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time having expired, pursuant to rule XXII, the Chair lays before the Senate the pending cloture motion, which the clerk will state. The assistant legislative clerk read as follows: Cloture Motion We, the undersigned Senators, in accordance with the provisions of rule XXII of the Standing Rules of the Senate, do hereby move to bring to a close debate on the pending motion to proceed to S. 1, a bill to approve the Keystone XL Pipeline.

Inhofe, Dean Heller, Rand Paul, Kelly Ayotte, Bill Cassidy, John Cornyn, David Vitter, John Hoeven. The PRESIDING OFFICER. By unanimous consent, the mandatory quorum call has been waived. The question is, Is it the sense of the Senate that debate on the motion to [[Page S146]] proceed to S. 1, a bill to approve the Keystone XL Pipeline, shall be brought to a close? The yeas and nays are mandatory under the rule. The clerk will call the roll. The assistant legislative clerk called the roll. Mr. CORNYN. The following Senators are necessarily absent: the Senator from Louisiana (Mr. Cassidy) and the Senator from Florida (Mr. Rubio). Further, if present and voting, the Senator from Louisiana (Mr. Cassidy) would have voted ``yea.'' Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the Senator from Ohio (Mr. Brown), the Senator from Nevada (Mr. Reid), and the Senator from Oregon (Mr. Wyden) are necessarily absent. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Lankford).

Under the previous order, the Senate will resume consideration of the motion to proceed to S. 1, which the clerk will report. The bill clerk read as follows: Motion to proceed to Calendar No. 1, S. 1, a bill to approve the Keystone XL Pipeline. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the time until 5:30 p.m. will be equally divided and controlled in the usual form. The Senator from Maine. Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be permitted to proceed for up to 15 minutes as in morning business. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Ms. COLLINS. Thank you, Mr. President. I further request that the time not be charged to either side on the debate on the Keystone pipeline, if that is necessary. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, reserving the right to object--I am sorry, I was discussing with the staff. If the Senator will please repeat her request. Ms. COLLINS. I asked unanimous consent to proceed for up to 15 minutes as in morning business, and since my remarks do not pertain to the debate for the Keystone Pipeline, that the time not be charged to either side in that debate. Mr. DURBIN. I have no objection. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Priorities of Senate Special Committee on Aging Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, it has been my privilege to serve on the Senate Special Committee on Aging since my very first days in the Senate, and I am honored to have been elected to chair this committee for the 114th Congress. I wish to welcome the Presiding Officer, Senator Cotton of Arkansas, to the committee. He will be a new member on our committee, and I believe he will enjoy his service as much as I have. My service on the aging committee is particularly appropriate since Maine is the oldest State in the Nation by median age. Many people would guess that Florida would have that distinction, but, in fact, it is the great State of Maine. Throughout its history, the aging committee has spurred Congress to action on issues that are important to older Americans through its hearings, its investigations, and its reports. This is the first time a Maine Senator has chaired the committee since the 1990s, when my predecessor, mentor, and friend, Senator Bill Cohen, served as chairman. I wish to share with my colleagues today my priorities for the committee as we begin this new Congress. I have three major priorities for the committee's work: first, retirement security; second, investments in biomedical research targeting diseases that disproportionately affect older Americans, such as Alzheimer's and diabetes; and, third, protecting seniors against financial exploitation and scams. I am increasingly concerned that our seniors will not have adequate savings and other financial resources during their retirement years. The committee will, therefore, focus on retirement security and, in particular, on the need to encourage more savings and better financial planning. According to the nonpartisan Center for Retirement Research at Boston College, there currently is an estimated $6.6 trillion gap between the savings Americans have today and what they should have in order to maintain their standard of living during retirement. Nationally, one in four Americans has no source of income beyond Social Security. In the State of Maine, the number is one in three. Social Security provides an absolutely vital safety net. However, with an average benefit of just $16,000 a year, it certainly is not enough to finance a comfortable retirement for many Americans. According to a Gallup survey published in 2012, more than half of all Americans are worried they will not be able to maintain their standard of living in retirement. That is up sharply from 34 percent two decades ago, and the Boston College analysis demonstrates that their concern is warranted. There are many reasons for the decline in retirement security facing American seniors, including the demise of many defined benefit pension plans in the private sector; the severity of the recent financial crisis, which wiped out much of the net worth of many [[Page S137]] seniors, at least temporarily; rising health care costs; the need for long-term care; and, most of all, the simple fact that Americans are living far longer than we used to. Many Americans reaching retirement age also have more debt than retirees of previous generations. I remember when my parents paid off the mortgage on their home and had a mortgage-burning party. Well, today, people who are the age my parents were when they paid off their house are taking on new debt and new mortgages. We found in the aging committee that there are seniors who are still paying off their student loans or the student loans of their children. These are all issues I look forward to the committee exploring in depth in this new Congress. Another priority will be highlighting the importance of biomedical research on diseases such as Alzheimer's and diabetes, which take such a devastating toll on older Americans and their families. Investments in biomedical research not only improve the health and longevity of Americans but also provide benefits to our economy and to the Federal budget. For example, nearly one out of three Medicare dollars is spent treating people living with diabetes. According to multiple economic analyses, there is roughly a 2-to-1 return on investment in Federal support for biomedical research. This investment at the National Institutes of Health and at research centers across the country spur job creation and are critical to America's competitiveness in the global research environment. As the Senate cochair of the Congressional Task Force on Alzheimer's Disease, I am particularly committed to helping to spur breakthroughs in Alzheimer's disease, which has had such a devastating impact on 5.2 million Americans and their families. In addition to the suffering it causes, Alzheimer's costs the United States an astonishing $214 billion a year. That includes $150 billion in costs to the Medicare and Medicaid programs. These costs will only skyrocket as the baby boom generation ages. Fortunately, there is promising research that holds hope for Alzheimer's patients and their families. The research community is poised to make important advances through clinical trials and investigating new therapeutic targets. But adequate funding is critical to advance this research and to achieve these breakthroughs. At a time when the United States is spending more than $200 billion a year for Alzheimer's patients, we are spending less than three-tenths of 1 percent of that amount--about $600 million a year--on research. Surely, we can do more for Alzheimer's, given its tremendous human and economic price. The National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease has as its primary goal the prevention and effective treatment of Alzheimer's by the year 2025. To meet that goal, the chairman of the Federal Alzheimer's Advisory Council says that we need to devote $2 billion a year to Alzheimer's research. Well, think about that. That is only 1 percent-- in fact, it is less than 1 percent--of what we as a society are spending to care for people with Alzheimer's. That investment will lead to better treatments and ultimately to a means of prevention or even a cure for this awful and expensive disease. The aging committee will also continue its focus on scams that target our seniors, such as the Jamaican lottery phone scam we exposed in the last Congress. This nefarious scheme, which is estimated to have cost Americans as much as $300 million a year, particularly targeted seniors in the Northeast. Some seniors in my State lost tens of thousands of dollars to the scam which involved a con artist calling a victim to tell him or her that they had won the Jamaican lottery but needed to pay fees to process the winnings. I don't need to tell my colleagues that these seniors had won nothing of the sort. But this was a very sophisticated scheme. In addition to educating seniors to help them avoid becoming victims of such scams, the hearing resulted in the Jamaican Government passing new laws targeting the scammers and prompted Federal law enforcement to make several arrests. The aging committee will also continue its fraud hotline to help protect seniors from these kinds of scams and financial exploitation, and the phone number for that fraud hotline, which is toll-free, is 1-855-303-9470. In addition to these three major priorities, it is my hope our committee in the second year will also take a close look--really scrutinize--Federal programs designed to help our seniors, such as those authorized by the Older Americans Act. We want to make sure these programs are as effective and efficient as possible and that their benefits reach those seniors as intended. So we will be performing that oversight function and sharing our findings with the committee of jurisdiction--the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee--on which I am also privileged to serve. The Senate Special Committee on Aging has a long history and tradition of bipartisanship, and my work on this committee during the past Congress was particularly rewarding because of the strong partnership I forged with the committee chairman, the senior Senator from Florida, Bill Nelson. I look forward to continuing that bipartisan tradition with my good friend and close colleague, Senator Claire McCaskill of Missouri, who will be serving as the committee's ranking member in the 114th Congress. Finally, I encourage the Presiding Officer and all of the other members of the committee not only to be active participants in the committee but also to share with us their thoughts on issues that we should pursue. Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor, and seeing no one seeking recognition, I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. SCHATZ. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Ernst). Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. SCHATZ. Madam President, I rise today in opposition to S. 1, which will circumvent the administration's official review process for projects crossing international borders and approve construction of the Keystone XL Pipeline, a pipeline dedicated to increasing production of some of the dirtiest, most polluting, and most dangerous crude oil in the world. Supporters of this pipeline in Congress have been relentless. Over the last 2 Congresses they have held 44 votes in the House and Senate intended to approve Keystone. On Tuesday, the very first bill the new Republican majority introduced, traditionally reserved for a party's highest legislative priority, was Keystone. Think about this. Here we stand in what people still call the world's greatest deliberative body, and the first bill we are taking up is not infrastructure generally, not national energy policy, not even national laws as they relate to our pipeline infrastructure. No, we are legislating about a specific pipeline which will move oil from Canada through the United States to be primarily exported from our southern border. I understand there are people of good will and good faith, including the Presiding Officer, who are on both sides of this issue. But it is hard to imagine why this should be the first piece of legislation we take up in this Congress. We have yet to seriously consider or to clarify our policy with respect to the Islamic State. Income inequality is gutting the middle class. Our national infrastructure needs a jolt of investment. Our immigration policy is a failure and a mess. I do not understand why this would be S. 1. Supporters of this bill have stood up three main arguments in favor of Keystone and expanding drilling of tar sands oil reserves in Canada. One, they say it will increase energy security; two, they think it will lower oil and gas prices; third, they say it is a jobs bill. Let's examine these claims, because however tenuous they were, they have been undermined further by facts over the last couple of years. First, the United States has never during the modern age of global energy trade been more energy secure. We import far less oil from unstable regimes and unfriendly countries than we have in decades. We are continuing to build massive amounts of ever cheaper homegrown clean energy such as wind [[Page S138]] and solar, even as we use our energy more efficiently. The United States will add nearly 10 gigawatts of wind and solar capacity in the next year. Not including hydro, the United States has over 85,000 megawatts of renewable energy capacity and continues to build on that number year over year. The prices for solar have dropped 80 percent since 2008 and prices for wind power, which are already competitive with fossil fuels, have dropped 30 percent since 2008. These trends are creating jobs right here at home. For example, the wind industry has over 500 manufacturing facilities across 44 States that are responsible for making wind turbines with over 66 percent domestic content. Second, the recent collapse of crude oil and gasoline prices demonstrates two things. In my home State of Hawaii, energy prices remain far too high. But on the mainland, oil and gas prices are currently very low. The idea that Keystone would make a significant difference was never based in reality, but now it is just obvious. We have low prices and the project has not even started. Gasoline is now $2.21 a gallon. Crude oil prices have slipped below $50 a barrel. The last time gasoline prices were this low was in the aftermath of the financial crisis. As a practical matter, it is not clear to me, and it is certainly not clear to most energy experts, how moving oil from Canada through the United States and exporting refined crude from the Gulf of Mexico would significantly reduce energy prices for us in the United States. Finally, this is called a jobs bill by some. This is many things. It is anti-clean air; it is anti-clean water; it is anti-public health. It is a regulatory earmark. But it is not a jobs bill. It is not deserving of being the No. 1 priority of the 114th Congress. We have heard estimates ranging as high as 42,000 indirect or induced jobs during the construction phase. We know, and everyone seems to agree, that Keystone will employ approximately 35 full-time employees when construction is finished. That is not 3,500 employees. That is not 35,000 employees. That is the 35 full-time employees when construction is completed. If we want to do a real jobs bill worthy of the Senate, we should do a real jobs bill. An infrastructure bank, a highway bill, Shaheen- Portman--all would create orders of magnitude more jobs than this. The American economy added 353,000 jobs in November alone, which made 2014 the strongest year for job growth since 1999. If we pass a highway bill, we get millions of jobs. If we pass an infrastructure bank, we will get hundreds of thousands of jobs. If we pass the bipartisan Shaheen-Portman energy efficiency bill, we will also get hundreds of thousands of jobs. Look, even one new job is a good thing. But if we want to do a jobs bill, let's do a jobs bill. There is plenty of room for us to work together on infrastructure, on energy efficiency, and create hundreds of thousands and even millions of jobs. But this is an energy bill. It moves us in the wrong direction. There are colleagues, with whom I agree, who are arguing against this legislation primarily saying they want to allow the administration's process to play out and that we should not supersede the State Department review. I agree. It is fair to say this is unprecedented, even a little strange, for the Congress to legislate the specifics of a particular infrastructure project. But I want to be clear. This is not a process argument for me. I oppose Keystone because it is a bad idea. Whether it is done through the regular order or in an expedited fashion, whether it is done through the administrative process or the legislative process, I oppose any action, whether through legislation, litigation, or administrative action, that will enable the extraction of Canadian tar sands oil. My reasons are very simple--climate change and math. Climate change, because it is the greatest and most urgent challenge to the health of our families, to the economy, and to our way of life. I want to preserve the American way of life, not endanger it. Math, because we have crunched the numbers and we know we simply cannot afford to burn the oil from tar sands and put its pollution into the air. It is simple. We have a budget. Just as every family in this country must stick to its budget and live within its means, we have to do the same as a planet when it comes to carbon pollution. A new study published last week in the scientific journal Nature makes this clear. The authors asked the question: If we want to stay within our carbon budget and limit warming to 2 degrees Celsius, which is the limit 167 countries agree we must meet to avoid catastrophic effects of climate change, how much more coal, gas, and oil can we burn? The study finds that in order to meet this goal, the majority of the world's known reserves of fossil fuel must stay in the ground between now and 2050. This includes one-third of the world's current oil reserves and 80 percent of current coal reserves. It also finds, and this is critical, that: Any increase in unconventional oil production-- Which includes Canadian tar sands. --is incommensurate with efforts to limit average global warming to 2 degrees Celsius. As we learn more about climate change amidst a clean energy revolution, we find that moving toward clean energy, taking control of our future, is good for business. Our economy will do better. It will grow faster and it will be more resilient if we embrace the technologies and solutions at our fingertips and end our reliance on fossil fuel. We have a chance to embrace the future here. Our future is not tar sands oil. Our future is wind and solar and geothermal and energy efficiency. Our future is not in adding carbon pollution. Our future is in innovating our way out of this problem. Throughout our history, America always leads when we are needed the most. That is what we have to do, not in the direction of more carbon pollution but toward a clean energy economy. A report by New Climate Economy, a group chaired by former Mexican President Felipe Calderon, and including Bank of America chairman Chad Holliday, among others, marshals quantitative evidence to show that action on climate change is a requirement for future global economic growth. In other words, those who warn about the EPA regulation or prices on carbon killing jobs have it exactly backward. The truth is that in order to avoid major disruptions to our economy, we have to reduce carbon pollution and work with other countries such as Canada to ensure that they do the same. I am looking forward to the open amendment process on this bill that the majority leader has promised. It will be an opportunity for the American public to see where Members of the Senate stand on the facts of climate change. Anyone who looks at the facts and does the math ought to oppose this bill and oppose construction of the Keystone XL Pipeline. For me and for many Americans, a vote against this bill is a vote to preserve and protect the air we breathe and the water we drink. It is a vote to ensure that we continue to reduce carbon pollution and fight climate change. It is a vote to leave our children a healthy world. I urge my colleagues to oppose cloture on the motion to proceed. I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Entry-Exit Visa System Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, the attacks on the people of France demonstrate in the most chilling terms the threats posed to Western nations by those who are imbued with Islamic terrorism. While there are many factors that play into the spread of this jihadist ideology in the West, it is time for an honest and plain admission that our open immigration policies are ineffective and have failed to meet the minimum standards that are set by existing law in the United States. This is something I have been dealing with for quite a number of years--a decade really. We have laws that would improve dramatically our ability to identify and block terrorists from entering and staying in the country, but they are not funded and they are not [[Page S139]] carried out and it is unacceptable, as I will point out. Dozens of terrorists and terror plotters have been admitted to the United States on visas or are relying on broader networks to simply enter into our country, taking advantage of lax immigration policies. For instance, the 9/11 attackers all came here on visas. A visa is a document that allows an individual to come for a limited period of time and then return to their home country. This visa system is essential in a modern world, but it needs to be managed and carried out in an effective way. The Boston bombers came as asylees, people seeking asylum, while their mosque was linked to foreign nationals tied to ISIS and foreign terrorists. The individual behind the attempted Christmas bombing in Oregon was a refugee. We have a class of individuals we accept each year who claim to be refugees from foreign countries. This one was from Somalia. The recently foiled plot to bomb a courthouse and school in Connecticut was attempted by a Moroccan national who had a revoked student visa. Many individuals have visas to be students in the United States. We are not managing that well at all. This one had a revoked student visa. It was revoked because of information that came to the attention of officials, but no one made an effort or successfully attempted in any real way to find the individual so he might be deported. Al Qaeda operatives who were apprehended in Kentucky were on visas from Iraq. These are only some of the examples that are out there. These individuals use lax visa policies, flawed asylum policies, flawed refugee policies, and flawed border protection policies. In addition, we are not organized in a way that works effectively. In addition to that, the President of the United States has directed his ICE officers, his Citizenship and Immigration Services officers, and his Border Patrol officers, who are the key individuals in this system, to conduct their business in a way that guarantees failure. That is just the fact. The 9/11 Commission--we all remember that great Commission after the terrible attack on 9/11--zeroed in on our lax immigration policies. Among other things, the Commission demanded implementation of a biometric entry-exit visa system. What does that mean? That means a biometric system where people are identified effectively through fingerprints or some other identifier. I have been through this for years. Back when President Bush was President and we worked with Homeland Security, Governor Ridge was the Secretary of Homeland Security. I think at the end he was finally convinced, and I worked on him very hard. But he volunteered, the last day in office, to use a fingerprint biometric system. It should have already been done by the time President Bush left office, but it wasn't, and it hasn't been done yet. We need a system that works. By the way, police officers have in their cars all over America computer-type screens where they can stop someone on the road, they can ask them to put their hand on the screen, and it reads their fingerprints. It checks the National Crime Information Center to find out whether the person is wanted for murder in New York. He might have caught him in Texas. It lets the officer know whether there are warrants out for these individuals. This is the way the system works in our country, and we need to use it with regard to people who come here on visas. It is an outrage that this hasn't been done, completed fully, and made operational years ago. It is an outrage. It is in the law of the United States. Congress has funded money for this project and it has not yet been done. It will cost us in the future, as the 9/11 Commission has so warned. The 9/11 Commission demanded this system, and it is designed to track those entering and departing the United States on visas. By the way, almost half of the people, at least 40-plus percent now of individuals unlawfully in America entered on a visa. In other words, they didn't come across the border unlawfully. They came lawfully-- perhaps using false documents, but they got a visa. They came to the United States maybe lawfully, but they just did not return to their home country when the visa expired. My colleagues have to know no one is checking. We have no idea whether they left the country or stayed in the country. We do not have an operable exit visa system. This is so bizarre because it is not expensive. It can be implemented rapidly. It will work and give us valuable information that we must have if we are serious about this process, and we must be serious about the process. The individuals in France--I mentioned the ones in the United States--left the country, went through Yemen, apparently, were trained in some sort of terrorist camp, and came back and executed their violent acts in France. So we have to do a better job of this, and we can do it. President Obama's administration has refused to implement the entry- exit system as required by law. We have talked about this publicly and debated it for years. Just last year the co-chairs of the 9/11 Commission, in an evaluation of how well the recommendations they made back after 9/11 have been carried out--a 10-year review of how their report had been received and how much of it had been accomplished-- issued this written statement. Without exit-tracking, our government does not know when a foreign visitor admitted to the United States on a temporary basis has overstayed his or her admission. Here is the language. We put it on a chart because it is important that we understand this. Without exit-tracking, our government does not know when a foreign visitor admitted to the United States on a temporary basis has overstayed his or her admission. Had this system been in place before 9/11, we would have had a better chance of detecting the plotters before they struck. . . . There is no excuse for the fact that 13 years after 9/11 we do not have this much capability in place. Amen. That is exactly correct. That is from ``Reflections on the Tenth Anniversary of the 9/11 Commission Report,'' Thomas H. Kean and Lee H. Hamilton, in 2014. In fact, the original report said this: The Department of Homeland Security, properly supported by the Congress, should complete, as quickly as possible, a biometric entry-exit screening system. That was the report from 2004. It is a very important report. They went to great length to help this Nation figure out what is the responsible thing to do to protect ourselves better from those attackers on 9/11, many of whom were visa overstayers. They didn't come across the border unlawfully; they came across on a lawful visa. Some of them I think had false documentation to get that visa, but they came on a visa, for the most part lawfully, and did not go home as they were required to go home. They overstayed their visa. Nobody knew they had overstayed. Nobody made an inquiry about it. The ``Tenth Anniversary Report Card: The Status of the 9/11 Commission Recommendations,'' by Thomas H. Kean and Lee H. Hamilton, 2011, said this: Full deployment of the biometric exit component of US-VISIT should be a high priority. Such a capability would have assisted law enforcement and intelligence officials in August and September 2001 in conducting a search for two of the 9/11 hijackers that were in the U.S. on expired visas. This would have helped. Indeed, of course, those of us who have some experience in law enforcement know that when you get to one or two of the guys, the whole scheme may get disrupted, and we can penetrate the organization and break it up and stop crime from occurring. To me, it is mind boggling, as the commission leaders have told us, that we haven't completed this. I am told there are forces that don't like the exit visa system. They think it might slow things down a little bit. First, this is not correct. When you come into the country, you are clocked in and you are biometrically fingerprinted. What would you have to do when you leave? Go to the airport, go in a certain line, go through, show your ticket, show your passport, put your hand on a biometric screener, you are read, and you are approved to leave. It is not going to take any massive amounts of time. One excuse after the other has slowed this down, and it is not acceptable. We have to do better. In fact, the administration has suspended enforcement of the visa system almost entirely. We have to understand, colleagues: If we don't have even an exit visa system where we know [[Page S140]] who left the country, how do we know who overstayed and who stayed in the country? Unless somebody overstays their visa and they are caught for speeding and the police officer identified that, I will ask colleagues, what happens? Under the policy of this President of the United States, directed to the lowest officers in America, nothing happens. If the individual does not commit a serious felony, they will not be processed for deportation, even though they have come to the country on a promise to leave on a certain date and flatly refused to do so. This is not acceptable. If we don't have a system that has integrity, then everybody gets the message pretty soon: Just get a visa, come to America, you never have to leave. If you don't get a felony charge against you, you are never going to be deported. This is the policy of this government at this very moment. It is hard for anybody to believe, but that is the truth. We have approximately 5 million visa overstays in the United States. But as the National ICE-- Immigration Customs Enforcement--officers Council president Chris Crane has explained: ICE agents are now prohibited from arresting illegal aliens solely on charges of illegal entry or visa overstay. What a dramatic statement that is. And not only visa overstays, they are prohibited from arresting and removing people who came across the border illegally. That is what he means by illegal entry or visa overstays. This of course removes a cornerstone of integrity in any law system. If we can't look people in the eye and say: We give you a visa, you have a 6-month visa, but at 6 months you have to return to your home country, and mean it, and say: Eventually you will be apprehended and deported if you don't--then the system has no integrity. That is where we are today. Unsurprisingly, ABC News reported that the Obama administration had lost track of 6,000 foreign students who had overstayed their visas and were of ``heightened concern.'' In other words, these 6,000 had some special concern in their background that made us worry about them, whether it was drugs or terrorism or whatever. Of course they have lost sight of them. They are not attempting to find them. So the head of the union representing U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services officers, one of the three major components of the Department of Homeland Security dealing with immigration, Mr. Ken Palinkas, was explicit in his warning to us. It is remarkable what Mr. Crane has said and now what Mr. Palinkas has said: There is no doubt that there are already many individuals in the United States, on visas--expired or active--who are being targeted for radicalization or who already subscribe to radicalized views. Many millions come legally to the U.S. through our wide open immigration policy every year--whether as temporary visitors, lifetime immigrants, refugees, asylum- seekers, foreign students, or recipients of our ``visa waiver program'' which allows people to come and go freely. Yet our government cannot effectively track these foreign visitors and immigrants. This is the man whose officers do this job. They are the ones who approve the visas and manage this system. He went on to warn that the President's so-called Executive amnesty would make the situation radically worse, saying: I write today to warn the general public that this situation is about to get exponentially worse--and more dangerous. . . . Express your concern to your Senators and Congressmen before it is too late. It is a national security imperative to stop this Executive amnesty. It sends exactly the wrong message. What it says is that if you can get into America--through the border, by boat, by plane, on a visa--any way you get into this country and pass the border, you are not going to be asked to leave unless you commit some felony--some serious felony, for that matter. Many felonies don't qualify. And we have over 100,000 people who have committed serious felonies who have been released into America. We don't know where they are, and they are not going to be deported. We have to restore immigration enforcement, establish better controls and screening on immigration from high-risk regions of the world. We really should give more attention to that. It is perfectly legitimate. The visa system, the immigration system of the United States, should serve who? It should serve the interests of the American people. Somebody doesn't have a constitutional right to come to America. The decision is whether America feels like it is in its interests. We have always accepted a large number of people. In fact, we have the largest immigration numbers of any nation in the world. We admit 1 million a year lawfully. When they come from high-risk areas of the world, terrorist states, we should indeed give more scrutiny to those applicants. Census data shows that legal immigration to the United States from the Middle East is one of the largest and fastest growing categories of new admittances. For the national security of the United States, it is imperative that Congress block Executive amnesty and restore essential enforcement, basic bread-and-butter law enforcement. Anyone who claims to be concerned about our national security should be resolutely focused on this task. There is so much that can be done with relatively little difficulty if we have the leadership and will to get it done. It would be unthinkable for the President to veto the Homeland Security appropriations bill in order to continue this illegal and dangerous amnesty scheme during a time of growing threats abroad. Again, let me say that this: the entry-exit visa system is an unappreciated, important part of American immigration law. It is critical to the national security of the United States, as the 9/11 Commission has so stated on more than one occasion. We can do this. Why is it not being done? What forces, what special interests, are interceding between the people of the United States, the national interests, and their special interests that block this kind of system? We can make it work. It is not that hard. We need a biometric system, and that system should be founded on the fingerprint. It took us a number of years, but I think the government has finally concluded it must be the fingerprint for a lot of reasons, one of which is if somebody got a visa to the United States and they committed a murder, an armed robbery, a terrorist act, a major fraud, and a warrant was issued for their arrest--if you don't clock it in at the airport, who knows when they are leaving? So this would pick it up and would pick up any warrants that might be outstanding for those individuals anywhere in the United States that are put in the NCIC, National Crime Information Center. That is the way the system should work. It is long overdue. In the course of the discussions we will have in the weeks and months to come about the necessity of fixing a broken immigration system, the entry- exit visa system has to be implemented. It is long overdue. We can make it happen. It is not that expensive. It is relatively inexpensive, actually, and it will make us much safer in the process. I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. SESSIONS. I ask unanimous consent that the time allotted to each side and utilized be counted against both sides equally during quorum calls. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. SESSIONS. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. COATS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. COATS. Madam President, here we are at the beginning of a new year and a new Congress, and I think we all feel a responsibility to do what the American people voted for in the November 2014 election, which is to come together in this body and in this Congress and work together to find sensible solutions to the very real problems facing Americans. [[Page S141]] It is no secret that the last 6 years have been pretty tough for a lot of people who are out of work or doing part-time work; kids graduating from high school, graduating from college, graduating from community schools, 2-year schools; going back and getting new training and still unable to find meaningful jobs; finding jobs that are part time, two or three of those together; parents trying to save money, pay the mortgage, save money to send the kids to postgraduate school. It has not been easy. So we have come to a point where we have legislation in a new session of Congress, with commitments on a bipartisan basis to stand together, to work together, to try to find solutions, to get people back to work and get our economy moving again. Now we come to the very first issue up for discussion and debate and hopefully passage in this new Congress--the Keystone Pipeline. This is an issue that has been going on for 6 years. The President has been obstinate in his obstruction in letting this go forward, in making a decision. Yet here we are, finally, with an opportunity to not only pass legislation which has passed the House of Representatives, again, just last week with very significant bipartisan support--but now in the Senate to take up this legislation and to move it forward tonight with this vote, to start the process to allow amendments, to allow debate, and to move forward and hopefully enjoy bipartisan support with over 60 votes and then move it to final passage and then send it to the President for, hopefully, signing. This project is the largest, ready-to-build infrastructure project in the United States. It supports tens of thousands of jobs. The estimate has been well over 42,000. It invests billions of dollars in the American economy. It increases revenue to States and local governments, all without spending one dime of taxpayer money. This is a private sector initiative that can be of great benefit to our country. It can provide meaningful jobs and has many benefits for us in the future. It is supported by Democrats, by Republicans, and by a number of labor unions. For instance, the Indiana State Building and Construction Trade Council, which represents 75,000 working Hoosiers in my State, reached out to me recently and asked me to support construction of the Keystone Pipeline, calling it ``an important job creation and energy security issue.'' They are right on the mark. They know I have been a longtime supporter of this effort, but they wanted to put it in writing. I am not sure it was necessary, and they weren't weighing this on the basis of Republican or Democrat, liberal or conservative; they were saying that this is good for us and we hope all of our Senators can support it. We hope it passes. This is an initiative that puts our people to work. Other labor unions, including the North America's Building Trade Unions and the Laborers' International Union of North America support this project. I mentioned the President, for 6 years, has come up with more feeble excuses in terms of why he believes this should not go forward. The last excuse was: We are in a process here and the process has to go forward. That process was waiting, apparently, on the Nebraska Supreme Court approval of the pipeline route through Nebraska, and that was his excuse for why he would have to veto it. I am sure my colleagues now have the word that the Nebraska Supreme Court has upheld State approval of the Keystone Pipeline. In fact, the President's own State Department, in response to numerous calls for environmental studies-- all of which were used as an excuse for not going forward--the President's own State Department has repeatedly approved this, saying it will not have a negative environmental imprint. So what could possibly be the reason the President remains intransigent on this particular issue, because every other box has been checked? We have to come down to the inevitable conclusion that it is all political, that an extreme environmental wing of the President's own party is simply putting untold pressure on him to not go forward with anything having to do with fossil fuels or providing energy security for America from our own resources. After all, a significant portion comes from Montana and North Dakota--and the last time I checked they are in the United States--and from our friendly neighbor to the north, Canada. If this doesn't go through, we will keep importing large quantities of oil from the Middle East. We know what complications there are in terms of securing that oil and how much volatility occurs there based on what is happening today in the Middle East. So getting this product from our Northern States of North Dakota and Montana and getting this product from our friend to the north, Canada, simply makes a great deal of sense in terms of our energy security, our energy supplies, and lessening our reliance on the volatility that comes from getting oil from other sources. To conclude, let me just make it clear what it is we are trying to do. This will help the United States diversify its energy supply. It will offset our dependence on Middle East oil. It will support tens of thousands of American jobs in construction. It will invest billions of dollars in the American economy. It will increase revenue to State and local governments. It will not harm our environment, as numerous studies have indicated--all these benefits without spending a dime of taxpayer money. So after 6 years of delay, procrastination, and evermore feeble excuses, it is time for the President to make a decision. Soon he will have an opportunity to use that pen he so famously talked about not to sign a veto or to declare a veto but to sign a bill approving the Keystone Pipeline into law. I strongly support construction of this pipeline and I urge my colleagues to do the same. I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Will the Senator withhold his request? Mr. COATS. I certainly will. I didn't see my colleague. I am happy to do so. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia. Mr. KAINE. Madam President, I am happy I was here for the comments of my colleague from Indiana on the Keystone Pipeline and, similar to the Senator from Indiana, I am also happy to finally have this debate. The comments he made are very sincere and passionately believed. I accept that. I only challenge one aspect of the comments, which is the suggestion that opposition of Keystone is feeble or only for political reasons. I am a pro-energy Senator. The first bill I introduced in the 114th Congress was a bill I am cosponsoring with Senator Barrasso of Wyoming to expedite American exports of liquid natural gas, but I am an opponent of Keystone on environmental and economic grounds, and I wish to spend a few minutes describing why. To begin with, it can probably be summed up in a question: Why embrace dirty energy when America is in the midst of a clean energy revolution? That is a primary reason I oppose Keystone. The United States, thank goodness, is on a clean energy roll. Not only are we on a clean energy roll, we are on an energy production roll that is helping our economy, helping our trade deficit, and hurting some of our most significant global adversaries, notably Russia and Iran. We have embraced over the last few years a set of conservation and efficiency investments, probably most notably the increased CAFE standards that have saved energy use in the vehicle sector as well as helped the American auto industry significantly rebound. Our natural gas revolution, of which I am a strong supporter, has enabled American industry and consumers to get lower priced energy, and it has enabled us to lessen our dependence on dirtier fuels in the production of electric power and other aspects of our power usage. Wind and solar and other noncarbon energy developments have rocketed ahead. Nearly one- third of the energy that has been added to the American electricity grid since 2005 has been in the wind and solar area. We are one of the few nations in the world that in the period from 2005 to 2012 actually saw a reduction in our carbon emissions. We are on a clean energy roll. We are innovating for the world and we are selling technologies to the rest of the world and that is good for our economy as well as good for the environment. We are also asserting American energy leadership not just in the advances in clean energy but also in the significant advances in American energy production. I think we should feel [[Page S142]] good about the fact that we are a country that has gone from being one of the greatest net importers of energy in the world to now a country that is going to be one of the greatest energy producers in the world, and in many energy areas we are now a net exporter. So emissions are going down. Production and exports are going up. The other thing that is great for Americans is that prices are going down. A barrel of oil right now is in the $50-a-barrel range, which is putting about $1,000 a year back into the pockets of an American family. It is helping American businesses, and it is imposing, as I mentioned earlier, some significant harm upon two of our most persistent global adversaries--Iran and Russia--that rely on energy exports to drive their economy. This energy revolution--higher production, greater economic efficiency, greater cleanliness--has all been happening without the Keystone Pipeline. It has all been happening without the United States embracing tar sands oil. We are going in the right direction now. I oppose the Keystone Pipeline because accelerating the use of tar sands oil turns us around. Instead of going in the right direction to more production, more national security and greater emissions control, the Keystone Pipeline accelerates tar sands oil and takes us in the wrong direction. Simply put, tar sands oil and the exploitation of that resource is a bad bet for the environment and, I believe, a bad bet for the economy. Last month, December 2014, a magazine I really like that normally has a lot of articles about the outdoors, Outside magazine, ran a lengthy article on the area of Canada in Alberta where tar sands are mined. The article is called ``The High Cost of Oil.'' To anyone who is interested in this debate--pro, con or undecided--go online to Outside magazine, December 2014, ``The High Cost of Oil,'' and read what the mining of tar sands oil does to this part of Canada and to this planet. Tar sands oil is not like conventional gas or petroleum. Tar sands oil, the mining and refining and production of it, produces about 15 to 20 percent more greenhouse gas emissions per unit of energy than conventional petroleum. Natural gas produces dramatically less CO 2 than conventional petroleum, but tar sands oil produces dramatically more. If you care about the emissions of CO 2 -- and I think we should all care about the emissions of CO 2 because I accept the science that says CO 2 emissions cause significant climate effects--if you care about CO 2 emissions, then tar sands oil is absolutely the worst thing that can be done. Over the 2 years now that I have been in the Senate, I have had a lot of folks come to me and talk to me about Keystone. They never say a word about greenhouse gas or CO 2 emissions--not a word. Senator Coats didn't say a word in his comments about CO 2 or greenhouse gas emissions. I ask individuals, when they come and talk to me about Keystone: What do you think about CO 2 emissions? What do you think about the fact that tar sands oil is significantly more carbon dense than normal petroleum? The response I find myself getting is: I don't know; I am not a scientist. In fact, I heard that from an energy CEO who employs tons of scientists in his organizations: I don't know; I am not a scientist. The scientific consensus I believe is very clear. We have to do what we can--not drastically and dramatically but in an incremental way-- every day to bring down our CO 2 emissions. I believe we need to do that in smart ways. Yet, from an emissions standpoint, tar sands oil goes exactly in the wrong direction. It is not just CO 2 emissions. Tar sands oil also involves the mining of it. I would encourage you to read this article. It involves scraping up vast acreages of an arboreal forest in Alberta to get to the tar sands underneath. So far, an area about the size of the State of Rhode Island has been completely despoiled to look like a moonscape to get to tar sands, and this will significantly accelerate the more tar sands are built. In the area of Alberta where the mining and refining is taking place, there has been a dramatic increase in respiratory illness and other illnesses associated either with airborne emissions or with the contamination of the area's water supply. Probably one of the most powerful things about the article is not the lengthy analysis, not the words, it is the pictures. The pictures in that article are staggering. When you see what has to be done to these arboreal forests to mine tar sands oil, you come back to this question: Why would we embrace a dirtier technology when America is on a clean- energy revolution that is driving down prices, driving up production, and also driving down emissions. Tar sands oil takes us in the wrong direction. It is not so much about the pipeline. We rely on pipelines in this country, but it is about the acceleration of the development of a resource that, frankly, just doesn't need to be developed. I will conclude and say this. Some say--and I made this argument-- well, look, it is going to be mined anyway and refined anyway. If the pipeline doesn't go through the United States, it will go westward or eastward through Canada or another direction. I am not completely sure that is correct. The article in Outside discusses the fact that Canadians, who know this better than anybody because they live in the neighborhood, are fighting against pipelines being built in Canada. There is also the matter with oil now at a significantly lower price than it has been. Even the economics of this tar sands oil, which is pretty expensive because of what you have to do to refine it, may not make any sense. But even if we set those arguments aside and somebody says to me, why shouldn't the United States just give the big green light to tar sands oil because somebody is going to get it, the reason I think we shouldn't is the United States is showing the world right now what it means to be an energy leader. With increased production, lower emissions, lower prices through innovation--through American innovation--we are showing the world what it means to be an energy leader. We are a leader because we have embraced a simple effort. I am not an engineer, but as I look at what happened in innovation in the last decade, the ethic we have embraced is: Let's do it cleaner tomorrow than today. That is pretty simple. Let's do it cleaner tomorrow than today--not dramatically cleaner. It doesn't have to turn day and night from today to tomorrow. Let's just get a little bit cleaner tomorrow than today. That is what we have been doing as a Nation. It has been increasing supply. It has been driving down demand. It has been driving down prices. It has been helping us control emissions. That is what we should keep doing. I am a pro-energy Senator, but I am a deep skeptic about the use of tar sands oil. For that reason, I am glad we are going to have the debate. I think we should finally be at it. But I am going to oppose the Keystone Pipeline because tar sands oil is going backwards and not forwards. We are showing the world what it means to go forward, and that is the direction we should continue to go. I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll. Ms. CANTWELL. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coats). Without objection, it is so ordered Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, we are going to be voting shortly on the motion to proceed to S. 1, the Keystone XL Pipeline. I am here to urge my colleagues to vote no on that motion to proceed. We had a couple of chances to come to the Senate floor already today and last week and talk about the important issue of energy development in the United States and how we move our country forward with job creation and energy development. The President--we got to hear his remarks and certainly we respect people's points of view that this issue is an issue we have had a lot of time to discuss. Mr. President, the issue is whether the American public and people in affected States have had a lot of time to talk about this issue and whether they have had a transparent process to talk about this issue. I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record an article that [[Page S143]] was in USA TODAY whose headline is ``Permit problems plague Keystone XL pipeline's S.D. leg.'' There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows: [From USA Today, Jan. 7, 2015] Permit Problems Plague Keystone XL Pipeline's S.D. Leg (By John Hultjhult) The South Dakota Public Utilities Commission on Tuesday voted down a move by tribal and environmental groups to force a reboot to the Keystone XL pipeline's state-level permitting process. ( http://www .argusleader.com/story/news/2015/01/06/sd-permit-keystone-xl- still-question/21359367/ ) PUC commissioners said there are clear questions about whether South Dakota's stretch of the massive and controversial project is still due the construction permit it earned in 2010, given a series of changes to its original scope. The 2014 version of the pipeline would be able to carry crude from North Dakota, for example, along with the anticipated crude extracted from tar sands in Alberta, Canada. Even so, commissioners ruled that forcing pipeline owner TransCanada to start over without being offered a chance to explain how it could make those changes while meeting its old obligations would be a denial of due process. ``We need to go through the process to find out,'' Commissioner Chris Nelson said. TransCanada asked for re-certification of its 2010 construction permit in September. The company had to ask for re-certification because four years had passed since the permit was granted. The pipeline stalled as President Obama chose Tuesday to delay the issuance of a federal permit indefinitely, a move that has frustrated supporters, who say the project will add jobs and boost energy security. If completed, the Keystone XL pipeline would release more than 800,000 barrels of oil a day. The GOP-controlled Senate is expected to take up the issue this week. In a new application for the 313 miles of pipeline planned for South Dakota, the company notes 30 changes to the original project, including the addition of North Dakota oil, minor route changes, alterations to construction plans and costs. The Yankton Sioux Tribe filed a motion to dismiss the company's application based on those changes, saying the re- certification process is meant for projects that have been delayed, not those that have altered dramatically in scope. The permit was issued with a set of 50 conditions, which were based on the project as approved four years ago. Thomasina Real Bird, a lawyer for the Yankton Sioux Tribe, told commissioners that the changes to the pipeline are simply too significant to allow the company to apply for re- certification. The company isn't just asking to re-certify a stalled project, she said. ``They're going a step beyond, and that step is not allowed by law,'' Real Bird said. Several others spoke in support of the Yankton Sioux Tribe's motion to dismiss, including Kimberly Craven of the Indigenous Environmental Network. ``I would urge the commission to start over,'' Craven said. ``It's a new permit, a new ballgame.'' Bill Taylor, a lawyer for TransCanada, told commissioners that re-certification is meant to determine whether delayed projects still fall within the scope of an old permit. Dropping a re-certification request because a project changes renders the re-certification process pointless. Keystone XL has changed, but Taylor said the company is prepared to prove that it still meets each of the 50 conditions attached to its 2010 approval. The pipeline is still a pipeline, the product is the same, and the end result is more energy security for the U.S., Taylor said. ``The current iteration of the project can and will meeting the conditions upon which the permit is issued,'' Taylor said. The PUC voted 3-0 to deny the motions to dismiss the application brought by the Yankton Sioux Tribe and joined by others. The hearing on the merits of the re-certification is planned for May. Ms. CANTWELL. This is an article that just recently appeared in the paper about how South Dakota is bringing up objections to the pipeline, and they want to do due process with their public utility commission to make sure this project meets the criteria of environmental and safety concerns and security concerns that State wants to see met. The reason this is still an issue in South Dakota is because part of the pipeline will go through South Dakota. There have been many changes since the original proposal was put forth, and people in South Dakota want to know exactly what these changes are and exactly how they will go through the process. In fact, one Native American tribe representative who was objecting said: The company is not just asking to recertify its old project. They are going a step beyond that that is not allowed by law. So there are people who want them to go through the normal process because siting of a pipeline of this nature is of great concern to local residents, to property owners. I find it interesting that in the debate on this issue, we on this side of the aisle are the ones who are advocating and standing up for property owners to make sure there is not a taking of their property without a transparent process and input for that process because that is exactly what transpired here when the company, with the help of the State of Nebraska, did not continue to proceed through their public service commission, their public utility commission, and instead tried to pass a law saying that the environmental review and security issues and oversight could be done by the Governor. Now, my colleagues who are Governors know that when you are Governor, you do not have the most transparent process. It is not as if citizens are going to come to hearings in the Governor's office. It is not as though all of that is there for review. Certainly those citizens do not have the ability to object and make sure they are getting the right compensation for their property and make sure issues of safety and security are addressed. So that is why some private property owners sued. Because the legislature and the Governor did not have the right to act; the law taking the power away from the utility commission and giving it to the Governor was unconstitutional. The separation of powers is divided between the Governor and their public service commission. It is the job of those UTCs--utilities and transportation commissions around the country--to protect the interests of the public in the siting of these facilities. That this authority was now moved up through the legislature to the Governor to decide all of that was clearly something that was not constitutional. I find it very interesting that four of the seven supreme court justices said, in fact, yes, that law passed by the legislature was not constitutional. So my question is, What is the hurry? Now that this issue, based on standing and the other justices not deciding, has the process to move forward, Congress feels some sort of urgency to be a siting commission and site a pipeline that has, No. 1, failed to go through the public process in the State of Nebraska; No. 2, has a public process now being questioned in the State of South Dakota, raising concern and urgency that those issues of the public be addressed; and No. 3, goes over what the President of the United States has said he wants to follow as a due process and make sure all the issues are brought to the table. I will remind my colleagues that if everybody here had their way, the President would have approved the original Keystone XL pipeline route. Congress thought they should stick their hands in the middle of this siting and land use issue and put in legislative language on a passed bill by the Congress saying the President, if it was a national security interest, must decide and site the Keystone Pipeline. Thank God those at the State Department and the White House decided that was not such a smart idea because that current pipeline went through a major aquifer that served eight States and posed a great deal of concern to landowners, farmers, residents, and various individuals about that particular proposal. So if this body would have had its way before--those who support this pipeline--they would have pressured the President to approve what is now a defunct, horrible idea of what was proposed by TransCanada. So now I ask my colleagues, are you sure all of the issues have been addressed here at the local level? Because clearly there are people in Nebraska and people in South Dakota who do not think so. Last I checked, our job is not to site pipelines; our job is to move our country forward on an energy strategy that will produce jobs, diversify our resources, and make the United States a leader in energy. I know my colleagues feel as if we will get a chance to address a lot of issues if we do move forward in a debate, and I am sure there will be many on many sides. I question whether we shouldn't be spending our time focusing on a bipartisan energy bill with lots of support on a whole myriad of [[Page S144]] others issues we need to work on, as we did in 2007, to make sure we are helping in the transformation of energy policy moving forward that will produce a lot more jobs. This particular proposal, as many of my colleagues have pointed out, while there are some immediate construction jobs, the long-term jobs are very few compared to many of the other things we have been doing. I would also like to point out that since Keystone has undertaken more development in the United States, that part of that development in the United States has also come into question lately. The security of the welding on the pipeline that has been done in the southern part of that pipeline has come into question, even to the point where I think the State Department has said to the company: We are going to have a third-party validator approve whether you are actually meeting the standards we would like to see in the development of this pipeline in the United States. But there are many issues here about safety and security, as my colleagues can point out who have brought up these issues before. My colleague from Michigan suffered one of the most devastating oilspills in her area. That was a tar sands oilspill. My colleague from Michigan, Senator Stabenow, has actually flown over that oilspill and cited that it took 4 years and $1.2 billion to clean it up and that the tar sands sunk to the bottom of the river and the river had to be dredged. So this is something my colleagues may not quite understand, that the tar sands, even according to the Commandant of the Coast Guard--we do not really have a solution for its cleanup when it spills in water. That is why I want to make sure that tar sands pay into the oilspill liability trust fund, as any other oil source does, so that we can make sure we are planning for the future and for getting help and response for any of these oilspills that could occur in the future. But needless to say Michigan and the Kalamazoo spill taught our Nation how dangerous this oilspill process could be. So why are we prematurely trying to cut off the debate on this issue at the local government level and say that we in Congress know better than these utility and transportation commissions and their transparent siting process for the American public? Why do we somehow know better that this is where a pipeline should go and how the process should work? So I hope my colleagues will stop and think more about how TransCanada proposal. I know some of my colleagues like to talk about being a good neighbor, and I like to say, you know, we in the Pacific Northwest consider British Columbia a very big friend and neighbor. There are many times that people talk about two provinces and five States working together as an organization on economic issues. So that structure has been in place for many years in the Pacific Northwest. But the people of British Columbia have not been a big supporter of tar sands oil expansion. Something like 60 percent of the public of British Columbia opposes having a tar sands pipeline cross their province. TransCanada knows they are not going to be successful in getting this oil from Alberta across British Columbia out to the Pacific because the people of British Columbia do not want it. So, of course, why not come to the United States? Why not ask them if they want a pipeline going through the middle of their country? British Columbia Premier Christy Clark laid out five principles that ought to have been met in order to site a pipeline of tar sands. Those conditions have not been met, and the province is officially opposed to the pipeline. So there was a lot of opposition and concern there. I will note for my colleagues that when a public UTC--a utility commission or public service commission--when they evaluate a project, they have to look at the environmental impact, and that is water supply, wildlife, vegetation, plants, and they have to look at the economic and social impact. They need to look at alternative routes, the impact to future development near the pipeline, and the views of cities and counties. Again, I will note that I think all of those are a part of having a transparent process instead of a political process on siting. So I am not for moving forward on what I consider special interest legislation, Congress siting for a special interest--this TransCanada company--a project that even people in Canada have raised suspicion about. I hope that we will allow the President to still do due process on such an important issue of environmental concern and that we will not start setting a standard that if you want to short-circuit the eminent domain and protection rights of individuals, we will just bypass all of that at the local level and somehow go to Congress and they will get that done for you. I think that is a very bad message. I hope my colleagues will turn down this legislation, I hope that we can move on to other energy issues that will help our country diversify and move forward in the future. I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. HOEVEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. HOEVEN. Mr. President, I rise to again talk about the Keystone XL Pipeline approval bill. We will be voting on cloture on the motion to proceed in about 15 minutes or so. I believe we have a bipartisan majority. We have 60 sponsors of the legislation, and we will have some others join us in voting to proceed on the bill. That is important, not just because this is bipartisan legislation, important energy legislation for our country but, as I have said before, this is an opportunity for all the Members of this body-- Republican and Democrat--to come forward with their amendments in an open amendment process and really have an energy debate. Let's talk about the energy future of this country and let's bring forward amendments to this legislation that can be good amendments and help us build the right kind of energy plan for our country. What I would point out about this Keystone Pipeline approval bill is that as we work to build an energy plan for this country, as we work to produce more energy so we are truly energy secure--a lot of people call it energy independence--but the way I define it is energy security for our country where we produce more energy than we consume, so we control our destiny. If we produce more energy than we consume, then we control our destiny when it comes to energy. But to do that, we would not only have to produce that energy, we have to have the infrastructure to move it safely, cost effectively, and efficiently from where it is produced to where it is consumed. We have this incredible opportunity with Canada to have North American energy security. We are working with our closest friend and ally in the world. We together produce more energy than we consume, and we have the infrastructure in place to move it from where it is produced to where it is consumed in our country. Now we control our own destiny. When it comes to OPEC or when it comes to Russia or when it comes to China, when it comes to geopolitical events that affect the price of energy, we are in a strong situation. Look at what is going on in Western Europe right now. Look at what is going on in Ukraine. They are in a tremendously difficult situation because they are dependent on Russia for their energy, for their natural gas, at a time when Vladimir Putin is undertaking very aggressive action in Europe. He is invading Ukraine. He has taken Crimea. He continues his aggressive efforts. And at the same time the European Union is trying to support Ukraine, Ukraine is fighting with Russia. This is a situation where Ukraine is depending upon Russia for its energy. Does America really want to be in that kind of a situation in the future when we have real problems in the Middle East, when we have real problems with fundamentalists, Islamic jihadists conducting terror on our people and other freedom-loving people around the world? Do we want to be in a situation where we continue to depend upon the Middle East for our oil? Well, the answer to that is no. The American people resoundingly answer that question--no. [[Page S145]] Also, the American people well know that the reason gas prices at the pump today are lower is not because OPEC just decided to give us a Christmas present. They know the reason energy prices are low in this country, that when they pull up to the pump they are saving money, is because we are producing so much more energy in this country and we are getting more energy from Canada. Unless OPEC cuts back their production, more supply drives prices down. So it is not only about low prices now, it is about making sure we are able to control our energy destiny in the future. We have to take a long-term view. It is working. Of the 18 million barrels of oil a day this country consumes, we now produce 11 million barrels in this country. We are up to 11 million barrels that we produce in this country of the total we consume, so we are still importing about 7 million barrels a day. Canada is now up to 3 million of those 7 million barrels, so we are down to only importing about 4 million barrels a day, but if we keep working at this, we can continue to produce more in this country. Canada's production is continuing to grow. And if we build the infrastructure, we can make sure that we control that energy--North American energy security. That means not only now do our consumers and small businesses and our whole Nation benefit from lower energy prices, lower gas prices at the pump, but we have that ability to make sure we control our destiny and that we benefit in the future. Let's not repeat the mistakes of the past where we return to this dependency on OPEC down the road because we haven't built the infrastructure, we haven't worked with Canada, and we haven't brought our domestic industry to North America so that we truly are energy secure. If we don't build the necessary infrastructure, if we block the necessary infrastructure, we can't build that energy plan for the future. I have heard my counterparts, some of the critics, say: Well, it is not up to us to issue a building permit for infrastructure. Really? So you mean it is the President's job and it is Congress's job to block critical energy that will get us to energy security? Our job is to block it? Our job is to prevent the very infrastructure we need to build energy security for this country, to block the private investment, the $8 billion that private companies want to spend to build this infrastructure, to create jobs, to produce more energy in North America, and to help make this country's energy security? The President's job and this body's job is to block the ability of our country and Canada to build this necessary infrastructure? Well, I don't think so. If you want to put it in terms of: Oh, well, we are not supposed to issue a building permit--really? So our job is to prevent the building of critical infrastructure even when it does not cost one single penny--not one penny--of government money? This is almost $8 billion of private investment that will generate hundreds of millions of dollars of revenue--State, local, and Federal. Every State on the route has approved it. There is an idea somehow we are jumping the gun after 6 years? Let's see, it has been in process for 6 years. Every State on the route has approved it. We are not spending any Federal money. We are saying our job as a Congress and the President is to block that kind of investment, block that kind of job creation, block that kind of energy development, and block our ability to get to energy security for this country. Then there is this argument: Oh, well, it is TransCanada. It is one company. It is only one company, so it really doesn't matter. Really? Well, if you were a company--a Canadian company or a U.S. company--and you were about to build infrastructure so that we could continue to produce more energy in this country, would you do it? If, in spite of the process that the Federal Government has to approve this project, where all of the requirements have been met--not once, but over and over again--and Congress and the President continue to block your ability to build that infrastructure, are you going to jump up and spend billions of dollars and do it? I doubt it. And isn't that really what this is all about? That is what it is about, isn't it? It is for the folks, for the extreme environmental groups that don't want the development of fossil fuels--they are going to block it. This is sending the message and making sure they shut her down here. That has to be music to OPEC's ears. I have to believe that OPEC is going: Boy, that is great; they are not going to build the infrastructure in their country to produce the energy. That is going to keep OPEC in business. There is another country that I think will be very pleased, really excited, if this project gets blocked, and that is China. China is so anxious to get this oil, they are trying to buy that production in Canada. Because, make no mistake, if the energy doesn't come to the United States, it is going somewhere else, and it is most likely going to China. So when we get back in that situation down the road when oil prices move back up, energy demand goes back up, and we have prevented our industry from growing--and Canada is sending all the oil to China, and we have to go back hat in hand to OPEC, Venezuela, and all of these countries, remember---- The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired. Mr. HOEVEN. I ask unanimous consent to continue for 5 minutes. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Ms. CANTWELL. Reserving the right to object. Is the vote scheduled for 4 minutes from now? The PRESIDING OFFICER. Yes, the vote is scheduled for 5:30 p.m. Ms. CANTWELL. I am happy if the Senator speaks until the time of the vote, but I think we should keep to the vote schedule. Mr. HOEVEN. What time is the vote scheduled? The PRESIDING OFFICER. The vote is scheduled at 5:30 p.m. That would leave the Senator 2 minutes. Mr. HOEVEN. I note the presence of the chairman of the Energy Committee. I defer to her for some time if she wishes to speak before the vote. That would be my question, whether we could get maybe a couple of minutes for that purpose. I can certainly wrap up in a couple of minutes. Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I defer to my colleague, the sponsor of this legislation, Senator Hoeven from North Dakota, to conclude his remarks within the remaining time so that we can begin our vote at 5:30 p.m. We appreciate his leadership on this bill. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 1 minute remaining. Mr. HOEVEN. I will wrap up on this note. Let's not get back into the same predicament we have gotten ourselves into before. Let's build this vital energy infrastructure so we can develop energy security for our country, together with Canada. The other point I want to make is on the environmental point: No significant environmental impact. That is the finding of the Obama administration's environmental impact statement done by the State Department. That is their own report: No significant environmental impact. I look forward to having more discussion on the environmental aspects as well. I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of this legislation. Cloture Motion The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time having expired, pursuant to rule XXII, the Chair lays before the Senate the pending cloture motion, which the clerk will state. The assistant legislative clerk read as follows: Cloture Motion We, the undersigned Senators, in accordance with the provisions of rule XXII of the Standing Rules of the Senate, do hereby move to bring to a close debate on the pending motion to proceed to S. 1, a bill to approve the Keystone XL Pipeline.

s136-s146] from the congressional record online through the government publishing office [ www.gpo.gov ] keystone xl pipeline act--motion to proceed the presiding officer. under the previous order, the senate will resume consideration of the motion to proceed to s. 1, which the clerk will report. the bill clerk read as follows: motion to proceed to calendar no. 1, s. 1, a bill to approve the keystone xl pipeline. the presiding officer. under the previous order, the time until 5:30 p.m. will be equally divided and controlled in the usual form. the senator from maine. ms. collins. mr. president, i ask unanimous consent that i be permitted to proceed for up to 15 minutes as in morning business. the presiding officer. without objection, it is so ordered. ms. collins. thank you, mr. president. i further request that the time not be charged to either side on the debate on the keystone pipeline, if that is necessary. the presiding officer. is there objection? mr. durbin. mr. president, reserving the right to object--i am sorry, i was discussing with the staff. if the senator will please repeat her request. ms. collins. i asked unanimous consent to proceed for up to 15 minutes as in morning business, and since my remarks do not pertain to the debate for the keystone pipeline, that the time not be charged to either side in that debate. mr. durbin. i have no objection. the presiding officer. without objection, it is so ordered. priorities of senate special committee on aging ms. collins. mr. president, it has been my privilege to serve on the senate special committee on aging since my very first days in the senate, and i am honored to have been elected to chair this committee for the 114th congress. i wish to welcome the presiding officer, senator cotton of arkansas, to the committee. he will be a new member on our committee, and i believe he will enjoy his service as much as i have. my service on the aging committee is particularly appropriate since maine is the oldest state in the nation by median age. many people would guess that florida would have that distinction, but, in fact, it is the great state of maine. throughout its history, the aging committee has spurred congress to action on issues that are important to older americans through its hearings, its investigations, and its reports. this is the first time a maine senator has chaired the committee since the 1990s, when my predecessor, mentor, and friend, senator bill cohen, served as chairman. i wish to share with my colleagues today my priorities for the committee as we begin this new congress. i have three major priorities for the committee's work: first, retirement security; second, investments in biomedical research targeting diseases that disproportionately affect older americans, such as alzheimer's and diabetes; and, third, protecting seniors against financial exploitation and scams. i am increasingly concerned that our seniors will not have adequate savings and other financial resources during their retirement years. the committee will, therefore, focus on retirement security and, in particular, on the need to encourage more savings and better financial planning. according to the nonpartisan center for retirement research at boston college, there currently is an estimated $6.6 trillion gap between the savings americans have today and what they should have in order to maintain their standard of living during retirement. nationally, one in four americans has no source of income beyond social security. in the state of maine, the number is one in three. social security provides an absolutely vital safety net. however, with an average benefit of just $16,000 a year, it certainly is not enough to finance a comfortable retirement for many americans. according to a gallup survey published in 2012, more than half of all americans are worried they will not be able to maintain their standard of living in retirement. that is up sharply from 34 percent two decades ago, and the boston college analysis demonstrates that their concern is warranted. there are many reasons for the decline in retirement security facing american seniors, including the demise of many defined benefit pension plans in the private sector; the severity of the recent financial crisis, which wiped out much of the net worth of many [[page s137]] seniors, at least temporarily; rising health care costs; the need for long-term care; and, most of all, the simple fact that americans are living far longer than we used to. many americans reaching retirement age also have more debt than retirees of previous generations. i remember when my parents paid off the mortgage on their home and had a mortgage-burning party. well, today, people who are the age my parents were when they paid off their house are taking on new debt and new mortgages. we found in the aging committee that there are seniors who are still paying off their student loans or the student loans of their children. these are all issues i look forward to the committee exploring in depth in this new congress. another priority will be highlighting the importance of biomedical research on diseases such as alzheimer's and diabetes, which take such a devastating toll on older americans and their families. investments in biomedical research not only improve the health and longevity of americans but also provide benefits to our economy and to the federal budget. for example, nearly one out of three medicare dollars is spent treating people living with diabetes. according to multiple economic analyses, there is roughly a 2-to-1 return on investment in federal support for biomedical research. this investment at the national institutes of health and at research centers across the country spur job creation and are critical to america's competitiveness in the global research environment. as the senate cochair of the congressional task force on alzheimer's disease, i am particularly committed to helping to spur breakthroughs in alzheimer's disease, which has had such a devastating impact on 5.2 million americans and their families. in addition to the suffering it causes, alzheimer's costs the united states an astonishing $214 billion a year. that includes $150 billion in costs to the medicare and medicaid programs. these costs will only skyrocket as the baby boom generation ages. fortunately, there is promising research that holds hope for alzheimer's patients and their families. the research community is poised to make important advances through clinical trials and investigating new therapeutic targets. but adequate funding is critical to advance this research and to achieve these breakthroughs. at a time when the united states is spending more than $200 billion a year for alzheimer's patients, we are spending less than three-tenths of 1 percent of that amount--about $600 million a year--on research. surely, we can do more for alzheimer's, given its tremendous human and economic price. the national plan to address alzheimer's disease has as its primary goal the prevention and effective treatment of alzheimer's by the year 2025. to meet that goal, the chairman of the federal alzheimer's advisory council says that we need to devote $2 billion a year to alzheimer's research. well, think about that. that is only 1 percent-- in fact, it is less than 1 percent--of what we as a society are spending to care for people with alzheimer's. that investment will lead to better treatments and ultimately to a means of prevention or even a cure for this awful and expensive disease. the aging committee will also continue its focus on scams that target our seniors, such as the jamaican lottery phone scam we exposed in the last congress. this nefarious scheme, which is estimated to have cost americans as much as $300 million a year, particularly targeted seniors in the northeast. some seniors in my state lost tens of thousands of dollars to the scam which involved a con artist calling a victim to tell him or her that they had won the jamaican lottery but needed to pay fees to process the winnings. i don't need to tell my colleagues that these seniors had won nothing of the sort. but this was a very sophisticated scheme. in addition to educating seniors to help them avoid becoming victims of such scams, the hearing resulted in the jamaican government passing new laws targeting the scammers and prompted federal law enforcement to make several arrests. the aging committee will also continue its fraud hotline to help protect seniors from these kinds of scams and financial exploitation, and the phone number for that fraud hotline, which is toll-free, is 1-855-303-9470. in addition to these three major priorities, it is my hope our committee in the second year will also take a close look--really scrutinize--federal programs designed to help our seniors, such as those authorized by the older americans act. we want to make sure these programs are as effective and efficient as possible and that their benefits reach those seniors as intended. so we will be performing that oversight function and sharing our findings with the committee of jurisdiction--the health, education, labor, and pensions committee--on which i am also privileged to serve. the senate special committee on aging has a long history and tradition of bipartisanship, and my work on this committee during the past congress was particularly rewarding because of the strong partnership i forged with the committee chairman, the senior senator from florida, bill nelson. i look forward to continuing that bipartisan tradition with my good friend and close colleague, senator claire mccaskill of missouri, who will be serving as the committee's ranking member in the 114th congress. finally, i encourage the presiding officer and all of the other members of the committee not only to be active participants in the committee but also to share with us their thoughts on issues that we should pursue. thank you, mr. president. i yield the floor, and seeing no one seeking recognition, i suggest the absence of a quorum. the presiding officer. the clerk will call the roll. the bill clerk proceeded to call the roll. mr. schatz. madam president, i ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. the presiding officer (mrs. ernst). without objection, it is so ordered. mr. schatz. madam president, i rise today in opposition to s. 1, which will circumvent the administration's official review process for projects crossing international borders and approve construction of the keystone xl pipeline, a pipeline dedicated to increasing production of some of the dirtiest, most polluting, and most dangerous crude oil in the world. supporters of this pipeline in congress have been relentless. over the last 2 congresses they have held 44 votes in the house and senate intended to approve keystone. on tuesday, the very first bill the new republican majority introduced, traditionally reserved for a party's highest legislative priority, was keystone. think about this. here we stand in what people still call the world's greatest deliberative body, and the first bill we are taking up is not infrastructure generally, not national energy policy, not even national laws as they relate to our pipeline infrastructure. no, we are legislating about a specific pipeline which will move oil from canada through the united states to be primarily exported from our southern border. i understand there are people of good will and good faith, including the presiding officer, who are on both sides of this issue. but it is hard to imagine why this should be the first piece of legislation we take up in this congress. we have yet to seriously consider or to clarify our policy with respect to the islamic state. income inequality is gutting the middle class. our national infrastructure needs a jolt of investment. our immigration policy is a failure and a mess. i do not understand why this would be s. 1. supporters of this bill have stood up three main arguments in favor of keystone and expanding drilling of tar sands oil reserves in canada. one, they say it will increase energy security; two, they think it will lower oil and gas prices; third, they say it is a jobs bill. let's examine these claims, because however tenuous they were, they have been undermined further by facts over the last couple of years. first, the united states has never during the modern age of global energy trade been more energy secure. we import far less oil from unstable regimes and unfriendly countries than we have in decades. we are continuing to build massive amounts of ever cheaper homegrown clean energy such as wind [[page s138]] and solar, even as we use our energy more efficiently. the united states will add nearly 10 gigawatts of wind and solar capacity in the next year. not including hydro, the united states has over 85,000 megawatts of renewable energy capacity and continues to build on that number year over year. the prices for solar have dropped 80 percent since 2008 and prices for wind power, which are already competitive with fossil fuels, have dropped 30 percent since 2008. these trends are creating jobs right here at home. for example, the wind industry has over 500 manufacturing facilities across 44 states that are responsible for making wind turbines with over 66 percent domestic content. second, the recent collapse of crude oil and gasoline prices demonstrates two things. in my home state of hawaii, energy prices remain far too high. but on the mainland, oil and gas prices are currently very low. the idea that keystone would make a significant difference was never based in reality, but now it is just obvious. we have low prices and the project has not even started. gasoline is now $2.21 a gallon. crude oil prices have slipped below $50 a barrel. the last time gasoline prices were this low was in the aftermath of the financial crisis. as a practical matter, it is not clear to me, and it is certainly not clear to most energy experts, how moving oil from canada through the united states and exporting refined crude from the gulf of mexico would significantly reduce energy prices for us in the united states. finally, this is called a jobs bill by some. this is many things. it is anti-clean air; it is anti-clean water; it is anti-public health. it is a regulatory earmark. but it is not a jobs bill. it is not deserving of being the no. 1 priority of the 114th congress. we have heard estimates ranging as high as 42,000 indirect or induced jobs during the construction phase. we know, and everyone seems to agree, that keystone will employ approximately 35 full-time employees when construction is finished. that is not 3,500 employees. that is not 35,000 employees. that is the 35 full-time employees when construction is completed. if we want to do a real jobs bill worthy of the senate, we should do a real jobs bill. an infrastructure bank, a highway bill, shaheen- portman--all would create orders of magnitude more jobs than this. the american economy added 353,000 jobs in november alone, which made 2014 the strongest year for job growth since 1999. if we pass a highway bill, we get millions of jobs. if we pass an infrastructure bank, we will get hundreds of thousands of jobs. if we pass the bipartisan shaheen-portman energy efficiency bill, we will also get hundreds of thousands of jobs. look, even one new job is a good thing. but if we want to do a jobs bill, let's do a jobs bill. there is plenty of room for us to work together on infrastructure, on energy efficiency, and create hundreds of thousands and even millions of jobs. but this is an energy bill. it moves us in the wrong direction. there are colleagues, with whom i agree, who are arguing against this legislation primarily saying they want to allow the administration's process to play out and that we should not supersede the state department review. i agree. it is fair to say this is unprecedented, even a little strange, for the congress to legislate the specifics of a particular infrastructure project. but i want to be clear. this is not a process argument for me. i oppose keystone because it is a bad idea. whether it is done through the regular order or in an expedited fashion, whether it is done through the administrative process or the legislative process, i oppose any action, whether through legislation, litigation, or administrative action, that will enable the extraction of canadian tar sands oil. my reasons are very simple--climate change and math. climate change, because it is the greatest and most urgent challenge to the health of our families, to the economy, and to our way of life. i want to preserve the american way of life, not endanger it. math, because we have crunched the numbers and we know we simply cannot afford to burn the oil from tar sands and put its pollution into the air. it is simple. we have a budget. just as every family in this country must stick to its budget and live within its means, we have to do the same as a planet when it comes to carbon pollution. a new study published last week in the scientific journal nature makes this clear. the authors asked the question: if we want to stay within our carbon budget and limit warming to 2 degrees celsius, which is the limit 167 countries agree we must meet to avoid catastrophic effects of climate change, how much more coal, gas, and oil can we burn? the study finds that in order to meet this goal, the majority of the world's known reserves of fossil fuel must stay in the ground between now and 2050. this includes one-third of the world's current oil reserves and 80 percent of current coal reserves. it also finds, and this is critical, that: any increase in unconventional oil production-- which includes canadian tar sands. --is incommensurate with efforts to limit average global warming to 2 degrees celsius. as we learn more about climate change amidst a clean energy revolution, we find that moving toward clean energy, taking control of our future, is good for business. our economy will do better. it will grow faster and it will be more resilient if we embrace the technologies and solutions at our fingertips and end our reliance on fossil fuel. we have a chance to embrace the future here. our future is not tar sands oil. our future is wind and solar and geothermal and energy efficiency. our future is not in adding carbon pollution. our future is in innovating our way out of this problem. throughout our history, america always leads when we are needed the most. that is what we have to do, not in the direction of more carbon pollution but toward a clean energy economy. a report by new climate economy, a group chaired by former mexican president felipe calderon, and including bank of america chairman chad holliday, among others, marshals quantitative evidence to show that action on climate change is a requirement for future global economic growth. in other words, those who warn about the epa regulation or prices on carbon killing jobs have it exactly backward. the truth is that in order to avoid major disruptions to our economy, we have to reduce carbon pollution and work with other countries such as canada to ensure that they do the same. i am looking forward to the open amendment process on this bill that the majority leader has promised. it will be an opportunity for the american public to see where members of the senate stand on the facts of climate change. anyone who looks at the facts and does the math ought to oppose this bill and oppose construction of the keystone xl pipeline. for me and for many americans, a vote against this bill is a vote to preserve and protect the air we breathe and the water we drink. it is a vote to ensure that we continue to reduce carbon pollution and fight climate change. it is a vote to leave our children a healthy world. i urge my colleagues to oppose cloture on the motion to proceed. i yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum. the presiding officer. the clerk will call the roll. the assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. mr. sessions. madam president, i ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. the presiding officer. without objection, it is so ordered. entry-exit visa system mr. sessions. madam president, the attacks on the people of france demonstrate in the most chilling terms the threats posed to western nations by those who are imbued with islamic terrorism. while there are many factors that play into the spread of this jihadist ideology in the west, it is time for an honest and plain admission that our open immigration policies are ineffective and have failed to meet the minimum standards that are set by existing law in the united states. this is something i have been dealing with for quite a number of years--a decade really. we have laws that would improve dramatically our ability to identify and block terrorists from entering and staying in the country, but they are not funded and they are not [[page s139]] carried out and it is unacceptable, as i will point out. dozens of terrorists and terror plotters have been admitted to the united states on visas or are relying on broader networks to simply enter into our country, taking advantage of lax immigration policies. for instance, the 9/11 attackers all came here on visas. a visa is a document that allows an individual to come for a limited period of time and then return to their home country. this visa system is essential in a modern world, but it needs to be managed and carried out in an effective way. the boston bombers came as asylees, people seeking asylum, while their mosque was linked to foreign nationals tied to isis and foreign terrorists. the individual behind the attempted christmas bombing in oregon was a refugee. we have a class of individuals we accept each year who claim to be refugees from foreign countries. this one was from somalia. the recently foiled plot to bomb a courthouse and school in connecticut was attempted by a moroccan national who had a revoked student visa. many individuals have visas to be students in the united states. we are not managing that well at all. this one had a revoked student visa. it was revoked because of information that came to the attention of officials, but no one made an effort or successfully attempted in any real way to find the individual so he might be deported. al qaeda operatives who were apprehended in kentucky were on visas from iraq. these are only some of the examples that are out there. these individuals use lax visa policies, flawed asylum policies, flawed refugee policies, and flawed border protection policies. in addition, we are not organized in a way that works effectively. in addition to that, the president of the united states has directed his ice officers, his citizenship and immigration services officers, and his border patrol officers, who are the key individuals in this system, to conduct their business in a way that guarantees failure. that is just the fact. the 9/11 commission--we all remember that great commission after the terrible attack on 9/11--zeroed in on our lax immigration policies. among other things, the commission demanded implementation of a biometric entry-exit visa system. what does that mean? that means a biometric system where people are identified effectively through fingerprints or some other identifier. i have been through this for years. back when president bush was president and we worked with homeland security, governor ridge was the secretary of homeland security. i think at the end he was finally convinced, and i worked on him very hard. but he volunteered, the last day in office, to use a fingerprint biometric system. it should have already been done by the time president bush left office, but it wasn't, and it hasn't been done yet. we need a system that works. by the way, police officers have in their cars all over america computer-type screens where they can stop someone on the road, they can ask them to put their hand on the screen, and it reads their fingerprints. it checks the national crime information center to find out whether the person is wanted for murder in new york. he might have caught him in texas. it lets the officer know whether there are warrants out for these individuals. this is the way the system works in our country, and we need to use it with regard to people who come here on visas. it is an outrage that this hasn't been done, completed fully, and made operational years ago. it is an outrage. it is in the law of the united states. congress has funded money for this project and it has not yet been done. it will cost us in the future, as the 9/11 commission has so warned. the 9/11 commission demanded this system, and it is designed to track those entering and departing the united states on visas. by the way, almost half of the people, at least 40-plus percent now of individuals unlawfully in america entered on a visa. in other words, they didn't come across the border unlawfully. they came lawfully-- perhaps using false documents, but they got a visa. they came to the united states maybe lawfully, but they just did not return to their home country when the visa expired. my colleagues have to know no one is checking. we have no idea whether they left the country or stayed in the country. we do not have an operable exit visa system. this is so bizarre because it is not expensive. it can be implemented rapidly. it will work and give us valuable information that we must have if we are serious about this process, and we must be serious about the process. the individuals in france--i mentioned the ones in the united states--left the country, went through yemen, apparently, were trained in some sort of terrorist camp, and came back and executed their violent acts in france. so we have to do a better job of this, and we can do it. president obama's administration has refused to implement the entry- exit system as required by law. we have talked about this publicly and debated it for years. just last year the co-chairs of the 9/11 commission, in an evaluation of how well the recommendations they made back after 9/11 have been carried out--a 10-year review of how their report had been received and how much of it had been accomplished-- issued this written statement. without exit-tracking, our government does not know when a foreign visitor admitted to the united states on a temporary basis has overstayed his or her admission. here is the language. we put it on a chart because it is important that we understand this. without exit-tracking, our government does not know when a foreign visitor admitted to the united states on a temporary basis has overstayed his or her admission. had this system been in place before 9/11, we would have had a better chance of detecting the plotters before they struck. . . . there is no excuse for the fact that 13 years after 9/11 we do not have this much capability in place. amen. that is exactly correct. that is from ``reflections on the tenth anniversary of the 9/11 commission report,'' thomas h. kean and lee h. hamilton, in 2014. in fact, the original report said this: the department of homeland security, properly supported by the congress, should complete, as quickly as possible, a biometric entry-exit screening system. that was the report from 2004. it is a very important report. they went to great length to help this nation figure out what is the responsible thing to do to protect ourselves better from those attackers on 9/11, many of whom were visa overstayers. they didn't come across the border unlawfully; they came across on a lawful visa. some of them i think had false documentation to get that visa, but they came on a visa, for the most part lawfully, and did not go home as they were required to go home. they overstayed their visa. nobody knew they had overstayed. nobody made an inquiry about it. the ``tenth anniversary report card: the status of the 9/11 commission recommendations,'' by thomas h. kean and lee h. hamilton, 2011, said this: full deployment of the biometric exit component of us-visit should be a high priority. such a capability would have assisted law enforcement and intelligence officials in august and september 2001 in conducting a search for two of the 9/11 hijackers that were in the u.s. on expired visas. this would have helped. indeed, of course, those of us who have some experience in law enforcement know that when you get to one or two of the guys, the whole scheme may get disrupted, and we can penetrate the organization and break it up and stop crime from occurring. to me, it is mind boggling, as the commission leaders have told us, that we haven't completed this. i am told there are forces that don't like the exit visa system. they think it might slow things down a little bit. first, this is not correct. when you come into the country, you are clocked in and you are biometrically fingerprinted. what would you have to do when you leave? go to the airport, go in a certain line, go through, show your ticket, show your passport, put your hand on a biometric screener, you are read, and you are approved to leave. it is not going to take any massive amounts of time. one excuse after the other has slowed this down, and it is not acceptable. we have to do better. in fact, the administration has suspended enforcement of the visa system almost entirely. we have to understand, colleagues: if we don't have even an exit visa system where we know [[page s140]] who left the country, how do we know who overstayed and who stayed in the country? unless somebody overstays their visa and they are caught for speeding and the police officer identified that, i will ask colleagues, what happens? under the policy of this president of the united states, directed to the lowest officers in america, nothing happens. if the individual does not commit a serious felony, they will not be processed for deportation, even though they have come to the country on a promise to leave on a certain date and flatly refused to do so. this is not acceptable. if we don't have a system that has integrity, then everybody gets the message pretty soon: just get a visa, come to america, you never have to leave. if you don't get a felony charge against you, you are never going to be deported. this is the policy of this government at this very moment. it is hard for anybody to believe, but that is the truth. we have approximately 5 million visa overstays in the united states. but as the national ice-- immigration customs enforcement--officers council president chris crane has explained: ice agents are now prohibited from arresting illegal aliens solely on charges of illegal entry or visa overstay. what a dramatic statement that is. and not only visa overstays, they are prohibited from arresting and removing people who came across the border illegally. that is what he means by illegal entry or visa overstays. this of course removes a cornerstone of integrity in any law system. if we can't look people in the eye and say: we give you a visa, you have a 6-month visa, but at 6 months you have to return to your home country, and mean it, and say: eventually you will be apprehended and deported if you don't--then the system has no integrity. that is where we are today. unsurprisingly, abc news reported that the obama administration had lost track of 6,000 foreign students who had overstayed their visas and were of ``heightened concern.'' in other words, these 6,000 had some special concern in their background that made us worry about them, whether it was drugs or terrorism or whatever. of course they have lost sight of them. they are not attempting to find them. so the head of the union representing u.s. citizenship and immigration services officers, one of the three major components of the department of homeland security dealing with immigration, mr. ken palinkas, was explicit in his warning to us. it is remarkable what mr. crane has said and now what mr. palinkas has said: there is no doubt that there are already many individuals in the united states, on visas--expired or active--who are being targeted for radicalization or who already subscribe to radicalized views. many millions come legally to the u.s. through our wide open immigration policy every year--whether as temporary visitors, lifetime immigrants, refugees, asylum- seekers, foreign students, or recipients of our ``visa waiver program'' which allows people to come and go freely. yet our government cannot effectively track these foreign visitors and immigrants. this is the man whose officers do this job. they are the ones who approve the visas and manage this system. he went on to warn that the president's so-called executive amnesty would make the situation radically worse, saying: i write today to warn the general public that this situation is about to get exponentially worse--and more dangerous. . . . express your concern to your senators and congressmen before it is too late. it is a national security imperative to stop this executive amnesty. it sends exactly the wrong message. what it says is that if you can get into america--through the border, by boat, by plane, on a visa--any way you get into this country and pass the border, you are not going to be asked to leave unless you commit some felony--some serious felony, for that matter. many felonies don't qualify. and we have over 100,000 people who have committed serious felonies who have been released into america. we don't know where they are, and they are not going to be deported. we have to restore immigration enforcement, establish better controls and screening on immigration from high-risk regions of the world. we really should give more attention to that. it is perfectly legitimate. the visa system, the immigration system of the united states, should serve who? it should serve the interests of the american people. somebody doesn't have a constitutional right to come to america. the decision is whether america feels like it is in its interests. we have always accepted a large number of people. in fact, we have the largest immigration numbers of any nation in the world. we admit 1 million a year lawfully. when they come from high-risk areas of the world, terrorist states, we should indeed give more scrutiny to those applicants. census data shows that legal immigration to the united states from the middle east is one of the largest and fastest growing categories of new admittances. for the national security of the united states, it is imperative that congress block executive amnesty and restore essential enforcement, basic bread-and-butter law enforcement. anyone who claims to be concerned about our national security should be resolutely focused on this task. there is so much that can be done with relatively little difficulty if we have the leadership and will to get it done. it would be unthinkable for the president to veto the homeland security appropriations bill in order to continue this illegal and dangerous amnesty scheme during a time of growing threats abroad. again, let me say that this: the entry-exit visa system is an unappreciated, important part of american immigration law. it is critical to the national security of the united states, as the 9/11 commission has so stated on more than one occasion. we can do this. why is it not being done? what forces, what special interests, are interceding between the people of the united states, the national interests, and their special interests that block this kind of system? we can make it work. it is not that hard. we need a biometric system, and that system should be founded on the fingerprint. it took us a number of years, but i think the government has finally concluded it must be the fingerprint for a lot of reasons, one of which is if somebody got a visa to the united states and they committed a murder, an armed robbery, a terrorist act, a major fraud, and a warrant was issued for their arrest--if you don't clock it in at the airport, who knows when they are leaving? so this would pick it up and would pick up any warrants that might be outstanding for those individuals anywhere in the united states that are put in the ncic, national crime information center. that is the way the system should work. it is long overdue. in the course of the discussions we will have in the weeks and months to come about the necessity of fixing a broken immigration system, the entry- exit visa system has to be implemented. it is long overdue. we can make it happen. it is not that expensive. it is relatively inexpensive, actually, and it will make us much safer in the process. i yield the floor, and i suggest the absence of a quorum. the presiding officer. the clerk will call the roll. the assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. mr. sessions. madam president, i ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. the presiding officer. without objection, it is so ordered. mr. sessions. i ask unanimous consent that the time allotted to each side and utilized be counted against both sides equally during quorum calls. the presiding officer. without objection, it is so ordered. mr. sessions. i suggest the absence of a quorum. the presiding officer. the clerk will call the roll. the assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. mr. coats. madam president, i ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. the presiding officer. without objection, it is so ordered. mr. coats. madam president, here we are at the beginning of a new year and a new congress, and i think we all feel a responsibility to do what the american people voted for in the november 2014 election, which is to come together in this body and in this congress and work together to find sensible solutions to the very real problems facing americans. [[page s141]] it is no secret that the last 6 years have been pretty tough for a lot of people who are out of work or doing part-time work; kids graduating from high school, graduating from college, graduating from community schools, 2-year schools; going back and getting new training and still unable to find meaningful jobs; finding jobs that are part time, two or three of those together; parents trying to save money, pay the mortgage, save money to send the kids to postgraduate school. it has not been easy. so we have come to a point where we have legislation in a new session of congress, with commitments on a bipartisan basis to stand together, to work together, to try to find solutions, to get people back to work and get our economy moving again. now we come to the very first issue up for discussion and debate and hopefully passage in this new congress--the keystone pipeline. this is an issue that has been going on for 6 years. the president has been obstinate in his obstruction in letting this go forward, in making a decision. yet here we are, finally, with an opportunity to not only pass legislation which has passed the house of representatives, again, just last week with very significant bipartisan support--but now in the senate to take up this legislation and to move it forward tonight with this vote, to start the process to allow amendments, to allow debate, and to move forward and hopefully enjoy bipartisan support with over 60 votes and then move it to final passage and then send it to the president for, hopefully, signing. this project is the largest, ready-to-build infrastructure project in the united states. it supports tens of thousands of jobs. the estimate has been well over 42,000. it invests billions of dollars in the american economy. it increases revenue to states and local governments, all without spending one dime of taxpayer money. this is a private sector initiative that can be of great benefit to our country. it can provide meaningful jobs and has many benefits for us in the future. it is supported by democrats, by republicans, and by a number of labor unions. for instance, the indiana state building and construction trade council, which represents 75,000 working hoosiers in my state, reached out to me recently and asked me to support construction of the keystone pipeline, calling it ``an important job creation and energy security issue.'' they are right on the mark. they know i have been a longtime supporter of this effort, but they wanted to put it in writing. i am not sure it was necessary, and they weren't weighing this on the basis of republican or democrat, liberal or conservative; they were saying that this is good for us and we hope all of our senators can support it. we hope it passes. this is an initiative that puts our people to work. other labor unions, including the north america's building trade unions and the laborers' international union of north america support this project. i mentioned the president, for 6 years, has come up with more feeble excuses in terms of why he believes this should not go forward. the last excuse was: we are in a process here and the process has to go forward. that process was waiting, apparently, on the nebraska supreme court approval of the pipeline route through nebraska, and that was his excuse for why he would have to veto it. i am sure my colleagues now have the word that the nebraska supreme court has upheld state approval of the keystone pipeline. in fact, the president's own state department, in response to numerous calls for environmental studies-- all of which were used as an excuse for not going forward--the president's own state department has repeatedly approved this, saying it will not have a negative environmental imprint. so what could possibly be the reason the president remains intransigent on this particular issue, because every other box has been checked? we have to come down to the inevitable conclusion that it is all political, that an extreme environmental wing of the president's own party is simply putting untold pressure on him to not go forward with anything having to do with fossil fuels or providing energy security for america from our own resources. after all, a significant portion comes from montana and north dakota--and the last time i checked they are in the united states--and from our friendly neighbor to the north, canada. if this doesn't go through, we will keep importing large quantities of oil from the middle east. we know what complications there are in terms of securing that oil and how much volatility occurs there based on what is happening today in the middle east. so getting this product from our northern states of north dakota and montana and getting this product from our friend to the north, canada, simply makes a great deal of sense in terms of our energy security, our energy supplies, and lessening our reliance on the volatility that comes from getting oil from other sources. to conclude, let me just make it clear what it is we are trying to do. this will help the united states diversify its energy supply. it will offset our dependence on middle east oil. it will support tens of thousands of american jobs in construction. it will invest billions of dollars in the american economy. it will increase revenue to state and local governments. it will not harm our environment, as numerous studies have indicated--all these benefits without spending a dime of taxpayer money. so after 6 years of delay, procrastination, and evermore feeble excuses, it is time for the president to make a decision. soon he will have an opportunity to use that pen he so famously talked about not to sign a veto or to declare a veto but to sign a bill approving the keystone pipeline into law. i strongly support construction of this pipeline and i urge my colleagues to do the same. i yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum. the presiding officer. will the senator withhold his request? mr. coats. i certainly will. i didn't see my colleague. i am happy to do so. the presiding officer. the senator from virginia. mr. kaine. madam president, i am happy i was here for the comments of my colleague from indiana on the keystone pipeline and, similar to the senator from indiana, i am also happy to finally have this debate. the comments he made are very sincere and passionately believed. i accept that. i only challenge one aspect of the comments, which is the suggestion that opposition of keystone is feeble or only for political reasons. i am a pro-energy senator. the first bill i introduced in the 114th congress was a bill i am cosponsoring with senator barrasso of wyoming to expedite american exports of liquid natural gas, but i am an opponent of keystone on environmental and economic grounds, and i wish to spend a few minutes describing why. to begin with, it can probably be summed up in a question: why embrace dirty energy when america is in the midst of a clean energy revolution? that is a primary reason i oppose keystone. the united states, thank goodness, is on a clean energy roll. not only are we on a clean energy roll, we are on an energy production roll that is helping our economy, helping our trade deficit, and hurting some of our most significant global adversaries, notably russia and iran. we have embraced over the last few years a set of conservation and efficiency investments, probably most notably the increased cafe standards that have saved energy use in the vehicle sector as well as helped the american auto industry significantly rebound. our natural gas revolution, of which i am a strong supporter, has enabled american industry and consumers to get lower priced energy, and it has enabled us to lessen our dependence on dirtier fuels in the production of electric power and other aspects of our power usage. wind and solar and other noncarbon energy developments have rocketed ahead. nearly one- third of the energy that has been added to the american electricity grid since 2005 has been in the wind and solar area. we are one of the few nations in the world that in the period from 2005 to 2012 actually saw a reduction in our carbon emissions. we are on a clean energy roll. we are innovating for the world and we are selling technologies to the rest of the world and that is good for our economy as well as good for the environment. we are also asserting american energy leadership not just in the advances in clean energy but also in the significant advances in american energy production. i think we should feel [[page s142]] good about the fact that we are a country that has gone from being one of the greatest net importers of energy in the world to now a country that is going to be one of the greatest energy producers in the world, and in many energy areas we are now a net exporter. so emissions are going down. production and exports are going up. the other thing that is great for americans is that prices are going down. a barrel of oil right now is in the $50-a-barrel range, which is putting about $1,000 a year back into the pockets of an american family. it is helping american businesses, and it is imposing, as i mentioned earlier, some significant harm upon two of our most persistent global adversaries--iran and russia--that rely on energy exports to drive their economy. this energy revolution--higher production, greater economic efficiency, greater cleanliness--has all been happening without the keystone pipeline. it has all been happening without the united states embracing tar sands oil. we are going in the right direction now. i oppose the keystone pipeline because accelerating the use of tar sands oil turns us around. instead of going in the right direction to more production, more national security and greater emissions control, the keystone pipeline accelerates tar sands oil and takes us in the wrong direction. simply put, tar sands oil and the exploitation of that resource is a bad bet for the environment and, i believe, a bad bet for the economy. last month, december 2014, a magazine i really like that normally has a lot of articles about the outdoors, outside magazine, ran a lengthy article on the area of canada in alberta where tar sands are mined. the article is called ``the high cost of oil.'' to anyone who is interested in this debate--pro, con or undecided--go online to outside magazine, december 2014, ``the high cost of oil,'' and read what the mining of tar sands oil does to this part of canada and to this planet. tar sands oil is not like conventional gas or petroleum. tar sands oil, the mining and refining and production of it, produces about 15 to 20 percent more greenhouse gas emissions per unit of energy than conventional petroleum. natural gas produces dramatically less co 2 than conventional petroleum, but tar sands oil produces dramatically more. if you care about the emissions of co 2 -- and i think we should all care about the emissions of co 2 because i accept the science that says co 2 emissions cause significant climate effects--if you care about co 2 emissions, then tar sands oil is absolutely the worst thing that can be done. over the 2 years now that i have been in the senate, i have had a lot of folks come to me and talk to me about keystone. they never say a word about greenhouse gas or co 2 emissions--not a word. senator coats didn't say a word in his comments about co 2 or greenhouse gas emissions. i ask individuals, when they come and talk to me about keystone: what do you think about co 2 emissions? what do you think about the fact that tar sands oil is significantly more carbon dense than normal petroleum? the response i find myself getting is: i don't know; i am not a scientist. in fact, i heard that from an energy ceo who employs tons of scientists in his organizations: i don't know; i am not a scientist. the scientific consensus i believe is very clear. we have to do what we can--not drastically and dramatically but in an incremental way-- every day to bring down our co 2 emissions. i believe we need to do that in smart ways. yet, from an emissions standpoint, tar sands oil goes exactly in the wrong direction. it is not just co 2 emissions. tar sands oil also involves the mining of it. i would encourage you to read this article. it involves scraping up vast acreages of an arboreal forest in alberta to get to the tar sands underneath. so far, an area about the size of the state of rhode island has been completely despoiled to look like a moonscape to get to tar sands, and this will significantly accelerate the more tar sands are built. in the area of alberta where the mining and refining is taking place, there has been a dramatic increase in respiratory illness and other illnesses associated either with airborne emissions or with the contamination of the area's water supply. probably one of the most powerful things about the article is not the lengthy analysis, not the words, it is the pictures. the pictures in that article are staggering. when you see what has to be done to these arboreal forests to mine tar sands oil, you come back to this question: why would we embrace a dirtier technology when america is on a clean- energy revolution that is driving down prices, driving up production, and also driving down emissions. tar sands oil takes us in the wrong direction. it is not so much about the pipeline. we rely on pipelines in this country, but it is about the acceleration of the development of a resource that, frankly, just doesn't need to be developed. i will conclude and say this. some say--and i made this argument-- well, look, it is going to be mined anyway and refined anyway. if the pipeline doesn't go through the united states, it will go westward or eastward through canada or another direction. i am not completely sure that is correct. the article in outside discusses the fact that canadians, who know this better than anybody because they live in the neighborhood, are fighting against pipelines being built in canada. there is also the matter with oil now at a significantly lower price than it has been. even the economics of this tar sands oil, which is pretty expensive because of what you have to do to refine it, may not make any sense. but even if we set those arguments aside and somebody says to me, why shouldn't the united states just give the big green light to tar sands oil because somebody is going to get it, the reason i think we shouldn't is the united states is showing the world right now what it means to be an energy leader. with increased production, lower emissions, lower prices through innovation--through american innovation--we are showing the world what it means to be an energy leader. we are a leader because we have embraced a simple effort. i am not an engineer, but as i look at what happened in innovation in the last decade, the ethic we have embraced is: let's do it cleaner tomorrow than today. that is pretty simple. let's do it cleaner tomorrow than today--not dramatically cleaner. it doesn't have to turn day and night from today to tomorrow. let's just get a little bit cleaner tomorrow than today. that is what we have been doing as a nation. it has been increasing supply. it has been driving down demand. it has been driving down prices. it has been helping us control emissions. that is what we should keep doing. i am a pro-energy senator, but i am a deep skeptic about the use of tar sands oil. for that reason, i am glad we are going to have the debate. i think we should finally be at it. but i am going to oppose the keystone pipeline because tar sands oil is going backwards and not forwards. we are showing the world what it means to go forward, and that is the direction we should continue to go. i yield the floor, and i suggest the absence of a quorum. the presiding officer. the clerk will call the roll. the bill clerk proceeded to call the roll. ms. cantwell. i ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. the presiding officer (mr. coats). without objection, it is so ordered ms. cantwell. mr. president, we are going to be voting shortly on the motion to proceed to s. 1, the keystone xl pipeline. i am here to urge my colleagues to vote no on that motion to proceed. we had a couple of chances to come to the senate floor already today and last week and talk about the important issue of energy development in the united states and how we move our country forward with job creation and energy development. the president--we got to hear his remarks and certainly we respect people's points of view that this issue is an issue we have had a lot of time to discuss. mr. president, the issue is whether the american public and people in affected states have had a lot of time to talk about this issue and whether they have had a transparent process to talk about this issue. i ask unanimous consent to have printed in the record an article that [[page s143]] was in usa today whose headline is ``permit problems plague keystone xl pipeline's s.d. leg.'' there being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the record, as follows: [from usa today, jan. 7, 2015] permit problems plague keystone xl pipeline's s.d. leg (by john hultjhult) the south dakota public utilities commission on tuesday voted down a move by tribal and environmental groups to force a reboot to the keystone xl pipeline's state-level permitting process. ( http://www .argusleader.com/story/news/2015/01/06/sd-permit-keystone-xl- still-question/21359367/ ) puc commissioners said there are clear questions about whether south dakota's stretch of the massive and controversial project is still due the construction permit it earned in 2010, given a series of changes to its original scope. the 2014 version of the pipeline would be able to carry crude from north dakota, for example, along with the anticipated crude extracted from tar sands in alberta, canada. even so, commissioners ruled that forcing pipeline owner transcanada to start over without being offered a chance to explain how it could make those changes while meeting its old obligations would be a denial of due process. ``we need to go through the process to find out,'' commissioner chris nelson said. transcanada asked for re-certification of its 2010 construction permit in september. the company had to ask for re-certification because four years had passed since the permit was granted. the pipeline stalled as president obama chose tuesday to delay the issuance of a federal permit indefinitely, a move that has frustrated supporters, who say the project will add jobs and boost energy security. if completed, the keystone xl pipeline would release more than 800,000 barrels of oil a day. the gop-controlled senate is expected to take up the issue this week. in a new application for the 313 miles of pipeline planned for south dakota, the company notes 30 changes to the original project, including the addition of north dakota oil, minor route changes, alterations to construction plans and costs. the yankton sioux tribe filed a motion to dismiss the company's application based on those changes, saying the re- certification process is meant for projects that have been delayed, not those that have altered dramatically in scope. the permit was issued with a set of 50 conditions, which were based on the project as approved four years ago. thomasina real bird, a lawyer for the yankton sioux tribe, told commissioners that the changes to the pipeline are simply too significant to allow the company to apply for re- certification. the company isn't just asking to re-certify a stalled project, she said. ``they're going a step beyond, and that step is not allowed by law,'' real bird said. several others spoke in support of the yankton sioux tribe's motion to dismiss, including kimberly craven of the indigenous environmental network. ``i would urge the commission to start over,'' craven said. ``it's a new permit, a new ballgame.'' bill taylor, a lawyer for transcanada, told commissioners that re-certification is meant to determine whether delayed projects still fall within the scope of an old permit. dropping a re-certification request because a project changes renders the re-certification process pointless. keystone xl has changed, but taylor said the company is prepared to prove that it still meets each of the 50 conditions attached to its 2010 approval. the pipeline is still a pipeline, the product is the same, and the end result is more energy security for the u.s., taylor said. ``the current iteration of the project can and will meeting the conditions upon which the permit is issued,'' taylor said. the puc voted 3-0 to deny the motions to dismiss the application brought by the yankton sioux tribe and joined by others. the hearing on the merits of the re-certification is planned for may. ms. cantwell. this is an article that just recently appeared in the paper about how south dakota is bringing up objections to the pipeline, and they want to do due process with their public utility commission to make sure this project meets the criteria of environmental and safety concerns and security concerns that state wants to see met. the reason this is still an issue in south dakota is because part of the pipeline will go through south dakota. there have been many changes since the original proposal was put forth, and people in south dakota want to know exactly what these changes are and exactly how they will go through the process. in fact, one native american tribe representative who was objecting said: the company is not just asking to recertify its old project. they are going a step beyond that that is not allowed by law. so there are people who want them to go through the normal process because siting of a pipeline of this nature is of great concern to local residents, to property owners. i find it interesting that in the debate on this issue, we on this side of the aisle are the ones who are advocating and standing up for property owners to make sure there is not a taking of their property without a transparent process and input for that process because that is exactly what transpired here when the company, with the help of the state of nebraska, did not continue to proceed through their public service commission, their public utility commission, and instead tried to pass a law saying that the environmental review and security issues and oversight could be done by the governor. now, my colleagues who are governors know that when you are governor, you do not have the most transparent process. it is not as if citizens are going to come to hearings in the governor's office. it is not as though all of that is there for review. certainly those citizens do not have the ability to object and make sure they are getting the right compensation for their property and make sure issues of safety and security are addressed. so that is why some private property owners sued. because the legislature and the governor did not have the right to act; the law taking the power away from the utility commission and giving it to the governor was unconstitutional. the separation of powers is divided between the governor and their public service commission. it is the job of those utcs--utilities and transportation commissions around the country--to protect the interests of the public in the siting of these facilities. that this authority was now moved up through the legislature to the governor to decide all of that was clearly something that was not constitutional. i find it very interesting that four of the seven supreme court justices said, in fact, yes, that law passed by the legislature was not constitutional. so my question is, what is the hurry? now that this issue, based on standing and the other justices not deciding, has the process to move forward, congress feels some sort of urgency to be a siting commission and site a pipeline that has, no. 1, failed to go through the public process in the state of nebraska; no. 2, has a public process now being questioned in the state of south dakota, raising concern and urgency that those issues of the public be addressed; and no. 3, goes over what the president of the united states has said he wants to follow as a due process and make sure all the issues are brought to the table. i will remind my colleagues that if everybody here had their way, the president would have approved the original keystone xl pipeline route. congress thought they should stick their hands in the middle of this siting and land use issue and put in legislative language on a passed bill by the congress saying the president, if it was a national security interest, must decide and site the keystone pipeline. thank god those at the state department and the white house decided that was not such a smart idea because that current pipeline went through a major aquifer that served eight states and posed a great deal of concern to landowners, farmers, residents, and various individuals about that particular proposal. so if this body would have had its way before--those who support this pipeline--they would have pressured the president to approve what is now a defunct, horrible idea of what was proposed by transcanada. so now i ask my colleagues, are you sure all of the issues have been addressed here at the local level? because clearly there are people in nebraska and people in south dakota who do not think so. last i checked, our job is not to site pipelines; our job is to move our country forward on an energy strategy that will produce jobs, diversify our resources, and make the united states a leader in energy. i know my colleagues feel as if we will get a chance to address a lot of issues if we do move forward in a debate, and i am sure there will be many on many sides. i question whether we shouldn't be spending our time focusing on a bipartisan energy bill with lots of support on a whole myriad of [[page s144]] others issues we need to work on, as we did in 2007, to make sure we are helping in the transformation of energy policy moving forward that will produce a lot more jobs. this particular proposal, as many of my colleagues have pointed out, while there are some immediate construction jobs, the long-term jobs are very few compared to many of the other things we have been doing. i would also like to point out that since keystone has undertaken more development in the united states, that part of that development in the united states has also come into question lately. the security of the welding on the pipeline that has been done in the southern part of that pipeline has come into question, even to the point where i think the state department has said to the company: we are going to have a third-party validator approve whether you are actually meeting the standards we would like to see in the development of this pipeline in the united states. but there are many issues here about safety and security, as my colleagues can point out who have brought up these issues before. my colleague from michigan suffered one of the most devastating oilspills in her area. that was a tar sands oilspill. my colleague from michigan, senator stabenow, has actually flown over that oilspill and cited that it took 4 years and $1.2 billion to clean it up and that the tar sands sunk to the bottom of the river and the river had to be dredged. so this is something my colleagues may not quite understand, that the tar sands, even according to the commandant of the coast guard--we do not really have a solution for its cleanup when it spills in water. that is why i want to make sure that tar sands pay into the oilspill liability trust fund, as any other oil source does, so that we can make sure we are planning for the future and for getting help and response for any of these oilspills that could occur in the future. but needless to say michigan and the kalamazoo spill taught our nation how dangerous this oilspill process could be. so why are we prematurely trying to cut off the debate on this issue at the local government level and say that we in congress know better than these utility and transportation commissions and their transparent siting process for the american public? why do we somehow know better that this is where a pipeline should go and how the process should work? so i hope my colleagues will stop and think more about how transcanada proposal. i know some of my colleagues like to talk about being a good neighbor, and i like to say, you know, we in the pacific northwest consider british columbia a very big friend and neighbor. there are many times that people talk about two provinces and five states working together as an organization on economic issues. so that structure has been in place for many years in the pacific northwest. but the people of british columbia have not been a big supporter of tar sands oil expansion. something like 60 percent of the public of british columbia opposes having a tar sands pipeline cross their province. transcanada knows they are not going to be successful in getting this oil from alberta across british columbia out to the pacific because the people of british columbia do not want it. so, of course, why not come to the united states? why not ask them if they want a pipeline going through the middle of their country? british columbia premier christy clark laid out five principles that ought to have been met in order to site a pipeline of tar sands. those conditions have not been met, and the province is officially opposed to the pipeline. so there was a lot of opposition and concern there. i will note for my colleagues that when a public utc--a utility commission or public service commission--when they evaluate a project, they have to look at the environmental impact, and that is water supply, wildlife, vegetation, plants, and they have to look at the economic and social impact. they need to look at alternative routes, the impact to future development near the pipeline, and the views of cities and counties. again, i will note that i think all of those are a part of having a transparent process instead of a political process on siting. so i am not for moving forward on what i consider special interest legislation, congress siting for a special interest--this transcanada company--a project that even people in canada have raised suspicion about. i hope that we will allow the president to still do due process on such an important issue of environmental concern and that we will not start setting a standard that if you want to short-circuit the eminent domain and protection rights of individuals, we will just bypass all of that at the local level and somehow go to congress and they will get that done for you. i think that is a very bad message. i hope my colleagues will turn down this legislation, i hope that we can move on to other energy issues that will help our country diversify and move forward in the future. i yield the floor, and i suggest the absence of a quorum. the presiding officer. the clerk will call the roll. the assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. mr. hoeven. mr. president, i ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. the presiding officer. without objection, it is so ordered. mr. hoeven. mr. president, i rise to again talk about the keystone xl pipeline approval bill. we will be voting on cloture on the motion to proceed in about 15 minutes or so. i believe we have a bipartisan majority. we have 60 sponsors of the legislation, and we will have some others join us in voting to proceed on the bill. that is important, not just because this is bipartisan legislation, important energy legislation for our country but, as i have said before, this is an opportunity for all the members of this body-- republican and democrat--to come forward with their amendments in an open amendment process and really have an energy debate. let's talk about the energy future of this country and let's bring forward amendments to this legislation that can be good amendments and help us build the right kind of energy plan for our country. what i would point out about this keystone pipeline approval bill is that as we work to build an energy plan for this country, as we work to produce more energy so we are truly energy secure--a lot of people call it energy independence--but the way i define it is energy security for our country where we produce more energy than we consume, so we control our destiny. if we produce more energy than we consume, then we control our destiny when it comes to energy. but to do that, we would not only have to produce that energy, we have to have the infrastructure to move it safely, cost effectively, and efficiently from where it is produced to where it is consumed. we have this incredible opportunity with canada to have north american energy security. we are working with our closest friend and ally in the world. we together produce more energy than we consume, and we have the infrastructure in place to move it from where it is produced to where it is consumed in our country. now we control our own destiny. when it comes to opec or when it comes to russia or when it comes to china, when it comes to geopolitical events that affect the price of energy, we are in a strong situation. look at what is going on in western europe right now. look at what is going on in ukraine. they are in a tremendously difficult situation because they are dependent on russia for their energy, for their natural gas, at a time when vladimir putin is undertaking very aggressive action in europe. he is invading ukraine. he has taken crimea. he continues his aggressive efforts. and at the same time the european union is trying to support ukraine, ukraine is fighting with russia. this is a situation where ukraine is depending upon russia for its energy. does america really want to be in that kind of a situation in the future when we have real problems in the middle east, when we have real problems with fundamentalists, islamic jihadists conducting terror on our people and other freedom-loving people around the world? do we want to be in a situation where we continue to depend upon the middle east for our oil? well, the answer to that is no. the american people resoundingly answer that question--no. [[page s145]] also, the american people well know that the reason gas prices at the pump today are lower is not because opec just decided to give us a christmas present. they know the reason energy prices are low in this country, that when they pull up to the pump they are saving money, is because we are producing so much more energy in this country and we are getting more energy from canada. unless opec cuts back their production, more supply drives prices down. so it is not only about low prices now, it is about making sure we are able to control our energy destiny in the future. we have to take a long-term view. it is working. of the 18 million barrels of oil a day this country consumes, we now produce 11 million barrels in this country. we are up to 11 million barrels that we produce in this country of the total we consume, so we are still importing about 7 million barrels a day. canada is now up to 3 million of those 7 million barrels, so we are down to only importing about 4 million barrels a day, but if we keep working at this, we can continue to produce more in this country. canada's production is continuing to grow. and if we build the infrastructure, we can make sure that we control that energy--north american energy security. that means not only now do our consumers and small businesses and our whole nation benefit from lower energy prices, lower gas prices at the pump, but we have that ability to make sure we control our destiny and that we benefit in the future. let's not repeat the mistakes of the past where we return to this dependency on opec down the road because we haven't built the infrastructure, we haven't worked with canada, and we haven't brought our domestic industry to north america so that we truly are energy secure. if we don't build the necessary infrastructure, if we block the necessary infrastructure, we can't build that energy plan for the future. i have heard my counterparts, some of the critics, say: well, it is not up to us to issue a building permit for infrastructure. really? so you mean it is the president's job and it is congress's job to block critical energy that will get us to energy security? our job is to block it? our job is to prevent the very infrastructure we need to build energy security for this country, to block the private investment, the $8 billion that private companies want to spend to build this infrastructure, to create jobs, to produce more energy in north america, and to help make this country's energy security? the president's job and this body's job is to block the ability of our country and canada to build this necessary infrastructure? well, i don't think so. if you want to put it in terms of: oh, well, we are not supposed to issue a building permit--really? so our job is to prevent the building of critical infrastructure even when it does not cost one single penny--not one penny--of government money? this is almost $8 billion of private investment that will generate hundreds of millions of dollars of revenue--state, local, and federal. every state on the route has approved it. there is an idea somehow we are jumping the gun after 6 years? let's see, it has been in process for 6 years. every state on the route has approved it. we are not spending any federal money. we are saying our job as a congress and the president is to block that kind of investment, block that kind of job creation, block that kind of energy development, and block our ability to get to energy security for this country. then there is this argument: oh, well, it is transcanada. it is one company. it is only one company, so it really doesn't matter. really? well, if you were a company--a canadian company or a u.s. company--and you were about to build infrastructure so that we could continue to produce more energy in this country, would you do it? if, in spite of the process that the federal government has to approve this project, where all of the requirements have been met--not once, but over and over again--and congress and the president continue to block your ability to build that infrastructure, are you going to jump up and spend billions of dollars and do it? i doubt it. and isn't that really what this is all about? that is what it is about, isn't it? it is for the folks, for the extreme environmental groups that don't want the development of fossil fuels--they are going to block it. this is sending the message and making sure they shut her down here. that has to be music to opec's ears. i have to believe that opec is going: boy, that is great; they are not going to build the infrastructure in their country to produce the energy. that is going to keep opec in business. there is another country that i think will be very pleased, really excited, if this project gets blocked, and that is china. china is so anxious to get this oil, they are trying to buy that production in canada. because, make no mistake, if the energy doesn't come to the united states, it is going somewhere else, and it is most likely going to china. so when we get back in that situation down the road when oil prices move back up, energy demand goes back up, and we have prevented our industry from growing--and canada is sending all the oil to china, and we have to go back hat in hand to opec, venezuela, and all of these countries, remember---- the presiding officer. the senator's time has expired. mr. hoeven. i ask unanimous consent to continue for 5 minutes. the presiding officer. is there objection? ms. cantwell. reserving the right to object. is the vote scheduled for 4 minutes from now? the presiding officer. yes, the vote is scheduled for 5:30 p.m. ms. cantwell. i am happy if the senator speaks until the time of the vote, but i think we should keep to the vote schedule. mr. hoeven. what time is the vote scheduled? the presiding officer. the vote is scheduled at 5:30 p.m. that would leave the senator 2 minutes. mr. hoeven. i note the presence of the chairman of the energy committee. i defer to her for some time if she wishes to speak before the vote. that would be my question, whether we could get maybe a couple of minutes for that purpose. i can certainly wrap up in a couple of minutes. ms. murkowski. mr. president, i defer to my colleague, the sponsor of this legislation, senator hoeven from north dakota, to conclude his remarks within the remaining time so that we can begin our vote at 5:30 p.m. we appreciate his leadership on this bill. the presiding officer. the senator has 1 minute remaining. mr. hoeven. i will wrap up on this note. let's not get back into the same predicament we have gotten ourselves into before. let's build this vital energy infrastructure so we can develop energy security for our country, together with canada. the other point i want to make is on the environmental point: no significant environmental impact. that is the finding of the obama administration's environmental impact statement done by the state department. that is their own report: no significant environmental impact. i look forward to having more discussion on the environmental aspects as well. i urge my colleagues to vote in favor of this legislation. cloture motion the presiding officer. all time having expired, pursuant to rule xxii, the chair lays before the senate the pending cloture motion, which the clerk will state. the assistant legislative clerk read as follows: cloture motion we, the undersigned senators, in accordance with the provisions of rule xxii of the standing rules of the senate, do hereby move to bring to a close debate on the pending motion to proceed to s. 1, a bill to approve the keystone xl pipeline. mitch mcconnell, lisa murkowski, chuck grassley, richard burr, tim scott, john boozman, ron johnson, lindsey graham, james lankford, james m. inhofe, dean heller, rand paul, kelly ayotte, bill cassidy, john cornyn, david vitter, john hoeven. the presiding officer. by unanimous consent, the mandatory quorum call has been waived. the question is, is it the sense of the senate that debate on the motion to [[page s146]] proceed to s. 1, a bill to approve the keystone xl pipeline, shall be brought to a close?

CREC-2015-01-12-pt1-PgS146-2,CREC-2015-01-12,114,KEYSTONE XL PIPELINE,"[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 5 (Monday, January 12, 2015)] [Senate] [Pages S146-S147] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] KEYSTONE XL PIPELINE Mr. TOOMEY. Mr. President, first, I congratulate my colleagues Senator Hoeven and Senator Manchin, the cosponsors of this legislation. I also commend the energy committee chair, Senator Murkowski. This is important legislation. It is long overdue that we take this up, but it is encouraging that we finally are doing that. So I commend them for that. Mr. President, the Senate is not in order. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate will be in order. Could Senators please take their conversations out of the Chamber. The Senate will be in order. The Senator is recognized. Mr. TOOMEY. Thank you, Mr. President. A couple of things about the Keystone Pipeline, and then I wish to talk about an amendment I am going to be offering. First, I think one of the encouraging things about approving this pipeline is the benefits for the environment. The fact is we will be moving oil on a pipeline which is a cleaner, safer way to do it than any available alternative. That is good news. It is good news that it is going to create jobs across our country. The State Department has estimated 42,000 jobs in the development of this pipeline. That is terrific news for everyone who is going to get a chance to benefit from that work. Clearly it is going to reduce our dependence on non-North American oil, which can only be good from a geopolitical point of view as well as an economic point of view. Of course, the fact is this legislation has bipartisan support and has for a long time. It received 31 Democratic votes in the House, 14 Democratic votes in the Senate, as well as every Republican Senator the last time it was brought up. It is strongly supported by the labor community because they recognize the benefits of the jobs it will create, and I urge my colleagues to support this important legislation. I also would like to take a moment to thank Leader McConnell for doing exactly what he said he would do and what many of us said we needed to do in this Chamber, which is to reopen this body--reopen it and have debate and put legislation on the floor and open it for amendment. Let's have a discussion. Let's change policy in this country in ways that will be constructive. We are beginning this process now as we said we would, and I think that is terrific and I intend to take advantage of the opportunity. I have several amendments I am going to file and I intend to bring up with respect to this legislation. One is going to be an amendment that will encourage a transition of our Federal Government's vehicle fleet from the current practice of burning gasoline mostly, and I encourage the adoption of natural gas as an alternative fuel because natural gas is cleaner, it is domestic, it is actually cheaper. Without any government subsidy or taxpayer help, natural gas is a cheaper source of fuel. We have a staggering quantity. The United States is the world's No. 1 producer of natural gas. We have 2.2 quadrillion cubic feet of natural gas. That is too big a number for me to wrap my brain around, but let's put it this way: That is the gas we know of, and it is enough to last the next 85 years, based on any plausible projection of our use. It is a staggering amount. I have another amendment that also has bipartisan support. I thank Senator Feinstein, Senators Flake and Manchin for supporting the effort to repeal the corn ethanol mandate in our fuel. This is a very bad policy that we have had for far too long. It is time to end this mandate that we grow corn and use it to burn in our gas tanks. It is a practice that is bad for the environment. It raises the cost of filling our tanks. It raises the cost of food because so much of our corn production goes into this, and it is not good for our engines. There is no good reason to continue this, and I look forward to having the debate that will enable us to repeal the corn ethanol mandate. But the amendment I wish to talk about is another bipartisan amendment. I thank Senator Casey for being the Democratic cosponsor for this amendment, and I thank Senator Hatch for joining me. This is an amendment that will preserve an important, environmentally beneficial source of alternative energy that we have especially in Pennsylvania and West Virginia, and it is under threat by two new rules that have been proposed by the EPA. Let me give a little bit of background as to why we have gotten to this place. In Pennsylvania and West Virginia we have been mining coal for well over a century, and for many of the decades, especially in the early years of our coal development, we took the high-energy density coal and our coal miners sold it to the steel industry where it was used in the manufacturing process of making steel, and the low-energy coal was left in piles--huge piles--actually mountains. It is often referred to as waste coal. The first photograph illustrates one of these waste coal piles. It is in Nanty Glo in Cambria County, PA. It is one of many piles or, as I say, mountains throughout Pennsylvania and West Virginia. The Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection estimates that there are 2 billion tons of waste coal such as this covering 180,000 acres in Pennsylvania alone. Think about that. It is a massive scale because of over a century of legacy of coal mining. Some of these piles are literally in people's backyards. [[Page S147]] Here we can see the people who live literally within a stone's throw--if you have a reasonably good arm--within a stone's throw you can reach this pile. That is also Nanty Glo in Cambria County. There are people who live within a couple of hundred feet. What is the problem with these mountains? The problem with these mountains of coal is it rains on them, and when it rains the runoff is horrendous. It looks like this. It looks like this in every one of these mountains of waste coal everywhere that one exists, every time it rains. In 2003 in an op-ed entitled ``The Benefits of Waste Coal,'' former Democratic Governor of Pennsylvania Ed Rendell's Department of Environmental Protection secretary, whose name is Kathleen McGinty, wrote: ``For years these piles sat abandoned, generating iron, manganese and aluminum pollution that discharged as runoff into Pennsylvania's waterways.'' That is exactly what happens when these piles just sit here. In 2011 the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection report states: Coal refuse piles that are not removed (i.e. burned for fuel) generally create severe acid mine drainage, with pH in the 2.5 range . . . A pH that high, by the way, is somewhere between the intensity of stomach acid and hydrochloric acid. That kind of acidic chemical running into our waters is enormously damaging. Slide No. 4 is another depiction of exactly what happens when rainwater runs through these piles and finds its way into the streams, rivers, ponds, and lakes of Pennsylvania. It pollutes hundreds of miles of rivers and streams. In 2007 former Democratic Governor of Pennsylvania, Ed Rendell said: These piles are domestic energy sources that have significant value when put into production in CFB cogeneration plants. When left on the ground, waste coal presents a grave environmental threat. Runoff from these piles contributes to the ``abandoned mine drainage'' that is the second leading water pollution problem in the Commonwealth, literally killing all life in some 2,000 stream miles in Pennsylvania. But that is not all. Photo No. 5 shows something else that happens with these piles. They catch fire. They spontaneously combust. It could be from lightning, carelessness, and sometimes it is unknown, but they catch fire. This particular photo is from Fell Township in Lackawanna County, PA. The pile caught fire in December of 2013. It burned for over a year. It is very hard to put these fires out. It burned out of control with, obviously, no ability to do anything about the pollutants that are being released by the combustion because it is completely uncontrolled. We think the fire went out in January, but authorities are still not certain that it may not be smoldering somewhere below the surface. By the way, this mountain is 600 feet from residential housing. What is the effect of this kind of combustion on the residents in that area? How much of this will burn? Maybe some people think this is just a freak incident. Not really, the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection estimates that 6.6 million tons of waste coal burns each year--unintended, uncontrolled, but it is burning--and in the process it emits 9 million tons of carbon dioxide and many tons of other uncontrolled air pollution. What about cleaning all of this up? The costs would be absolutely staggering. Again, former Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection Secretary McGinty estimated that it costs between $20,000 and $40,000 to reclaim just one acre of waste coal. We have hundreds of thousands of acres of waste coal. The Pennsylvania General Assembly has estimated it would cost approximately $15 billion to remediate Pennsylvania's abandoned mine set. That is the bad news. The good news is the market has figured out a solution to address this matter. The free market has developed a way to systematically eliminate these mountains of waste coal, and for decades we have had powerplants designed specifically for the purpose of burning this coal and doing so in a controlled and regulated fashion. They have removed 210 million tons of waste coal and used it to produce electricity. They have remediated over 8,000 acres. They have generated 1.769 gigawatts of electricity, which is enough to power 1.3 million homes, and in the process the generation of electricity from this waste coal has directly resulted in creating 1,200 jobs. In the past, the EPA has always acknowledged the benefits of systematically eliminating these mountains of waste coal and doing so by generating electricity. In fact, I will quote a report from the EPA in 2011 that says this: ``Because of the unique environmental benefits that coal refuse-fired EGUs provide, these units warrant special consideration.'' The problem I am here to address is that there are two new rules passed by the EPA that would bring an end to the systemic elimination of these mountains because these rules are prohibitive. It is not possible for the waste coal powerplants to comply with these rules, so they would all be shut down and we would be left with these piles indefinitely, which would mar our landscape and pollute our water and air. The two specific rules that would do this--the cross-State air pollution rule is very likely to have the effect of imposing absolutely unattainable goals on waste coal powerplants, and the utility MACT rule establishes new and very stringent emission controls and a whole new generation of very stringent regulations that this industry cannot meet. If these rules go into effect--and they are scheduled to go into effect later this year--then waste coal and electric generation ends, and these plants close. As a result, we lose the electric power they have been generating, the 1,200 jobs they sustain, and the low-cost energy that is reliable and domestic. We will end up with a more serious air pollution problem when the spontaneous combustion continues, and we will have an ongoing problem with water and air pollution as the nearby streams and water table will be polluted. That is why Senator Casey, Senator Hatch, and I have joined together to offer an amendment to this legislation that will exempt the waste coal powerplants from the most onerous and prohibitive aspects of these new rules. With respect to utility MACT, we would retain all of the regulatory limits on mercury, chromium, nickel, and other heavy metals, but it would exempt the waste coal plants from the cross-State air pollution rules, and it would allow these plants to continue remediating these waste coal sites. I wish to stress that it is important to point out that all of the existing regulations that have long been in effect will remain in effect. What we are talking about are the two new rules that would be guaranteed to shut down the industry. Those two rules would not go into effect with respect to the waste coal electric generation. The fact is if our amendment is adopted and becomes law, we will be helping our environment by continuing to systematically eliminate these blights. I want more success stories like the one in this photograph. This photo was taken in Nesquehoning in Carbon County, PA. The first photo shows what the ground looked like when the waste coal was piled up. The second photo shows what happens after it has been consumed and the land has been restored. This happened precisely because there is a nearby waste coal powerplant that was able to take this coal, generate electricity for us to use, and restore the land to a much safer, much more environmentally friendly, and much more attractive environment. We need to keep these plants operating. It is about improving our environment, it is about keeping people working, it is about the low- cost, reliable electricity that we have from it, and I urge my colleagues to support this amendment. With that, I yield the floor. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 5 (Monday, January 12, 2015)] [Senate] [Pages S146-S147] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] KEYSTONE XL PIPELINE Mr. TOOMEY. Mr. President, first, I congratulate my colleagues Senator Hoeven and Senator Manchin, the cosponsors of this legislation. I also commend the energy committee chair, Senator Murkowski. This is important legislation. It is long overdue that we take this up, but it is encouraging that we finally are doing that. So I commend them for that. Mr. President, the Senate is not in order. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate will be in order. Could Senators please take their conversations out of the Chamber. The Senate will be in order. The Senator is recognized. Mr. TOOMEY. Thank you, Mr. President. A couple of things about the Keystone Pipeline, and then I wish to talk about an amendment I am going to be offering. First, I think one of the encouraging things about approving this pipeline is the benefits for the environment. The fact is we will be moving oil on a pipeline which is a cleaner, safer way to do it than any available alternative. That is good news. It is good news that it is going to create jobs across our country. The State Department has estimated 42,000 jobs in the development of this pipeline. That is terrific news for everyone who is going to get a chance to benefit from that work. Clearly it is going to reduce our dependence on non-North American oil, which can only be good from a geopolitical point of view as well as an economic point of view. Of course, the fact is this legislation has bipartisan support and has for a long time. It received 31 Democratic votes in the House, 14 Democratic votes in the Senate, as well as every Republican Senator the last time it was brought up. It is strongly supported by the labor community because they recognize the benefits of the jobs it will create, and I urge my colleagues to support this important legislation. I also would like to take a moment to thank Leader McConnell for doing exactly what he said he would do and what many of us said we needed to do in this Chamber, which is to reopen this body--reopen it and have debate and put legislation on the floor and open it for amendment. Let's have a discussion. Let's change policy in this country in ways that will be constructive. We are beginning this process now as we said we would, and I think that is terrific and I intend to take advantage of the opportunity. I have several amendments I am going to file and I intend to bring up with respect to this legislation. One is going to be an amendment that will encourage a transition of our Federal Government's vehicle fleet from the current practice of burning gasoline mostly, and I encourage the adoption of natural gas as an alternative fuel because natural gas is cleaner, it is domestic, it is actually cheaper. Without any government subsidy or taxpayer help, natural gas is a cheaper source of fuel. We have a staggering quantity. The United States is the world's No. 1 producer of natural gas. We have 2.2 quadrillion cubic feet of natural gas.

It is about improving our environment, it is about keeping people working, it is about the low- cost, reliable electricity that we have from it, and I urge my colleagues to support this amendment. With that, I yield the floor. ____________________",package_114_129.csv,13431,13431,13499,"[congressional record volume 161, number 5 (monday, january 12, 2015)] [senate] [pages s146-s147] from the congressional record online through the government publishing office [ www.gpo.gov ] keystone xl pipeline mr. toomey. mr. president, first, i congratulate my colleagues senator hoeven and senator manchin, the cosponsors of this legislation. i also commend the energy committee chair, senator murkowski. this is important legislation. it is long overdue that we take this up, but it is encouraging that we finally are doing that. so i commend them for that. mr. president, the senate is not in order. the presiding officer. the senate will be in order. could senators please take their conversations out of the chamber. the senate will be in order. the senator is recognized. mr. toomey. thank you, mr. president. a couple of things about the keystone pipeline, and then i wish to talk about an amendment i am going to be offering. first, i think one of the encouraging things about approving this pipeline is the benefits for the environment. the fact is we will be moving oil on a pipeline which is a cleaner, safer way to do it than any available alternative. that is good news. it is good news that it is going to create jobs across our country. the state department has estimated 42,000 jobs in the development of this pipeline. that is terrific news for everyone who is going to get a chance to benefit from that work. clearly it is going to reduce our dependence on non-north american oil, which can only be good from a geopolitical point of view as well as an economic point of view. of course, the fact is this legislation has bipartisan support and has for a long time. it received 31 democratic votes in the house, 14 democratic votes in the senate, as well as every republican senator the last time it was brought up. it is strongly supported by the labor community because they recognize the benefits of the jobs it will create, and i urge my colleagues to support this important legislation. i also would like to take a moment to thank leader mcconnell for doing exactly what he said he would do and what many of us said we needed to do in this chamber, which is to reopen this body--reopen it and have debate and put legislation on the floor and open it for amendment. let's have a discussion. let's change policy in this country in ways that will be constructive. we are beginning this process now as we said we would, and i think that is terrific and i intend to take advantage of the opportunity. i have several amendments i am going to file and i intend to bring up with respect to this legislation. one is going to be an amendment that will encourage a transition of our federal government's vehicle fleet from the current practice of burning gasoline mostly, and i encourage the adoption of natural gas as an alternative fuel because natural gas is cleaner, it is domestic, it is actually cheaper. without any government subsidy or taxpayer help, natural gas is a cheaper source of fuel. we have a staggering quantity. the united states is the world's no. 1 producer of natural gas. we have 2.2 quadrillion cubic feet of natural gas. that is too big a number for me to wrap my brain around, but let's put it this way: that is the gas we know of, and it is enough to last the next 85 years, based on any plausible projection of our use. it is a staggering amount. i have another amendment that also has bipartisan support. i thank senator feinstein, senators flake and manchin for supporting the effort to repeal the corn ethanol mandate in our fuel. this is a very bad policy that we have had for far too long. it is time to end this mandate that we grow corn and use it to burn in our gas tanks. it is a practice that is bad for the environment. it raises the cost of filling our tanks. it raises the cost of food because so much of our corn production goes into this, and it is not good for our engines. there is no good reason to continue this, and i look forward to having the debate that will enable us to repeal the corn ethanol mandate. but the amendment i wish to talk about is another bipartisan amendment. i thank senator casey for being the democratic cosponsor for this amendment, and i thank senator hatch for joining me. this is an amendment that will preserve an important, environmentally beneficial source of alternative energy that we have especially in pennsylvania and west virginia, and it is under threat by two new rules that have been proposed by the epa. let me give a little bit of background as to why we have gotten to this place. in pennsylvania and west virginia we have been mining coal for well over a century, and for many of the decades, especially in the early years of our coal development, we took the high-energy density coal and our coal miners sold it to the steel industry where it was used in the manufacturing process of making steel, and the low-energy coal was left in piles--huge piles--actually mountains. it is often referred to as waste coal. the first photograph illustrates one of these waste coal piles. it is in nanty glo in cambria county, pa. it is one of many piles or, as i say, mountains throughout pennsylvania and west virginia. the pennsylvania department of environmental protection estimates that there are 2 billion tons of waste coal such as this covering 180,000 acres in pennsylvania alone. think about that. it is a massive scale because of over a century of legacy of coal mining. some of these piles are literally in people's backyards. [[page s147]] here we can see the people who live literally within a stone's throw--if you have a reasonably good arm--within a stone's throw you can reach this pile. that is also nanty glo in cambria county. there are people who live within a couple of hundred feet. what is the problem with these mountains? the problem with these mountains of coal is it rains on them, and when it rains the runoff is horrendous. it looks like this. it looks like this in every one of these mountains of waste coal everywhere that one exists, every time it rains. in 2003 in an op-ed entitled ``the benefits of waste coal,'' former democratic governor of pennsylvania ed rendell's department of environmental protection secretary, whose name is kathleen mcginty, wrote: ``for years these piles sat abandoned, generating iron, manganese and aluminum pollution that discharged as runoff into pennsylvania's waterways.'' that is exactly what happens when these piles just sit here. in 2011 the pennsylvania department of environmental protection report states: coal refuse piles that are not removed (i.e. burned for fuel) generally create severe acid mine drainage, with ph in the 2.5 range . . . a ph that high, by the way, is somewhere between the intensity of stomach acid and hydrochloric acid. that kind of acidic chemical running into our waters is enormously damaging. slide no. 4 is another depiction of exactly what happens when rainwater runs through these piles and finds its way into the streams, rivers, ponds, and lakes of pennsylvania. it pollutes hundreds of miles of rivers and streams. in 2007 former democratic governor of pennsylvania, ed rendell said: these piles are domestic energy sources that have significant value when put into production in cfb cogeneration plants. when left on the ground, waste coal presents a grave environmental threat. runoff from these piles contributes to the ``abandoned mine drainage'' that is the second leading water pollution problem in the commonwealth, literally killing all life in some 2,000 stream miles in pennsylvania. but that is not all. photo no. 5 shows something else that happens with these piles. they catch fire. they spontaneously combust. it could be from lightning, carelessness, and sometimes it is unknown, but they catch fire. this particular photo is from fell township in lackawanna county, pa. the pile caught fire in december of 2013. it burned for over a year. it is very hard to put these fires out. it burned out of control with, obviously, no ability to do anything about the pollutants that are being released by the combustion because it is completely uncontrolled. we think the fire went out in january, but authorities are still not certain that it may not be smoldering somewhere below the surface. by the way, this mountain is 600 feet from residential housing. what is the effect of this kind of combustion on the residents in that area? how much of this will burn? maybe some people think this is just a freak incident. not really, the pennsylvania department of environmental protection estimates that 6.6 million tons of waste coal burns each year--unintended, uncontrolled, but it is burning--and in the process it emits 9 million tons of carbon dioxide and many tons of other uncontrolled air pollution. what about cleaning all of this up? the costs would be absolutely staggering. again, former pennsylvania department of environmental protection secretary mcginty estimated that it costs between $20,000 and $40,000 to reclaim just one acre of waste coal. we have hundreds of thousands of acres of waste coal. the pennsylvania general assembly has estimated it would cost approximately $15 billion to remediate pennsylvania's abandoned mine set. that is the bad news. the good news is the market has figured out a solution to address this matter. the free market has developed a way to systematically eliminate these mountains of waste coal, and for decades we have had powerplants designed specifically for the purpose of burning this coal and doing so in a controlled and regulated fashion. they have removed 210 million tons of waste coal and used it to produce electricity. they have remediated over 8,000 acres. they have generated 1.769 gigawatts of electricity, which is enough to power 1.3 million homes, and in the process the generation of electricity from this waste coal has directly resulted in creating 1,200 jobs. in the past, the epa has always acknowledged the benefits of systematically eliminating these mountains of waste coal and doing so by generating electricity. in fact, i will quote a report from the epa in 2011 that says this: ``because of the unique environmental benefits that coal refuse-fired egus provide, these units warrant special consideration.'' the problem i am here to address is that there are two new rules passed by the epa that would bring an end to the systemic elimination of these mountains because these rules are prohibitive. it is not possible for the waste coal powerplants to comply with these rules, so they would all be shut down and we would be left with these piles indefinitely, which would mar our landscape and pollute our water and air. the two specific rules that would do this--the cross-state air pollution rule is very likely to have the effect of imposing absolutely unattainable goals on waste coal powerplants, and the utility mact rule establishes new and very stringent emission controls and a whole new generation of very stringent regulations that this industry cannot meet. if these rules go into effect--and they are scheduled to go into effect later this year--then waste coal and electric generation ends, and these plants close. as a result, we lose the electric power they have been generating, the 1,200 jobs they sustain, and the low-cost energy that is reliable and domestic. we will end up with a more serious air pollution problem when the spontaneous combustion continues, and we will have an ongoing problem with water and air pollution as the nearby streams and water table will be polluted. that is why senator casey, senator hatch, and i have joined together to offer an amendment to this legislation that will exempt the waste coal powerplants from the most onerous and prohibitive aspects of these new rules. with respect to utility mact, we would retain all of the regulatory limits on mercury, chromium, nickel, and other heavy metals, but it would exempt the waste coal plants from the cross-state air pollution rules, and it would allow these plants to continue remediating these waste coal sites. i wish to stress that it is important to point out that all of the existing regulations that have long been in effect will remain in effect. what we are talking about are the two new rules that would be guaranteed to shut down the industry. those two rules would not go into effect with respect to the waste coal electric generation. the fact is if our amendment is adopted and becomes law, we will be helping our environment by continuing to systematically eliminate these blights. i want more success stories like the one in this photograph. this photo was taken in nesquehoning in carbon county, pa. the first photo shows what the ground looked like when the waste coal was piled up. the second photo shows what happens after it has been consumed and the land has been restored. this happened precisely because there is a nearby waste coal powerplant that was able to take this coal, generate electricity for us to use, and restore the land to a much safer, much more environmentally friendly, and much more attractive environment. we need to keep these plants operating. it is about improving our environment, it is about keeping people working, it is about the low- cost, reliable electricity that we have from it, and i urge my colleagues to support this amendment. with that, i yield the floor. ____________________",13431

Mr. President, I ask the Senate to join me today in honoring the 150th anniversary of the State of Missouri's Emancipation Proclamation which ended slavery in the State of Missouri. This proclamation of freedom was imperative for democracy and progress in our State. It is undoubtedly a landmark in Missouri's history. In 1720, the arrival of 500 slaves to the areas presently known as St. Louis [[Page S148]] County and Jefferson County, marked the beginning of slavery in Missouri. Those slaves, who were brought to work in the lead mines in those counties, experienced great discrimination over the course of 1\1/2\ centuries. When the Territorial Slave Codes were created in 1804, slaves were banned from using firearms, participating in assemblies, holding church services and selling alcohol. Under the codes, slaves were also punished severely for participating in resistance efforts and the mutilation of slaves for the sexual assault of white women was made legal. White men who sexually assaulted slave women, however, were charged for trespassing upon a slave owner's property. Retained by the State Constitution in 1820, the Territorial Slave Codes were only a premonition of more to come. In 1821, Missouri entered the Union as a slave State with the passing of the Missouri Compromise and in 1825, the Missouri Legislature passed a law which declared slaves to be incompetent as witnesses in legal cases involving whites. That gloomy trend continued as the education of slaves was banned in an 1847 ordinance. One of the most foreboding events, however, occurred in 1857 with the infamous Supreme Court case Dred Scott v. Sandford when the judicial system in the state of Missouri and the wider judicial system in the United States decided that persons of African descent were not U.S. citizens. At the time of the Civil War, over 100,000 slaves were living in the State of Missouri and when President Abraham Lincoln signed the Emancipation Proclamation in 1863, Missouri's slaves were not freed as Missouri was not officially in rebellion against the United States. Missouri's slaves received their freedom on January 11, 1865, when the Emancipation Ordinance was signed at a State convention in St. Louis. That ordinance was made effective immediately and the strict codes of the past were eliminated.

Mr. President, today I highlight the service of William ``Bill'' Harrison Bullock to his country, commitment to his family, and contribution to both the city of Wilmington and the State of Delaware. Bill was born on November 11, 1926, in Wilmington, DE, to William and Amy Bullock. He graduated from P.S. DuPont in 1945 and was immediately drafted to serve as an aircraft mechanic in the Asia-Pacific theater during the Second World War. Upon his return to the United States, Bill joined and ultimately took over the five generation family business, Bullock Iron Works, which allowed him to meld his passions of building and construction with artistry. Bill invented a process for the precision bending of cold steel for decorative applications, including railings. The family business gave him an opportunity to work with his brother-in-law James Broad--husband to his sister Amy--and his nephew Jim Broad. Bill very much enjoyed and spoke often of the bond created by working and creating beautiful ornamental steel creations with his family members. Bill had a long-standing bet with his brother-in-law that he would not get married before he turned 30 years old. Bill married Norma McBride on November 10, 1956--1 day before his 30th birthday. They had two children, William and June. Through his management of Bullock Iron Works, Bill developed a very strong set of business principles and ethics, which he was able to pass along to his children, even though neither went into the family business. His friends often joked with Bill that Delaware is not flat and that if he left he would not fall off a cliff into a chasm. He retorted that he never left the State because he had no need or reason to do so. Bill loved Delaware and found there everything he needed to raise a family, to grow the family business, and to enjoy his hobbies and passions: fresh and salt water fishing, cultivating beautiful phalaenopsis and cattleya orchids, and enjoying the comradery of his fellow veterans at the Delaware Veterans Club, Post #1. Bill was preceded in death by his wife of 33 years Norma, his sister Amy, and brother-in-law James Broad. He is survived by his daughter Blake McBride, son William H. Bullock II, and daughter-in-law Marci Hanlon, three grandchildren, his sister and brother-in-law, and several nieces and nephews. Bill was a true Delawarean and one of the best and brightest of the Greatest Generation. He helped to win the Second World War, raised a strong and loving family, grew and bolstered his business, and was a true friend to his neighbors, war buddies, and the wider Wilmington community. He will be missed. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 5 (Monday, January 12, 2015)] [Senate] [Page S148] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS ______ REMEMBERING WILLIAM ``BILL'' HARRISON BULLOCK Mr. COONS.

CREC-2015-01-12-pt1-PgS155-6,CREC-2015-01-12,114,THE ECONOMY AND KEYSTONE PIPELINE,"[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 5 (Monday, January 12, 2015)] [Senate] [Pages S155-S158] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] THE ECONOMY AND KEYSTONE PIPELINE Mrs. BOXER. I thank the majority leader for allowing me this time to proceed. It is one thing to rewrite history a few years after it passes. It is another thing to rewrite it while you are still living through it. To say that this economic recovery is a Republican recovery is kind of funny and strange. In fact, the year 2014 was the best year for job creation since 1999, and it could have been a lot better in 2014 and in prior years if our Republican friends had not filibustered every single job proposal that President Obama put forward. It is sad because we could have gotten here much quicker. The economy added almost 3 million jobs in 2014, averaging almost 250,000 jobs a month. The unemployment rate has fallen to 5.6 percent, and most of that decline--and here is the good news--came from long- term unemployed workers getting back to work. The GDP growth has accelerated, reaching an annualized rate of 5 percent in the third quarter of 2014. This is the best GDP growth we have seen in over 10 years. Our economic recovery has been long, it has been tough, but it is happening and I thank the President for his leadership. We have added 11.2 million private sector jobs since February of 2010. That is the longest streak of recorded private sector job gains in American history. The stock market has bounced back from the crash and added more than 10,000 points, reaching an all-time high of over 18,000 points. Our annual deficit has been reduced by almost two-thirds. I think it is important to put into context the job growth under Presidents Democratic and Republican. I think we need to look at private sector job growth. This is an extraordinary chart. Under George Herbert Walker Bush, there were 1.5 million jobs created in his term of office. In Bill Clinton's term of office, there were 21.2 million jobs created. I have seen that number up to 23 million, but that is probably including the public sector. But during Bill Clinton's term, there were 21.2 million private sector jobs. Under George W. Bush, there was a loss of 460,000 jobs. Under President Obama, there is a gain so far of 7 million, and he has 2 years to go, and we are just moving forward. To me this says that we Democrats know what we are doing, and if you want to look at deficits, that is another day's speech. It was Bill Clinton who balanced the budget. It was George W. Bush who unbalanced it, put two wars on a credit card, gave a tax cut to the rich, and we had terrible deficits. Barack Obama has now reduced this deficit by two-thirds. So I say all this leading up to my discussion of the Keystone Pipeline. How does that even connect? I will tell you. When a new majority takes over in Congress you know the first bill they take up symbolizes their priorities. Out of all the things that they pick, all the things that they pick, they pick a bill that in terms of permanent job creation will be thirty-five jobs. And that [[Page S156]] is proven by the State Department--35 long-term jobs. One has to wonder, Why are they doing this? I believe I know the answer. This is really a big hug and a big kiss to big oil and Canadian interests. That is what it is about. Otherwise, why wouldn't we turn to the highway bill? I think the Presiding Officer and I know we have worked across partisan lines on that issue, and it means good jobs for America--good jobs, long-lasting jobs, rebuilding our bridges and our roads and making sure we have transit systems that work. We have a terrible record in terms of the condition of our bridges today. Thousands and thousands--tens of thousands of bridges are not in good shape, and we have seen bridges fail, and we know the outcome. Why are we pursuing a project for Canadian oil business interests that they will make billions off of instead of pursuing projects for America-- America--such as building our infrastructure? This bill isn't about helping American workers or families. Let's be very clear. It does nothing. Again, when I say 35 permanent jobs, I am not making that up. That is in the final supplemental environmental impact statement which I believe the Republicans want to make final, so they are accepting it. The Republicans are accepting the fact that there are 35 permanent jobs, because they, in their language, say, We approve of the final supplemental environmental impact statement, which is where it says there will be 35 permanent jobs. Now, yes, there are temporary jobs for 2 years--a couple thousand-- but the fact is we can have millions of jobs when we rebuild our infrastructure. We have 400 new jobs coming to the Imperial Valley in my home State because we have lithium there and they are going to start producing it. So 400 jobs, just one little project. This is 35 jobs for Americans. They have to be kidding. This is what they have for us, after all that blood, sweat, and tears during the election? I think that wasting another minute on the tar sands project doesn't make any sense. What we need is a multiyear surface transportation bill. We still have unemployed people in the construction industry. We have 600,000 construction workers who remain out of work. What are we giving them? We are giving them 2,000 temporary jobs and 35 permanent jobs? Let's do a highway bill. By the way, the trust fund is running dry and in 4 months will be completely dry. Let's step up to the plate and do our job, not do the job for the Canadian oil interests. I don't get it. I don't think it makes sense, because I know we have worked together on transportation projects. We are worried. Billions of dollars going to our States--whether it is Oklahoma, California, Nevada, east coast, west coast--the funding is going to be delayed or stopped. And all these short-term extensions the House did are absolutely irresponsible. It doesn't provide stability to our local governments, to our businesses. So we know what we have to do. We have to invest in our aging infrastructure. No country can be great if we don't have an infrastructure that moves people and moves goods. Again, 50 percent of our Nation's roads are in less than good condition and 63,000 bridges are structurally deficient. Let's do something for America. That is what we are here for; not to do something good for Canadian oil companies. Let's focus on what is good for the people. Now let's turn to this infrastructure project, the Keystone Pipeline. I want to say unequivocally--and I don't have any doubts because I resource everything I say--that from extraction to transportation to refining to [waste/waist] storage, misery follows the tar sands. That is the oil that gets put in the pipeline--the dirtiest oil. I think XL stands for extra lethal. So a pipeline is a pipeline. Fine. It is what we put in it. This is the filthiest, most polluted kind of oil. Tar sands oil contains levels of toxic pollutants and metals that are much higher than conventional crude oil--11 times more sulfur and nickel, 6 times more nitrogen, 5 times more lead than conventional crude oil. Who is saying that? Is it Barbara Boxer? No. Let me source it: The USGS, the U.S. Geological Survey, the heavy oil and natural bitumen resources in geological basins of the world--documented. Tar sands equal the dirtiest oil. Why do some of my Republican friends and some of my Democratic friends--I admit that; I know there are a few--want to rush to bring this filthy oil into our country? The only benefit is to the Canadian oil interests. The fact is we need less pollution, not more pollution. Now high levels of dangerous air pollutants and carcinogens have been documented downwind from the tar sands refineries. People in nearby communities are suffering higher rates and types of cancers, such as leukemia and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. Again, is this me saying it? Some rightwing blog took me to task the last time I said it. They said, Oh, she was on the floor making stuff up. OK. Let's be clear. I am not making stuff up. I am telling the truth, and I am going to document it in every case: Significantly higher levels of volatile compounds and carcinogens were found downwind of tar sands processing facilities. There were elevated rates of cancers linked to these toxic chemicals, including leukemia and non-Hodgkins lymphoma. Where does this come from? Simpson, I.J., et al., air quality in the Industrial Heartland of Alberta, Canada and potential impacts on human health. Characterization of trace gases measured over Alberta oil sands mining operations: 76 speciated C2-C10 volatile organic compounds, and they list what they are. This is from two peer-reviewed papers. Is this what the Republicans do first? I thought we wanted to make people healthy. It is one thing to want to repeal the Affordable Care Act, which now, in my State, has reduced the uninsured by close to 50 percent--that is bad enough. Now they want to bring in this oil and help the Canadian oil people and it is going to bring all of these carcinogens and all of this pollution to our country. We already know about the people from Port Arthur, TX, where they have these refineries. Look at this picture. A picture is worth a thousand words. I know that is a cliche, but it is a fact. I could try to explain to my colleagues what happens near the playground when this stuff is refined. One might say, Oh, that is nice, Barbara, but are you really making this up? No. Here it is. Look at it. They suffer asthma, respiratory ailments, skin irritations, and cancer. This is what happens, right near a playground. Now, there are some politicians down there saying, Bring it on. We want it. We like it. But talk to the real people there who live there with children. They have had enough of tar sands. They have had it up to here with them. They want none of it. Let's not forget about the waste. Once they burn all of this stuff, they have waste left over. It is called petcoke, petroleum coke. Look at this. This is what it looks like, as shown in this picture. It is stored in the Midwest. A lot of it is stored in the Midwest. What happens? In this photograph we can see it is not wet, so it can blow in the wind. Billowing black clouds have contaminated our children. They contain heavy metals. Children playing baseball have been forced off the field to seek cover from the clouds of black dust that pelted homes and cars. This happened. This is why my friend Senator Durbin is so concerned, because it happened to his Little League players in the Chicago area. When inhaled, these particles can increase the number and severity of asthma attacks. They can aggravate bronchitis--I am coughing just at the thought of it--lung disease. They reduce the body's ability to fight infections. Where does that come from? I will say it again. When inhaled, these particles can increase the number and severity of asthma attacks, cause or aggravate bronchitis and other lung diseases, and reduce the body's ability to fight infections. What is the source of that? California Air Resources Board, Air Pollution Particulate Matter brochure dated May 6, 2009. So I don't know how exposing Americans to this kind of pollution is in the national interests. I believe instead of waiving all of the environmental reports as my Republican friends do in their bill, they ought to call for more studies on the health impact of the tar sands oil so our families know what they are going to get with this pipeline. Also there are spills to worry about. Not only is the Keystone tar sands [[Page S157]] pipeline harmful to human health, it hurts environments and communities located near it, because if there is a spill, it is the toughest kind of oil to clean up. Here is the source for that: The EPA NEPA compliance comment letter, State Department. That is what they talk about. We have had spills at the tar sands--spills in Michigan, spills in Arkansas. If my colleagues don't believe me, ask those folks. Do my colleagues know in 2010 a pipeline ruptured and spilled over a million gallons of tar sands oil into the Kalamazoo River in Michigan? The local health department ordered the evacuation of 50 households and approximately 100 families were advised not to drink the water. The Michigan spill was the largest inland spill in U.S. history and more than 40 years and $1 billion later, it is not cleaned up. So wait a minute. Let's review. Republicans take over and the first bill they give us is the tar sands bill. The only people it helps, in my opinion, backed up by fact, are Canadian oil interests. The only jobs it creates permanently are 35 jobs. What it does to our health is a disaster, because the tar sands oil is the most toxic, dirty type of oil, and if there is a spill, it is the hardest to clean up. Who do we think is paying the $1 billion to clean up a tar sand spill in Michigan? I can tell my colleagues. It is probably most of the government. Maybe we are trying to collect some from the private sector. If my colleagues don't believe me about Michigan, let's turn to Mayflower, AR. This is a beautiful neighborhood of homes, as shown in this picture. This is filthy, dirty, disgusting oil and the camera is taking pictures of it. In 2013, 200,000 gallons of tar sands burst from a pipeline, because it is volatile. It burst from the pipeline and spilled into the streets of a subdivision. It forced the evacuation and abandonment of 22 homes--residents who were exposed to high levels of benzene, a known carcinogen, and hydrogen sulfide. People in this community--not some made-up, mystical community or mythical community-- in this community they suffered dizziness, nausea, headaches, respiratory problems, all classic symptoms of exposure to the chemicals found in the tar sands. So remember this picture and remember the picture of the filthy, dirty oil and the petcoke, because a picture tells a thousand words, and that is the picture my friends want to make a reality in America. Their first great bill, their first great contribution to the economy, 35 jobs. Please. We can do better. We can work together on a highway bill, on a transportation bill. We do so well on that. And we can add millions of jobs, especially in the construction industry. Now there is the issue of climate change. We know we are dealing with a lot of deniers on the other side of the aisle. They deny climate change is real. It doesn't matter what we tell them. July was the hottest month, August was the hottest month, and September was the hottest month in 2014. We know what is happening. The world knows what is happening. We have deniers here, so they deny any problem and they go rush to build the Keystone Pipeline. What will happen is the Keystone Pipeline will undermine our efforts to address climate change. The State Department's own analysis says a barrel of tar sands oil carried by the Keystone tar sands pipeline will create at least 17 percent more carbon pollution than domestic oil. Peer-reviewed research estimates that the increase in oil consumption caused by Keystone could result in up to 110 million metric tons of carbon pollution each year--four times the State Department's estimate. So this is even more than the State Department says. The source there is Erickson et al., ``Nature Climate Change.'' That is a peer-reviewed study as well. This is equivalent to carbon pollution adding 23 million new cars to the road or building 29 coal-fired powerplants. So the State Department is very modest in its projection. Even that is too much. Here is more. Here is the State Department. That is the 17 percent quote. And it could add up to an additional 27 million metric tons of carbon pollution each year. That is more of the State Department. This is their modest conclusion. We believe the peer-reviewed study shows it is far worse than even the State Department says. If you don't believe climate change is a problem, I am really sorry for your constituency because let me tell you what scientists are saying. And I am saying it is 98 percent of scientists. Let's be clear. Ninety-eight percent of scientists say climate change is real, and 2 percent say: We are not so sure. So my friends side with the 2 percent. Suppose one of my friends didn't feel well and went to the doctor, and the doctor said: I am sorry to tell you this, sir, but you have a cancer that is raging over your body, and we need to operate today. You say: I want a second opinion. That is good. You go get a second opinion. The second doctor says: Absolutely, you better get that operation. You say: Well, I want a third opinion. All right. I understand it. You go for a third opinion. Absolutely, those two doctors were right, but you keep going, and you get nine opinions that all say: Sir, you are a dead man if you don't get this operation. And then you find the 10th, and he says: You know, just go on a vegetarian diet, and you will be fine. If you listen to that one out of 10 doctors, there is something wrong with you. It is just like Big Tobacco. They did the same thing. They said: Oh, tobacco is fine, not a problem--until we realized there was a whole campaign by the big tobacco companies to turn us away from the fact that tobacco causes cancer. That is the truth. Guess what we found out. In a Union of Concerned Scientists expose, they found out that the same people who led that fight of tobacco denial are leading the fight of climate denial. If this was just going to hurt you, I say to my Republican friends rhetorically, I wouldn't care. I mean, I would be really sad and sorry if one of my friends went to the doctor and didn't listen to the best advice. But you know what. That hurts him. I would be miserable, and I would try to talk him out of it. But this is about my constituents and the people of this country. I have to say this is wrong. This is just wrong. This is an opportunity to bring the parties together. We could have done it around so many issues and in particular the highway bill. So common sense tells us this isn't the right thing to do. We are looking at unleashing this dirty, filthy oil. It is going to be harmful to our families' health. It is going to worsen the impact of climate change. It will not create the jobs we need to create. Again, I urge my colleagues vote no. It is not ready for prime time. There are going to be amendments that will reveal the fact that if we go forward with this, it is actually going to raise gas prices for Americans because all this stuff is going to be exported. Even the tar sands that are now currently in America--they are going to export it because of the world market. We are going to have amendments that are going to show that. This bill doesn't even have a ``Made in America'' amendment to it. We are going to offer that. Why don't we make this deal here? Why don't we put people to work here? That is not in this bill. This bill is not ready. This bill does not help us; this bill hurts us. I know my friends came here to make this country better. I think they think it helps. I don't question that. But if you look at all of the facts--and I have them lined up here, one after the other--whether it is the jobs impact, the health impact, who benefits, who gets hurt, it is pretty clear. It is on the record. All you have to do is look at it. Don't shop around for a doctor who will tell you this is a good deal because they have already spoken. It is not a good deal. We can do so much better. Because I think it is going to be a contentious debate, after this I hope we turn to the highway bill. My friend Jim Inhofe and I, who worked so well together, and my colleagues on both sides of the aisle and across the Capitol on the other side, the House, can finally come together and do something that will send a strong signal to the American people that the election just ended, now let's govern. But when you bring things before the body that some of us feel are so detrimental to the American people, I am willing to vote on it at midnight. It is OK with me. We will vote at midnight and vote at 1 o'clock in the morning. I don't care what time we vote, but why are we taking this up? This is not what we should be doing. [[Page S158]] S. 1--I looked at some of the S. 1 bills the Democrats have put forward, and they mostly have to do with creating a lot of jobs or making sure there is equal pay for equal work or making sure the minimum wage is increased. We could be doing all of those things together. It is with pride that I stand here again for my State. It is with no animosity about the election. It was hard-fought and hard-won. But I believe this is an enormous mistake, and I will continue to stand on my feet as long as it takes to make the case as to why I think it is wrong and make the case where I think there is so much else we could do for the good of our people. I thank the Presiding Officer for his courtesy. I yield the floor. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 5 (Monday, January 12, 2015)] [Senate] [Pages S155-S158] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] THE ECONOMY AND KEYSTONE PIPELINE Mrs. BOXER.

We have a terrible record in terms of the condition of our bridges today. Thousands and thousands--tens of thousands of bridges are not in good shape, and we have seen bridges fail, and we know the outcome. Why are we pursuing a project for Canadian oil business interests that they will make billions off of instead of pursuing projects for America-- America--such as building our infrastructure? This bill isn't about helping American workers or families. Let's be very clear. It does nothing. Again, when I say 35 permanent jobs, I am not making that up. That is in the final supplemental environmental impact statement which I believe the Republicans want to make final, so they are accepting it. The Republicans are accepting the fact that there are 35 permanent jobs, because they, in their language, say, We approve of the final supplemental environmental impact statement, which is where it says there will be 35 permanent jobs. Now, yes, there are temporary jobs for 2 years--a couple thousand-- but the fact is we can have millions of jobs when we rebuild our infrastructure. We have 400 new jobs coming to the Imperial Valley in my home State because we have lithium there and they are going to start producing it. So 400 jobs, just one little project. This is 35 jobs for Americans. They have to be kidding. This is what they have for us, after all that blood, sweat, and tears during the election? I think that wasting another minute on the tar sands project doesn't make any sense. What we need is a multiyear surface transportation bill. We still have unemployed people in the construction industry. We have 600,000 construction workers who remain out of work. What are we giving them? We are giving them 2,000 temporary jobs and 35 permanent jobs? Let's do a highway bill. By the way, the trust fund is running dry and in 4 months will be completely dry. Let's step up to the plate and do our job, not do the job for the Canadian oil interests. I don't get it. I don't think it makes sense, because I know we have worked together on transportation projects. We are worried. Billions of dollars going to our States--whether it is Oklahoma, California, Nevada, east coast, west coast--the funding is going to be delayed or stopped. And all these short-term extensions the House did are absolutely irresponsible. It doesn't provide stability to our local governments, to our businesses. So we know what we have to do. We have to invest in our aging infrastructure. No country can be great if we don't have an infrastructure that moves people and moves goods. Again, 50 percent of our Nation's roads are in less than good condition and 63,000 bridges are structurally deficient. Let's do something for America. That is what we are here for; not to do something good for Canadian oil companies. Let's focus on what is good for the people. Now let's turn to this infrastructure project, the Keystone Pipeline. I want to say unequivocally--and I don't have any doubts because I resource everything I say--that from extraction to transportation to refining to [waste/waist] storage, misery follows the tar sands. That is the oil that gets put in the pipeline--the dirtiest oil. I think XL stands for extra lethal. So a pipeline is a pipeline. Fine. It is what we put in it. This is the filthiest, most polluted kind of oil. Tar sands oil contains levels of toxic pollutants and metals that are much higher than conventional crude oil--11 times more sulfur and nickel, 6 times more nitrogen, 5 times more lead than conventional crude oil. Who is saying that? Is it Barbara Boxer? No. Let me source it: The USGS, the U.S. Geological Survey, the heavy oil and natural bitumen resources in geological basins of the world--documented. Tar sands equal the dirtiest oil. Why do some of my Republican friends and some of my Democratic friends--I admit that; I know there are a few--want to rush to bring this filthy oil into our country? The only benefit is to the Canadian oil interests. The fact is we need less pollution, not more pollution. Now high levels of dangerous air pollutants and carcinogens have been documented downwind from the tar sands refineries. People in nearby communities are suffering higher rates and types of cancers, such as leukemia and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. Again, is this me saying it? Some rightwing blog took me to task the last time I said it. They said, Oh, she was on the floor making stuff up. OK. Let's be clear. I am not making stuff up. I am telling the truth, and I am going to document it in every case: Significantly higher levels of volatile compounds and carcinogens were found downwind of tar sands processing facilities. There were elevated rates of cancers linked to these toxic chemicals, including leukemia and non-Hodgkins lymphoma. Where does this come from? Simpson, I.J., et al., air quality in the Industrial Heartland of Alberta, Canada and potential impacts on human health. Characterization of trace gases measured over Alberta oil sands mining operations: 76 speciated C2-C10 volatile organic compounds, and they list what they are. This is from two peer-reviewed papers. Is this what the Republicans do first? I thought we wanted to make people healthy. It is one thing to want to repeal the Affordable Care Act, which now, in my State, has reduced the uninsured by close to 50 percent--that is bad enough. Now they want to bring in this oil and help the Canadian oil people and it is going to bring all of these carcinogens and all of this pollution to our country. We already know about the people from Port Arthur, TX, where they have these refineries. Look at this picture. A picture is worth a thousand words. I know that is a cliche, but it is a fact. I could try to explain to my colleagues what happens near the playground when this stuff is refined. One might say, Oh, that is nice, Barbara, but are you really making this up? No. Here it is. Look at it. They suffer asthma, respiratory ailments, skin irritations, and cancer. This is what happens, right near a playground. Now, there are some politicians down there saying, Bring it on. We want it. We like it. But talk to the real people there who live there with children. They have had enough of tar sands. They have had it up to here with them. They want none of it. Let's not forget about the waste. Once they burn all of this stuff, they have waste left over. It is called petcoke, petroleum coke. Look at this. This is what it looks like, as shown in this picture. It is stored in the Midwest. A lot of it is stored in the Midwest. What happens? In this photograph we can see it is not wet, so it can blow in the wind. Billowing black clouds have contaminated our children. They contain heavy metals. Children playing baseball have been forced off the field to seek cover from the clouds of black dust that pelted homes and cars. This happened. This is why my friend Senator Durbin is so concerned, because it happened to his Little League players in the Chicago area. When inhaled, these particles can increase the number and severity of asthma attacks. They can aggravate bronchitis--I am coughing just at the thought of it--lung disease. They reduce the body's ability to fight infections. Where does that come from? I will say it again. When inhaled, these particles can increase the number and severity of asthma attacks, cause or aggravate bronchitis and other lung diseases, and reduce the body's ability to fight infections. What is the source of that? California Air Resources Board, Air Pollution Particulate Matter brochure dated May 6, 2009. So I don't know how exposing Americans to this kind of pollution is in the national interests. I believe instead of waiving all of the environmental reports as my Republican friends do in their bill, they ought to call for more studies on the health impact of the tar sands oil so our families know what they are going to get with this pipeline. Also there are spills to worry about. Not only is the Keystone tar sands [[Page S157]] pipeline harmful to human health, it hurts environments and communities located near it, because if there is a spill, it is the toughest kind of oil to clean up. Here is the source for that: The EPA NEPA compliance comment letter, State Department. That is what they talk about. We have had spills at the tar sands--spills in Michigan, spills in Arkansas. If my colleagues don't believe me, ask those folks. Do my colleagues know in 2010 a pipeline ruptured and spilled over a million gallons of tar sands oil into the Kalamazoo River in Michigan? The local health department ordered the evacuation of 50 households and approximately 100 families were advised not to drink the water. The Michigan spill was the largest inland spill in U.S. history and more than 40 years and $1 billion later, it is not cleaned up. So wait a minute. Let's review. Republicans take over and the first bill they give us is the tar sands bill. The only people it helps, in my opinion, backed up by fact, are Canadian oil interests. The only jobs it creates permanently are 35 jobs. What it does to our health is a disaster, because the tar sands oil is the most toxic, dirty type of oil, and if there is a spill, it is the hardest to clean up. Who do we think is paying the $1 billion to clean up a tar sand spill in Michigan? I can tell my colleagues. It is probably most of the government. Maybe we are trying to collect some from the private sector. If my colleagues don't believe me about Michigan, let's turn to Mayflower, AR. This is a beautiful neighborhood of homes, as shown in this picture. This is filthy, dirty, disgusting oil and the camera is taking pictures of it. In 2013, 200,000 gallons of tar sands burst from a pipeline, because it is volatile. It burst from the pipeline and spilled into the streets of a subdivision. It forced the evacuation and abandonment of 22 homes--residents who were exposed to high levels of benzene, a known carcinogen, and hydrogen sulfide. People in this community--not some made-up, mystical community or mythical community-- in this community they suffered dizziness, nausea, headaches, respiratory problems, all classic symptoms of exposure to the chemicals found in the tar sands. So remember this picture and remember the picture of the filthy, dirty oil and the petcoke, because a picture tells a thousand words, and that is the picture my friends want to make a reality in America. Their first great bill, their first great contribution to the economy, 35 jobs. Please. We can do better. We can work together on a highway bill, on a transportation bill. We do so well on that. And we can add millions of jobs, especially in the construction industry. Now there is the issue of climate change. We know we are dealing with a lot of deniers on the other side of the aisle. They deny climate change is real. It doesn't matter what we tell them. July was the hottest month, August was the hottest month, and September was the hottest month in 2014. We know what is happening. The world knows what is happening. We have deniers here, so they deny any problem and they go rush to build the Keystone Pipeline. What will happen is the Keystone Pipeline will undermine our efforts to address climate change. The State Department's own analysis says a barrel of tar sands oil carried by the Keystone tar sands pipeline will create at least 17 percent more carbon pollution than domestic oil. Peer-reviewed research estimates that the increase in oil consumption caused by Keystone could result in up to 110 million metric tons of carbon pollution each year--four times the State Department's estimate. So this is even more than the State Department says. The source there is Erickson et al., ``Nature Climate Change.'' That is a peer-reviewed study as well. This is equivalent to carbon pollution adding 23 million new cars to the road or building 29 coal-fired powerplants. So the State Department is very modest in its projection. Even that is too much. Here is more. Here is the State Department. That is the 17 percent quote. And it could add up to an additional 27 million metric tons of carbon pollution each year. That is more of the State Department. This is their modest conclusion. We believe the peer-reviewed study shows it is far worse than even the State Department says. If you don't believe climate change is a problem, I am really sorry for your constituency because let me tell you what scientists are saying. And I am saying it is 98 percent of scientists. Let's be clear. Ninety-eight percent of scientists say climate change is real, and 2 percent say: We are not so sure. So my friends side with the 2 percent. Suppose one of my friends didn't feel well and went to the doctor, and the doctor said: I am sorry to tell you this, sir, but you have a cancer that is raging over your body, and we need to operate today. You say: I want a second opinion. That is good. You go get a second opinion. The second doctor says: Absolutely, you better get that operation. You say: Well, I want a third opinion. All right. I understand it. You go for a third opinion. Absolutely, those two doctors were right, but you keep going, and you get nine opinions that all say: Sir, you are a dead man if you don't get this operation. And then you find the 10th, and he says: You know, just go on a vegetarian diet, and you will be fine. If you listen to that one out of 10 doctors, there is something wrong with you. It is just like Big Tobacco. They did the same thing. They said: Oh, tobacco is fine, not a problem--until we realized there was a whole campaign by the big tobacco companies to turn us away from the fact that tobacco causes cancer. That is the truth. Guess what we found out. In a Union of Concerned Scientists expose, they found out that the same people who led that fight of tobacco denial are leading the fight of climate denial. If this was just going to hurt you, I say to my Republican friends rhetorically, I wouldn't care. I mean, I would be really sad and sorry if one of my friends went to the doctor and didn't listen to the best advice. But you know what. That hurts him. I would be miserable, and I would try to talk him out of it. But this is about my constituents and the people of this country. I have to say this is wrong. This is just wrong. This is an opportunity to bring the parties together. We could have done it around so many issues and in particular the highway bill. So common sense tells us this isn't the right thing to do. We are looking at unleashing this dirty, filthy oil. It is going to be harmful to our families' health. It is going to worsen the impact of climate change. It will not create the jobs we need to create. Again, I urge my colleagues vote no. It is not ready for prime time. There are going to be amendments that will reveal the fact that if we go forward with this, it is actually going to raise gas prices for Americans because all this stuff is going to be exported. Even the tar sands that are now currently in America--they are going to export it because of the world market. We are going to have amendments that are going to show that. This bill doesn't even have a ``Made in America'' amendment to it. We are going to offer that. Why don't we make this deal here? Why don't we put people to work here? That is not in this bill. This bill is not ready. This bill does not help us; this bill hurts us. I know my friends came here to make this country better. I think they think it helps. I don't question that. But if you look at all of the facts--and I have them lined up here, one after the other--whether it is the jobs impact, the health impact, who benefits, who gets hurt, it is pretty clear. It is on the record. All you have to do is look at it. Don't shop around for a doctor who will tell you this is a good deal because they have already spoken. It is not a good deal. We can do so much better. Because I think it is going to be a contentious debate, after this I hope we turn to the highway bill. My friend Jim Inhofe and I, who worked so well together, and my colleagues on both sides of the aisle and across the Capitol on the other side, the House, can finally come together and do something that will send a strong signal to the American people that the election just ended, now let's govern. But when you bring things before the body that some of us feel are so detrimental to the American people, I am willing to vote on it at midnight. It is OK with me. We will vote at midnight and vote at 1 o'clock in the morning. I don't care what time we vote, but why are we taking this up? This is not what we should be doing. [[Page S158]] S. 1--I looked at some of the S. 1 bills the Democrats have put forward, and they mostly have to do with creating a lot of jobs or making sure there is equal pay for equal work or making sure the minimum wage is increased. We could be doing all of those things together. It is with pride that I stand here again for my State. It is with no animosity about the election. It was hard-fought and hard-won. But I believe this is an enormous mistake, and I will continue to stand on my feet as long as it takes to make the case as to why I think it is wrong and make the case where I think there is so much else we could do for the good of our people. I thank the Presiding Officer for his courtesy. I yield the floor. ____________________","Congressional Record, Volume 161 Issue 5 (Monday, January 12, 2015) [Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 5 (Monday, January 12, 2015)] [Senate] [Pages S155-S158] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] THE ECONOMY AND KEYSTONE PIPELINE Mrs. BOXER. I thank the majority leader for allowing me this time to proceed. It is one thing to rewrite history a few years after it passes. It is another thing to rewrite it while you are still living through it. To say that this economic recovery is a Republican recovery is kind of funny and strange. In fact, the year 2014 was the best year for job creation since 1999, and it could have been a lot better in 2014 and in prior years if our Republican friends had not filibustered every single job proposal that President Obama put forward. It is sad because we could have gotten here much quicker. The economy added almost 3 million jobs in 2014, averaging almost 250,000 jobs a month. The unemployment rate has fallen to 5.6 percent, and most of that decline--and here is the good news--came from long- term unemployed workers getting back to work. The GDP growth has accelerated, reaching an annualized rate of 5 percent in the third quarter of 2014. This is the best GDP growth we have seen in over 10 years. Our economic recovery has been long, it has been tough, but it is happening and I thank the President for his leadership. We have added 11.2 million private sector jobs since February of 2010. That is the longest streak of recorded private sector job gains in American history. The stock market has bounced back from the crash and added more than 10,000 points, reaching an all-time high of over 18,000 points. Our annual deficit has been reduced by almost two-thirds. I think it is important to put into context the job growth under Presidents Democratic and Republican. I think we need to look at private sector job growth. This is an extraordinary chart. Under George Herbert Walker Bush, there were 1.5 million jobs created in his term of office. In Bill Clinton's term of office, there were 21.2 million jobs created. I have seen that number up to 23 million, but that is probably including the public sector. But during Bill Clinton's term, there were 21.2 million private sector jobs. Under George W. Bush, there was a loss of 460,000 jobs. Under President Obama, there is a gain so far of 7 million, and he has 2 years to go, and we are just moving forward. To me this says that we Democrats know what we are doing, and if you want to look at deficits, that is another day's speech. It was Bill Clinton who balanced the budget. It was George W. Bush who unbalanced it, put two wars on a credit card, gave a tax cut to the rich, and we had terrible deficits. Barack Obama has now reduced this deficit by two-thirds. So I say all this leading up to my discussion of the Keystone Pipeline. How does that even connect? I will tell you. When a new majority takes over in Congress you know the first bill they take up symbolizes their priorities. Out of all the things that they pick, all the things that they pick, they pick a bill that in terms of permanent job creation will be thirty-five jobs. And that [[Page S156]] is proven by the State Department--35 long-term jobs. One has to wonder, Why are they doing this? I believe I know the answer. This is really a big hug and a big kiss to big oil and Canadian interests. That is what it is about. Otherwise, why wouldn't we turn to the highway bill? I think the Presiding Officer and I know we have worked across partisan lines on that issue, and it means good jobs for America--good jobs, long-lasting jobs, rebuilding our bridges and our roads and making sure we have transit systems that work. We have a terrible record in terms of the condition of our bridges today. Thousands and thousands--tens of thousands of bridges are not in good shape, and we have seen bridges fail, and we know the outcome. Why are we pursuing a project for Canadian oil business interests that they will make billions off of instead of pursuing projects for America-- America--such as building our infrastructure? This bill isn't about helping American workers or families. Let's be very clear. It does nothing. Again, when I say 35 permanent jobs, I am not making that up. That is in the final supplemental environmental impact statement which I believe the Republicans want to make final, so they are accepting it.

You say: I want a second opinion. That is good. You go get a second opinion. The second doctor says: Absolutely, you better get that operation. You say: Well, I want a third opinion. All right. I understand it. You go for a third opinion. Absolutely, those two doctors were right, but you keep going, and you get nine opinions that all say: Sir, you are a dead man if you don't get this operation. And then you find the 10th, and he says: You know, just go on a vegetarian diet, and you will be fine. If you listen to that one out of 10 doctors, there is something wrong with you. It is just like Big Tobacco. They did the same thing. They said: Oh, tobacco is fine, not a problem--until we realized there was a whole campaign by the big tobacco companies to turn us away from the fact that tobacco causes cancer. That is the truth. Guess what we found out. In a Union of Concerned Scientists expose, they found out that the same people who led that fight of tobacco denial are leading the fight of climate denial. If this was just going to hurt you, I say to my Republican friends rhetorically, I wouldn't care. I mean, I would be really sad and sorry if one of my friends went to the doctor and didn't listen to the best advice. But you know what. That hurts him. I would be miserable, and I would try to talk him out of it. But this is about my constituents and the people of this country. I have to say this is wrong. This is just wrong. This is an opportunity to bring the parties together. We could have done it around so many issues and in particular the highway bill. So common sense tells us this isn't the right thing to do. We are looking at unleashing this dirty, filthy oil. It is going to be harmful to our families' health. It is going to worsen the impact of climate change. It will not create the jobs we need to create. Again, I urge my colleagues vote no. It is not ready for prime time. There are going to be amendments that will reveal the fact that if we go forward with this, it is actually going to raise gas prices for Americans because all this stuff is going to be exported. Even the tar sands that are now currently in America--they are going to export it because of the world market. We are going to have amendments that are going to show that. This bill doesn't even have a ``Made in America'' amendment to it. We are going to offer that. Why don't we make this deal here? Why don't we put people to work here? That is not in this bill. This bill is not ready. This bill does not help us; this bill hurts us. I know my friends came here to make this country better. I think they think it helps. I don't question that. But if you look at all of the facts--and I have them lined up here, one after the other--whether it is the jobs impact, the health impact, who benefits, who gets hurt, it is pretty clear. It is on the record. All you have to do is look at it. Don't shop around for a doctor who will tell you this is a good deal because they have already spoken. It is not a good deal. We can do so much better. Because I think it is going to be a contentious debate, after this I hope we turn to the highway bill. My friend Jim Inhofe and I, who worked so well together, and my colleagues on both sides of the aisle and across the Capitol on the other side, the House, can finally come together and do something that will send a strong signal to the American people that the election just ended, now let's govern. But when you bring things before the body that some of us feel are so detrimental to the American people, I am willing to vote on it at midnight. It is OK with me. We will vote at midnight and vote at 1 o'clock in the morning. I don't care what time we vote, but why are we taking this up? This is not what we should be doing. [[Page S158]] S. 1--I looked at some of the S. 1 bills the Democrats have put forward, and they mostly have to do with creating a lot of jobs or making sure there is equal pay for equal work or making sure the minimum wage is increased. We could be doing all of those things together. It is with pride that I stand here again for my State. It is with no animosity about the election. It was hard-fought and hard-won. But I believe this is an enormous mistake, and I will continue to stand on my feet as long as it takes to make the case as to why I think it is wrong and make the case where I think there is so much else we could do for the good of our people. I thank the Presiding Officer for his courtesy. I yield the floor. ____________________",package_114_129.csv,21094,21094,21162,"[congressional record volume 161, number 5 (monday, january 12, 2015)] [senate] [pages s155-s158] from the congressional record online through the government publishing office [ www.gpo.gov ] the economy and keystone pipeline mrs. boxer. i thank the majority leader for allowing me this time to proceed. it is one thing to rewrite history a few years after it passes. it is another thing to rewrite it while you are still living through it. to say that this economic recovery is a republican recovery is kind of funny and strange. in fact, the year 2014 was the best year for job creation since 1999, and it could have been a lot better in 2014 and in prior years if our republican friends had not filibustered every single job proposal that president obama put forward. it is sad because we could have gotten here much quicker. the economy added almost 3 million jobs in 2014, averaging almost 250,000 jobs a month. the unemployment rate has fallen to 5.6 percent, and most of that decline--and here is the good news--came from long- term unemployed workers getting back to work. the gdp growth has accelerated, reaching an annualized rate of 5 percent in the third quarter of 2014. this is the best gdp growth we have seen in over 10 years. our economic recovery has been long, it has been tough, but it is happening and i thank the president for his leadership. we have added 11.2 million private sector jobs since february of 2010. that is the longest streak of recorded private sector job gains in american history. the stock market has bounced back from the crash and added more than 10,000 points, reaching an all-time high of over 18,000 points. our annual deficit has been reduced by almost two-thirds. i think it is important to put into context the job growth under presidents democratic and republican. i think we need to look at private sector job growth. this is an extraordinary chart. under george herbert walker bush, there were 1.5 million jobs created in his term of office. in bill clinton's term of office, there were 21.2 million jobs created. i have seen that number up to 23 million, but that is probably including the public sector. but during bill clinton's term, there were 21.2 million private sector jobs. under george w. bush, there was a loss of 460,000 jobs. under president obama, there is a gain so far of 7 million, and he has 2 years to go, and we are just moving forward. to me this says that we democrats know what we are doing, and if you want to look at deficits, that is another day's speech. it was bill clinton who balanced the budget. it was george w. bush who unbalanced it, put two wars on a credit card, gave a tax cut to the rich, and we had terrible deficits. barack obama has now reduced this deficit by two-thirds. so i say all this leading up to my discussion of the keystone pipeline. how does that even connect? i will tell you. when a new majority takes over in congress you know the first bill they take up symbolizes their priorities. out of all the things that they pick, all the things that they pick, they pick a bill that in terms of permanent job creation will be thirty-five jobs. and that [[page s156]] is proven by the state department--35 long-term jobs. one has to wonder, why are they doing this? i believe i know the answer. this is really a big hug and a big kiss to big oil and canadian interests. that is what it is about. otherwise, why wouldn't we turn to the highway bill? i think the presiding officer and i know we have worked across partisan lines on that issue, and it means good jobs for america--good jobs, long-lasting jobs, rebuilding our bridges and our roads and making sure we have transit systems that work. we have a terrible record in terms of the condition of our bridges today. thousands and thousands--tens of thousands of bridges are not in good shape, and we have seen bridges fail, and we know the outcome. why are we pursuing a project for canadian oil business interests that they will make billions off of instead of pursuing projects for america-- america--such as building our infrastructure? this bill isn't about helping american workers or families. let's be very clear. it does nothing. again, when i say 35 permanent jobs, i am not making that up. that is in the final supplemental environmental impact statement which i believe the republicans want to make final, so they are accepting it. the republicans are accepting the fact that there are 35 permanent jobs, because they, in their language, say, we approve of the final supplemental environmental impact statement, which is where it says there will be 35 permanent jobs. now, yes, there are temporary jobs for 2 years--a couple thousand-- but the fact is we can have millions of jobs when we rebuild our infrastructure. we have 400 new jobs coming to the imperial valley in my home state because we have lithium there and they are going to start producing it. so 400 jobs, just one little project. this is 35 jobs for americans. they have to be kidding. this is what they have for us, after all that blood, sweat, and tears during the election? i think that wasting another minute on the tar sands project doesn't make any sense. what we need is a multiyear surface transportation bill. we still have unemployed people in the construction industry. we have 600,000 construction workers who remain out of work. what are we giving them? we are giving them 2,000 temporary jobs and 35 permanent jobs? let's do a highway bill. by the way, the trust fund is running dry and in 4 months will be completely dry. let's step up to the plate and do our job, not do the job for the canadian oil interests. i don't get it. i don't think it makes sense, because i know we have worked together on transportation projects. we are worried. billions of dollars going to our states--whether it is oklahoma, california, nevada, east coast, west coast--the funding is going to be delayed or stopped. and all these short-term extensions the house did are absolutely irresponsible. it doesn't provide stability to our local governments, to our businesses. so we know what we have to do. we have to invest in our aging infrastructure. no country can be great if we don't have an infrastructure that moves people and moves goods. again, 50 percent of our nation's roads are in less than good condition and 63,000 bridges are structurally deficient. let's do something for america. that is what we are here for; not to do something good for canadian oil companies. let's focus on what is good for the people. now let's turn to this infrastructure project, the keystone pipeline. i want to say unequivocally--and i don't have any doubts because i resource everything i say--that from extraction to transportation to refining to [waste/waist] storage, misery follows the tar sands. that is the oil that gets put in the pipeline--the dirtiest oil. i think xl stands for extra lethal. so a pipeline is a pipeline. fine. it is what we put in it. this is the filthiest, most polluted kind of oil. tar sands oil contains levels of toxic pollutants and metals that are much higher than conventional crude oil--11 times more sulfur and nickel, 6 times more nitrogen, 5 times more lead than conventional crude oil. who is saying that? is it barbara boxer? no. let me source it: the usgs, the u.s. geological survey, the heavy oil and natural bitumen resources in geological basins of the world--documented. tar sands equal the dirtiest oil. why do some of my republican friends and some of my democratic friends--i admit that; i know there are a few--want to rush to bring this filthy oil into our country? the only benefit is to the canadian oil interests. the fact is we need less pollution, not more pollution. now high levels of dangerous air pollutants and carcinogens have been documented downwind from the tar sands refineries. people in nearby communities are suffering higher rates and types of cancers, such as leukemia and non-hodgkin's lymphoma. again, is this me saying it? some rightwing blog took me to task the last time i said it. they said, oh, she was on the floor making stuff up. ok. let's be clear. i am not making stuff up. i am telling the truth, and i am going to document it in every case: significantly higher levels of volatile compounds and carcinogens were found downwind of tar sands processing facilities. there were elevated rates of cancers linked to these toxic chemicals, including leukemia and non-hodgkins lymphoma. where does this come from? simpson, i.j., et al., air quality in the industrial heartland of alberta, canada and potential impacts on human health. characterization of trace gases measured over alberta oil sands mining operations: 76 speciated c2-c10 volatile organic compounds, and they list what they are. this is from two peer-reviewed papers. is this what the republicans do first? i thought we wanted to make people healthy. it is one thing to want to repeal the affordable care act, which now, in my state, has reduced the uninsured by close to 50 percent--that is bad enough. now they want to bring in this oil and help the canadian oil people and it is going to bring all of these carcinogens and all of this pollution to our country. we already know about the people from port arthur, tx, where they have these refineries. look at this picture. a picture is worth a thousand words. i know that is a cliche, but it is a fact. i could try to explain to my colleagues what happens near the playground when this stuff is refined. one might say, oh, that is nice, barbara, but are you really making this up? no. here it is. look at it. they suffer asthma, respiratory ailments, skin irritations, and cancer. this is what happens, right near a playground. now, there are some politicians down there saying, bring it on. we want it. we like it. but talk to the real people there who live there with children. they have had enough of tar sands. they have had it up to here with them. they want none of it. let's not forget about the waste. once they burn all of this stuff, they have waste left over. it is called petcoke, petroleum coke. look at this. this is what it looks like, as shown in this picture. it is stored in the midwest. a lot of it is stored in the midwest. what happens? in this photograph we can see it is not wet, so it can blow in the wind. billowing black clouds have contaminated our children. they contain heavy metals. children playing baseball have been forced off the field to seek cover from the clouds of black dust that pelted homes and cars. this happened. this is why my friend senator durbin is so concerned, because it happened to his little league players in the chicago area. when inhaled, these particles can increase the number and severity of asthma attacks. they can aggravate bronchitis--i am coughing just at the thought of it--lung disease. they reduce the body's ability to fight infections. where does that come from? i will say it again. when inhaled, these particles can increase the number and severity of asthma attacks, cause or aggravate bronchitis and other lung diseases, and reduce the body's ability to fight infections. what is the source of that? california air resources board, air pollution particulate matter brochure dated may 6, 2009. so i don't know how exposing americans to this kind of pollution is in the national interests. i believe instead of waiving all of the environmental reports as my republican friends do in their bill, they ought to call for more studies on the health impact of the tar sands oil so our families know what they are going to get with this pipeline. also there are spills to worry about. not only is the keystone tar sands [[page s157]] pipeline harmful to human health, it hurts environments and communities located near it, because if there is a spill, it is the toughest kind of oil to clean up. here is the source for that: the epa nepa compliance comment letter, state department. that is what they talk about. we have had spills at the tar sands--spills in michigan, spills in arkansas. if my colleagues don't believe me, ask those folks. do my colleagues know in 2010 a pipeline ruptured and spilled over a million gallons of tar sands oil into the kalamazoo river in michigan? the local health department ordered the evacuation of 50 households and approximately 100 families were advised not to drink the water. the michigan spill was the largest inland spill in u.s. history and more than 40 years and $1 billion later, it is not cleaned up. so wait a minute. let's review. republicans take over and the first bill they give us is the tar sands bill. the only people it helps, in my opinion, backed up by fact, are canadian oil interests. the only jobs it creates permanently are 35 jobs. what it does to our health is a disaster, because the tar sands oil is the most toxic, dirty type of oil, and if there is a spill, it is the hardest to clean up. who do we think is paying the $1 billion to clean up a tar sand spill in michigan? i can tell my colleagues. it is probably most of the government. maybe we are trying to collect some from the private sector. if my colleagues don't believe me about michigan, let's turn to mayflower, ar. this is a beautiful neighborhood of homes, as shown in this picture. this is filthy, dirty, disgusting oil and the camera is taking pictures of it. in 2013, 200,000 gallons of tar sands burst from a pipeline, because it is volatile. it burst from the pipeline and spilled into the streets of a subdivision. it forced the evacuation and abandonment of 22 homes--residents who were exposed to high levels of benzene, a known carcinogen, and hydrogen sulfide. people in this community--not some made-up, mystical community or mythical community-- in this community they suffered dizziness, nausea, headaches, respiratory problems, all classic symptoms of exposure to the chemicals found in the tar sands. so remember this picture and remember the picture of the filthy, dirty oil and the petcoke, because a picture tells a thousand words, and that is the picture my friends want to make a reality in america. their first great bill, their first great contribution to the economy, 35 jobs. please. we can do better. we can work together on a highway bill, on a transportation bill. we do so well on that. and we can add millions of jobs, especially in the construction industry. now there is the issue of climate change. we know we are dealing with a lot of deniers on the other side of the aisle. they deny climate change is real. it doesn't matter what we tell them. july was the hottest month, august was the hottest month, and september was the hottest month in 2014. we know what is happening. the world knows what is happening. we have deniers here, so they deny any problem and they go rush to build the keystone pipeline. what will happen is the keystone pipeline will undermine our efforts to address climate change. the state department's own analysis says a barrel of tar sands oil carried by the keystone tar sands pipeline will create at least 17 percent more carbon pollution than domestic oil. peer-reviewed research estimates that the increase in oil consumption caused by keystone could result in up to 110 million metric tons of carbon pollution each year--four times the state department's estimate. so this is even more than the state department says. the source there is erickson et al., ``nature climate change.'' that is a peer-reviewed study as well. this is equivalent to carbon pollution adding 23 million new cars to the road or building 29 coal-fired powerplants. so the state department is very modest in its projection. even that is too much. here is more. here is the state department. that is the 17 percent quote. and it could add up to an additional 27 million metric tons of carbon pollution each year. that is more of the state department. this is their modest conclusion. we believe the peer-reviewed study shows it is far worse than even the state department says. if you don't believe climate change is a problem, i am really sorry for your constituency because let me tell you what scientists are saying. and i am saying it is 98 percent of scientists. let's be clear. ninety-eight percent of scientists say climate change is real, and 2 percent say: we are not so sure. so my friends side with the 2 percent. suppose one of my friends didn't feel well and went to the doctor, and the doctor said: i am sorry to tell you this, sir, but you have a cancer that is raging over your body, and we need to operate today. you say: i want a second opinion. that is good. you go get a second opinion. the second doctor says: absolutely, you better get that operation. you say: well, i want a third opinion. all right. i understand it. you go for a third opinion. absolutely, those two doctors were right, but you keep going, and you get nine opinions that all say: sir, you are a dead man if you don't get this operation. and then you find the 10th, and he says: you know, just go on a vegetarian diet, and you will be fine. if you listen to that one out of 10 doctors, there is something wrong with you. it is just like big tobacco. they did the same thing. they said: oh, tobacco is fine, not a problem--until we realized there was a whole campaign by the big tobacco companies to turn us away from the fact that tobacco causes cancer. that is the truth. guess what we found out. in a union of concerned scientists expose, they found out that the same people who led that fight of tobacco denial are leading the fight of climate denial. if this was just going to hurt you, i say to my republican friends rhetorically, i wouldn't care. i mean, i would be really sad and sorry if one of my friends went to the doctor and didn't listen to the best advice. but you know what. that hurts him. i would be miserable, and i would try to talk him out of it. but this is about my constituents and the people of this country. i have to say this is wrong. this is just wrong. this is an opportunity to bring the parties together. we could have done it around so many issues and in particular the highway bill. so common sense tells us this isn't the right thing to do. we are looking at unleashing this dirty, filthy oil. it is going to be harmful to our families' health. it is going to worsen the impact of climate change. it will not create the jobs we need to create. again, i urge my colleagues vote no. it is not ready for prime time. there are going to be amendments that will reveal the fact that if

don't we make this deal here? why don't we put people to work here? that is not in this bill. this bill is not ready. this bill does not help us; this bill hurts us. i know my friends came here to make this country better. i think they think it helps. i don't question that. but if you look at all of the facts--and i have them lined up here, one after the other--whether it is the jobs impact,

MADELEINE Z. BORDALLO of guam in the house of representatives Monday, January 12, 2015 Ms. BORDALLO. Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize the nearly four decades of service of my former colleague Congressman Eni Faleomavaega of American Samoa. After nearly four decades on Capitol Hill, American Samoa's longest serving Member of Congress and the first Asian Pacific American in U.S. history to become chairman and ranking member of the House Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on Asia and the Pacific, bid farewell to colleagues and friends at a reception on Capitol Hill held in his honor on Wednesday, November 19th. The farewell reception for Faleomavaega included Members of Congress from the House and Senate, both Republicans and Democrats, ambassadors, foreign delegations, and their family members. They paid tribute to the man they call ``Our Eni,'' and did so by sharing memories from their years together. Congressman Eni F.H. Faleomavaega, beloved by so many on the Hill, first came to Capitol Hill in the 1970s and served as Chief of Staff to the late Paramount Chief A.U. Fuimaono, American Samoa's first Representative in Congress, and as staff counsel to the late Congressman Phil Burton of San Francisco before he became American Samoa's Representative in 1989. As a reflection of Faleomavaega's genuine kindness that touched so many and his bipartisan approach that reached across party lines, the reception was attended by many, including House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi and her husband Paul. Leader Pelosi shared memories of Faleomavaega in their early years with Congressman Phil Burton long before she and Faleomavaega were both elected to Congress. ``Eni, you are family from the Burtons on,'' Leader Pelosi stated. The Pelosis visited privately with Faleomavaega and his family, including his wife, Mrs. Hinanui Hunkin, and his daughter and son-in-law, Leonne and Fui Vakapuna. Current and former members of the House Foreign Affairs Committee also attended. Republican Senator Jeff Flake of Arizona, who first came to the Hill as a Representative from Arizona's 1st District in 2001, expressed his gratitude to Faleomavaega as a leader, mentor, and friend, including an unforgettable moment with Faleomavaega when the two were on their way to a hearing. Congressman Faleomavaega was in an elevator with a good number of Samoan visitors whom the Senator described as all resembling NFL linebackers. Faleomavaega immediately held the elevator door open when he saw his friend coming down the hallway. Mr. Flake squeezed in to the elevator but once the door closed, rather than ascend to the next floor, the elevator dropped a few feet and the entire group was trapped for about twenty minutes before they were rescued. Senator Flake joked that the irony of it all was that the hearing was on submerged lands. In his message to Faleomavaega, Senator Flake stated, ``Eni, I have such good memories of our time together. Thanks for being such a good friend and mentor to me, and such a good example of a disciple of Christ. I look forward to working with you on a range of issues in the future. With admiration, Jeff Flake, U.S. Senate.'' Hawai`i Senator Mazie Hirono, reminisced with Faleomavaega about their early years in the House together and conveyed how much she will miss him being an honorary member of the Hawai`i State delegation. Over the years, because of his close ties to Hawai`i and friendship with the delegation, Faleomavaega was always invited to speak at the annual King Kamehameha Lei Draping Ceremony. The Senator also shared how, whenever Faleomavaega had the opportunity, he always reminded President Obama that Kahuku (Faleomavaega's alma mater) is better than Punahou (the President's alma mater). ``To my brother,'' Senator Hirono stated, ``Thank you for all the kokua. Kahuku High, here I come! Take care, aloha.'' In a surprise tribute to the Congressman, former Hawai`i Senator Daniel Akaka, whom Faleomavaega affectionately calls by his Hawaiian name, ``Kaniela'', also joined in on the reception from his home in Hawai`i via telephone. The pair, who for many years were the only Members of Congress with Polynesian ancestry and who were also founding members of the Congressional Asian Pacific American Caucus, laughed about their imaginary ``Polynesian Caucus'' in which Senator Akaka was the chair and Faleomavaega was the secretary. Senator Akaka thanked his ``brother'' Faleomavaega and his wife, Hina, for their years of friendship to him and his wife ``Aunty Millie'' all the way back to when Faleomavaega was first elected. Congressman Charles Rangel of New York and Congresswoman Grace Napolitano of California shared their admiration for Faleomavaega's decades of service, noting how much personal dedication and family sacrifice is required to be a Member of Congress. Congressman Rangel stated, ``Eni, the Congress will miss you so much and I even more'' and added that when Congress loses one of its devoted servants, a family gains a husband, father, and grandfather. Congresswoman Napolitano said, ``Eni, my friend, I will miss your smiling face'' and shared how being so far from home in Washington, D.C. makes her miss her grandchildren, to which Faleomavaega replied, ``I don't even know how to be a grandpa!'' The Congressman's youngest daughter, Leonne, who was only two years old when Faleomavaega was first elected to Congress and who is now a wife and mother, smiled and gave her dad a big hug. Republican Congresswoman, Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, former chair of the House Foreign [[Page E48]] Affairs Committee, said ``I'm gonna miss you, amigo!'' as Faleomavaega introduced her to all the famous Samoans pictured in photos around his office. When they came to a picture of Faleomavaega with Dwayne ``The Rock'' Johnson, she asked, ``Do you really know Dwayne Johnson?'' Without skipping a beat, the Congressman replied, ``Of course I do. His mom is my cousin!'' Ms. Ros-Lehtinen, who represents Florida's 27th District including Miami, where Dwayne Johnson lives, said, ``Everyone is your cousin, Eni. And he's my constituent!'' When they came across Faleomavaega's centerpiece photo from the 1960s featuring him with Elvis in Hawai`i, the Congresswoman laughed, ``Elvis is Samoan too? You do know everybody Eni, even Elvis! I already like you. But now I like you even more.'' Congresswoman Madeleine Bordallo of Guam brought her entire staff to bid farewell to Faleomavaega. ``Hafa Adai! To our friend Eni from the Guam office! I will always remember our many years together in Congress. You were a dear friend and you helped me along with advice during my early years! One memory I will take with me is our CODEL to American Samoa. What a fiesta that was!!! Love, Madeleine and from all your friends on Guam!'' Other Members, including Congressman Steve Chabot (R-OH), Congressman David Cicilline (D-RI), Congressman John Conyers (D-MI), Congressman Eliot Engel (D-NY), Congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard (D-HI), Congressman Mike Honda (D-CA), Congressman Gregory Meeks (D-NY), Congresswoman Grace Meng (D-NY), Congressman Nick Rahall (D-WV), Congressman Gregorio Kilili Camacho Sablan (D-MP), Congressman Brad Sherman (D-CA), and former Congressman Solomon Ortiz (D-TX) also attended Faleomavaega's farewell reception. Several who attended wrote the following in Faleomavaega's guestbook. ``You are my buddy and you always will be!''--Congressman Dana Rohrabacher (R-CA). ``To a dear dear friend. You have made a giant difference in the lives of so many! Thank you, thank you so much, Sheila!''-- Congresswoman Sheila Jackson Lee (D-TX). ``I've really enjoyed serving with you. You've done a great job!''-- Congressman Buck McKeon (R-CA). ``The mark of success is not measured in what you've accomplished but rather in the lives that you have touched. Eni you've touched so many lives in your years of service, you're the definition of success. Be well my friend.''--Congressman Ami Bera (D-CA). ``Hermano, you are the best. We will see you soon!''--Congressman Henry Cuellar (D-TX). Ambassadors and delegations from the Asia-Pacific region, including Korea, Vietnam, Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar, Kazakhstan, Taiwan, Pakistan, and Uzbekistan, also expressed their gratitude to Faleomavaega. From Myanmar: ``On behalf of the Myanmar Government, I wish to extend our sincere gratitude to you for your kind contribution toward promoting Myanmar-U.S. relations as well as for your country.'' From Pakistan: ``The Embassy of Pakistan deeply appreciates gracious support received by your office. Thank you.'' From Vietnam: ``Brother Eni, we love you so much. Thank God for helping us meet each other on the earth!'' Also from Vietnam: ``We'll keep you forever in our heart, millions of Vietnamese will do.'' Faleomavaega expressed his gratitude and appreciation to all who attended. ``I am deeply appreciative of the opportunity to have worked with such distinguished leaders during my time in Washington, DC. The memories we built are priceless and I wish my friends and colleagues and the people of American Samoa continued success and happiness,'' Faleomavaega concluded. As you can see his years of service have had a tremendous impact on U.S. policy in American Samoa and on U.S. foreign policy across the globe. I wish him the best in his future endeavors. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 5 (Monday, January 12, 2015)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Pages E47-E48] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] HONORING CONGRESSMAN ENI FALEOMAVAEGA OF AMERICAN SAMOA FOR HIS NEARLY FOUR DECADES OF SERVICE TO THE CONGRESS OF THE UNITED STATES ______ HON.

Other Members, including Congressman Steve Chabot (R-OH), Congressman David Cicilline (D-RI), Congressman John Conyers (D-MI), Congressman Eliot Engel (D-NY), Congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard (D-HI), Congressman Mike Honda (D-CA), Congressman Gregory Meeks (D-NY), Congresswoman Grace Meng (D-NY), Congressman Nick Rahall (D-WV), Congressman Gregorio Kilili Camacho Sablan (D-MP), Congressman Brad Sherman (D-CA), and former Congressman Solomon Ortiz (D-TX) also attended Faleomavaega's farewell reception. Several who attended wrote the following in Faleomavaega's guestbook. ``You are my buddy and you always will be!''--Congressman Dana Rohrabacher (R-CA). ``To a dear dear friend. You have made a giant difference in the lives of so many! Thank you, thank you so much, Sheila!''-- Congresswoman Sheila Jackson Lee (D-TX). ``I've really enjoyed serving with you. You've done a great job!''-- Congressman Buck McKeon (R-CA). ``The mark of success is not measured in what you've accomplished but rather in the lives that you have touched. Eni you've touched so many lives in your years of service, you're the definition of success. Be well my friend.''--Congressman Ami Bera (D-CA). ``Hermano, you are the best. We will see you soon!''--Congressman Henry Cuellar (D-TX). Ambassadors and delegations from the Asia-Pacific region, including Korea, Vietnam, Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar, Kazakhstan, Taiwan, Pakistan, and Uzbekistan, also expressed their gratitude to Faleomavaega. From Myanmar: ``On behalf of the Myanmar Government, I wish to extend our sincere gratitude to you for your kind contribution toward promoting Myanmar-U.S. relations as well as for your country.'' From Pakistan: ``The Embassy of Pakistan deeply appreciates gracious support received by your office. Thank you.'' From Vietnam: ``Brother Eni, we love you so much. Thank God for helping us meet each other on the earth!'' Also from Vietnam: ``We'll keep you forever in our heart, millions of Vietnamese will do.'' Faleomavaega expressed his gratitude and appreciation to all who attended. ``I am deeply appreciative of the opportunity to have worked with such distinguished leaders during my time in Washington, DC. The memories we built are priceless and I wish my friends and colleagues and the people of American Samoa continued success and happiness,'' Faleomavaega concluded. As you can see his years of service have had a tremendous impact on U.S. policy in American Samoa and on U.S. foreign policy across the globe. I wish him the best in his future endeavors. ____________________",package_114_129.csv,9685,9685,9753,"[congressional record volume 161, number 5 (monday, january 12, 2015)] [extensions of remarks] [pages e47-e48] from the congressional record online through the government publishing office [ www.gpo.gov ] honoring congressman eni faleomavaega of american samoa for his nearly four decades of service to the congress of the united states ______ hon. madeleine z. bordallo of guam in the house of representatives monday, january 12, 2015 ms. bordallo. mr. speaker, i rise to recognize the nearly four decades of service of my former colleague congressman eni faleomavaega of american samoa. after nearly four decades on capitol hill, american samoa's longest serving member of congress and the first asian pacific american in u.s. history to become chairman and ranking member of the house foreign affairs subcommittee on asia and the pacific, bid farewell to colleagues and friends at a reception on capitol hill held in his honor on wednesday, november 19th. the farewell reception for faleomavaega included members of congress from the house and senate, both republicans and democrats, ambassadors, foreign delegations, and their family members. they paid tribute to the man they call ``our eni,'' and did so by sharing memories from their years together. congressman eni f.h. faleomavaega, beloved by so many on the hill, first came to capitol hill in the 1970s and served as chief of staff to the late paramount chief a.u. fuimaono, american samoa's first representative in congress, and as staff counsel to the late congressman phil burton of san francisco before he became american samoa's representative in 1989. as a reflection of faleomavaega's genuine kindness that touched so many and his bipartisan approach that reached across party lines, the reception was attended by many, including house democratic leader nancy pelosi and her husband paul. leader pelosi shared memories of faleomavaega in their early years with congressman phil burton long before she and faleomavaega were both elected to congress. ``eni, you are family from the burtons on,'' leader pelosi stated. the pelosis visited privately with faleomavaega and his family, including his wife, mrs. hinanui hunkin, and his daughter and son-in-law, leonne and fui vakapuna. current and former members of the house foreign affairs committee also attended. republican senator jeff flake of arizona, who first came to the hill as a representative from arizona's 1st district in 2001, expressed his gratitude to faleomavaega as a leader, mentor, and friend, including an unforgettable moment with faleomavaega when the two were on their way to a hearing. congressman faleomavaega was in an elevator with a good number of samoan visitors whom the senator described as all resembling nfl linebackers. faleomavaega immediately held the elevator door open when he saw his friend coming down the hallway. mr. flake squeezed in to the elevator but once the door closed, rather than ascend to the next floor, the elevator dropped a few feet and the entire group was trapped for about twenty minutes before they were rescued. senator flake joked that the irony of it all was that the hearing was on submerged lands. in his message to faleomavaega, senator flake stated, ``eni, i have such good memories of our time together. thanks for being such a good friend and mentor to me, and such a good example of a disciple of christ. i look forward to working with you on a range of issues in the future. with admiration, jeff flake, u.s. senate.'' hawai`i senator mazie hirono, reminisced with faleomavaega about their early years in the house together and conveyed how much she will miss him being an honorary member of the hawai`i state delegation. over the years, because of his close ties to hawai`i and friendship with the delegation, faleomavaega was always invited to speak at the annual king kamehameha lei draping ceremony. the senator also shared how, whenever faleomavaega had the opportunity, he always reminded president obama that kahuku (faleomavaega's alma mater) is better than punahou (the president's alma mater). ``to my brother,'' senator hirono stated, ``thank you for all the kokua. kahuku high, here i come! take care, aloha.'' in a surprise tribute to the congressman, former hawai`i senator daniel akaka, whom faleomavaega affectionately calls by his hawaiian name, ``kaniela'', also joined in on the reception from his home in hawai`i via telephone. the pair, who for many years were the only members of congress with polynesian ancestry and who were also founding members of the congressional asian pacific american caucus, laughed about their imaginary ``polynesian caucus'' in which senator akaka was the chair and faleomavaega was the secretary. senator akaka thanked his ``brother'' faleomavaega and his wife, hina, for their years of friendship to him and his wife ``aunty millie'' all the way back to when faleomavaega was first elected. congressman charles rangel of new york and congresswoman grace napolitano of california shared their admiration for faleomavaega's decades of service, noting how much personal dedication and family sacrifice is required to be a member of congress. congressman rangel stated, ``eni, the congress will miss you so much and i even more'' and added that when congress loses one of its devoted servants, a family gains a husband, father, and grandfather. congresswoman napolitano said, ``eni, my friend, i will miss your smiling face'' and shared how being so far from home in washington, d.c. makes her miss her grandchildren, to which faleomavaega replied, ``i don't even know how to be a grandpa!'' the congressman's youngest daughter, leonne, who was only two years old when faleomavaega was first elected to congress and who is now a wife and mother, smiled and gave her dad a big hug. republican congresswoman, ileana ros-lehtinen, former chair of the house foreign [[page e48]] affairs committee, said ``i'm gonna miss you, amigo!'' as faleomavaega introduced her to all the famous samoans pictured in photos around his office. when they came to a picture of faleomavaega with dwayne ``the rock'' johnson, she asked, ``do you really know dwayne johnson?'' without skipping a beat, the congressman replied, ``of course i do. his mom is my cousin!'' ms. ros-lehtinen, who represents florida's 27th district including miami, where dwayne johnson lives, said, ``everyone is your cousin, eni. and he's my constituent!'' when they came across faleomavaega's centerpiece photo from the 1960s featuring him with elvis in hawai`i, the congresswoman laughed, ``elvis is samoan too? you do know everybody eni, even elvis! i already like you. but now i like you even more.'' congresswoman madeleine bordallo of guam brought her entire staff to bid farewell to faleomavaega. ``hafa adai! to our friend eni from the guam office! i will always remember our many years together in congress. you were a dear friend and you helped me along with advice during my early years! one memory i will take with me is our codel to american samoa. what a fiesta that was!!! love, madeleine and from all your friends on guam!'' other members, including congressman steve chabot (r-oh), congressman david cicilline (d-ri), congressman john conyers (d-mi), congressman eliot engel (d-ny), congresswoman tulsi gabbard (d-hi), congressman mike honda (d-ca), congressman gregory meeks (d-ny), congresswoman grace meng (d-ny), congressman nick rahall (d-wv), congressman gregorio kilili camacho sablan (d-mp), congressman brad sherman (d-ca), and former congressman solomon ortiz (d-tx) also attended faleomavaega's farewell reception. several who attended wrote the following in faleomavaega's guestbook. ``you are my buddy and you always will be!''--congressman dana rohrabacher (r-ca). ``to a dear dear friend. you have made a giant difference in the lives of so many! thank you, thank you so much, sheila!''-- congresswoman sheila jackson lee (d-tx). ``i've really enjoyed serving with you. you've done a great job!''-- congressman buck mckeon (r-ca). ``the mark of success is not measured in what you've accomplished but rather in the lives that you have touched. eni you've touched so many lives in your years of service, you're the definition of success. be well my friend.''--congressman ami bera (d-ca). ``hermano, you are the best. we will see you soon!''--congressman henry cuellar (d-tx). ambassadors and delegations from the asia-pacific region, including korea, vietnam, cambodia, laos, myanmar, kazakhstan, taiwan, pakistan, and uzbekistan, also expressed their gratitude to faleomavaega. from myanmar: ``on behalf of the myanmar government, i wish to extend our sincere gratitude to you for your kind contribution toward promoting myanmar-u.s. relations as well as for your country.'' from pakistan: ``the embassy of pakistan deeply appreciates gracious support received by your office. thank you.'' from vietnam: ``brother eni, we love you so much. thank god for helping us meet each other on the earth!'' also from vietnam: ``we'll keep you forever in our heart, millions of vietnamese will do.'' faleomavaega expressed his gratitude and appreciation to all who attended. ``i am deeply appreciative of the opportunity to have worked with such distinguished leaders during my time in washington, dc. the memories we built are priceless and i wish my friends and colleagues and the people of american samoa continued success and happiness,'' faleomavaega concluded. as you can see his years of service have had a tremendous impact on u.s. policy in american samoa and on u.s. foreign policy across the globe. i wish him the best in his future endeavors. ____________________",9685
CREC-2015-01-12-pt1-PgE48-3,CREC-2015-01-12,114,HONORING LARRY BLAKENEY FOR HIS EXCEPTIONAL CONTRIBUTION TO ALABAMA ATHLETICS,"[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 5 (Monday, January 12, 2015)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Pages E48-E49] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] HONORING LARRY BLAKENEY FOR HIS EXCEPTIONAL CONTRIBUTION TO ALABAMA ATHLETICS ______ HON. MARTHA ROBY of alabama in the house of representatives Monday, January 12, 2015 Mrs. ROBY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Mr. Larry Blakeney, an exceptional Alabamian who has made an enormous contribution to athletics and the development of young people in my state. Coach Blakeney is best known as the head coach of the Troy University Trojan football [[Page E49]] team, a position he held for 24 years, retiring this past December. During that time, Coach Blakeney built a little-known Southeast Alabama team into a conference powerhouse and a nationally-competitive program. His remarkable career at Troy has included six 10-win seasons, five Sunbelt Conference championships, and 178 wins--a total that places him among the top three Alabama college coaches, behind the legendary Paul ``Bear'' Bryant and just ahead of his mentor and winningest Auburn coach Ralph ``Shug'' Jordan. Among the defining characteristics of Larry Blakeney-coached teams was the fearless attitude they took into competition. ``Any team, anytime, anywhere'' was Troy's motto, never phased or intimidated by traditional college football powers. And the Trojans would not just compete against the best, they would win. Simply put, Larry Blakeney has personified Troy Football, so much so that the field on which the Trojans play bears his name. Larry Blakeney's impact on the game of football in Alabama started as a player in high school, when he led the Gordo Green Wave to a record of 24-2-2 and three-straight Warrior Conference championships. He enrolled at Auburn University, where he became the first sophomore to start at quarterback under Coach Ralph ``Shug'' Jordan, a distinction that even Auburn Heisman winner Pat Sullivan does not share. Blakeney began his coaching career in the high school ranks, first at Southern Academy, then Walker High School and Vestavia Hills High School. He was then hired at his beloved alma mater, Auburn, where he served as an assistant coach for 14 seasons. Auburn would experience one of its most successful runs ever with Coach Blakeney calling plays, including three-straight SEC championships in 1987, 1988 and 1989. Coach Blakeney's success and championship drive made him the perfect choice to lead Troy's burgeoning football program beginning in 1991. His success on the gridiron has led to many accolades, including multiple ``Coach of the Year'' honors and placement in the Alabama Sports Hall of Fame. However, Coach Blakeney's impact goes far beyond the playing field. From Gordo to Auburn to Troy, he has maintained close, warm relationships with his teammates, fellow coaches, and players. The Auburn Creed, which outlines how Auburn men and women are supposed to live, emphasizes ``the human touch,'' which cultivates love, understanding and sympathy with your fellow man. Larry Blakeney personifies and embodies that ``human touch'' to a great and rare degree. Hundreds and perhaps thousands of once-young men are, today, better husbands, fathers, and citizens because of the positive influence of Coach Blakeney; a good man who used the game of football to teach integrity, character, and perseverance throughout his entire career. Mr. Speaker, it is my privilege to acknowledge Coach Blakeney's positive impact on young people in Alabama, to celebrate his remarkable career, and to honor his place among the greatest college football coaches to walk the sidelines in my state. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 5 (Monday, January 12, 2015)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Pages E48-E49] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] HONORING LARRY BLAKENEY FOR HIS EXCEPTIONAL CONTRIBUTION TO ALABAMA ATHLETICS ______ HON.

BEN RAY LUJAAN of new mexico in the house of representatives Monday, January 12, 2015 Mr. BEN RAY LUJAAN of New Mexico. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the 100th anniversary of the Kiwanis Club, as well as the outstanding work of the Kiwanis Club of Santa Fe. While the Kiwanis Club originated as a business fellowship, it has evolved into an important worldwide service organization. Over the years the Kiwanis Club has devoted itself to making a positive impact on the lives of underprivileged children and communities, contributing nearly 150,000 service projects, 6 million hours of service, and $100 million per year to communities around the world. Some of their notable projects include a partnership with UNICEF to eliminate maternal/ neonatal tetanus, a worldwide service project to end Iodine Deficiency Disorder, and the Young Children Priority One program to address the needs of children age 0-5. The Kiwanis Club has truly set an example for selfless and enduring community service. The Kiwanis Club of Santa Fe is an important part of the international Kiwanis Club organization. Originally formed on April 25, 1921, the Club has had a significant impact on the children and community of Santa Fe. In addition to helping over 155 students with more than $450,000 for college scholarships, the Club has also had an important hand in many community service projects, such as the organization of the annual Pinewood Derby, building a computer lab for St. Catherine's Indian school, and the Kamp Kiwanis camping facility and program for handicapped children. Moreover, the Club has helped organize and produce the annual Zozobra event, one of the oldest celebrations in North America and a tradition that is dear to all New Mexicans. The Kiwanis Club of Santa Fe has had a tremendous effect on the city of Santa Fe and has truly helped make a difference in its community. I applaud the Kiwanis Club of Santa Fe for setting an example of dedicated community service for the people of New Mexico. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 5 (Monday, January 12, 2015)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E48] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] IN RECOGNITION OF THE KIWANIS CLUB 100TH ANNIVERSARY ______ HON.

ADAM B. SCHIFF of california in the house of representatives Monday, January 12, 2015 Mr. SCHIFF. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the Armenian Sisters' Academy of Los Angeles upon its thirtieth anniversary. The Armenian Sisters' Academy of Los Angeles (ASA), nestled in the foothills of the Verdugo Mountains in Montrose, offers a Day Care Program, Preschool, Kindergarten and grades 1st through 8th. Established in 1985, the ASA is one of three schools in the United States operated and governed by the only existing Catholic Order of the Armenian Sisters of the Immaculate Conception, which was founded in 1847. The other two schools are located in Radnor, Pennsylvania and Lexington, Massachusetts, established in 1967 and 1979, respectively. Since its inception, the ASA has been committed to providing an exemplary and well-rounded education to its students. The ASA offers a bilingual curriculum, art, music and computer instruction to all students, and has been successful in preserving the identity and culture of the Armenian people by teaching the Armenian language, Armenian cultural courses and religion. The ASA also offers after school extracurricular activities such as Armenian dance classes, basketball and volleyball. The Armenian Sisters' Academy of Los Angeles is dedicated to the development of the child spiritually, personally, emotionally, intellectually and socially. Among the many goals and objectives the ASA strives to achieve include providing each student with a respectful and optimistic environment in which each student feels encouraged, creating an atmosphere where the Armenian language, heritage and culture may be taught and experienced, emphasizing the heritage, privileges and responsibilities of American citizenship, and encouraging small group work and the increased use of independent study. I commend the ASA for being an integral part of the community, and applaud the school's unwavering commitment to our youth. The ASA plays a central role in shaping our children into responsible citizens and thriving members of society. I ask all Members to join me in congratulating the Armenian Sisters' Academy of Los Angeles for thirty years of dedicated service to the community. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 5 (Monday, January 12, 2015)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E48] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] TRIBUTE TO THE ARMENIAN SISTERS' ACADEMY OF LOS ANGELES ______ HON.

Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas' application to join the International Criminal Court (ICC) is an affront to all of those who have engaged for years in efforts to accomplish a peaceful resolution to the decades long Israeli-Palestinian conflict. The Palestinian Authority's anticipated war crimes complaint against Israel will, in no uncertain terms, severely hinder future comprehensive peace talks in a time when the advancement of a two-state solution that ensures enduring peace has never been more important.

We cannot stand by while the Palestinian Authority, engaged in a unity government with Hamas, makes frivolous and damaging claims against Israel Defense Forces soldiers and Israeli citizens residing in settlements in the disputed West Bank.

KEN CALVERT of california in the house of representatives Friday, January 9, 2015 Mr. CALVERT. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 3, the Keystone XL [[Page E50]] Pipeline Act. The legislation would immediately authorize the construction, connection, operation, and maintenance of the Keystone XL pipeline. My constituents are sick and tired of the delays in approving and building the Keystone pipeline. The recent drop in gas prices highlights the economic benefits of increased energy production right here in North America. Building the Keystone pipeline will increase access to more North American energy sources and further reduce our dependence on oil from the Middle East. For the first time in decades, North American energy independence is within our grasp if we make the critical investments in the necessary infrastructure. President Obama's opposition to the Keystone pipeline and all of its economic benefits shows just how out of touch he is with middle class working families. The State Department studied the environmental impacts of the Keystone XL pipeline and concluded that it would not have a negative impact. Furthermore, the State Department found that the Keystone XL pipeline project would support roughly 42,000 jobs. Earlier today, the Nebraska Supreme Court dismissed a key lawsuit challenging the Keystone XL pipeline. The passage of H.R. 3 is the tenth bill approved by the House of Representatives to authorize the construction of the Keystone XL pipeline. Thankfully, the new Republican majority in the Senate has indicated it will take action on similar legislation next week. I know my constituents and hardworking American families hope we can finally start construction on this economically important project. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 5 (Monday, January 12, 2015)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Pages E49-E50] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] KEYSTONE XL PIPELINE ACT ______ speech of HON.

KEN CALVERT of california in the house of representatives Monday, January 12, 2015 Mr. CALVERT. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor and pay tribute to an individual whose dedication and contributions to the community of Corona, California are exceptional. Riverside County has been fortunate to have committed community leaders who willingly and unselfishly give their time and talent and make their communities a better place to live and work. Jim Pauly is one of these outstanding individuals. On Thursday, January 15, 2015, Jim Pauly will be honored with the Lifetime Achievement Award at the Corona Chamber of Commerce Installation Dinner. In the history of Corona, California, few individuals can match the years of devoted service Jim has given to his hometown. After attending local schools throughout his childhood, Jim enlisted in the United States Navy during World War II at seventeen years old as a senior at Corona High School. Following his service in the Armed Forces, Jim returned to attend Chaffey College. In 1947, Jim began working full time at Emerson's Men Clothes. Due to his strong work ethic and commitment to the business, Jim became a partner, changing the name to Emerson-Pauly Menswear. After thriving for over fifty years in Corona retail, Jim retired and closed the storefront in 1993. Jim's commitment to the business community is only matched by his devotion to service and leadership. Jim regularly contributes to the community through work on the Charity Solicitation Committee as Vice Chairman of the Downtown Corona Redevelopment Project and as the Chairman of the Corona Parking Authority. Additionally, Jim is involved in several local organizations, frequently offering his guidance. Jim was a member of the 20-30 Club and acted as the president in 1959. As a fifty eight year member of Elks Lodge, Jim served as Lodge Leader in 1959. Jim also holds fifty-five years of membership with the Rotary Club and served as the organization's president in 1965. Finally, in 1966, Jim was appointed to the Corona-Norco Unified School District Board of Trustees. Due to his exceptional work, he was elected twice more to continue to build a strong foundation for the Corona-Norco Unified School District. In light of all Jim has done for the community of Corona, it is clear he fully deserves the Corona Chamber of Commerce's Lifetime Achievement award. Jim's tireless passion for community service has contributed immensely to the betterment of Corona, California. He has been the heart and soul of many community organizations, and I am proud to call him a fellow community member, American and friend. I know that many community members are grateful for his service and salute him as he receives this prestigious award. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 5 (Monday, January 12, 2015)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E50] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] TRIBUTE TO JIM PAULY ______ HON.

KEN CALVERT of california in the house of representatives Monday, January 12, 2015 Mr. CALVERT. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor and pay tribute to an individual whose dedication and contributions to the community of Corona, California are exceptional. Corona has been fortunate to have dynamic and dedicated community leaders who willingly and unselfishly give their time and talent and make their communities a better place to live and work. Wayne Keith is certainly one of these individuals. On Thursday, January 15, 2015, Wayne will be honored with the Lifetime Achievement Award at the Corona Chamber of Commerce Installation Dinner. Following his graduation from Iowa State College, Wayne took his Bachelor's Degree in Mechanical Engineering to the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics, known today as NASA. Following his time there, Wayne then took a position with the Aluminum Company of America, ALCOA, in 1945, where he would remain for forty years. After dedicating his time and efforts to offices in Cleveland, Detroit, New Kensington and Pittsburg, Wayne found his home in Corona where he acted as general manager until his retirement from the plant in 1986. In addition to his strong work ethic, Wayne also exemplifies what it means to be a volunteer. After moving to Corona in 1969, Wayne immediately involved himself in the growing Corona community in a variety of capacities. Wayne took on many leadership positions with organizations such as the United Way, Corona Rotary Club, Good Samaritan Boys Home, First Congressional Church, Navy League, Peppermint Ridge, YMCA, The Greater Corona Chamber of Commerce, Corona Community Hospital, Norco-Corona Unified School District, California Manufacturer's Association and the Wagner Foundation. Few citizens can match the years of service Wayne has generously donated to the Corona community. Given all of the contributions Wayne has made, he has received many prestigious honors. In 1975, Wayne was deemed Citizen of the Year by the Corona Chamber of Commerce. Wayne has also been the recipient of other prominent awards such as the Corona Chamber's ``George'' Award, the Corona Community Hospital Volunteers Award, Peppermint Ridge's Golden Hinge Award and the Ira D. Calvert Distinguished Service Award due to his outstanding leadership and significant contributions to the Corona community. In light of all that Wayne has done for the community of Corona, it is clear he fully deserves the Corona Chamber of Commerce's Lifetime Achievement award.

CHRIS VAN HOLLEN of maryland in the house of representatives Friday, January 9, 2015 Mr. VAN HOLLEN. Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to H.R. 3, which would circumvent the legal approval process and grant blanket automatic authority for TransCanada to ``construct, connect, operate, and maintain'' the Keystone XL pipeline and cross-border facilities. Every cross-border pipeline must undergo a vetting process to make sure that it is in the national interest. This process has been ongoing at the State Department and has been complicated by disputes over the route, most notably in Nebraska, where their Supreme Court ruled on the issue just this morning. Today's legislation would provide a special deal for one company to bypass federal permitting requirements. Additionally, the oil that would be transported by Keystone XL, tar sands oil, is currently exempt from the Oil Spill Liability Trust Fund that is used to fund the response to leaks and accidents. This means that the American public would bear the risks for the immediate cleanup costs from any potential accidents or leaks from the pipeline. Congressman Earl Blumenauer introduced legislation last night, which I am proud to cosponsor, to close that loophole and ensure that TransCanada and other companies transporting tar sands oil share responsibility for those costs by paying into the Oil Spill Liability Trust Fund. Democrats are offering a motion today to address this issue for the oil that would be transported through the Keystone XL pipeline, and I hope my Republican colleagues will work with us to close this loophole. Ultimately, there is no reason to give special treatment to a single, foreign company, which would be exempt from permitting requirements and from paying into the Oil Spill Liability Trust Fund. We should reject this bill and allow the State Department to complete its ongoing review. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 5 (Monday, January 12, 2015)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E51] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] KEYSTONE XL PIPELINE ACT ______ speech of HON.

ILEANA ROS-LEHTINEN of florida in the house of representatives Monday, January 12, 2015 Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, I submit the following: [From National Review Online, Jan. 6, 2015] Yes, Cuba Is a State Sponsor of Terror (By Yleem Poblete & Jason I. Poblete) The most senior U.S. delegation in decades will soon be in Havana to engage a declared enemy of the United States in discussions about ``normalizing'' relations. Covering much more subject matter than routine migration issues, these meetings stem in large measure from the December 17 return of spies to Cuba who are responsible for American deaths. Obama sent three Cuban spies back to the island, trading them for the release of American Alan Gross. Mr. Gross had been held hostage for five years for the ``crime'' of teaching Jewish Cubans how to connect to the Internet. As part of this lopsided deal, the Obama administration also declared American policy a failure and offered a large basket of potential economic and diplomatic benefits. This was a significant ideological and political victory for the Communist regime. [[Page E52]] And there are more rewards in the offing. Administration officials are reportedly considering removing Cuba from the U.S. list of state sponsors of terrorism--a request Raul Castro made in May 2014 and one that the Cuban regime has made many times in recent years. Under Section 6(j) of the Export Administration Act, a country's designation as supporting acts of international terrorism may be rescinded in only two ways. Cuba is not ready to come off that list. Quite the opposite. In the first instance, the President must certify to the Congress that there has been a fundamental change in the leadership and policies of the government in question, as was the case with Iraq after the removal of Saddam Hussein. There is no legitimate way that administration officials can make such a claim with respect to Cuba. Moreover, the criteria for determining such a systemic transformation is clearly defined in the LIBERTAD Act, known as the Helms-Burton law. For starters, as stated in the law, Fidel and Raul Castro cannot be part of the governing structure. That leaves only the second option for removal from the list. To remove Cuba's terrorism designation, the president would need to submit a report to Congress, 45 days prior to the proposed removal, certifying that 1) the regime has not provided any support for international terrorism during the preceding six months and 2) the government has provided assurances that it will not support acts of international terrorism in the future. Most would agree that Cuba fails on both counts. Cuba has supported and provided safe haven to members of the Basque Fatherland and Liberty (ETA) and the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC). Both are U.S.-designated Foreign Terrorist Organizations (FTOs). The Obama administration would therefore need to remove ETA and FARC from the FTO list, before removing Cuba from the state- sponsors-of-terrorism list. Both actions are untenable at this time. Unless Spain's foreign-policy establishment is about to make a radical shift in thinking, ETA remains a terrorist organization and there are ETA sympathizers in Cuba who are wanted for terrible crimes against the Spanish people. As for FARC, despite the faux peace process in Havana the past few months, it continues to carry out violent acts in Colombia, has no plans to lay down arms anytime soon, and has links to al-Qaeda in the Lands of the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM). The ``April 2014 State Department Country Reports on Terrorism,'' however, implied that the only role the Castro regime had with FARC was facilitating travel for the ``peace talks'' between these terrorists and the Colombian government. It further stated that the ETA presence in Cuba is diminished. It would appear that a kinder-and-gentler Cuba narrative is being written to accommodate a preconceived policy outcome. Administration officials have reportedly spent the last two years creating a foundation for Obama's Cuba announcement on December 17--all the while denying any such activity when asked by Congress about related news reports. If this sounds familiar, it's because it closely parallels the script used in the negotiations leading to the release of five Taliban leaders held at Guantanamo in exchange for Bowe Bergdahl. The State Department terrorism report also makes references beyond ETA and FARC--most significantly that Cuba harbors several fugitives of U.S. justice. Terrorists, murderers, and other violent criminals are being protected, well fed, and supported by the Communist regime. Among these is a woman convicted of first-degree murder, Joanne Chesimard. Also known as Assata Shakur, she is on the FBI's Most Wanted Terrorists list for executing a New Jersey State Police trooper. With the help of the Black Liberation Army, she broke out of prison and found refuge in Cuba. According to the FBI, Chesimard ``continues to profess her radical anti- U.S. government ideology.'' New Jersey governor Chris Christie said recently that he wants her back in New Jersey. He'll be waiting a long time. Basing the decision to remove Cuba from the state-sponsors- of-terrorism list solely on these above-referenced examples (there is probably a great deal more in classified form), the president would need to prove that for the six months prior to the proposed rescission, the Cuban dictatorship did not provide any assistance to terrorists and had unconditionally returned U.S. fugitives. But Communist-party officials have already stated publicly that Cuba considers Chesimard a political asylee and, as such, not to be released into U.S. custody. The president would also have to accept as credible the ``assurances'' from the Havana regime that it would not provide support in the future for international terrorism--a difficult task given intelligence gaps highlighted in the State Department's terrorism report. The pertinent section states: ``There was no indication that the Cuban government provided weapons or paramilitary training to terrorist groups,'' but it provides no further data or analysis on these activities. It also fails to address the relationship and cooperation between Cuba and other state sponsors of terrorism such as Iran, or other entities listed on the FTO List. And then there is the question of intelligence tainted and manipulated by Americans spying for the Cuban regime. One of the most notorious of these traitors, Ana Belen Montes, used her position at the Defense Intelligence Agency to provide Cuban handlers copious amounts of highly sensitive data, including military contingency plans, details of intelligence-gathering efforts, and profiles of a broad spectrum of U.S. officials. Congress must therefore require a comprehensive appraisal of the range of Cuba's activities against the U.S. and its interests and priorities before the White House can make any decision on whether Cuba will remain on the terrorism list. The review must cover no less than a 20-year period and include a fresh appraisal of all available raw data used in the Clinton-era Pentagon assessment spearheaded by Montes. The review should include detailed intelligence and analysis of unconventional threats and programs that have dual-use application, such as Cuba's biotech capabilities. The congressional national-security and judiciary committees must be given full access to all files pertaining to the WASP spy network, including data related to the 1996 Brothers to the Rescue shoot-down, as well as damage assessments for all Americans and non-Americans convicted of spying for the Cuban regime. However, if President Obama chooses to proceed irrespective of the aforementioned conditions and determines that Cuba should be removed from the state-sponsors-of-terrorism list, Congress would have only 45 days from the submission date to evaluate the rescission proposal and act accordingly. Members of the House and Senate must therefore be proactive in countering the executive action outlined on December 17 and in preventing further damage. Failure to do so would make Congress complicit in the administration's acquiescence to Cuba's Communist regime; it would undermine American interests and reinforce a message of weakness to other enemies of freedom and security. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 5 (Monday, January 12, 2015)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Pages E51-E52] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] CUBA A SPONSOR OF TERROR ______ HON.

Failure to do so would make Congress complicit in the administration's acquiescence to Cuba's Communist regime; it would undermine American interests and reinforce a message of weakness to other enemies of freedom and security. ____________________",package_114_129.csv,8608,8608,8676,"[congressional record volume 161, number 5 (monday, january 12, 2015)] [extensions of remarks] [pages e51-e52] from the congressional record online through the government publishing office [ www.gpo.gov ] cuba a sponsor of terror ______ hon. ileana ros-lehtinen of florida in the house of representatives monday, january 12, 2015 ms. ros-lehtinen. mr. speaker, i submit the following: [from national review online, jan. 6, 2015] yes, cuba is a state sponsor of terror (by yleem poblete & jason i. poblete) the most senior u.s. delegation in decades will soon be in havana to engage a declared enemy of the united states in discussions about ``normalizing'' relations. covering much more subject matter than routine migration issues, these meetings stem in large measure from the december 17 return of spies to cuba who are responsible for american deaths. obama sent three cuban spies back to the island, trading them for the release of american alan gross. mr. gross had been held hostage for five years for the ``crime'' of teaching jewish cubans how to connect to the internet. as part of this lopsided deal, the obama administration also declared american policy a failure and offered a large basket of potential economic and diplomatic benefits. this was a significant ideological and political victory for the communist regime. [[page e52]] and there are more rewards in the offing. administration officials are reportedly considering removing cuba from the u.s. list of state sponsors of terrorism--a request raul castro made in may 2014 and one that the cuban regime has made many times in recent years. under section 6(j) of the export administration act, a country's designation as supporting acts of international terrorism may be rescinded in only two ways. cuba is not ready to come off that list. quite the opposite. in the first instance, the president must certify to the congress that there has been a fundamental change in the leadership and policies of the government in question, as was the case with iraq after the removal of saddam hussein. there is no legitimate way that administration officials can make such a claim with respect to cuba. moreover, the criteria for determining such a systemic transformation is clearly defined in the libertad act, known as the helms-burton law. for starters, as stated in the law, fidel and raul castro cannot be part of the governing structure. that leaves only the second option for removal from the list. to remove cuba's terrorism designation, the president would need to submit a report to congress, 45 days prior to the proposed removal, certifying that 1) the regime has not provided any support for international terrorism during the preceding six months and 2) the government has provided assurances that it will not support acts of international terrorism in the future. most would agree that cuba fails on both counts. cuba has supported and provided safe haven to members of the basque fatherland and liberty (eta) and the revolutionary armed forces of colombia (farc). both are u.s.-designated foreign terrorist organizations (ftos). the obama administration would therefore need to remove eta and farc from the fto list, before removing cuba from the state- sponsors-of-terrorism list. both actions are untenable at this time. unless spain's foreign-policy establishment is about to make a radical shift in thinking, eta remains a terrorist organization and there are eta sympathizers in cuba who are wanted for terrible crimes against the spanish people. as for farc, despite the faux peace process in havana the past few months, it continues to carry out violent acts in colombia, has no plans to lay down arms anytime soon, and has links to al-qaeda in the lands of the islamic maghreb (aqim). the ``april 2014 state department country reports on terrorism,'' however, implied that the only role the castro regime had with farc was facilitating travel for the ``peace talks'' between these terrorists and the colombian government. it further stated that the eta presence in cuba is diminished. it would appear that a kinder-and-gentler cuba narrative is being written to accommodate a preconceived policy outcome. administration officials have reportedly spent the last two years creating a foundation for obama's cuba announcement on december 17--all the while denying any such activity when asked by congress about related news reports. if this sounds familiar, it's because it closely parallels the script used in the negotiations leading to the release of five taliban leaders held at guantanamo in exchange for bowe bergdahl. the state department terrorism report also makes references beyond eta and farc--most significantly that cuba harbors several fugitives of u.s. justice. terrorists, murderers, and other violent criminals are being protected, well fed, and supported by the communist regime. among these is a woman convicted of first-degree murder, joanne chesimard. also known as assata shakur, she is on the fbi's most wanted terrorists list for executing a new jersey state police trooper. with the help of the black liberation army, she broke out of prison and found refuge in cuba. according to the fbi, chesimard ``continues to profess her radical anti- u.s. government ideology.'' new jersey governor chris christie said recently that he wants her back in new jersey. he'll be waiting a long time. basing the decision to remove cuba from the state-sponsors- of-terrorism list solely on these above-referenced examples (there is probably a great deal more in classified form), the president would need to prove that for the six months prior to the proposed rescission, the cuban dictatorship did not provide any assistance to terrorists and had unconditionally returned u.s. fugitives. but communist-party officials have already stated publicly that cuba considers chesimard a political asylee and, as such, not to be released into u.s. custody. the president would also have to accept as credible the ``assurances'' from the havana regime that it would not provide support in the future for international terrorism--a difficult task given intelligence gaps highlighted in the state department's terrorism report. the pertinent section states: ``there was no indication that the cuban government provided weapons or paramilitary training to terrorist groups,'' but it provides no further data or analysis on these activities. it also fails to address the relationship and cooperation between cuba and other state sponsors of terrorism such as iran, or other entities listed on the fto list. and then there is the question of intelligence tainted and manipulated by americans spying for the cuban regime. one of the most notorious of these traitors, ana belen montes, used her position at the defense intelligence agency to provide cuban handlers copious amounts of highly sensitive data, including military contingency plans, details of intelligence-gathering efforts, and profiles of a broad spectrum of u.s. officials. congress must therefore require a comprehensive appraisal of the range of cuba's activities against the u.s. and its interests and priorities before the white house can make any decision on whether cuba will remain on the terrorism list. the review must cover no less than a 20-year period and include a fresh appraisal of all available raw data used in the clinton-era pentagon assessment spearheaded by montes. the review should include detailed intelligence and analysis of unconventional threats and programs that have dual-use application, such as cuba's biotech capabilities. the congressional national-security and judiciary committees must be given full access to all files pertaining to the wasp spy network, including data related to the 1996 brothers to the rescue shoot-down, as well as damage assessments for all americans and non-americans convicted of spying for the cuban regime. however, if president obama chooses to proceed irrespective of the aforementioned conditions and determines that cuba should be removed from the state-sponsors-of-terrorism list, congress would have only 45 days from the submission date to evaluate the rescission proposal and act accordingly. members of the house and senate must therefore be proactive in countering the executive action outlined on december 17 and in preventing further damage. failure to do so would make congress complicit in the administration's acquiescence to cuba's communist regime; it would undermine american interests and reinforce a message of weakness to other enemies of freedom and security. ____________________",8608
CREC-2015-01-12-pt1-PgE52,CREC-2015-01-12,114,SUPPORT FOR THE CUBAN PEOPLE,"[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 5 (Monday, January 12, 2015)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Pages E52-E53] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] SUPPORT FOR THE CUBAN PEOPLE ______ HON. CHRISTOPHER H. SMITH of new jersey in the house of representatives Monday, January 12, 2015 Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Mr. Speaker, I rise to voice my strong support for the Cuban people, who have suffered for so many decades under the brutal regime of the Castro brothers, and to thank my colleague, Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, for her leadership in calling for statements on the record on the deplorable human rights situation in Castro's Cuba. Her leadership and moral clarity on this issue stands in contrast to that of the Obama Administration, which once again has demonstrated its fecklessness. The events of this past weekend--where the absence of our President among so many bold Heads of State who marched in Paris for freedom and against extremism was so glaring--underscores how this Administration scorns our friends while coddling this country's enemies. The disregard this Administration showed for the people of France is part of a pattern, a pattern of contempt which includes disrespect to our great ally Canada and Prime Minister Harper over the crucial Keystone pipeline, which includes allowing Administration spokesmen to insult Israel's courageous Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu in the most juvenile fashion, and which includes abandonment of our Polish and Czech allies when they sought to base a missile shield in their countries in 2009. By this move to normalize relations with Cuba without consultation with either Congress or the State Department, and without holding the Castro regime to minimum standards of protection of human rights and commitment to democracy as prerequisites to negotiations, the Administration betrays the aspirations of the Cuban people while embracing the brutal dictators and oligarchs who turned an island paradise into a gulag. Again, there is a pattern here, a pattern of embracing our enemies, be it Hugo Chavez in Venezuela, the mullahs of Iran, or the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt, whose rise this Administration helped facilitate. And with each embrace of dictatorships and murderous regimes, the Administration showed its contempt for the downtrodden of these countries--the masses of people in Venezuela who suffered first under the dictator Chavez and now suffer under his understudy in oppression, Nicolas Maduro, who continues to persecute democracy advocates such as Leopoldo Lopez. This Administration was also silent when the Muslim Brotherhood Morsi regime oppressed the Coptic minority in Egypt, and it lifted no fingers to support the people of Iran during their peaceful Green Revolution protests in the wake of the 2009 election in that country, which were met with batons and pepper spray. And now the President embraces the Castro brothers, who were tutors to Hugo Chavez in the ways of oppression and whose support of so-called revolutionary movements has brought so much suffering to countries in Latin America and around the world. Let's be clear about this: Cuba has been a state sponsor of terrorism, supporting violence against allies of the United States such as Colombia. [[Page E53]] I have been a consistent supporter of the Cuban people in resisting tyranny. I am fortunate to have known many great Cuban dissidents, first and foremost Armando Valladares, whose autobiography Against All Hope was a first-hand account of Castro's tyranny, on par with the great work of Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn. I have also stood with the Ladies in White, or Las Damas de Blanco, and courageous leaders such as Ivonne Malleza Galano, and with heroes such as Dr. Oscar Biscet, a medical doctor and courageous human rights advocate who testified before our human rights subcommittee in February 2012 on ``Further Human Rights Violations in Castro's Cuba: The Continued Abuse of Political Prisoners.'' Dr. Biscet's story is far too commonplace to ignore. For the QUOTE UNQUOTE ``crime'' of organizing meetings on behalf of human rights, Dr. Biscet was first arrested and detained by Cuban police in 1999 along with two dozen other advocates. He was released after 5 days, but was rearrested again later that year, this time spending three years in prison. After he got out, he was rearrested a third time in December 2002, beaten and released. Presumably, the Castro regime saw his beating as sufficient warning not to speak out in defense of liberty and human dignity. When he continued to do so, however, the Castro regime arrested him a fourth time, in March 2003, and sentenced him to 25 years in prison. Fortunately, the Catholic Church intervened to secure his release and that of 50 other unjustly-jailed dissidents in March 2011. He was able to testify via phone at our hearing from Cuba from the US mission. To this day he is unable to leave the Island, prevented by the Castro Brothers. Dr. Biscet is just one example of the many who suffer under the Castro Brothers. I join my voice with those of my colleagues to express my dismay that the Administration would squander so much leverage in seeking this rapprochement with Cuba, and not doing more to gain concessions from the Castro regime to advance the cause of human rights, offering so much in exchange for so little. Despite today's news confirming that Cuba released 53 dissidents, which we welcome, since the Administration announced that it would seek normalization of relations with Cuba, hundreds have been arrested, and critics of the government who thought this might signal a new openness continue to be suppressed. This includes Cuban artist Tania Bruguera, who along with other freedom advocates was detained following her attempt to speak and assembly freely in Havana's Revolutionary Square. There should be no easing of the pressure until Cuba has met definitive and concrete human rights and democratic milestones. Among this is the release of all political prisoners, the end of harassment and a policy of releasing and then re-jailing, the ending of restrictions on freedom of speech and the press, and on the rights of Assembly. Moreover, the Church must be allowed to conduct its affairs fully and freely without government interference. And, finally, the Castro regime must be held to account for their harboring of some seventy fugitives from justice, including Joanne Chesimard, who was convicted of killing a state trooper from my home state of New Jersey in 1973, Werner Foerster, leaving his then-young wife a widow. The events of the past several weeks remind us how political violence done in the name of ideology destroys lives and creates deep divisions in the fabric of our society. That this Administration would fail to condition normalization upon the return of fugitives such as Joanne Chesimard, who is on the FBI's Most Wanted Terrorist list, shows where its priorities are. In closing, I want to assure the Cuban people that I will do everything to make sure that human rights milestones are met before our government makes concessions that are effectively unilateral, squandering leverage. Mind you, this lifeline thrown by the Obama Administration to the Castro regime came at a time when Cuba's oil patrons, Russia and Venezuela, were themselves hurting for cash, and unable to continue subsidizing the regime in Cuba. To that end, I plan to hold a hearing on the human rights situation in Cuba, focusing in particular on the plight of Afro-Cubans. I also intend to seek a visa to go to Cuba, so I can meet with political prisoners languishing in jail and visit churches, which are spheres independent of government control. I have on multiple occasions sought a visa, only to never have one granted. I say to the Cuban regime--if today marks a new day of openness, then prove it, and let one of your most consistent critics visit Cuba and have freedom of movement to meet with victims of the regime. And, finally, I will introduce legislation to make sure that human rights are not forgotten. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 5 (Monday, January 12, 2015)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Pages E52-E53] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] SUPPORT FOR THE CUBAN PEOPLE ______ HON.

[[page e53]] i have been a consistent supporter of the cuban people in resisting tyranny. i am fortunate to have known many great cuban dissidents, first and foremost armando valladares, whose autobiography against all hope was a first-hand account of castro's tyranny, on par with the great work of aleksandr solzhenitsyn. i have also stood with the ladies in white, or las damas de blanco, and courageous leaders such as ivonne malleza galano, and with heroes such as dr. oscar biscet, a medical doctor and courageous human rights advocate who testified before our human rights subcommittee in february 2012 on ``further human rights violations in castro's cuba: the continued abuse of political prisoners.'' dr. biscet's story is far too commonplace to ignore. for the quote unquote ``crime'' of organizing meetings on behalf of human rights, dr. biscet was first arrested and detained by cuban police in 1999 along with two dozen other advocates. he was released after 5 days, but was rearrested again later that year, this time spending three years in prison. after he got out, he was rearrested a third time in december 2002, beaten and released. presumably, the castro regime saw his beating as sufficient warning not to speak out in defense of liberty and human dignity. when he continued to do so, however, the castro regime arrested him a fourth time, in march 2003, and sentenced him to 25 years in prison. fortunately, the catholic church intervened to secure his release and that of 50 other unjustly-jailed dissidents in march 2011. he was able to testify via phone at our hearing from cuba from the us mission. to this day he is unable to leave the island, prevented by the castro brothers. dr. biscet is just one example of the many who suffer under the castro brothers. i join my voice with those of my colleagues to express my dismay that the administration would squander so much leverage in seeking this rapprochement with cuba, and not doing more to gain concessions from the castro regime to advance the cause of human rights, offering so much in exchange for so little. despite today's news confirming that cuba released 53 dissidents, which we welcome, since the administration announced that it would seek normalization of relations with cuba, hundreds have been arrested, and critics of the government who thought this might signal a new openness continue to be suppressed. this includes cuban artist tania bruguera, who along with other freedom advocates was detained following her attempt to speak and assembly freely in havana's revolutionary square. there should be no easing of the pressure until cuba has met definitive and concrete human rights and democratic milestones. among this is the release of all political prisoners, the end of harassment and a policy of releasing and then re-jailing, the ending of restrictions on freedom of speech and the press, and on the rights of assembly. moreover, the church must be allowed to conduct its affairs fully and freely without government interference. and, finally, the castro regime must be held to account for their harboring of some seventy fugitives from justice, including joanne chesimard, who was convicted of killing a state trooper from my home state of new jersey in 1973, werner foerster, leaving his then-young wife a widow. the events of the past several weeks remind us how political violence done in the name of ideology destroys lives and creates deep divisions in the fabric of our society. that this administration would fail to condition normalization upon the return of fugitives such as joanne chesimard, who is on the fbi's most wanted terrorist list, shows where its priorities are. in closing, i want to assure the cuban people that i will do everything to make sure that human rights milestones are met before our government makes concessions that are effectively unilateral, squandering leverage. mind you, this lifeline thrown by the obama administration to the castro regime came at a time when cuba's oil patrons, russia and venezuela, were themselves hurting for cash, and unable to continue subsidizing the regime in cuba. to that end, i plan to hold a hearing on the human rights situation in cuba, focusing in particular on the plight of afro-cubans. i also intend to seek a visa to go to cuba, so i can meet with political prisoners languishing in jail and visit churches, which are spheres independent of government control. i have on multiple occasions sought a visa, only to never have one granted. i say to the cuban regime--if today marks a new day of openness, then prove it, and let one of your most consistent critics visit cuba and have freedom of movement to meet with victims of the regime. and, finally, i will introduce legislation to make sure that human rights are not forgotten. ____________________",8127

Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Dr. Dale Patterson, Pastor of East Brent Baptist Church, upon the occasion of his retirement after 33 years at East Brent Baptist Church in Pensacola, Florida, and for more than 50 years of ministry. Pastor Patterson is a native of Sumrall, Mississippi, and he started his long and distinguished career in the ministry in Mississippi, where he served congregations in Hattiesburg, Mendenall, Shuqualak, and Picayune, while also pursuing his education at Mississippi College, William Carey College, Mississippi State University, and the New Orleans Baptist Theological Seminary, where he received his master's and doctoral degrees. In 1981, Pastor Patterson and his family moved to Northwest Florida, where he took the important position of Pastor of East Brent Baptist Church. During his three-plus decades in Northwest Florida, Pastor Patterson became a staple of the community, leading his ministry based on a simple plan to minister to those within the church, while also reaching out to spread the Gospel to all the members of the community in need of the Lord's guidance. Under Pastor Patterson's leadership, and with the grace of God, East Brent Baptist Church has grown significantly over the past decades. Pastor Patterson supervised the purchase of property surrounding East Brent Baptist Church to expand the grounds and facilitate the construction of many new facilities, including the Family Life Center, the Worship Center, the G Building--used to house various events from Sunday School classes to GED classes and weddings--as well as the reutilization of existing property to provide recreational opportunities for children in the church community. In addition, during his tenure, East Brent Baptist launched Care Ministries, Inc. to help further spread the word of Jesus Christ far and wide. There is no question that Pastor Patterson's record of leadership and accomplishments at East Brent Baptist are myriad; however, he has also served in important leadership positions throughout the state and in the larger Southern Baptist Community. During his time in ministry, Pastor Patterson has served as President of the Associational Pastor's Conference, Moderator of Association and has served on State Board of Missions for Florida Baptist Convention. Pastor Patterson has also held the chairmanship of various committees, including: the Evangelism Committee, Mission's Committee, Sunday School Committee, Program Committee, State Order of Business, State Nomination Committee, State Loans and Grants Committee, Budget and Allocations Committee, and the Health and Hope Committee. Pastor Patterson's many accomplishments, however, are only a small window into the exceptional work that he has done serving the Lord and the congregation of East Brent Baptist Church, and his many successes in life are a testament to what can be achieved through faith and adherence to the teachings of Jesus Christ. Mr. Speaker, on behalf of the United States Congress, my wife Vicki and I wish Pastor Patterson, his wife Louise, and the entire Patterson family all the best as Pastor Patterson enjoys his retirement years spending time with his family and the many friends he has made throughout the Northwest Florida community.
