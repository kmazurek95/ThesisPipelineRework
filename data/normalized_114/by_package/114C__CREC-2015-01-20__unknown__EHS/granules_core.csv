CREC-2015-01-20-pt1-PgH414,CREC-2015-01-20,114,"THE LEGACY OF DR. MARTIN LUTHER KING, JR.","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 9 (Tuesday, January 20, 2015)] [House] [Page H414] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] THE LEGACY OF DR. MARTIN LUTHER KING, JR. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee) for 5 minutes. Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, what an interesting coincidence. We are here today to hear from the President of the United States, President Barack Obama, on his State of the Union. Just yesterday, millions of Americans honored together the legacy and the message of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. I rise today to emphasize that Dr. King's message was not a message for one particular ethnic or racial or religious group, but as I have reflected over the years, he equals the original values of this Nation. The Constitution begins by saying we have come to order a more perfect Union. It is a small document. The Bill of Rights gives flesh to the bones of the Constitution because it gives us the freedom of religion and speech and access and the ability to move around, and the right to a jury trial and the right to due process and the right to dignity, and it freed the slaves. But it also is a document that can free us from the biases that sometimes come because of isolation, and that was Dr. King. He sought for America her higher angels. He wanted her to be able to be true to her values. For those who fled persecution in faraway places, he wanted America to be that place that did not see color, religion, ethnicity, did not see differences because one was disabled or gay or straight, but really saw us in an equal manner. He marched for all people, and I would hope that as we begin this session of Congress, as we listen to the President of the United States, who literally stands on the shoulders of Dr. Martin Luther King--for it was the Civil Rights Act of 1964 where many lost their lives and the Voting Rights Act of 1965 where a young woman by the name of Viola Liuzzo died right after the Selma march. As she was bringing back those protestors and marchers, she was shot dead. She was a white woman from Michigan. And so I pay tribute to Dr. King today, and I look forward to listening to the President's message that will hopefully be a message of hope and the opportunities for America to work together. At the same time, I remember my own community. I pay tribute to a place called Freedmen's Town, founded by former slaves, and Camp Logan, a place where Black soldiers were isolated in World War I, but they had on the uniform of this country. I pay tribute to Christie Adair, Zollie Scales, C. Anderson Davis, Reverend F.N. Williams, and, as well, S.J. Gilbert, Reverend J.J. Roberson, and many others who have walked the pathway, the leaders of the NAACP, the leaders of the Urban League, and many of our seniors who came to us to give us knowledge through their sacrifices of World War II, to the Buffalo Soldiers that we see in our community all the time, and to those who have put on the uniform through the ages. All of those persons combined make up the spirit of Dr. Martin Luther King, who leaves us with the most important statement: ``injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere.'' As we now go on our new journey, let us look to respect our law enforcement but also look, as we stand alongside of the men and women in blue, that we also find a way to be able to bring justice and opportunity and, as well, fairness to the criminal justice system. It takes all of us to be able to get that system right side up: our law enforcement officers and their training, and then, of course, the judicial system. Let us look forward in Dr. King's spirit of coming together, no matter what our race, color, or creed, whatever our body says to do, to be able to do what is right. I said to young people when I was speaking about Dr. King this weekend, I used one simple theme: he had a humble courage, a quiet courage. He had to make decisions in the quietness of his own presence and his own space to say, ``I am willing to do what is right even though there may be danger.'' He never announced and never spoke about words that dealt with his own personal courage. He did say that he had a peace that would allow him to see the promised land and to acknowledge to us that he might not get there with us, but he knew that we as a people--and I take that ``we'' as the American people--will get there some day. Let us together fix Ferguson and the many Fergusons around the Nation. Let us bring comfort to parents all around this Nation. Let us be reminded of Dr. King's spirit, not just in this weekend of activities and respect and honor, but let us do it always. I close by simply saying, thank you at home to Mr. Ovide Duncantell. Mr. Duncantell has been the visionary for our efforts in Houston on honoring Dr. Martin Luther King. He first met with Daddy King and named the street, and then we were able successfully, with Federal funds and working with Mr. Duncantell, to place a Martin Luther King memorial, the first built outside of Washington, D.C., in the last 10 years. We are excited about it. We know that his spirit is not in bricks and mortar; it is living within us. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 9 (Tuesday, January 20, 2015)] [House] [Page H414] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] THE LEGACY OF DR.

The Chair recognizes the gentleman from California (Mr. Bera) for 5 minutes. Mr. BERA. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the memory of Sacramento County Sheriff Deputy Danny Oliver. Deputy Oliver had served the citizens of Sacramento County for 15 years when he paid the ultimate sacrifice in the line of duty this past October. Later that day, Placer County Sheriff's Investigator Michael Davis, Jr., was shot and killed by the same assailant. Deputy Oliver grew up in the Del Paso Heights neighborhood of Sacramento and graduated from Grant High School. He loved serving the community where he grew up and dedicated his life to making it better. He was known for being part of the community that he served, answering emails from concerned citizens even when he was off duty, and never declining to attend a neighborhood meeting. Deputy Oliver was as dedicated to his family as he was to his job, and his family was dedicated to him. His wife, Susan Oliver, worked two jobs while Danny went through the sheriff's academy, where he graduated at the top of his class academically. She will be my guest tonight at the State of the Union. Susan and Danny have two daughters, Melissa and Jenny. The lives of Deputy Oliver and Investigator Davis are a reminder that our law enforcement officers put their lives on the line every day for our safety. They were true heroes, and we are forever indebted to them and their loved ones. Let's honor their memory by building understanding and trust between law enforcement and the communities they serve, just like Deputy Oliver did. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 9 (Tuesday, January 20, 2015)] [House] [Page H413] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] REMEMBERING SHERIFF'S DEPUTY DANNY OLIVER The SPEAKER pro tempore.

CREC-2015-01-20-pt1-PgH413-5,CREC-2015-01-20,114,DR. MARTIN LUTHER KING AND PUERTO RICO STATEHOOD,"[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 9 (Tuesday, January 20, 2015)] [House] [Pages H413-H414] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] DR. MARTIN LUTHER KING AND PUERTO RICO STATEHOOD The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Puerto Rico (Mr. Pierluisi) for 5 minutes. Mr. PIERLUISI. Mr. Speaker, yesterday this Nation, including Puerto Rico, celebrated Martin Luther King Day. It is important to pause and reflect upon Dr. King's legacy and its relevance to the issue of Puerto Rico's political status. In the 1950s and 1960s, Dr. King was the most prominent leader of the civil rights movement for racial equality in the United States. He was physically brave, leading peaceful marches and other protests in parts of the country where some government officials and residents were willing to use violence and intimidation to maintain a system of segregation and discrimination. Dr. King was also remarkably eloquent. His speeches and writings inspired men and women who already supported the campaign for racial equality, but they also changed the hearts and minds of individuals who initially opposed the cause. He helped many Americans who were living in moral darkness to see the light. Dr. King was motivated by a sense of urgency. In a letter written from an Alabama jail, he stated that ``justice too long delayed is justice denied.'' But Dr. King was also strategic. Every action he took was carefully designed to advance the cause. He knew that means matter as much as ends, and he had little patience for advocates who lacked a sense of tactics and timing. Dr. King traveled to Puerto Rico on at least two occasions, but it does not appear that he expressed a considered opinion about the island's political status. Nevertheless, based on Dr. King's philosophy, it is fair to presume that he would be very troubled by the situation in Puerto Rico. Dr. King regarded the right to vote as sacred. In a 1957 speech delivered in front of the Lincoln Memorial, he said: So long as I do not firmly and irrevocably possess the right to vote, I do not possess myself. I cannot make up my mind; it is made up for me. I cannot live as a democratic citizen, observing the laws I have helped to enact; I can only submit to the edict of others. Nearly 50 years after Dr. King's death from an assassin's bullet, the right to vote in Federal and local elections is guaranteed to all American citizens regardless of race, but only if they reside [[Page H414]] in a U.S. State. The 3.6 million American citizens residing in the U.S. territory of Puerto Rico are denied this sacred right, unable to vote for the Federal leaders who make the laws that govern every aspect of their lives. We lack the very right that Dr. King lived for and the right he died for. The movement that Dr. King led was a quest for equal rights and equal opportunities for African Americans. However, the principle that lay behind the movement and that gave it such moral power has broader application. It is the belief that there is only one category of American citizenship, not a first-class citizenship for some and a second-class citizenship for others. Every day that Puerto Rico remains a territory, an undemocratic and undignified status, this principle is violated. Dr. King taught us that achieving equality requires hard, determined, relentless work. It requires leaders who are both passionate and strategic, just as Dr. King was, but above all, it requires thousands upon thousands of ordinary men and women to unite around the principle, the principle of equality, and to fight for it until it is attained. Dr. King's life is a testament to the fundamental truth that there is no force on Earth strong enough to stop a righteous cause pursued by righteous means. Our struggle to obtain equal rights and equal opportunities for the U.S. citizens of Puerto Rico is a struggle for justice, and with tireless effort, we will prevail. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 9 (Tuesday, January 20, 2015)] [House] [Pages H413-H414] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] DR.

Ms. PELOSI. Mr. Speaker, this weekend we observed the celebration of the life of the Reverend Martin Luther King, Jr. He talked about engagement for the American people, for jobs, for justice, for peace, and it was pretty exciting to see the response across the country at a time when all of these issues are in the forefront. Tonight we will hear from the President of the United States. From what I hear about what he will present, it will reflect what we have seen across the country in terms of what he said last year reflected across the country: about when women succeed, America succeeds; about college affordability; about child care; about sick leave; all the kinds of issues that enable families--not just women, but families--to succeed. Hopefully it will reflect what we talked about on opening day: better infrastructure, bigger paychecks. As we all know, despite all of the economic gains and all the indicators that tell us that progress has been made in our economy-- and, indeed, it has--it isn't reflected in the paychecks of America's working families. So what we hear tonight, I know, will be in furtherance of increasing that paycheck, starting from the middle, starting from initiatives that benefit the middle class and those who aspire to it, all of it a reflection of the American people's thinking, all of it about engagement for policies that Reverend Martin Luther King talked about, all of it hopefully that we are able to do in a bipartisan way. Let us find the areas in which we have common ground. Let us work together to get that done, build confidence between us in this body, among the American people, and keep America number one in education, innovation, and justice and a factor for peace in the world. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 9 (Tuesday, January 20, 2015)] [House] [Page H415] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] LET US FIND AREAS OF COMMON GROUND (Ms. PELOSI asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.)

Mr. POE of Texas. Mr. Speaker, the President addresses the Union tonight, promising more government, more spending, and more taxes. Obviously the President did not read the November memo from America. The majority of the Union rejected the President's policies in the election of persistent Big Government. King George III and the British imposed the Stamp Act 250 years ago this year. The colonists decried the new tax. Higher taxes and more confiscation of property and wealth is not a sound solution; after all, taxes are already too high; after all, revenue into the Federal coffers is at a record level; after all, Americans are already hammered by ObamaCare taxes; and after all, raising taxes is not a proven economic theory to grow the economy.

Lockhart, a proud Utahn and, in fact, the immediate past speaker of the House of Representatives in Utah. Unfortunately, she passed away just a few days ago at the young age of 46. Speaker Lockhart was elected to the Utah House in 1998. She was trained as a registered nurse, and she first served on the Health and Human Services Committee but quickly threw herself into transportation issues, for which she was widely known. After her fourth session, she was appointed to the house leadership as the vice chair of executive appropriations and stayed in leadership the remainder of her time. In fact, in 2008, then-Representative Lockhart was elected as the assistant majority whip, and in 2010 she became the first female speaker of the Utah House in Utah history. Her tenure was epitomized by a more collaborative bottom-up approach that focused on having an open process where all members of the body could bring forward ideas for discussion. Becky Lockhart and her husband, Stan, raised their three children in Provo, Utah. They have been stalwarts within the party, and her presence will be keenly missed. Her trailblazing legacy will live on. May God bless Rebecca D. Lockhart and her family. We thank her for her service, and we will miss her greatly. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 9 (Tuesday, January 20, 2015)] [House] [Page H415] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] REMEMBERING REBECCA D.

The very existence of ISIS and others is not a reflection on Islam. Over the weekend, we have seen so many that have expressed opposition to these terrible acts. That is why it is so important, as we listen to the President's State of the Union, that the Congress, although with different opinions, agree to work on behalf of what is good for all of America, both building the economy but fighting against the war on terror, not only with weapons but with educating about democracy and principles and equality and trying to win the hearts and minds. Mr. Speaker, we have a lot of work to do. ____________________",package_114_126.csv,1415,1415,1484,"[congressional record volume 161, number 9 (tuesday, january 20, 2015)] [house] [page h416] from the congressional record online through the government publishing office [ www.gpo.gov ] isis is not a reflection on islam (ms. jackson lee asked and was given permission to address the house for 1 minute.) ms. jackson lee. mr. speaker, this morning most americans woke up to the news that isis was holding two citizens of the nation-state of japan and, in the holding of those citizens, threatening to kill them, asked japan to give $200 million. mr. speaker, does that sound like an organization that is dedicated and committed to principles however much we disagree with them, or does it sound like a group of thugs who are willing to do anything to gain money to promote their evil and dastardly acts? the very existence of isis and others is not a reflection on islam. over the weekend, we have seen so many that have expressed opposition to these terrible acts. that is why it is so important, as we listen to the president's state of the union, that the congress, although with different opinions, agree to work on behalf of what is good for all of america, both building the economy but fighting against the war on terror, not only with weapons but with educating about democracy and principles and equality and trying to win the hearts and minds. mr. speaker, we have a lot of work to do. ____________________",1415

CREC-2015-01-20-pt1-PgH416-3,CREC-2015-01-20,114,CONDEMNING THE RECENT TERRORIST ATTACKS IN PARIS,"[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 9 (Tuesday, January 20, 2015)] [House] [Pages H416-H418] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] CONDEMNING THE RECENT TERRORIST ATTACKS IN PARIS Mr. ROYCE. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and agree to the resolution (H. Res. 37) expressing the sense of the House of Representatives condemning the recent terrorist attacks in Paris that resulted in the deaths of seventeen innocent persons and offering condolences to those personally affected by this cowardly act. The Clerk read the title of the resolution. The text of the resolution is as follows: H. Res. 37 Whereas, on January 7, 2015, armed radical Islamist terrorists stormed the offices of the satirical newspaper Charlie Hebdo and slaughtered twelve people, including editorial staff of the paper, a visitor, a security guard, a maintenance worker, and a Muslim police officer; Whereas terrorists Cherif and Said Kouachi, who carried out the attack, were located and killed by police two days later and their hostages rescued; Whereas Amedy Coulibaly killed a female police officer on January 8, 2015, and intentionally targeted a kosher supermarket, taking multiple hostages and murdering four Jewish men on January 9, 2015, before French police raided the store, killed Coulibaly, and rescued the surviving hostages; Whereas Amedy Coulibaly stated that he had worked in coordination with Said and Cherif Kouachi and called them ``brothers from our team''; Whereas Hayat Boumeddiene, a fourth suspect connected with the attack and the common-law wife of Amedy Coulibaly, remains at large; Whereas the Kouachi brothers are believed to have traveled to Yemen in 2011 where they are reported to have received weapons training and met with Anwar al-Awlaki, a senior member of al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula; Whereas al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula claimed credit for the Charlie Hebdo attack; Whereas Amedy Coulibaly claimed to be a member of the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria; Whereas radical Islamist terrorist groups, including the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant, al-Qaeda and its affiliates worldwide, the Taliban and Haqqani network in Afghanistan and Pakistan, Ansar al-Sharia in Libya, Boko Haram in Nigeria, al-Shabaab in Somalia, Hizballah in Lebanon and Syria, Hamas in Gaza, and others, pose a growing threat to international peace and stability; Whereas these terrorist attacks represent an assault on fundamental principles essential to a democratic society, including the universal right to free expression and freedom of religion; Whereas the increase in anti-Semitic attacks in France and throughout Europe remains of great concern; Whereas the United States and France share a longstanding cultural, political, and economic relationship that has greatly benefitted both nations; Whereas since the founding of our Nation, France has been an ally of the United States, and French soldiers have fought side-by-side with American soldiers throughout history, including during two World Wars; Whereas security cooperation between the United States and France plays an essential role in combating violent extremism in West and North Africa, the Middle East and around the world; and Whereas the United States is committed to supporting its oldest ally France in this difficult time: Now, therefore, be it Resolved, That the House of Representatives-- (1) condemns the recent terrorist attacks in Paris that resulted in the tragic loss of seventeen innocent lives; (2) extends its deepest sympathies to all those affected by this tragedy; (3) supports the efforts of the Government of France to ensure that all of those individuals who committed or supported these attacks are brought to justice; (4) remains concerned regarding the flow of foreign fighters to and from the Middle East and West and North Africa and the threat posed by these individuals upon their return to their local communities; (5) appreciates and supports France's continuing efforts to combat terrorism and promote stability throughout the Middle East and West and North Africa; (6) appreciates France's contributions to the multilateral effort to destroy the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant; (7) recognizes the growing threat posed by radical Islamist terrorist groups worldwide and reaffirms the commitment of the United States to the multilateral, global fight against such violent extremists; (8) calls upon all nations to join a global effort to combat violent extremist ideologies and terrorist groups; and (9) remains committed to the defense of free expression, including religious freedom, as well as other universal values that terrorists seek to destroy through a campaign of cowardly threats and reprehensible violence. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from California (Mr. Royce) and the gentleman from New York (Mr. Engel) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from California. General Leave Mr. ROYCE. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and to add any extraneous material to the Record in this debate. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from California? There was no objection. Mr. ROYCE. I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of this resolution. The resolution condemns the terrorist attack in France carried out by Islamist extremists earlier this month. On January 7, two armed gunmen entered the offices of Charlie Hebdo, the satirical magazine in Paris, and, in a brutal, premeditated attack, killed 12 people and injured 11 others. The following day, as we watched this play out on international media, their associate, Amedy Coulibaly, shot and killed a female police officer, and in the following days with the Kouachi brothers on the run, Coulibaly targeted a kosher supermarket where he shot and killed four Jewish shoppers and took multiple hostages. Later that day, courageous French police officers stormed the supermarket, killed the attacker, and freed the hostages. There are no words that we can speak today, I think, that will comfort the families and the friends of the 17 people murdered in those terrorist attacks. The victims included cartoonists and maintenance workers, police officers, grocery shoppers, Christians, Jews, and Muslims. {time} 1415 There are no words strong enough to condemn these terrorists and their radical jihadist ideology. The Charlie Hebdo offices were attacked because their cartoons offended. The magazine's editor was specifically marked as a target for death by al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula's online newspaper magazine called Inspire under the not-so-subtle headline, ``A Bullet a Day Keeps the Infidel Away.'' [[Page H417]] Indeed, the Kouachi brothers called out the editor's name before they shot and killed him. Mr. Speaker, the attack on Charlie Hebdo was an attack on free speech. The right to express ideas and opinions, even if they are unpopular or offensive, is a foundation for a free society--France's and ours. Frankly, the struggle of the Enlightenment has largely been a struggle against blasphemy laws going all of the way back to the foundation of this Republic and our First Amendment and Jefferson's concept of freedom of speech and freedom of religion. It was not the first time that this magazine was attacked by terrorists. And, unfortunately, it probably won't be the last time a media outlet like this is targeted. That is why this resolution resolves to uphold and defend the basic principle--free speech. The grocery store victims were murdered because they were Jewish. In the days following, France stationed thousands of police officers to guard France's Jewish schools and synagogues in the aftermath of the terrorist attacks. Alarmingly, anti-Semitic forces are on the rise in France and in much of Europe. This resolution puts the House on record as condemning in the strongest terms possible the Paris attacks and extends the sympathy of every American to those affected by the tragedy. It reiterates our support for France, America's sister republic, our oldest ally, and it calls upon all nations to join the global effort of fighting violent extremism. This is a time to not just express sorrow for those killed but also a time to show resolve in the face of terror. Our intelligence-sharing with allies, already strong, will need to get much sharper; border checks improved; and coalition efforts to destroy ISIS will need to be stepped up. I urge all Members to support this resolution. I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume, and I rise in strong support of this resolution. Mr. Speaker, the terrorist attacks by radical Islamists in Paris were a tragedy for all who love peace and freedom. What happened at the offices of Charlie Hebdo and the kosher market reminds us this violent extremism remains a critical threat. I am happy to stand with the chairman here in showing strong bipartisanship once again because we grieve with France, our oldest ally. Our hearts break for all those who have lost loved ones in these attacks and for all who watched this carnage spill into their peaceful city streets. As a New Yorker, I remember the outpouring of support from France following September 11, 2011. But even as we mourn the dead, we draw inspiration from the displays of courage and solidarity on the streets of the City of Light, across Europe, and around the world. With the attackers still at large, Parisians took to the streets in massive and peaceful vigils. They sent a clear message to the world: freedom and justice will not be cowed by violence and terror. In these attacks, Mr. Speaker, the ancient evil of anti-Semitism once again showed its ugly face. Anti-Semitism is both a threat with which governments need to deal and a societal challenge requiring honest dialogue, critical self-examination, and constant vigilance. France's deployment of special troops and extra police to Jewish sites was the right thing to do. But much more will be needed in the days ahead to ensure that Europe's largest Jewish community is safe from attack and free from fear. Just as America stands with the people of France against terrorism, Americans also stand shoulder to shoulder with European Jewry. That is the message we are sending today with this resolution. Whether in Paris or New York, Moscow or Jerusalem, whether homegrown or imported, whether targeting Jews, Muslims, Christians, or anyone else, violent extremism has no place in a civilized world. We will continue to work with our friends and allies to put a stop to this threat. It is important that Congress go on record as strongly opposed to this violence. We will do whatever it takes to secure the future of freedom and democracy. Mr. Speaker, I am Jewish--Je suis Juif. I am Charlie--Je suis Charlie. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this resolution. I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. ROYCE. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Poe), the chairman of the Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on Terrorism, Nonproliferation, and Trade, and the author of this measure. Mr. POE of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman and the ranking member for bringing this resolution to the House floor so quickly. Mr. Speaker, it was a cold winter morning in Paris just before lunchtime when two masked men with AK-47s approached a woman standing outside the door of the Charlie Hebdo newspaper, forcing her to let them in. Once inside the door, they gunned down the security guard in the lobby and ran up to the second floor shouting, ``Where is Charb? Where is Charb?'' Charb is the nickname of the newspaper's editor, Mr. Charbonnier. After reaching their target, they executed him and 10 others. They exited the building shouting, ``Allahu Akbar,'' or ``God is the greatest.'' Then they sped off. They would kill an injured Muslim police officer lying on the ground before they fled. The two terrorists got away, but not for long. French law enforcement found and killed the men in a standoff near the Paris airport. That same day, another terrorist killed a female police officer and attacked a kosher supermarket and murdered four Jewish men. Once again, French law enforcement took care of the terrorists and rescued the hostages. These terrorists killed because they didn't like what people had to say. Mr. Speaker, it is a fundamental human right to have freedom of expression, freedom of press, freedom of speech, and freedom of religion. No amount of violence can take those rights away from us. It is basic. Mr. Speaker, this resolution says we are not going to let Islamic radical terrorists steal those rights from anyone, whether it is the French, whether it is someone else in the world or even here in America. Mr. Speaker, after all, they killed at the kosher cafe because they not only didn't like what people were saying, they didn't like those people because they were Jews. France did an excellent job bringing swift justice down on these terrorists, but the fight is certainly not over. There may be, and probably are, hundreds of others around the world plotting to kill neighbors and countrymen and people in other Nations because those terrorists don't agree with what those people say or what those people look like or what those people's personal religion may be. They think they have the right to kill in the name of a radical Islamic religion. Mr. Speaker, the threat is serious and it is deadly. This resolution remembers those folks who were killed because they believed the way they did or because they looked the way they looked or because their religion was different than others. We mourn when the French mourn. As stated earlier, the French are our oldest and first ally. In fact, Mr. Speaker, we have two portraits in this House Chamber, one of George Washington and one of Lafayette, the first great Frenchman who helped the United States. We have a close bond with the French. And it is important that we let them, the world, and especially the terrorists know that our bond with freedom-loving countries will remain strong, especially in time of need, when people are attacked because of their beliefs and the idea that they can express a difference of opinion. I want to congratulate French law enforcement for their speedy and quick resolve in disposing of these terrorists, and we should let them know that we appreciate all law enforcement who fight back against terrorists who want to kill us because we don't agree with them. Once again, I thank the chairman and the ranking member for bringing this resolution to the House floor. Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee). (Ms. JACKSON LEE asked and was given permission to revise and extend her remarks.) Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. Royce and Mr. Engel and [[Page H418]] Mr. Poe for their leadership in bringing the House together on a very important issue. Earlier today I stood and spoke about the tragic news that we heard early this morning of two Japanese citizens being held and ISIS asking for $200 million. The work of these individuals in Paris, France, and beyond was in their mind a connectedness to al Qaeda and others, proudly so, as they slaughtered those individuals who chose to lift up liberte in the spirit of the French people and take to the pen and assess the atmosphere of the day and provide humor to it. Mr. Speaker, I do not comment on one person's opinion, but I do know that liberte, democracy, liberty, and our own beliefs give every human being dignity and the freedom of expression, the free press, the right to free speech and religion, and I believe these are very valuable ideals. And so this resolution speaks to that by condemning the heinousness of the act. How many families--children, mothers, and fathers--were impacted by the loss of their loved ones? What a tragedy to see a police officer gunned down in the street who asked, as I reflect on the words as I recall them, to be left alone, and yet was shot again, and other officers in the line of duty being subjected to the violence of these individuals. This is an intolerable situation that should not be tolerated. But we are hearing from the voices of these terrorist groups that they are now asking individuals to stay in place, to stay at home and create jihad. At the same time, I have heard voices from the Islam extended community, people of the faith, Islamic faith, and I have heard them condemn these violent acts. I have heard them condemn these acts as not reflecting their faith. Then again, as we watched an individual slaughter Jewish persons in a kosher market purposely because of their faith, we cannot tolerate that. In one single voice, we should rise up as this resolution, H. Res. 37, says to express the affection for all people and their right to exist. That is, if you will, a universal phenomenon, to allow individual persons and individuals to exist without threat of heinous violence. As I talked about Dr. Martin Luther King, I said the very words he has commended to us: Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentlewoman has expired. Mr. ENGEL. I yield an additional 1 minute to the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee). Ms. JACKSON LEE. As we begin this journey into a new year, I don't know how much we will be confronted with these horrible acts. I am on the Homeland Security Committee, and for a long time we were seeing the signs of what I call franchise terrorism. But I do know that it has to be a world, a global effort, but it also has to, as I began to talk about earlier, reach the hearts and minds of young men and possibly women who are being subjected to radicalism on the Internet or elsewhere. We have to stop that bleeding, if you will, and begin to promote openly our values, which include respect for religious differences. As we do that, I believe it will be well worth the investment because we don't know where this is going to end, and we certainly need to say to the American people that we are committed, in essence that we are on top of it, and that we have many solutions to this tragic problem. So I rise in support of H. Res. 37 for its condemnation and recognition of where we are today, and I ask for us to address this in a multitude of ways in order to have peace in this world and in our Nation. {time} 1430 Mr. ROYCE. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Je suis Juif, I am Jewish. Mr. Speaker, Je suis Charlie, I am Charlie Hebdo. This is what we are all saying collectively as a Congress as we debate this bill today. This is what the people of France were saying and have been saying ever since the tragedy happened. People with placards and banners were carrying them high above France to show solidarity in the fight against terrorism. Mr. Speaker, we have had an important conversation here in the House. I am heartened by the expressions of unity and resolve, and I hope they provide a measure of comfort to those families that are suffering who had loved ones who were killed and those who were wounded by this recent attack. Symbolism looms hard in foreign affairs, and with this resolution, we deliver a powerful message. We deliver it on the day the President is going to speak with us in the State of the Union, and I think nothing could be stronger than for this House unanimously to fight terrorism, to reject terrorism, and, again, to say, ``Je suis Juif, Je suis Charlie.'' I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. ROYCE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Congressman Poe from Texas, chairman of the Subcommittee on Terrorism, Nonproliferation, and Trade, for authoring this important resolution; but I also want to thank our ranking member, Eliot Engel of New York, for his support in bringing this resolution to the floor to ensure that we speak with one voice on issues of violent extremism and to ensure that we stand with our ally France at this difficult time. Last week, many Members visited the Foreign Affairs Committee to sign a condolence book and greet the French Ambassador in person. Mr. Engel and I thanked them for their show of solidarity in this. Mr. Speaker, the ultimate reality is that these attacks in Paris are indicative of a resurgent terrorist threat from radical Islamist extremists. The brothers were connected to al Qaeda in Yemen, a particularly active and deadly al Qaeda franchise. The kosher market gunman pledged his allegiance to ISIS, which now controls parts of Iraq and Syria and has specifically targeted Americans. Up to 5,000 Europeans are believed now to have traveled to Syria to fight or get training. Whether from organized groups or returning foreign fighters or lone wolves, the terrorist threat is real, and it is growing. These are not criminals united by happenstance but by a militant jihadi impulse united by ideology, by doctrine, and by practice, its adherents drawn all the way from Africa to Southeast Asia, from the Middle East to the Caucasus. Unlike some of the rhetoric we have heard by some here in Washington, in every corner of the globe, terrorist groups are growing in number, and they are growing in strength. In Europe, France is at the front lines of a dangerous and growing ideology that has, again, demonstrated that it knows no bounds. As we face an expanding and evolving threat, it is imperative that we unequivocally condemn attacks on freedom of speech, condemn attacks on religious pluralism, and reaffirm our resolve to fight extremism. I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from California (Mr. Royce) that the House suspend the rules and agree to the resolution, H. Res. 37. The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the resolution was agreed to. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 9 (Tuesday, January 20, 2015)] [House] [Pages H416-H418] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] CONDEMNING THE RECENT TERRORIST ATTACKS IN PARIS Mr. ROYCE. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and agree to the resolution (H. Res. 37) expressing the sense of the House of Representatives condemning the recent terrorist attacks in Paris that resulted in the deaths of seventeen innocent persons and offering condolences to those personally affected by this cowardly act. The Clerk read the title of the resolution. The text of the resolution is as follows: H. Res. 37 Whereas, on January 7, 2015, armed radical Islamist terrorists stormed the offices of the satirical newspaper Charlie Hebdo and slaughtered twelve people, including editorial staff of the paper, a visitor, a security guard, a maintenance worker, and a Muslim police officer; Whereas terrorists Cherif and Said Kouachi, who carried out the attack, were located and killed by police two days later and their hostages rescued; Whereas Amedy Coulibaly killed a female police officer on January 8, 2015, and intentionally targeted a kosher supermarket, taking multiple hostages and murdering four Jewish men on January 9, 2015, before French police raided the store, killed Coulibaly, and rescued the surviving hostages; Whereas Amedy Coulibaly stated that he had worked in coordination with Said and Cherif Kouachi and called them ``brothers from our team''; Whereas Hayat Boumeddiene, a fourth suspect connected with the attack and the common-law wife of Amedy Coulibaly, remains at large; Whereas the Kouachi brothers are believed to have traveled to Yemen in 2011 where they are reported to have received weapons training and met with Anwar al-Awlaki, a senior member of al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula; Whereas al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula claimed credit for the Charlie Hebdo attack; Whereas Amedy Coulibaly claimed to be a member of the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria; Whereas radical Islamist terrorist groups, including the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant, al-Qaeda and its affiliates worldwide, the Taliban and Haqqani network in Afghanistan and Pakistan, Ansar al-Sharia in Libya, Boko Haram in Nigeria, al-Shabaab in Somalia, Hizballah in Lebanon and Syria, Hamas in Gaza, and others, pose a growing threat to international peace and stability; Whereas these terrorist attacks represent an assault on fundamental principles essential to a democratic society, including the universal right to free expression and freedom of religion; Whereas the increase in anti-Semitic attacks in France and throughout Europe remains of great concern; Whereas the United States and France share a longstanding cultural, political, and economic relationship that has greatly benefitted both nations; Whereas since the founding of our Nation, France has been an ally of the United States, and French soldiers have fought side-by-side with American soldiers throughout history, including during two World Wars; Whereas security cooperation between the United States and France plays an essential role in combating violent extremism in West and North Africa, the Middle East and around the world; and Whereas the United States is committed to supporting its oldest ally France in this difficult time: Now, therefore, be it Resolved, That the House of Representatives-- (1) condemns the recent terrorist attacks in Paris that resulted in the tragic loss of seventeen innocent lives; (2) extends its deepest sympathies to all those affected by this tragedy; (3) supports the efforts of the Government of France to ensure that all of those individuals who committed or supported these attacks are brought to justice; (4) remains concerned regarding the flow of foreign fighters to and from the Middle East and West and North Africa and the threat posed by these individuals upon their return to their local communities; (5) appreciates and supports France's continuing efforts to combat terrorism and promote stability throughout the Middle East and West and North Africa; (6) appreciates France's contributions to the multilateral effort to destroy the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant; (7) recognizes the growing threat posed by radical Islamist terrorist groups worldwide and reaffirms the commitment of the United States to the multilateral, global fight against such violent extremists; (8) calls upon all nations to join a global effort to combat violent extremist ideologies and terrorist groups; and (9) remains committed to the defense of free expression, including religious freedom, as well as other universal values that terrorists seek to destroy through a campaign of cowardly threats and reprehensible violence. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from California (Mr. Royce) and the gentleman from New York (Mr. Engel) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from California. General Leave Mr. ROYCE. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and to add any extraneous material to the Record in this debate. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from California? There was no objection. Mr. ROYCE. I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of this resolution. The resolution condemns the terrorist attack in France carried out by Islamist extremists earlier this month. On January 7, two armed gunmen entered the offices of Charlie Hebdo, the satirical magazine in Paris, and, in a brutal, premeditated attack, killed 12 people and injured 11 others. The following day, as we watched this play out on international media, their associate, Amedy Coulibaly, shot and killed a female police officer, and in the following days with the Kouachi brothers on the run, Coulibaly targeted a kosher supermarket where he shot and killed four Jewish shoppers and took multiple hostages. Later that day, courageous French police officers stormed the supermarket, killed the attacker, and freed the hostages. There are no words that we can speak today, I think, that will comfort the families and the friends of the 17 people murdered in those terrorist attacks. The victims included cartoonists and maintenance workers, police officers, grocery shoppers, Christians, Jews, and Muslims. {time} 1415 There are no words strong enough to condemn these terrorists and their radical jihadist ideology. The Charlie Hebdo offices were attacked because their cartoons offended. The magazine's editor was specifically marked as a target for death by al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula's online newspaper magazine called Inspire under the not-so-subtle headline, ``A Bullet a Day Keeps the Infidel Away.'' [[Page H417]] Indeed, the Kouachi brothers called out the editor's name before they shot and killed him. Mr. Speaker, the attack on Charlie Hebdo was an attack on free speech. The right to express ideas and opinions, even if they are unpopular or offensive, is a foundation for a free society--France's and ours. Frankly, the struggle of the Enlightenment has largely been a struggle against blasphemy laws going all of the way back to the foundation of this Republic and our First Amendment and Jefferson's concept of freedom of speech and freedom of religion. It was not the first time that this magazine was attacked by terrorists. And, unfortunately, it probably won't be the last time a media outlet like this is targeted. That is why this resolution resolves to uphold and defend the basic principle--free speech. The grocery store victims were murdered because they were Jewish. In the days following, France stationed thousands of police officers to guard France's Jewish schools and synagogues in the aftermath of the terrorist attacks. Alarmingly, anti-Semitic forces are on the rise in France and in much of Europe. This resolution puts the House on record as condemning in the strongest terms possible the Paris attacks and extends the sympathy of every American to those affected by the tragedy. It reiterates our support for France, America's sister republic, our oldest ally, and it calls upon all nations to join the global effort of fighting violent extremism. This is a time to not just express sorrow for those killed but also a time to show resolve in the face of terror. Our intelligence-sharing with allies, already strong, will need to get much sharper; border checks improved; and coalition efforts to destroy ISIS will need to be stepped up. I urge all Members to support this resolution. I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume, and I rise in strong support of this resolution. Mr. Speaker, the terrorist attacks by radical Islamists in Paris were a tragedy for all who love peace and freedom. What happened at the offices of Charlie Hebdo and the kosher market reminds us this violent extremism remains a critical threat. I am happy to stand with the chairman here in showing strong bipartisanship once again because we grieve with France, our oldest ally. Our hearts break for all those who have lost loved ones in these attacks and for all who watched this carnage spill into their peaceful city streets. As a New Yorker, I remember the outpouring of support from France following September 11, 2011. But even as we mourn the dead, we draw inspiration from the displays of courage and solidarity on the streets of the City of Light, across Europe, and around the world. With the attackers still at large, Parisians took to the streets in massive and peaceful vigils. They sent a clear message to the world: freedom and justice will not be cowed by violence and terror. In these attacks, Mr. Speaker, the ancient evil of anti-Semitism once again showed its ugly face. Anti-Semitism is both a threat with which governments need to deal and a societal challenge requiring honest dialogue, critical self-examination, and constant vigilance. France's deployment of special troops and extra police to Jewish sites was the right thing to do. But much more will be needed in the days ahead to ensure that Europe's largest Jewish community is safe from attack and free from fear. Just as America stands with the people of France against terrorism, Americans also stand shoulder to shoulder with European Jewry. That is the message we are sending today with this resolution. Whether in Paris or New York, Moscow or Jerusalem, whether homegrown or imported, whether targeting Jews, Muslims, Christians, or anyone else, violent extremism has no place in a civilized world. We will continue to work with our friends and allies to put a stop to this threat. It is important that Congress go on record as strongly opposed to this violence. We will do whatever it takes to secure the future of freedom and democracy. Mr. Speaker, I am Jewish--Je suis Juif. I am Charlie--Je suis Charlie. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this resolution. I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. ROYCE. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Poe), the chairman of the Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on Terrorism, Nonproliferation, and Trade, and the author of this measure. Mr. POE of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman and the ranking member for bringing this resolution to the House floor so quickly. Mr. Speaker, it was a cold winter morning in Paris just before lunchtime when two masked men with AK-47s approached a woman standing outside the door of the Charlie Hebdo newspaper, forcing her to let them in. Once inside the door, they gunned down the security guard in the lobby and ran up to the second floor shouting, ``Where is Charb? Where is Charb?'' Charb is the nickname of the newspaper's editor, Mr. Charbonnier. After reaching their target, they executed him and 10 others. They exited the building shouting, ``Allahu Akbar,'' or ``God is the greatest.'' Then they sped off. They would kill an injured Muslim police officer lying on the ground before they fled. The two terrorists got away, but not for long. French law enforcement found and killed the men in a standoff near the Paris airport. That same day, another terrorist killed a female police officer and attacked a kosher supermarket and murdered four Jewish men. Once again, French law enforcement took care of the terrorists and rescued the hostages. These terrorists killed because they didn't like what people had to say. Mr. Speaker, it is a fundamental human right to have freedom of expression, freedom of press, freedom of speech, and freedom of religion. No amount of violence can take those rights away from us. It is basic. Mr. Speaker, this resolution says we are not going to let Islamic radical terrorists steal those rights from anyone, whether it is the French, whether it is someone else in the world or even here in America. Mr. Speaker, after all, they killed at the kosher cafe because they not only didn't like what people were saying, they didn't like those people because they were Jews. France did an excellent job bringing swift justice down on these terrorists, but the fight is certainly not over. There may be, and probably are, hundreds of others around the world plotting to kill neighbors and countrymen and people in other Nations because those terrorists don't agree with what those people say or what those people look like or what those people's personal religion may be. They think they have the right to kill in the name of a radical Islamic religion. Mr. Speaker, the threat is serious and it is deadly. This resolution remembers those folks who were killed because they believed the way they did or because they looked the way they looked or because their religion was different than others. We mourn when the French mourn. As stated earlier, the French are our oldest and first ally. In fact, Mr. Speaker, we have two portraits in this House Chamber, one of George Washington and one of Lafayette, the first great Frenchman who helped the United States. We have a close bond with the French. And it is important that we let them, the world, and especially the terrorists know that our bond with freedom-loving countries will remain strong, especially in time of need, when people are attacked because of their beliefs and the idea that they can express a difference of opinion. I want to congratulate French law enforcement for their speedy and quick resolve in disposing of these terrorists, and we should let them know that we appreciate all law enforcement who fight back against terrorists who want to kill us because we don't agree with them. Once again, I thank the chairman and the ranking member for bringing this resolution to the House floor. Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee). (Ms. JACKSON LEE asked and was given permission to revise and extend her remarks.) Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. Royce and Mr. Engel and [[Page H418]] Mr. Poe for their leadership in bringing the House together on a very important issue. Earlier today I stood and spoke about the tragic news that we heard early this morning of two Japanese citizens being held and ISIS asking for $200 million. The work of these individuals in Paris, France, and beyond was in their mind a connectedness to al Qaeda and others, proudly so, as they slaughtered those individuals who chose to lift up liberte in the spirit of the French people and take to the pen and assess the atmosphere of the day and provide humor to it. Mr. Speaker, I do not comment on one person's opinion, but I do know that liberte, democracy, liberty, and our own beliefs give every human being dignity and the freedom of expression, the free press, the right to free speech and religion, and I believe these are very valuable ideals. And so this resolution speaks to that by condemning the heinousness of the act. How many families--children, mothers, and fathers--were impacted by the loss of their loved ones? What a tragedy to see a police officer gunned down in the street who asked, as I reflect on the words as I recall them, to be left alone, and yet was shot again, and other officers in the line of duty being subjected to the violence of these individuals. This is an intolerable situation that should not be tolerated. But we are hearing from the voices of these terrorist groups that they are now asking individuals to stay in place, to stay at home and create jihad. At the same time, I have heard voices from the Islam extended community, people of the faith, Islamic faith, and I have heard them condemn these violent acts. I have heard them condemn these acts as not reflecting their faith. Then again, as we watched an individual slaughter Jewish persons in a kosher market purposely because of their faith, we cannot tolerate that. In one single voice, we should rise up as this resolution, H. Res. 37, says to express the affection for all people and their right to exist. That is, if you will, a universal phenomenon, to allow individual persons and individuals to exist without threat of heinous violence. As I talked about Dr. Martin Luther King, I said the very words he has commended to us: Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentlewoman has expired. Mr. ENGEL. I yield an additional 1 minute to the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee). Ms. JACKSON LEE. As we begin this journey into a new year, I don't know how much we will be confronted with these horrible acts. I am on the Homeland Security Committee, and for a long time we were seeing the signs of what I call franchise terrorism. But I do know that it has to be a world, a global effort, but it also has to, as I began to talk about earlier, reach the hearts and minds of young men and possibly women who are being subjected to radicalism on the Internet or elsewhere. We have to stop that bleeding, if you will, and begin to promote openly our values, which include respect for religious differences. As we do that, I believe it will be well worth the investment because we don't know where this is going to end, and we certainly need to say to the American people that we are committed, in essence that we are on top of it, and that we have many solutions to this tragic problem. So I rise in support of H. Res. 37 for its condemnation and recognition of where we are today, and I ask for us to address this in a multitude of ways in order to have peace in this world and in our Nation. {time} 1430 Mr. ROYCE. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Je suis Juif, I am Jewish. Mr. Speaker, Je suis Charlie, I am Charlie Hebdo. This is what we are all saying collectively as a Congress as we debate this bill today. This is what the people of France were saying and have been saying ever since the tragedy happened. People with placards and banners were carrying them high above France to show solidarity in the fight against terrorism. Mr. Speaker, we have had an important conversation here in the House. I am heartened by the expressions of unity and resolve, and I hope they provide a measure of comfort to those families that are suffering who had loved ones who were killed and those who were wounded by this recent attack. Symbolism looms hard in foreign affairs, and with this resolution, we deliver a powerful message. We deliver it on the day the President is going to speak with us in the State of the Union, and I think nothing could be stronger than for this House unanimously to fight terrorism, to reject terrorism, and, again, to say, ``Je suis Juif, Je suis Charlie.'' I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. ROYCE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Congressman Poe from Texas, chairman of the Subcommittee on Terrorism, Nonproliferation, and Trade, for authoring this important resolution; but I also want to thank our ranking member, Eliot Engel of New York, for his support in bringing this resolution to the floor to ensure that we speak with one voice on issues of violent extremism and to ensure that we stand with our ally France at this difficult time. Last week, many Members visited the Foreign Affairs Committee to sign a condolence book and greet the French Ambassador in person. Mr. Engel and I thanked them for their show of solidarity in this. Mr. Speaker, the ultimate reality is that these attacks in Paris are indicative of a resurgent terrorist threat from radical Islamist extremists. The brothers were connected to al Qaeda in Yemen, a particularly active and deadly al Qaeda franchise. The kosher market gunman pledged his allegiance to ISIS, which now controls parts of Iraq and Syria and has specifically targeted Americans. Up to 5,000 Europeans are believed now to have traveled to Syria to fight or get training. Whether from organized groups or returning foreign fighters or lone wolves, the terrorist threat is real, and it is growing. These are not criminals united by happenstance but by a militant jihadi impulse united by ideology, by doctrine, and by practice, its adherents drawn all the way from Africa to Southeast Asia, from the Middle East to the Caucasus. Unlike some of the rhetoric we have heard by some here in Washington, in every corner of the globe, terrorist groups are growing in number, and they are growing in strength. In Europe, France is at the front lines of a dangerous and growing ideology that has, again, demonstrated that it knows no bounds. As we face an expanding and evolving threat, it is imperative that we unequivocally condemn attacks on freedom of speech, condemn attacks on religious pluralism, and reaffirm our resolve to fight extremism. I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore.

The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the resolution was agreed to. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. ____________________","Congressional Record, Volume 161 Issue 9 (Tuesday, January 20, 2015) [Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 9 (Tuesday, January 20, 2015)] [House] [Pages H416-H418] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] CONDEMNING THE RECENT TERRORIST ATTACKS IN PARIS Mr. ROYCE.

And it is important that we let them, the world, and especially the terrorists know that our bond with freedom-loving countries will remain strong, especially in time of need, when people are attacked because of their beliefs and the idea that they can express a difference of opinion. I want to congratulate French law enforcement for their speedy and quick resolve in disposing of these terrorists, and we should let them know that we appreciate all law enforcement who fight back against terrorists who want to kill us because we don't agree with them. Once again, I thank the chairman and the ranking member for bringing this resolution to the House floor. Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee). (Ms. JACKSON LEE asked and was given permission to revise and extend her remarks.) Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. Royce and Mr. Engel and [[Page H418]] Mr. Poe for their leadership in bringing the House together on a very important issue. Earlier today I stood and spoke about the tragic news that we heard early this morning of two Japanese citizens being held and ISIS asking for $200 million. The work of these individuals in Paris, France, and beyond was in their mind a connectedness to al Qaeda and others, proudly so, as they slaughtered those individuals who chose to lift up liberte in the spirit of the French people and take to the pen and assess the atmosphere of the day and provide humor to it. Mr. Speaker, I do not comment on one person's opinion, but I do know that liberte, democracy, liberty, and our own beliefs give every human being dignity and the freedom of expression, the free press, the right to free speech and religion, and I believe these are very valuable ideals. And so this resolution speaks to that by condemning the heinousness of the act. How many families--children, mothers, and fathers--were impacted by the loss of their loved ones? What a tragedy to see a police officer gunned down in the street who asked, as I reflect on the words as I recall them, to be left alone, and yet was shot again, and other officers in the line of duty being subjected to the violence of these individuals. This is an intolerable situation that should not be tolerated. But we are hearing from the voices of these terrorist groups that they are now asking individuals to stay in place, to stay at home and create jihad. At the same time, I have heard voices from the Islam extended community, people of the faith, Islamic faith, and I have heard them condemn these violent acts. I have heard them condemn these acts as not reflecting their faith. Then again, as we watched an individual slaughter Jewish persons in a kosher market purposely because of their faith, we cannot tolerate that. In one single voice, we should rise up as this resolution, H. Res. 37, says to express the affection for all people and their right to exist. That is, if you will, a universal phenomenon, to allow individual persons and individuals to exist without threat of heinous violence. As I talked about Dr. Martin Luther King, I said the very words he has commended to us: Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentlewoman has expired. Mr. ENGEL. I yield an additional 1 minute to the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee). Ms. JACKSON LEE. As we begin this journey into a new year, I don't know how much we will be confronted with these horrible acts. I am on the Homeland Security Committee, and for a long time we were seeing the signs of what I call franchise terrorism. But I do know that it has to be a world, a global effort, but it also has to, as I began to talk about earlier, reach the hearts and minds of young men and possibly women who are being subjected to radicalism on the Internet or elsewhere. We have to stop that bleeding, if you will, and begin to promote openly our values, which include respect for religious differences. As we do that, I believe it will be well worth the investment because we don't know where this is going to end, and we certainly need to say to the American people that we are committed, in essence that we are on top of it, and that we have many solutions to this tragic problem. So I rise in support of H. Res. 37 for its condemnation and recognition of where we are today, and I ask for us to address this in a multitude of ways in order to have peace in this world and in our Nation. {time} 1430 Mr. ROYCE. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Je suis Juif, I am Jewish. Mr. Speaker, Je suis Charlie, I am Charlie Hebdo. This is what we are all saying collectively as a Congress as we debate this bill today. This is what the people of France were saying and have been saying ever since the tragedy happened. People with placards and banners were carrying them high above France to show solidarity in the fight against terrorism. Mr. Speaker, we have had an important conversation here in the House. I am heartened by the expressions of unity and resolve, and I hope they provide a measure of comfort to those families that are suffering who had loved ones who were killed and those who were wounded by this recent attack. Symbolism looms hard in foreign affairs, and with this resolution, we deliver a powerful message. We deliver it on the day the President is going to speak with us in the State of the Union, and I think nothing could be stronger than for this House unanimously to fight terrorism, to reject terrorism, and, again, to say, ``Je suis Juif, Je suis Charlie.'' I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. ROYCE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Congressman Poe from Texas, chairman of the Subcommittee on Terrorism, Nonproliferation, and Trade, for authoring this important resolution; but I also want to thank our ranking member, Eliot Engel of New York, for his support in bringing this resolution to the floor to ensure that we speak with one voice on issues of violent extremism and to ensure that we stand with our ally France at this difficult time. Last week, many Members visited the Foreign Affairs Committee to sign a condolence book and greet the French Ambassador in person. Mr. Engel and I thanked them for their show of solidarity in this. Mr. Speaker, the ultimate reality is that these attacks in Paris are indicative of a resurgent terrorist threat from radical Islamist extremists. The brothers were connected to al Qaeda in Yemen, a particularly active and deadly al Qaeda franchise. The kosher market gunman pledged his allegiance to ISIS, which now controls parts of Iraq and Syria and has specifically targeted Americans. Up to 5,000 Europeans are believed now to have traveled to Syria to fight or get training. Whether from organized groups or returning foreign fighters or lone wolves, the terrorist threat is real, and it is growing. These are not criminals united by happenstance but by a militant jihadi impulse united by ideology, by doctrine, and by practice, its adherents drawn all the way from Africa to Southeast Asia, from the Middle East to the Caucasus. Unlike some of the rhetoric we have heard by some here in Washington, in every corner of the globe, terrorist groups are growing in number, and they are growing in strength. In Europe, France is at the front lines of a dangerous and growing ideology that has, again, demonstrated that it knows no bounds. As we face an expanding and evolving threat, it is imperative that we unequivocally condemn attacks on freedom of speech, condemn attacks on religious pluralism, and reaffirm our resolve to fight extremism. I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from California (Mr. Royce) that the House suspend the rules and agree to the resolution, H. Res. 37. The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the resolution was agreed to. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. ____________________",package_114_126.csv,22313,22313,22382,"[congressional record volume 161, number 9 (tuesday, january 20, 2015)] [house] [pages h416-h418] from the congressional record online through the government publishing office [ www.gpo.gov ] condemning the recent terrorist attacks in paris mr. royce. mr. speaker, i move to suspend the rules and agree to the resolution (h. res. 37) expressing the sense of the house of representatives condemning the recent terrorist attacks in paris that resulted in the deaths of seventeen innocent persons and offering condolences to those personally affected by this cowardly act. the clerk read the title of the resolution. the text of the resolution is as follows: h. res. 37 whereas, on january 7, 2015, armed radical islamist terrorists stormed the offices of the satirical newspaper charlie hebdo and slaughtered twelve people, including editorial staff of the paper, a visitor, a security guard, a maintenance worker, and a muslim police officer; whereas terrorists cherif and said kouachi, who carried out the attack, were located and killed by police two days later and their hostages rescued; whereas amedy coulibaly killed a female police officer on january 8, 2015, and intentionally targeted a kosher supermarket, taking multiple hostages and murdering four jewish men on january 9, 2015, before french police raided the store, killed coulibaly, and rescued the surviving hostages; whereas amedy coulibaly stated that he had worked in coordination with said and cherif kouachi and called them ``brothers from our team''; whereas hayat boumeddiene, a fourth suspect connected with the attack and the common-law wife of amedy coulibaly, remains at large; whereas the kouachi brothers are believed to have traveled to yemen in 2011 where they are reported to have received weapons training and met with anwar al-awlaki, a senior member of al-qaeda in the arabian peninsula; whereas al-qaeda in the arabian peninsula claimed credit for the charlie hebdo attack; whereas amedy coulibaly claimed to be a member of the islamic state of iraq and syria; whereas radical islamist terrorist groups, including the islamic state of iraq and the levant, al-qaeda and its affiliates worldwide, the taliban and haqqani network in afghanistan and pakistan, ansar al-sharia in libya, boko haram in nigeria, al-shabaab in somalia, hizballah in lebanon and syria, hamas in gaza, and others, pose a growing threat to international peace and stability; whereas these terrorist attacks represent an assault on fundamental principles essential to a democratic society, including the universal right to free expression and freedom of religion; whereas the increase in anti-semitic attacks in france and throughout europe remains of great concern; whereas the united states and france share a longstanding cultural, political, and economic relationship that has greatly benefitted both nations; whereas since the founding of our nation, france has been an ally of the united states, and french soldiers have fought side-by-side with american soldiers throughout history, including during two world wars; whereas security cooperation between the united states and france plays an essential role in combating violent extremism in west and north africa, the middle east and around the world; and whereas the united states is committed to supporting its oldest ally france in this difficult time: now, therefore, be it resolved, that the house of representatives-- (1) condemns the recent terrorist attacks in paris that resulted in the tragic loss of seventeen innocent lives; (2) extends its deepest sympathies to all those affected by this tragedy; (3) supports the efforts of the government of france to ensure that all of those individuals who committed or supported these attacks are brought to justice; (4) remains concerned regarding the flow of foreign fighters to and from the middle east and west and north africa and the threat posed by these individuals upon their return to their local communities; (5) appreciates and supports france's continuing efforts to combat terrorism and promote stability throughout the middle east and west and north africa; (6) appreciates france's contributions to the multilateral effort to destroy the islamic state of iraq and the levant; (7) recognizes the growing threat posed by radical islamist terrorist groups worldwide and reaffirms the commitment of the united states to the multilateral, global fight against such violent extremists; (8) calls upon all nations to join a global effort to combat violent extremist ideologies and terrorist groups; and (9) remains committed to the defense of free expression, including religious freedom, as well as other universal values that terrorists seek to destroy through a campaign of cowardly threats and reprehensible violence. the speaker pro tempore. pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from california (mr. royce) and the gentleman from new york (mr. engel) each will control 20 minutes. the chair recognizes the gentleman from california. general leave mr. royce. mr. speaker, i ask unanimous consent that all members have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and to add any extraneous material to the record in this debate. the speaker pro tempore. is there objection to the request of the gentleman from california? there was no objection. mr. royce. i yield myself such time as i may consume. mr. speaker, i rise today in support of this resolution. the resolution condemns the terrorist attack in france carried out by islamist extremists earlier this month. on january 7, two armed gunmen entered the offices of charlie hebdo, the satirical magazine in paris, and, in a brutal, premeditated attack, killed 12 people and injured 11 others. the following day, as we watched this play out on international media, their associate, amedy coulibaly, shot and killed a female police officer, and in the following days with the kouachi brothers on the run, coulibaly targeted a kosher supermarket where he shot and killed four jewish shoppers and took multiple hostages. later that day, courageous french police officers stormed the supermarket, killed the attacker, and freed the hostages. there are no words that we can speak today, i think, that will comfort the families and the friends of the 17 people murdered in those terrorist attacks. the victims included cartoonists and maintenance workers, police officers, grocery shoppers, christians, jews, and muslims. {time} 1415 there are no words strong enough to condemn these terrorists and their radical jihadist ideology. the charlie hebdo offices were attacked because their cartoons offended. the magazine's editor was specifically marked as a target for death by al qaeda in the arabian peninsula's online newspaper magazine called inspire under the not-so-subtle headline, ``a bullet a day keeps the infidel away.'' [[page h417]] indeed, the kouachi brothers called out the editor's name before they shot and killed him. mr. speaker, the attack on charlie hebdo was an attack on free speech. the right to express ideas and opinions, even if they are unpopular or offensive, is a foundation for a free society--france's and ours. frankly, the struggle of the enlightenment has largely been a struggle against blasphemy laws going all of the way back to the foundation of this republic and our first amendment and jefferson's concept of freedom of speech and freedom of religion. it was not the first time that this magazine was attacked by terrorists. and, unfortunately, it probably won't be the last time a media outlet like this is targeted. that is why this resolution resolves to uphold and defend the basic principle--free speech. the grocery store victims were murdered because they were jewish. in the days following, france stationed thousands of police officers to guard france's jewish schools and synagogues in the aftermath of the terrorist attacks. alarmingly, anti-semitic forces are on the rise in france and in much of europe. this resolution puts the house on record as condemning in the strongest terms possible the paris attacks and extends the sympathy of every american to those affected by the tragedy. it reiterates our support for france, america's sister republic, our oldest ally, and it calls upon all nations to join the global effort of fighting violent extremism. this is a time to not just express sorrow for those killed but also a time to show resolve in the face of terror. our intelligence-sharing with allies, already strong, will need to get much sharper; border checks improved; and coalition efforts to destroy isis will need to be stepped up. i urge all members to support this resolution. i reserve the balance of my time. mr. engel. mr. speaker, i yield myself such time as i may consume, and i rise in strong support of this resolution. mr. speaker, the terrorist attacks by radical islamists in paris were a tragedy for all who love peace and freedom. what happened at the offices of charlie hebdo and the kosher market reminds us this violent extremism remains a critical threat. i am happy to stand with the chairman here in showing strong bipartisanship once again because we grieve with france, our oldest ally. our hearts break for all those who have lost loved ones in these attacks and for all who watched this carnage spill into their peaceful city streets. as a new yorker, i remember the outpouring of support from france following september 11, 2011. but even as we mourn the dead, we draw inspiration from the displays of courage and solidarity on the streets of the city of light, across europe, and around the world. with the attackers still at large, parisians took to the streets in massive and peaceful vigils. they sent a clear message to the world: freedom and justice will not be cowed by violence and terror. in these attacks, mr. speaker, the ancient evil of anti-semitism once again showed its ugly face. anti-semitism is both a threat with which governments need to deal and a societal challenge requiring honest dialogue, critical self-examination, and constant vigilance. france's deployment of special troops and extra police to jewish sites was the right thing to do. but much more will be needed in the days ahead to ensure that europe's largest jewish community is safe from attack and free from fear. just as america stands with the people of france against terrorism, americans also stand shoulder to shoulder with european jewry. that is the message we are sending today with this resolution. whether in paris or new york, moscow or jerusalem, whether homegrown or imported, whether targeting jews, muslims, christians, or anyone else, violent extremism has no place in a civilized world. we will continue to work with our friends and allies to put a stop to this threat. it is important that congress go on record as strongly opposed to this violence. we will do whatever it takes to secure the future of freedom and democracy. mr. speaker, i am jewish--je suis juif. i am charlie--je suis charlie. mr. speaker, i urge my colleagues to support this resolution. i reserve the balance of my time. mr. royce. mr. speaker, i yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from texas (mr. poe), the chairman of the foreign affairs subcommittee on terrorism, nonproliferation, and trade, and the author of this measure. mr. poe of texas. mr. speaker, i thank the chairman and the ranking member for bringing this resolution to the house floor so quickly. mr. speaker, it was a cold winter morning in paris just before lunchtime when two masked men with ak-47s approached a woman standing outside the door of the charlie hebdo newspaper, forcing her to let them in. once inside the door, they gunned down the security guard in the lobby and ran up to the second floor shouting, ``where is charb? where is charb?'' charb is the nickname of the newspaper's editor, mr. charbonnier. after reaching their target, they executed him and 10 others. they exited the building shouting, ``allahu akbar,'' or ``god is the greatest.'' then they sped off. they would kill an injured muslim police officer lying on the ground before they fled. the two terrorists got away, but not for long. french law enforcement found and killed the men in a standoff near the paris airport. that same day, another terrorist killed a female police officer and attacked a kosher supermarket and murdered four jewish men. once again, french law enforcement took care of the terrorists and rescued the hostages. these terrorists killed because they didn't like what people had to say. mr. speaker, it is a fundamental human right to have freedom of expression, freedom of press, freedom of speech, and freedom of religion. no amount of violence can take those rights away from us. it is basic. mr. speaker, this resolution says we are not going to let islamic radical terrorists steal those rights from anyone, whether it is the french, whether it is someone else in the world or even here in america. mr. speaker, after all, they killed at the kosher cafe because they not only didn't like what people were saying, they didn't like those people because they were jews. france did an excellent job bringing swift justice down on these terrorists, but the fight is certainly not over. there may be, and probably are, hundreds of others around the world plotting to kill neighbors and countrymen and people in other nations because those terrorists don't agree with what those people say or what those people look like or what those people's personal religion may be. they think they have the right to kill in the name of a radical islamic religion. mr. speaker, the threat is serious and it is deadly. this resolution remembers those folks who were killed because they believed the way they did or because they looked the way they looked or because their religion was different than others. we mourn when the french mourn. as stated earlier, the french are our oldest and first ally. in fact, mr. speaker, we have two portraits in this house chamber, one of george washington and one of lafayette, the first great frenchman who helped the united states. we have a close bond with the french. and it is important that we let them, the world, and especially the terrorists know that our bond with freedom-loving countries will remain strong, especially in time of need, when people are attacked because of their beliefs and the idea that they can express a difference of opinion. i want to congratulate french law enforcement for their speedy and quick resolve in disposing of these terrorists, and we should let them know that we appreciate all law enforcement who fight back against terrorists who want to kill us because we don't agree with them. once again, i thank the chairman and the ranking member for bringing this resolution to the house floor. mr. engel. mr. speaker, i yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from texas (ms. jackson lee). (ms. jackson lee asked and was given permission to revise and extend her remarks.) ms. jackson lee. mr. speaker, i thank mr. royce and mr. engel and [[page h418]] mr. poe for their leadership in bringing the house together on a very important issue. earlier today i stood and spoke about the tragic news that we heard early this morning of two japanese citizens being held and isis asking for $200 million. the work of these individuals in paris, france, and beyond was in their mind a connectedness to al qaeda and others, proudly so, as they slaughtered those individuals who chose to lift up liberte in the spirit of the french people and take to the pen and assess the atmosphere of the day and provide humor to it. mr. speaker, i do not comment on one person's opinion, but i do know that liberte, democracy, liberty, and our own beliefs give every human being dignity and the freedom of expression, the free press, the right to free speech and religion, and i believe these are very valuable ideals. and so this resolution speaks to that by condemning the heinousness of the act. how many families--children, mothers, and fathers--were impacted by the loss of their loved ones? what a tragedy to see a police officer gunned down in the street who asked, as i reflect on the words as i recall them, to be left alone, and yet was shot again, and other officers in the line of duty being subjected to the violence of these individuals. this is an intolerable situation that should not be tolerated. but we are hearing from the voices of these terrorist groups that they are now asking individuals to stay in place, to stay at home and create jihad. at the same time, i have heard voices from the islam extended community, people of the faith, islamic faith, and i have heard them condemn these violent acts. i have heard them condemn these acts as not reflecting their faith. then again, as we watched an individual slaughter jewish persons in a kosher market purposely because of their faith, we cannot tolerate that. in one single voice, we should rise up as this resolution, h. res. 37, says to express the affection for all people and their right to exist. that is, if you will, a universal phenomenon, to allow individual persons and individuals to exist without threat of heinous violence. as i talked about dr. martin luther king, i said the very words he has commended to us: injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere. the speaker pro tempore. the time of the gentlewoman has expired. mr. engel. i yield an additional 1 minute to the gentlewoman from texas (ms. jackson lee). ms. jackson lee. as we begin this journey into a new year, i don't know how much we will be confronted with these horrible acts. i am on the homeland security committee, and for a long time we were seeing the signs of what i call franchise terrorism. but i do know that it has to be a world, a global effort, but it also has to, as i began to talk about earlier, reach the hearts and minds of young men and possibly women who are being subjected to radicalism on the internet or elsewhere. we have to stop that bleeding, if you will, and begin to promote openly our values, which include respect for religious differences. as we do that, i believe it will be well worth the investment because we don't know where this is going to end, and we certainly need to say to the american people that we are committed, in essence that we are on top of it, and that we have many solutions to this tragic problem. so i rise in support of h. res. 37 for its condemnation and recognition of where we are today, and i ask for us to address this in a multitude of ways in order to have peace in this world and in our nation. {time} 1430 mr. royce. mr. speaker, i reserve the balance of my time. mr. engel. mr. speaker, i yield myself such time as i may consume. je suis juif, i am jewish. mr. speaker, je suis charlie, i am charlie hebdo. this is what we are all saying collectively as a congress as we debate this bill today. this is what the people of france were saying and have been saying ever since the tragedy happened. people with placards and banners were

extremism and to ensure that we stand with our ally france at this difficult time. last week, many members visited the foreign affairs committee to sign a condolence book and greet the french

from radical islamist extremists. the brothers were connected to al qaeda in yemen, a particularly active and deadly al qaeda franchise. the kosher market gunman pledged his allegiance to isis, which now controls parts of iraq and syria and has specifically targeted americans. up to 5,000 europeans are believed now to have traveled to syria to fight or get training. whether from organized groups

(Applause, the Members rising.) The SPEAKER. Members of the Congress, I have the high privilege and the distinct honor of presenting to you the President of the United States. (Applause, the Members rising.) The PRESIDENT. Mr. Speaker, Mr. Vice President, Members of Congress, my fellow Americans: We are 15 years into this new century--15 years that dawned with terror touching our shores, that unfolded with a new generation fighting two long and costly wars, that saw a vicious recession spread across our Nation and the world. It has been, and still is, a hard time for many. But, tonight, we turn the page. Tonight, after a breakthrough year for America, our economy is growing and creating jobs at the fastest pace since 1999. Our unemployment rate is now lower than it was before the financial crisis. More of our kids are graduating than ever before. More of our people are insured than ever before. And we are as free from the grip of foreign oil as we have been in almost 30 years. [[Page H420]] Tonight, for the first time since 9/11, our combat mission in Afghanistan is over. Six years ago, nearly 180,000 American troops served in Iraq and Afghanistan. Today, fewer than 15,000 remain. And we salute the courage and sacrifice of every man and woman in this 9/11 generation who has served to keep us safe. We are humbled and grateful for your service. America, for all that we have endured, for all the grit and hard work required to come back, for all the tasks that lie ahead, know this: the shadow of crisis has passed, and the state of the Union is strong. At this moment, with a growing economy, shrinking deficits, bustling industry, and booming energy production, we have risen from recession freer to write our own future than any other nation on Earth. It is now up to us to choose who we want to be over the next 15 years and for decades to come. Will we accept an economy where only a few of us do spectacularly well, or will we commit ourselves to an economy that generates rising incomes and chances for everyone who makes the effort? Will we approach the world fearful and reactive, dragged into costly conflicts that strain our military and set back our standing, or will we lead wisely, using all elements of our power to defeat new threats and protect our planet? Will we allow ourselves to be sorted into factions and turned against one another, or will we recapture the sense of common purpose that has always propelled America forward? In 2 weeks, I will send this Congress a budget filled with ideas that are practical, not partisan; and in the months ahead, I will crisscross the country, making a case for those ideas. So, tonight, I want to focus less on a checklist of proposals and focus more on the values at stake in the choices before us. It begins with our economy. Seven years ago, Rebekah and Ben Erler of Minneapolis were newlyweds. She waited tables. He worked construction. Their first child, Jack, was on the way. They were young and in love in America, and it doesn't get much better than that. ``If only we had known,'' Rebekah wrote to me last spring, ``what was about to happen to the housing and construction market.'' As the crisis worsened, Ben's business dried up, so he took what jobs he could find even if they kept him on the road for long stretches of time. Rebekah took out student loans, enrolled in community college, and retrained for a new career. They sacrificed for each other, and, slowly, it paid off. They bought their first home. They had a second son, Henry. Rebekah got a better job and then a raise. Ben is back in construction and home for dinner every night. ``It is amazing,'' Rebekah wrote, ``what you can bounce back from when you have to . . . we are a strong, tight-knit family who has made it through some very, very hard times.'' We are a strong, tight-knit family who has made it through some very, very hard times. America, Rebekah and Ben's story is our story. They represent the millions who have worked hard and scrimped and sacrificed and retooled. You are the reason that I ran for this office. You are the people I was thinking of 6 years ago today, in the darkest months of the crisis, when I stood on the steps of this Capitol and promised we would rebuild our economy on a new foundation; and it has been your resilience--your effort--that has made it possible for our country to emerge stronger. We believed we could reverse the tide of outsourcing and draw new jobs to our shores, and over the past 5 years, our businesses have created more than 11 million new jobs. We believed we could reduce our dependence on foreign oil and protect our planet, and, today, America is number one in oil and gas. America is number one in wind power. Every 3 weeks, we bring online as much solar power as we did in all of 2008. And thanks to lower gas prices and higher fuel standards, the typical family this year should save about $750 at the pump. We believed we could prepare our kids for a more competitive world, and, today, our younger students have earned the highest math and reading scores on record. Our high school graduation rate has hit an all-time high, and more Americans finish college than ever before. We believed that sensible regulations could prevent another crisis, shield families from ruin, and encourage fair competition. Today, we have new tools to stop taxpayer-funded bailouts and a new consumer watchdog to protect us from predatory lending and abusive credit card practices, and in the past year alone, about 10 million uninsured Americans finally gained the security of health coverage. At every step, we were told our goals were misguided or too ambitious, that we would crush jobs and explode deficits. Instead, we have seen the fastest economic growth in over a decade, our deficits cut by two-thirds, a stock market that has doubled, and health care inflation at its lowest rate in 50 years. This is good news, people. So the verdict is clear. Middle class economics works, expanding opportunity works, and these policies will continue to work, as long as politics don't get in the way. We can't slow down businesses or put our economy at risk with government shutdowns or fiscal showdowns. We can't put the security of families at risk by taking away their health insurance or unraveling the new rules on Wall Street or refighting past battles on immigration when we have got to fix a broken system. And if a bill comes to my desk that tries to do any of these things, I will veto it. It will earn my veto. Today, thanks to a growing economy, the recovery is touching more and more lives. Wages are finally starting to rise again. We know that more small business owners plan to raise their employees' pay than at any time since 2007. But here is the thing. Those of us here tonight, we need to set our sights higher than just making sure government doesn't screw things up and halt the progress we are making. We need to do more than just do no harm. Tonight, together, let's do more to restore the link between hard work and growing opportunity for every American because families like Rebekah's still need our help. She and Ben are working as hard as ever but have to forego vacations and a new car so that they can pay off student loans and save for retirement. Friday-night pizza, that is a big splurge. Basic childcare for Jack and Henry costs more than their mortgage and almost as much as a year at the University of Minnesota. Like millions of hardworking Americans, Rebekah isn't asking for a handout, but she is asking that we look for more ways to help families get ahead. In fact, at every moment of economic change throughout our history, this country has taken bold action to adapt to new circumstances and to make sure everyone gets a fair shot. We set up worker protections, Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid to protect ourselves from the harshest adversity. We gave our citizens schools and colleges, infrastructure and the Internet--tools they needed to go as far as their efforts and their dreams will take them. That is what middle class economics is: the idea that this country does best when everyone gets their fair shot, everyone does their fair share, and everyone plays by the same set of rules. We don't just want everyone to share in America's success; we want everyone to contribute to our success. So what does middle class economics require in our time? First, middle class economics means helping working families feel more secure in a world of constant change. That means helping folks afford childcare, college, health care, a home, retirement; and my budget will address each of these issues, lowering the taxes of working families and putting thousands of dollars back into their pockets each year. Here is one example. During World War II, when men like my grandfather went off to war, having women like my grandmother in the workforce was a national security priority, so this country provided universal childcare. In today's economy, when having both parents in the workforce is an economic necessity for many families, we need affordable, high-quality childcare more than ever. It is not a nice-to-have; it is a must-have. It is time we stop treating childcare as a side issue or a women's issue and treat it like the national economic priority that it is for all of us, and that is [[Page H421]] why my plan will make quality childcare more available and more affordable for every middle class and low-income family with young children in America--by creating more slots and a new tax cut of up to $3,000 per child, per year. Here is another example. Today, we are the only advanced country on Earth that doesn't guarantee paid sick leave or paid maternity leave to our workers. Forty-three million workers have no paid sick leave. Forty-three million. Think about that. And that forces too many parents to make the gut-wrenching choice between a paycheck and a sick kid at home. So I will be taking new action to help States adopt paid leave laws of their own. And since paid sick leave won where it was on the ballot last November, let's put it to a vote right here in Washington. Send me a bill that gives every worker in America the opportunity to earn 7 days of paid sick leave. It is the right thing to do. Of course, nothing helps families make ends meet like higher wages. That is why this Congress still needs to pass a law that makes sure a woman is paid the same as a man for doing the same work. Really. It is 2015. It is time. We still need to make sure employees get the overtime they have earned. And to everyone in this Congress who still refuses to raise the minimum wage, I say this: If you truly believe you could work full time and support a family on less than $15,000 a year, try it. If not, vote to give millions of the hardest-working people in America a raise. Now, these ideas won't make everybody rich, won't relieve every hardship. That is not the job of government. To give working families a fair shot, we still need more employers to see beyond next quarter's earnings and recognize that investing in their workforce is in their company's long-term interest. We still need laws that strengthen, rather than weaken, unions and give American workers a voice. But, you know, things like child care and sick leave and equal pay, things like lower mortgage premiums and a higher minimum wage, these ideas will make a meaningful difference in the lives of millions of families. That is a fact. And that is what all of us, Republicans and Democrats alike, were sent here to do. Now, second, to make sure folks keep earning higher wages down the road, we have to do more to help Americans upgrade their skills. America thrived in the 20th century because we made high school free, sent a generation of GIs to college, trained the best workforce in the world. We were ahead of the curve. But other countries caught on, and in a 21st century economy that rewards knowledge like never before, we need to up our game. We need to do more. By the end of this decade, two in three job openings will require some higher education, two in three. And yet, we still live in a country where too many bright, striving Americans are priced out of the education they need. It is not fair to them, and it is sure not smart for our future. That is why I am sending this Congress a bold new plan to lower the cost of community college to zero. Keep in mind, 40 percent of our college students choose community college. Some are young and starting out. Some are older and looking for a better job. Some are veterans and single parents trying to transition back into the job market. Whoever you are, this plan is your chance to graduate ready for the new economy without a load of debt. Understand, you have got to earn it. You have got to keep your grades up and graduate on time. Tennessee, a State with Republican leadership, and Chicago, a city with Democratic leadership, are showing that free community college is possible. I want to spread that idea all across America, that 2 years of college becomes as free and universal in America as high school is today. Let's stay ahead of the curve. And I want to work with this Congress to make sure those already burdened with student loans can reduce their monthly payments so that student debt doesn't derail anyone's dreams. Thanks to Vice President Biden's great work to update our job training system, we are connecting community colleges with local employers to train workers to fill high-paying jobs like coding and nursing and robotics. Tonight I am also asking more businesses to follow the lead of companies like CVS and UPS and offer more educational benefits and paid apprenticeships, opportunities that give workers the chance to earn higher-paying jobs even if they don't have a higher education. And as a new generation of veterans comes home, we owe them every opportunity to live the American Dream they helped defend. Already, we have made strides towards ensuring that every veteran has access to the highest-quality care. We are slashing the backlog that had too many veterans waiting years to get the benefits they need, and we are making it easier for vets to translate their training and experience into civilian jobs. And Joining Forces, the national campaign launched by Michelle and Jill Biden--thank you, Michelle; thank you, Jill--has helped nearly 700,000 veterans and military spouses get a new job. So to every CEO in America, let me repeat: If you want somebody who is going to get the job done and done right, hire a veteran. Finally, as we better train our workers, we need the new economy to keep churning out high-wage jobs for our workers to fill. Since 2010, America has put more people back to work than Europe, Japan, and all advanced economies combined. Our manufacturers have added almost 800,000 new jobs. Some of our bedrock sectors, like our auto industry, are booming. But there are also millions of Americans who work jobs that didn't even exist 10 or 20 years ago, jobs at companies like Google and eBay and Tesla. So no one knows for certain which industries will generate the jobs of the future. But we do know we want them here in America. We know that. And that is why the third part of middle class economics is all about building the most competitive economy anywhere, the place where businesses want to locate and hire. Twenty-first century businesses need 21st century infrastructure, modern ports and stronger bridges, faster trains and the fastest Internet. Democrats and Republicans used to agree on this. So let's set our sights higher than a single oil pipeline. Let's pass a bipartisan infrastructure plan that could create more than 30 times as many jobs per year and make this country stronger for decades to come. Let's do it. Let's get it done. Let's get it done. Twenty-first century businesses, including small businesses, need to sell more American products overseas. Today, our businesses export more than ever, and exporters tend to pay their workers higher wages. But as we speak, China wants to write the rules for the world's fastest- growing region. That would put our workers and our businesses at a disadvantage. Why would we let that happen? We should write those rules. We should level the playing field. That is why I am asking both parties to give me trade promotion authority to protect American workers with strong new trade deals from Asia to Europe that aren't just free but are also fair. It is the right thing to do. Look, I am the first one to admit that past trade deals haven't always lived up to the hype, and that is why we have gone after countries that break the rules at our expense. But 95 percent of the world's customers live outside our borders. We can't close ourselves off from those opportunities. More than half of manufacturing executives have said they are actively looking to bring jobs back from China. Let's give them one more reason to get it done. Twenty-first century businesses will rely on American science and technology, research and development. I want the country that eliminated polio and mapped the human genome to lead a new era of medicine, one that delivers the right treatment at the right time. In some patients with cystic fibrosis, this approach has reversed a disease once thought unstoppable. So tonight, I am launching a new Precision Medicine Initiative to bring us closer to curing diseases like cancer and diabetes, and to give all of us access to the personalized information we need to keep ourselves and our families healthier. We can do this. I intend to protect a free and open Internet, extend its reach to every [[Page H422]] classroom and every community, and help folks build the fastest networks so that the next generation of digital innovators and entrepreneurs have the platform to keep reshaping our world. I want Americans to win the race for the kinds of discoveries that unleash new jobs: converting sunlight into liquid fuel; creating revolutionary prosthetics so that a veteran who gave his arms for his country can play catch with his kids again; pushing out into the solar system not just to visit, but to stay. Now, last month, we launched a new spacecraft as part of a reenergized space program that will send American astronauts to Mars; and in 2 months, to prepare us for those missions, Scott Kelly will begin a year-long stay in space. So good luck, Captain. Make sure to Instagram it. We are proud of you. Now, the truth is, when it comes to issues like infrastructure and basic research, I know there is bipartisan support in this Chamber. Members of both parties have told me so. Where we too often run onto the rocks is how to pay for these investments. As Americans, we don't mind paying our fair share of taxes as long as everybody else does too. But for far too long, lobbyists have rigged the Tax Code with loopholes that let some corporations pay nothing while others pay full freight. They have riddled it with giveaways that the superrich don't need while denying a break to middle class families who do. This year, we have an opportunity to change that. Let's close loopholes so we stop rewarding companies that keep profits abroad and reward those that invest here in America. Let's use those savings to rebuild our infrastructure and to make it more attractive for companies to bring jobs home. Let's simplify the system and let a small business owner file based on her actual bank statement instead of the number of accountants she can afford. And let's close the loopholes that lead to inequality, by allowing the top 1 percent to avoid paying taxes on their accumulated wealth. We can use that money to help more families pay for child care and send their kids to college. We need a Tax Code that truly helps working Americans try to get a leg up in the new economy. And we can achieve that together. We can achieve it together. Helping hardworking families make ends meet, giving them the tools they need for good-paying jobs in this new economy, and maintaining the conditions of growth and competitiveness, this is where America needs to go. I believe it is where the American people want to go. It will make our economy stronger a year from now, 15 years from now, and deep into the century ahead. Of course, if there is one thing this new century has taught us, it is that we cannot separate our work here at home from challenges beyond our shores. My first duty as Commander in Chief is to defend the United States of America. In doing so, the question is not whether America leads in the world, but how. When we make rash decisions--reacting to the headlines instead of using our heads--when the first response to a challenge is to send in our military, then we risk getting drawn into unnecessary conflicts and neglect the broader strategy we need for a safer, more prosperous world. That is what our enemies want us to do. I believe in a smarter kind of American leadership. We lead best when we combine military power with strong diplomacy, when we leverage our power with coalition building, when we don't let our fears blind us to the opportunities that this new century presents. That is exactly what we are doing right now, and around the globe, it is making a difference. First, we stand united with people around the world who have been targeted by terrorists, from a school in Pakistan to the streets of Paris. We will continue to hunt down terrorists and dismantle their networks; and we reserve the right to act unilaterally, as we have done relentlessly since I took office, to take out terrorists who pose a direct threat to us and our allies. At the same time, we have learned some costly lessons over the last 13 years. Instead of Americans patrolling the valleys of Afghanistan, we have trained their security forces, who have now taken the lead; and we have honored our troops' sacrifice by supporting that country's first democratic transition. Instead of sending large ground forces overseas, we are partnering with nations from south Asia to north Africa to deny safe haven to terrorists who threaten America. In Iraq and Syria, American leadership, including our military power, is stopping ISIL's advance. Instead of getting dragged into another ground war in the Middle East, we are leading a broad coalition, including Arab nations, to degrade and ultimately destroy this terrorist group. We are also supporting a moderate opposition in Syria that can help us in this effort and are assisting people everywhere who stand up to the bankrupt ideology of violent extremism. Now, this effort will take time. It will require focus. But we will succeed. And tonight, I call on this Congress to show the world that we are united in this mission by passing a resolution to authorize the use of force against ISIL. We need that authority. Second, we are demonstrating the power of American strength and diplomacy. We are upholding the principle that bigger nations can't bully the small, by opposing Russian aggression and supporting Ukraine's democracy and reassuring our NATO allies. Last year, as we were doing the hard work of imposing sanctions, along with our allies, as we were reinforcing our presence with the frontline States, Mr. Putin's aggression, it was suggested, was a masterful display of strategy and strength. That is what I heard from some folks. Well, today it is America that stands strong and united with our allies, while Russia is isolated with its economy in tatters. That is how America leads--not with bluster but with persistent, steady resolve. In Cuba, we are ending a policy that was long past its expiration date. When what you are doing doesn't work for 50 years, it is time to try something new. Our shift in Cuba policy has the potential to end a legacy of mistrust in our hemisphere. It removes a phony excuse for restrictions in Cuba, stands up for democratic values, and extends the hand of friendship to the Cuban people. And this year, Congress should begin the work of ending the embargo. As His Holiness, Pope Francis, has said, diplomacy is the work of ``small steps.'' These small steps have added up to new hope for the future in Cuba. And after years in prison, we are overjoyed that Alan Gross is back home where he belongs. Welcome home, Alan. We are glad you are here. Our diplomacy is at work with respect to Iran where, for the first time in a decade, we have halted the progress of its nuclear program and reduced its stockpile of nuclear material. Between now and this spring, we have a chance to negotiate a comprehensive agreement that prevents a nuclear-armed Iran, secures America and our allies-- including Israel--while avoiding yet another Middle East conflict There are no guarantees that negotiations will succeed, and I keep all options on the table to prevent a nuclear Iran. But new sanctions passed by this Congress at this moment in time will all but guarantee that diplomacy fails--alienating America from its allies, making it harder to maintain sanctions, and ensuring that Iran starts up its nuclear program again. It doesn't make sense, and that is why I will veto any new sanctions bill that threatens to undo this progress. The American people expect us to only go to war as a last resort, and I intend to stay true to that wisdom. Third, we are looking beyond the issues that have consumed us in the past to shape the coming century. No foreign nation and no hacker should be able to shut down our networks, steal our trade secrets, or invade the privacy of American families, especially our kids. So we are making sure our government integrates intelligence to combat cyber threats, just as we have done to combat terrorism. Tonight, I urge this Congress to finally pass the legislation we need to better meet the evolving threat of cyber attacks, combat identity theft, and protect our children's information. That should be a bipartisan effort. If we don't act, we will leave our Nation and our economy vulnerable. If we [[Page H423]] do, we can continue to protect the technologies that have unleashed untold opportunities for people around the globe. In west Africa, our troops, our scientists, our doctors, our nurses, and our health care workers are rolling back Ebola, saving countless lives and stopping the spread of disease. I could not be prouder of them, and I thank this Congress for your bipartisan support of their efforts. But the job is not yet done, and the world needs to use this lesson to build a more effective global effort to prevent the spread of future pandemics, invest in smart development, and eradicate extreme poverty. In the Asia Pacific, we are modernizing alliances while making sure that other nations play by the rules in how they trade, how they resolve maritime disputes, and how they participate in meeting common international challenges like nonproliferation and disaster relief; and no challenge poses a greater threat to future generations than climate change. 2014 was the planet's warmest year on record. Now, 1 year doesn't make a trend, but this does: 14 of the 15 warmest years on record have all fallen in the first 15 years of this century. I have heard some folks try to dodge the evidence by saying they are not scientists and that we don't have enough information to act. Well, I am not a scientist either, but you know what, I know a lot of really good scientists at NASA, at NOAA, and at our major universities. The best scientists in the world are all telling us that our activities are changing the climate, and if we don't act forcefully, we will continue to see rising oceans; longer, hotter heat waves; dangerous droughts and floods; and massive disruptions that can trigger greater migration, conflict, and hunger around the globe. The Pentagon says that climate change poses immediate risks to our national security. We should act like it. That is why, over the past 6 years, we have done more than ever to combat climate change, from the way we produce energy to the way we use it; that is why we have set aside more public lands and waters than any administration in history; and that is why I will not let this Congress endanger the health of our children by turning back the clock on our efforts. I am determined to make sure that American leadership drives international action. In Beijing, we made an historic announcement. The United States will double the pace at which we cut carbon pollution, and China committed for the first time to limiting their emissions. Because the world's two largest economies came together, other nations are now stepping up and offering hope that, this year, the world will finally reach an agreement to protect the one planet we have got. There is one last pillar of our leadership, and that is the example of our values. As Americans, we respect human dignity even when we are threatened, which is why I have prohibited torture and worked to make sure our use of new technology, like drones, is properly constrained. It is why we speak out against the deplorable anti-Semitism that has resurfaced in certain parts of the world. It is why we continue to reject offensive stereotypes of Muslims, the vast majority of whom share our commitment to peace. That is why we defend free speech; advocate for political prisoners; and condemn the persecution of women or religious minorities or people who are lesbian, gay, bisexual, or transgender. We do these things not only because they are the right thing to do, but because, ultimately, they will make us safer. As Americans, we have a profound commitment to justice, so it makes no sense to spend $3 million per prisoner to keep open a prison that the world condemns and terrorists use to recruit. Since I have been President, we have worked responsibly to cut the population of GTMO in half. Now, it is time to finish the job, and I will not relent in my determination to shut it down. It is not who we are. It is time to close GTMO. As Americans, we cherish our civil liberties, and we need to uphold that commitment if we want maximum cooperation from other countries and industry in our fight against terrorist networks. So while some have moved on from the debates over our surveillance programs, I have not. As promised, our intelligence agencies have worked hard with the recommendations of privacy advocates to increase transparency and build more safeguards against potential abuse. Next month, we will issue a report on how we are keeping our promise to keep our country safe while strengthening privacy. Looking to the future instead of the past, making sure we match our power with diplomacy and use force wisely, building coalitions to meet new challenges and opportunities, and leading always with the example of our values, that is what makes us exceptional. That is what keeps us strong. That is why we have to keep striving to hold ourselves to the highest of standards: our own. Just over a decade ago, I gave a speech in Boston where I said that there wasn't a liberal America or a conservative America, or a Black America or a White America, but a United States of America. I said this because I had seen it in my own life in a nation that gave someone like me a chance; because I grew up in Hawaii, a melting pot of races and customs; because I made Illinois my home, a State of small towns, rich farmlands, and one of the world's great cities, a microcosm of the country where Democrats, Republicans, and Independents--good people of every ethnicity and every faith--share certain bedrock values. Over the past 6 years the pundits have pointed out more than once that my Presidency hasn't delivered on this vision. How ironic, they say, that our politics seem more divided than ever. It is held up as proof not just of my own flaws--of which there are many--but also as proof that the vision itself is misguided, naive; that there are too many people in this town who actually benefit from partisanship and gridlock for us to ever do anything about it. I know how tempting such cynicism may be, but I still think the cynics are wrong. I still believe that we are one people. I still believe that together we can do great things, even when the odds are long. I believe this because over and over, in my 6 years in office, I have seen America at its best. I have seen the hopeful faces of young graduates from New York to California and our newest officers at West Point, Annapolis, Colorado Springs, and New London. I have mourned with grieving families in Tucson and Newtown; in Boston; in West, Texas; and West Virginia. I have watched Americans beat back adversity from the gulf coast to the Great Plains, from Midwest assembly lines to the Mid-Atlantic seaboard. I have seen something like gay marriage go from a wedge issue used to drive us apart to a story of freedom across our country, a civil right now legal in States that seven in 10 Americans call home. So I know the good and optimistic and big-hearted generosity of the American people, who every day live the idea that we are our brother's keeper and our sister's keeper, and I know they expect those of us who serve here to set a better example. So the question for those of us here tonight is how we--all of us-- can better reflect America's hopes. I have served in Congress with many of you. I know many of you well. There are a lot of good people here, on both sides of the aisle. And many of you have told me that this isn't what you signed up for-- arguing past each other on cable shows, the constant fundraising, always looking over your shoulder at how the base will react to every decision. Imagine if we broke out of these tired old patterns. Imagine if we did something different. Understand--a better politics isn't one where Democrats abandon their agenda or Republicans simply embrace mine. A better politics is one where we appeal to each other's basic decency instead of our basest fears. A better politics is one where we debate without demonizing each other, where we talk issues and values and principles and facts rather than gotcha moments or trivial gaffes or fake controversies that have nothing to do with people's daily lives. A better politics is one where we spend less time drowning in dark [[Page H424]] money for ads that pull us into the gutter and spend more time lifting young people up with a sense of purpose and possibility, asking them to join in the great mission of building America. If we are going to have arguments, let's have arguments, but let's make them debates worthy of this body and worthy of this country. We still may not agree on a woman's right to choose, but surely we can agree it is a good thing that teen pregnancies and abortions are nearing all-time lows and that every woman should have access to the health care that she needs. Yes, passions still fly on immigration, but surely we can all see something of ourselves in the striving young student and agree that no one benefits when a hardworking mom is snatched from her child, and that it is possible to shape a law that upholds our tradition as a nation of laws and a nation of immigrants. I have talked to Republicans and Democrats about that. That is something that we can share. We may go at it in campaign season, but surely we can agree that the right to vote is sacred, that it is being denied to too many, and that on this 50th anniversary of the great march from Selma to Montgomery and the passage of the Voting Rights Act, we can come together, Democrats and Republicans, to make voting easier for every single American. We may have different takes on the events of Ferguson and New York, but surely we can understand a father who fears his son can't walk home without being harassed, and surely we can understand the wife who won't rest until the police officer she married walks through the front door at the end of his shift, and surely we can agree that it is a good thing that for the first time in 40 years the crime rate and the incarceration rate have come down together, and use that as a starting point for Democrats and Republicans, community leaders and law enforcement, to reform America's criminal justice system so that it protects and serves all of us. That is a better politics. That is how we start rebuilding trust. That is how we move this country forward. That is what the American people want. That is what they deserve. I have no more campaigns to run. I know, because I won both of them. My only agenda for the next 2 years is the same as the one I have had since the day I swore an oath on the steps of this Capitol--to do what I believe is best for America. If you share the broad vision I outlined tonight, I ask you to join me in the work at hand. If you disagree with parts of it, I hope you will at least work with me where you do agree. And I commit to every Republican here tonight that I will not only seek out your ideas, I will seek to work with you to make this country stronger. Because I want this Chamber, I want this city to reflect the truth-- that for all our blind spots and shortcomings, we are a people with the strength and generosity of spirit to bridge divides, to unite in common effort, and to help our neighbors, whether down the street or on the other side of the world. I want our actions to tell every child, in every neighborhood: Your life matters, and we are committed to improving your life chances, as committed as we are to working on behalf of our own kids. I want future generations to know that we are a people who see our differences as a great gift, that we are a people who value the dignity and worth of every citizen--man and woman, young and old, Black and White, Latino, Asian, immigrant, Native American, gay, straight, Americans with mental illness or physical disability. Everybody matters. I want them to grow up in a country that shows the world what we still know to be true: that we are still more than a collection of red states and blue states; that we are the United States of America. I want them to grow up in a country where a young mom can sit down and write a letter to her President with a story that sums up these past 6 years: ``It is amazing what you can bounce back from when you have to . . . we are a strong, tight-knit family who has made it through some very, very hard times.'' My fellow Americans, we, too, are a strong, tight-knit family. We, too, have made it through some hard times. Fifteen years into this new century, we have picked ourselves up, dusted ourselves off, and begun again the work of remaking America. We have laid a new foundation. A brighter future is ours to write. Let's begin this new chapter-- together--and let's start the work right now. Thank you, God bless you, and God bless this country we love.

(Applause, the Members rising.) The SPEAKER. Members of the Congress, I have the high privilege and the distinct honor of presenting to you the President of the United States. (Applause, the Members rising.) The PRESIDENT. Mr. Speaker, Mr. Vice President, Members of Congress, my fellow Americans: We are 15 years into this new century--15 years that dawned with terror touching our shores, that unfolded with a new generation fighting two long and costly wars, that saw a vicious recession spread across our Nation and the world. It has been, and still is, a hard time for many. But, tonight, we turn the page. Tonight, after a breakthrough year for America, our economy is growing and creating jobs at the fastest pace since 1999. Our unemployment rate is now lower than it was before the financial crisis. More of our kids are graduating than ever before. More of our people are insured than ever before. And we are as free from the grip of foreign oil as we have been in almost 30 years. [[Page H420]] Tonight, for the first time since 9/11, our combat mission in Afghanistan is over. Six years ago, nearly 180,000 American troops served in Iraq and Afghanistan. Today, fewer than 15,000 remain. And we salute the courage and sacrifice of every man and woman in this 9/11 generation who has served to keep us safe. We are humbled and grateful for your service. America, for all that we have endured, for all the grit and hard work required to come back, for all the tasks that lie ahead, know this: the shadow of crisis has passed, and the state of the Union is strong. At this moment, with a growing economy, shrinking deficits, bustling industry, and booming energy production, we have risen from recession freer to write our own future than any other nation on Earth. It is now up to us to choose who we want to be over the next 15 years and for decades to come. Will we accept an economy where only a few of us do spectacularly well, or will we commit ourselves to an economy that generates rising incomes and chances for everyone who makes the effort? Will we approach the world fearful and reactive, dragged into costly conflicts that strain our military and set back our standing, or will we lead wisely, using all elements of our power to defeat new threats and protect our planet? Will we allow ourselves to be sorted into factions and turned against one another, or will we recapture the sense of common purpose that has always propelled America forward? In 2 weeks, I will send this Congress a budget filled with ideas that are practical, not partisan; and in the months ahead, I will crisscross the country, making a case for those ideas. So, tonight, I want to focus less on a checklist of proposals and focus more on the values at stake in the choices before us. It begins with our economy. Seven years ago, Rebekah and Ben Erler of Minneapolis were newlyweds. She waited tables. He worked construction. Their first child, Jack, was on the way. They were young and in love in America, and it doesn't get much better than that. ``If only we had known,'' Rebekah wrote to me last spring, ``what was about to happen to the housing and construction market.'' As the crisis worsened, Ben's business dried up, so he took what jobs he could find even if they kept him on the road for long stretches of time. Rebekah took out student loans, enrolled in community college, and retrained for a new career. They sacrificed for each other, and, slowly, it paid off. They bought their first home. They had a second son, Henry. Rebekah got a better job and then a raise. Ben is back in construction and home for dinner every night. ``It is amazing,'' Rebekah wrote, ``what you can bounce back from when you have to . . . we are a strong, tight-knit family who has made it through some very, very hard times.'' We are a strong, tight-knit family who has made it through some very, very hard times. America, Rebekah and Ben's story is our story. They represent the millions who have worked hard and scrimped and sacrificed and retooled. You are the reason that I ran for this office. You are the people I was thinking of 6 years ago today, in the darkest months of the crisis, when I stood on the steps of this Capitol and promised we would rebuild our economy on a new foundation; and it has been your resilience--your effort--that has made it possible for our country to emerge stronger. We believed we could reverse the tide of outsourcing and draw new jobs to our shores, and over the past 5 years, our businesses have created more than 11 million new jobs. We believed we could reduce our dependence on foreign oil and protect our planet, and, today, America is number one in oil and gas. America is number one in wind power. Every 3 weeks, we bring online as much solar power as we did in all of 2008. And thanks to lower gas prices and higher fuel standards, the typical family this year should save about $750 at the pump. We believed we could prepare our kids for a more competitive world, and, today, our younger students have earned the highest math and reading scores on record. Our high school graduation rate has hit an all-time high, and more Americans finish college than ever before. We believed that sensible regulations could prevent another crisis, shield families from ruin, and encourage fair competition. Today, we have new tools to stop taxpayer-funded bailouts and a new consumer watchdog to protect us from predatory lending and abusive credit card practices, and in the past year alone, about 10 million uninsured Americans finally gained the security of health coverage. At every step, we were told our goals were misguided or too ambitious, that we would crush jobs and explode deficits. Instead, we have seen the fastest economic growth in over a decade, our deficits cut by two-thirds, a stock market that has doubled, and health care inflation at its lowest rate in 50 years. This is good news, people. So the verdict is clear. Middle class economics works, expanding opportunity works, and these policies will continue to work, as long as politics don't get in the way. We can't slow down businesses or put our economy at risk with government shutdowns or fiscal showdowns. We can't put the security of families at risk by taking away their health insurance or unraveling the new rules on Wall Street or refighting past battles on immigration when we have got to fix a broken system. And if a bill comes to my desk that tries to do any of these things, I will veto it. It will earn my veto. Today, thanks to a growing economy, the recovery is touching more and more lives. Wages are finally starting to rise again. We know that more small business owners plan to raise their employees' pay than at any time since 2007. But here is the thing. Those of us here tonight, we need to set our sights higher than just making sure government doesn't screw things up and halt the progress we are making. We need to do more than just do no harm. Tonight, together, let's do more to restore the link between hard work and growing opportunity for every American because families like Rebekah's still need our help. She and Ben are working as hard as ever but have to forego vacations and a new car so that they can pay off student loans and save for retirement. Friday-night pizza, that is a big splurge. Basic childcare for Jack and Henry costs more than their mortgage and almost as much as a year at the University of Minnesota. Like millions of hardworking Americans, Rebekah isn't asking for a handout, but she is asking that we look for more ways to help families get ahead. In fact, at every moment of economic change throughout our history, this country has taken bold action to adapt to new circumstances and to make sure everyone gets a fair shot. We set up worker protections, Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid to protect ourselves from the harshest adversity. We gave our citizens schools and colleges, infrastructure and the Internet--tools they needed to go as far as their efforts and their dreams will take them. That is what middle class economics is: the idea that this country does best when everyone gets their fair shot, everyone does their fair share, and everyone plays by the same set of rules. We don't just want everyone to share in America's success; we want everyone to contribute to our success. So what does middle class economics require in our time? First, middle class economics means helping working families feel more secure in a world of constant change. That means helping folks afford childcare, college, health care, a home, retirement; and my budget will address each of these issues, lowering the taxes of working families and putting thousands of dollars back into their pockets each year. Here is one example. During World War II, when men like my grandfather went off to war, having women like my grandmother in the workforce was a national security priority, so this country provided universal childcare. In today's economy, when having both parents in the workforce is an economic necessity for many families, we need affordable, high-quality childcare more than ever. It is not a nice-to-have; it is a must-have. It is time we stop treating childcare as a side issue or a women's issue and treat it like the national economic priority that it is for all of us, and that is [[Page H421]] why my plan will make quality childcare more available and more affordable for every middle class and low-income family with young children in America--by creating more slots and a new tax cut of up to $3,000 per child, per year. Here is another example. Today, we are the only advanced country on Earth that doesn't guarantee paid sick leave or paid maternity leave to our workers. Forty-three million workers have no paid sick leave. Forty-three million. Think about that. And that forces too many parents to make the gut-wrenching choice between a paycheck and a sick kid at home. So I will be taking new action to help States adopt paid leave laws of their own. And since paid sick leave won where it was on the ballot last November, let's put it to a vote right here in Washington. Send me a bill that gives every worker in America the opportunity to earn 7 days of paid sick leave. It is the right thing to do. Of course, nothing helps families make ends meet like higher wages. That is why this Congress still needs to pass a law that makes sure a woman is paid the same as a man for doing the same work. Really. It is 2015. It is time. We still need to make sure employees get the overtime they have earned. And to everyone in this Congress who still refuses to raise the minimum wage, I say this: If you truly believe you could work full time and support a family on less than $15,000 a year, try it. If not, vote to give millions of the hardest-working people in America a raise. Now, these ideas won't make everybody rich, won't relieve every hardship. That is not the job of government. To give working families a fair shot, we still need more employers to see beyond next quarter's earnings and recognize that investing in their workforce is in their company's long-term interest. We still need laws that strengthen, rather than weaken, unions and give American workers a voice. But, you know, things like child care and sick leave and equal pay, things like lower mortgage premiums and a higher minimum wage, these ideas will make a meaningful difference in the lives of millions of families. That is a fact. And that is what all of us, Republicans and Democrats alike, were sent here to do. Now, second, to make sure folks keep earning higher wages down the road, we have to do more to help Americans upgrade their skills. America thrived in the 20th century because we made high school free, sent a generation of GIs to college, trained the best workforce in the world. We were ahead of the curve. But other countries caught on, and in a 21st century economy that rewards knowledge like never before, we need to up our game. We need to do more. By the end of this decade, two in three job openings will require some higher education, two in three. And yet, we still live in a country where too many bright, striving Americans are priced out of the education they need. It is not fair to them, and it is sure not smart for our future. That is why I am sending this Congress a bold new plan to lower the cost of community college to zero. Keep in mind, 40 percent of our college students choose community college. Some are young and starting out. Some are older and looking for a better job. Some are veterans and single parents trying to transition back into the job market. Whoever you are, this plan is your chance to graduate ready for the new economy without a load of debt. Understand, you have got to earn it. You have got to keep your grades up and graduate on time. Tennessee, a State with Republican leadership, and Chicago, a city with Democratic leadership, are showing that free community college is possible. I want to spread that idea all across America, that 2 years of college becomes as free and universal in America as high school is today. Let's stay ahead of the curve. And I want to work with this Congress to make sure those already burdened with student loans can reduce their monthly payments so that student debt doesn't derail anyone's dreams. Thanks to Vice President Biden's great work to update our job training system, we are connecting community colleges with local employers to train workers to fill high-paying jobs like coding and nursing and robotics. Tonight I am also asking more businesses to follow the lead of companies like CVS and UPS and offer more educational benefits and paid apprenticeships, opportunities that give workers the chance to earn higher-paying jobs even if they don't have a higher education. And as a new generation of veterans comes home, we owe them every opportunity to live the American Dream they helped defend. Already, we have made strides towards ensuring that every veteran has access to the highest-quality care. We are slashing the backlog that had too many veterans waiting years to get the benefits they need, and we are making it easier for vets to translate their training and experience into civilian jobs. And Joining Forces, the national campaign launched by Michelle and Jill Biden--thank you, Michelle; thank you, Jill--has helped nearly 700,000 veterans and military spouses get a new job. So to every CEO in America, let me repeat: If you want somebody who is going to get the job done and done right, hire a veteran. Finally, as we better train our workers, we need the new economy to keep churning out high-wage jobs for our workers to fill. Since 2010, America has put more people back to work than Europe, Japan, and all advanced economies combined. Our manufacturers have added almost 800,000 new jobs. Some of our bedrock sectors, like our auto industry, are booming. But there are also millions of Americans who work jobs that didn't even exist 10 or 20 years ago, jobs at companies like Google and eBay and Tesla. So no one knows for certain which industries will generate the jobs of the future. But we do know we want them here in America. We know that. And that is why the third part of middle class economics is all about building the most competitive economy anywhere, the place where businesses want to locate and hire. Twenty-first century businesses need 21st century infrastructure, modern ports and stronger bridges, faster trains and the fastest Internet. Democrats and Republicans used to agree on this. So let's set our sights higher than a single oil pipeline. Let's pass a bipartisan infrastructure plan that could create more than 30 times as many jobs per year and make this country stronger for decades to come. Let's do it. Let's get it done. Let's get it done. Twenty-first century businesses, including small businesses, need to sell more American products overseas. Today, our businesses export more than ever, and exporters tend to pay their workers higher wages. But as we speak, China wants to write the rules for the world's fastest- growing region. That would put our workers and our businesses at a disadvantage. Why would we let that happen? We should write those rules. We should level the playing field. That is why I am asking both parties to give me trade promotion authority to protect American workers with strong new trade deals from Asia to Europe that aren't just free but are also fair. It is the right thing to do. Look, I am the first one to admit that past trade deals haven't always lived up to the hype, and that is why we have gone after countries that break the rules at our expense. But 95 percent of the world's customers live outside our borders. We can't close ourselves off from those opportunities. More than half of manufacturing executives have said they are actively looking to bring jobs back from China. Let's give them one more reason to get it done. Twenty-first century businesses will rely on American science and technology, research and development. I want the country that eliminated polio and mapped the human genome to lead a new era of medicine, one that delivers the right treatment at the right time. In some patients with cystic fibrosis, this approach has reversed a disease once thought unstoppable. So tonight, I am launching a new Precision Medicine Initiative to bring us closer to curing diseases like cancer and diabetes, and to give all of us access to the personalized information we need to keep ourselves and our families healthier. We can do this. I intend to protect a free and open Internet, extend its reach to every [[Page H422]] classroom and every community, and help folks build the fastest networks so that the next generation of digital innovators and entrepreneurs have the platform to keep reshaping our world. I want Americans to win the race for the kinds of discoveries that unleash new jobs: converting sunlight into liquid fuel; creating revolutionary prosthetics so that a veteran who gave his arms for his country can play catch with his kids again; pushing out into the solar system not just to visit, but to stay. Now, last month, we launched a new spacecraft as part of a reenergized space program that will send American astronauts to Mars; and in 2 months, to prepare us for those missions, Scott Kelly will begin a year-long stay in space. So good luck, Captain. Make sure to Instagram it. We are proud of you. Now, the truth is, when it comes to issues like infrastructure and basic research, I know there is bipartisan support in this Chamber. Members of both parties have told me so. Where we too often run onto the rocks is how to pay for these investments. As Americans, we don't mind paying our fair share of taxes as long as everybody else does too. But for far too long, lobbyists have rigged the Tax Code with loopholes that let some corporations pay nothing while others pay full freight. They have riddled it with giveaways that the superrich don't need while denying a break to middle class families who do. This year, we have an opportunity to change that. Let's close loopholes so we stop rewarding companies that keep profits abroad and reward those that invest here in America. Let's use those savings to rebuild our infrastructure and to make it more attractive for companies to bring jobs home. Let's simplify the system and let a small business owner file based on her actual bank statement instead of the number of accountants she can afford. And let's close the loopholes that lead to inequality, by allowing the top 1 percent to avoid paying taxes on their accumulated wealth. We can use that money to help more families pay for child care and send their kids to college. We need a Tax Code that truly helps working Americans try to get a leg up in the new economy. And we can achieve that together. We can achieve it together. Helping hardworking families make ends meet, giving them the tools they need for good-paying jobs in this new economy, and maintaining the conditions of growth and competitiveness, this is where America needs to go. I believe it is where the American people want to go. It will make our economy stronger a year from now, 15 years from now, and deep into the century ahead. Of course, if there is one thing this new century has taught us, it is that we cannot separate our work here at home from challenges beyond our shores. My first duty as Commander in Chief is to defend the United States of America. In doing so, the question is not whether America leads in the world, but how. When we make rash decisions--reacting to the headlines instead of using our heads--when the first response to a challenge is to send in our military, then we risk getting drawn into unnecessary conflicts and neglect the broader strategy we need for a safer, more prosperous world. That is what our enemies want us to do. I believe in a smarter kind of American leadership. We lead best when we combine military power with strong diplomacy, when we leverage our power with coalition building, when we don't let our fears blind us to the opportunities that this new century presents. That is exactly what we are doing right now, and around the globe, it is making a difference. First, we stand united with people around the world who have been targeted by terrorists, from a school in Pakistan to the streets of Paris. We will continue to hunt down terrorists and dismantle their networks; and we reserve the right to act unilaterally, as we have done relentlessly since I took office, to take out terrorists who pose a direct threat to us and our allies. At the same time, we have learned some costly lessons over the last 13 years. Instead of Americans patrolling the valleys of Afghanistan, we have trained their security forces, who have now taken the lead; and we have honored our troops' sacrifice by supporting that country's first democratic transition. Instead of sending large ground forces overseas, we are partnering with nations from south Asia to north Africa to deny safe haven to terrorists who threaten America. In Iraq and Syria, American leadership, including our military power, is stopping ISIL's advance. Instead of getting dragged into another ground war in the Middle East, we are leading a broad coalition, including Arab nations, to degrade and ultimately destroy this terrorist group. We are also supporting a moderate opposition in Syria that can help us in this effort and are assisting people everywhere who stand up to the bankrupt ideology of violent extremism. Now, this effort will take time. It will require focus. But we will succeed. And tonight, I call on this Congress to show the world that we are united in this mission by passing a resolution to authorize the use of force against ISIL. We need that authority. Second, we are demonstrating the power of American strength and diplomacy. We are upholding the principle that bigger nations can't bully the small, by opposing Russian aggression and supporting Ukraine's democracy and reassuring our NATO allies. Last year, as we were doing the hard work of imposing sanctions, along with our allies, as we were reinforcing our presence with the frontline States, Mr. Putin's aggression, it was suggested, was a masterful display of strategy and strength. That is what I heard from some folks. Well, today it is America that stands strong and united with our allies, while Russia is isolated with its economy in tatters. That is how America leads--not with bluster but with persistent, steady resolve. In Cuba, we are ending a policy that was long past its expiration date. When what you are doing doesn't work for 50 years, it is time to try something new. Our shift in Cuba policy has the potential to end a legacy of mistrust in our hemisphere. It removes a phony excuse for restrictions in Cuba, stands up for democratic values, and extends the hand of friendship to the Cuban people. And this year, Congress should begin the work of ending the embargo. As His Holiness, Pope Francis, has said, diplomacy is the work of ``small steps.'' These small steps have added up to new hope for the future in Cuba. And after years in prison, we are overjoyed that Alan Gross is back home where he belongs. Welcome home, Alan. We are glad you are here. Our diplomacy is at work with respect to Iran where, for the first time in a decade, we have halted the progress of its nuclear program and reduced its stockpile of nuclear material. Between now and this spring, we have a chance to negotiate a comprehensive agreement that prevents a nuclear-armed Iran, secures America and our allies-- including Israel--while avoiding yet another Middle East conflict There are no guarantees that negotiations will succeed, and I keep all options on the table to prevent a nuclear Iran. But new sanctions passed by this Congress at this moment in time will all but guarantee that diplomacy fails--alienating America from its allies, making it harder to maintain sanctions, and ensuring that Iran starts up its nuclear program again. It doesn't make sense, and that is why I will veto any new sanctions bill that threatens to undo this progress. The American people expect us to only go to war as a last resort, and I intend to stay true to that wisdom. Third, we are looking beyond the issues that have consumed us in the past to shape the coming century. No foreign nation and no hacker should be able to shut down our networks, steal our trade secrets, or invade the privacy of American families, especially our kids. So we are making sure our government integrates intelligence to combat cyber threats, just as we have done to combat terrorism. Tonight, I urge this Congress to finally pass the legislation we need to better meet the evolving threat of cyber attacks, combat identity theft, and protect our children's information. That should be a bipartisan effort. If we don't act, we will leave our Nation and our economy vulnerable. If we [[Page H423]] do, we can continue to protect the technologies that have unleashed untold opportunities for people around the globe. In west Africa, our troops, our scientists, our doctors, our nurses, and our health care workers are rolling back Ebola, saving countless lives and stopping the spread of disease. I could not be prouder of them, and I thank this Congress for your bipartisan support of their efforts. But the job is not yet done, and the world needs to use this lesson to build a more effective global effort to prevent the spread of future pandemics, invest in smart development, and eradicate extreme poverty. In the Asia Pacific, we are modernizing alliances while making sure that other nations play by the rules in how they trade, how they resolve maritime disputes, and how they participate in meeting common international challenges like nonproliferation and disaster relief; and no challenge poses a greater threat to future generations than climate change. 2014 was the planet's warmest year on record. Now, 1 year doesn't make a trend, but this does: 14 of the 15 warmest years on record have all fallen in the first 15 years of this century. I have heard some folks try to dodge the evidence by saying they are not scientists and that we don't have enough information to act. Well, I am not a scientist either, but you know what, I know a lot of really good scientists at NASA, at NOAA, and at our major universities. The best scientists in the world are all telling us that our activities are changing the climate, and if we don't act forcefully, we will continue to see rising oceans; longer, hotter heat waves; dangerous droughts and floods; and massive disruptions that can trigger greater migration, conflict, and hunger around the globe. The Pentagon says that climate change poses immediate risks to our national security. We should act like it. That is why, over the past 6 years, we have done more than ever to combat climate change, from the way we produce energy to the way we use it; that is why we have set aside more public lands and waters than any administration in history; and that is why I will not let this Congress endanger the health of our children by turning back the clock on our efforts. I am determined to make sure that American leadership drives international action. In Beijing, we made an historic announcement. The United States will double the pace at which we cut carbon pollution, and China committed for the first time to limiting their emissions. Because the world's two largest economies came together, other nations are now stepping up and offering hope that, this year, the world will finally reach an agreement to protect the one planet we have got. There is one last pillar of our leadership, and that is the example of our values. As Americans, we respect human dignity even when we are threatened, which is why I have prohibited torture and worked to make sure our use of new technology, like drones, is properly constrained. It is why we speak out against the deplorable anti-Semitism that has resurfaced in certain parts of the world. It is why we continue to reject offensive stereotypes of Muslims, the vast majority of whom share our commitment to peace. That is why we defend free speech; advocate for political prisoners; and condemn the persecution of women or religious minorities or people who are lesbian, gay, bisexual, or transgender. We do these things not only because they are the right thing to do, but because, ultimately, they will make us safer. As Americans, we have a profound commitment to justice, so it makes no sense to spend $3 million per prisoner to keep open a prison that the world condemns and terrorists use to recruit. Since I have been President, we have worked responsibly to cut the population of GTMO in half. Now, it is time to finish the job, and I will not relent in my determination to shut it down. It is not who we are. It is time to close GTMO. As Americans, we cherish our civil liberties, and we need to uphold that commitment if we want maximum cooperation from other countries and industry in our fight against terrorist networks. So while some have moved on from the debates over our surveillance programs, I have not. As promised, our intelligence agencies have worked hard with the recommendations of privacy advocates to increase transparency and build more safeguards against potential abuse. Next month, we will issue a report on how we are keeping our promise to keep our country safe while strengthening privacy. Looking to the future instead of the past, making sure we match our power with diplomacy and use force wisely, building coalitions to meet new challenges and opportunities, and leading always with the example of our values, that is what makes us exceptional. That is what keeps us strong. That is why we have to keep striving to hold ourselves to the highest of standards: our own. Just over a decade ago, I gave a speech in Boston where I said that there wasn't a liberal America or a conservative America, or a Black America or a White America, but a United States of America. I said this because I had seen it in my own life in a nation that gave someone like me a chance; because I grew up in Hawaii, a melting pot of races and customs; because I made Illinois my home, a State of small towns, rich farmlands, and one of the world's great cities, a microcosm of the country where Democrats, Republicans, and Independents--good people of every ethnicity and every faith--share certain bedrock values. Over the past 6 years the pundits have pointed out more than once that my Presidency hasn't delivered on this vision. How ironic, they say, that our politics seem more divided than ever. It is held up as proof not just of my own flaws--of which there are many--but also as proof that the vision itself is misguided, naive; that there are too many people in this town who actually benefit from partisanship and gridlock for us to ever do anything about it. I know how tempting such cynicism may be, but I still think the cynics are wrong. I still believe that we are one people. I still believe that together we can do great things, even when the odds are long. I believe this because over and over, in my 6 years in office, I have seen America at its best. I have seen the hopeful faces of young graduates from New York to California and our newest officers at West Point, Annapolis, Colorado Springs, and New London. I have mourned with grieving families in Tucson and Newtown; in Boston; in West, Texas; and West Virginia. I have watched Americans beat back adversity from the gulf coast to the Great Plains, from Midwest assembly lines to the Mid-Atlantic seaboard. I have seen something like gay marriage go from a wedge issue used to drive us apart to a story of freedom across our country, a civil right now legal in States that seven in 10 Americans call home. So I know the good and optimistic and big-hearted generosity of the American people, who every day live the idea that we are our brother's keeper and our sister's keeper, and I know they expect those of us who serve here to set a better example. So the question for those of us here tonight is how we--all of us-- can better reflect America's hopes. I have served in Congress with many of you. I know many of you well. There are a lot of good people here, on both sides of the aisle. And many of you have told me that this isn't what you signed up for-- arguing past each other on cable shows, the constant fundraising, always looking over your shoulder at how the base will react to every decision. Imagine if we broke out of these tired old patterns. Imagine if we did something different. Understand--a better politics isn't one where Democrats abandon their agenda or Republicans simply embrace mine. A better politics is one where we appeal to each other's basic decency instead of our basest fears. A better politics is one where we debate without demonizing each other, where we talk issues and values and principles and facts rather than gotcha moments or trivial gaffes or fake controversies that have nothing to do with people's daily lives. A better politics is one where we spend less time drowning in dark [[Page H424]] money for ads that pull us into the gutter and spend more time lifting young people up with a sense of purpose and possibility, asking them to join in the great mission of building America. If we are going to have arguments, let's have arguments, but let's make them debates worthy of this body and worthy of this country. We still may not agree on a woman's right to choose, but surely we can agree it is a good thing that teen pregnancies and abortions are nearing all-time lows and that every woman should have access to the health care that she needs. Yes, passions still fly on immigration, but surely we can all see something of ourselves in the striving young student and agree that no one benefits when a hardworking mom is snatched from her child, and that it is possible to shape a law that upholds our tradition as a nation of laws and a nation of immigrants. I have talked to Republicans and Democrats about that. That is something that we can share. We may go at it in campaign season, but surely we can agree that the right to vote is sacred, that it is being denied to too many, and that on this 50th anniversary of the great march from Selma to Montgomery and the passage of the Voting Rights Act, we can come together, Democrats and Republicans, to make voting easier for every single American. We may have different takes on the events of Ferguson and New York, but surely we can understand a father who fears his son can't walk home without being harassed, and surely we can understand the wife who won't rest until the police officer she married walks through the front door at the end of his shift, and surely we can agree that it is a good thing that for the first time in 40 years the crime rate and the incarceration rate have come down together, and use that as a starting point for Democrats and Republicans, community leaders and law enforcement, to reform America's criminal justice system so that it protects and serves all of us. That is a better politics. That is how we start rebuilding trust. That is how we move this country forward. That is what the American people want. That is what they deserve. I have no more campaigns to run. I know, because I won both of them. My only agenda for the next 2 years is the same as the one I have had since the day I swore an oath on the steps of this Capitol--to do what I believe is best for America. If you share the broad vision I outlined tonight, I ask you to join me in the work at hand. If you disagree with parts of it, I hope you will at least work with me where you do agree. And I commit to every Republican here tonight that I will not only seek out your ideas, I will seek to work with you to make this country stronger. Because I want this Chamber, I want this city to reflect the truth-- that for all our blind spots and shortcomings, we are a people with the strength and generosity of spirit to bridge divides, to unite in common effort, and to help our neighbors, whether down the street or on the other side of the world. I want our actions to tell every child, in every neighborhood: Your life matters, and we are committed to improving your life chances, as committed as we are to working on behalf of our own kids. I want future generations to know that we are a people who see our differences as a great gift, that we are a people who value the dignity and worth of every citizen--man and woman, young and old, Black and White, Latino, Asian, immigrant, Native American, gay, straight, Americans with mental illness or physical disability. Everybody matters. I want them to grow up in a country that shows the world what we still know to be true: that we are still more than a collection of red states and blue states; that we are the United States of America. I want them to grow up in a country where a young mom can sit down and write a letter to her President with a story that sums up these past 6 years: ``It is amazing what you can bounce back from when you have to . . . we are a strong, tight-knit family who has made it through some very, very hard times.'' My fellow Americans, we, too, are a strong, tight-knit family. We, too, have made it through some hard times. Fifteen years into this new century, we have picked ourselves up, dusted ourselves off, and begun again the work of remaking America. We have laid a new foundation. A brighter future is ours to write. Let's begin this new chapter-- together--and let's start the work right now. Thank you, God bless you, and God bless this country we love.

(Applause, the Members rising.) The SPEAKER. Members of the Congress, I have the high privilege and the distinct honor of presenting to you the President of the United States. (Applause, the Members rising.) The PRESIDENT. Mr. Speaker, Mr. Vice President, Members of Congress, my fellow Americans: We are 15 years into this new century--15 years that dawned with terror touching our shores, that unfolded with a new generation fighting two long and costly wars, that saw a vicious recession spread across our Nation and the world. It has been, and still is, a hard time for many. But, tonight, we turn the page. Tonight, after a breakthrough year for America, our economy is growing and creating jobs at the fastest pace since 1999. Our unemployment rate is now lower than it was before the financial crisis. More of our kids are graduating than ever before. More of our people are insured than ever before. And we are as free from the grip of foreign oil as we have been in almost 30 years. [[Page H420]] Tonight, for the first time since 9/11, our combat mission in Afghanistan is over. Six years ago, nearly 180,000 American troops served in Iraq and Afghanistan. Today, fewer than 15,000 remain. And we salute the courage and sacrifice of every man and woman in this 9/11 generation who has served to keep us safe. We are humbled and grateful for your service. America, for all that we have endured, for all the grit and hard work required to come back, for all the tasks that lie ahead, know this: the shadow of crisis has passed, and the state of the Union is strong. At this moment, with a growing economy, shrinking deficits, bustling industry, and booming energy production, we have risen from recession freer to write our own future than any other nation on Earth. It is now up to us to choose who we want to be over the next 15 years and for decades to come. Will we accept an economy where only a few of us do spectacularly well, or will we commit ourselves to an economy that generates rising incomes and chances for everyone who makes the effort? Will we approach the world fearful and reactive, dragged into costly conflicts that strain our military and set back our standing, or will we lead wisely, using all elements of our power to defeat new threats and protect our planet? Will we allow ourselves to be sorted into factions and turned against one another, or will we recapture the sense of common purpose that has always propelled America forward? In 2 weeks, I will send this Congress a budget filled with ideas that are practical, not partisan; and in the months ahead, I will crisscross the country, making a case for those ideas. So, tonight, I want to focus less on a checklist of proposals and focus more on the values at stake in the choices before us. It begins with our economy. Seven years ago, Rebekah and Ben Erler of Minneapolis were newlyweds. She waited tables. He worked construction. Their first child, Jack, was on the way. They were young and in love in America, and it doesn't get much better than that. ``If only we had known,'' Rebekah wrote to me last spring, ``what was about to happen to the housing and construction market.'' As the crisis worsened, Ben's business dried up, so he took what jobs he could find even if they kept him on the road for long stretches of time. Rebekah took out student loans, enrolled in community college, and retrained for a new career. They sacrificed for each other, and, slowly, it paid off. They bought their first home. They had a second son, Henry. Rebekah got a better job and then a raise. Ben is back in construction and home for dinner every night. ``It is amazing,'' Rebekah wrote, ``what you can bounce back from when you have to . . . we are a strong, tight-knit family who has made it through some very, very hard times.'' We are a strong, tight-knit family who has made it through some very, very hard times. America, Rebekah and Ben's story is our story. They represent the millions who have worked hard and scrimped and sacrificed and retooled. You are the reason that I ran for this office. You are the people I was thinking of 6 years ago today, in the darkest months of the crisis, when I stood on the steps of this Capitol and promised we would rebuild our economy on a new foundation; and it has been your resilience--your effort--that has made it possible for our country to emerge stronger. We believed we could reverse the tide of outsourcing and draw new jobs to our shores, and over the past 5 years, our businesses have created more than 11 million new jobs. We believed we could reduce our dependence on foreign oil and protect our planet, and, today, America is number one in oil and gas. America is number one in wind power. Every 3 weeks, we bring online as much solar power as we did in all of 2008. And thanks to lower gas prices and higher fuel standards, the typical family this year should save about $750 at the pump. We believed we could prepare our kids for a more competitive world, and, today, our younger students have earned the highest math and reading scores on record. Our high school graduation rate has hit an all-time high, and more Americans finish college than ever before. We believed that sensible regulations could prevent another crisis, shield families from ruin, and encourage fair competition. Today, we have new tools to stop taxpayer-funded bailouts and a new consumer watchdog to protect us from predatory lending and abusive credit card practices, and in the past year alone, about 10 million uninsured Americans finally gained the security of health coverage. At every step, we were told our goals were misguided or too ambitious, that we would crush jobs and explode deficits. Instead, we have seen the fastest economic growth in over a decade, our deficits cut by two-thirds, a stock market that has doubled, and health care inflation at its lowest rate in 50 years. This is good news, people. So the verdict is clear. Middle class economics works, expanding opportunity works, and these policies will continue to work, as long as politics don't get in the way. We can't slow down businesses or put our economy at risk with government shutdowns or fiscal showdowns. We can't put the security of families at risk by taking away their health insurance or unraveling the new rules on Wall Street or refighting past battles on immigration when we have got to fix a broken system. And if a bill comes to my desk that tries to do any of these things, I will veto it. It will earn my veto. Today, thanks to a growing economy, the recovery is touching more and more lives. Wages are finally starting to rise again. We know that more small business owners plan to raise their employees' pay than at any time since 2007. But here is the thing. Those of us here tonight, we need to set our sights higher than just making sure government doesn't screw things up and halt the progress we are making. We need to do more than just do no harm. Tonight, together, let's do more to restore the link between hard work and growing opportunity for every American because families like Rebekah's still need our help. She and Ben are working as hard as ever but have to forego vacations and a new car so that they can pay off student loans and save for retirement. Friday-night pizza, that is a big splurge. Basic childcare for Jack and Henry costs more than their mortgage and almost as much as a year at the University of Minnesota. Like millions of hardworking Americans, Rebekah isn't asking for a handout, but she is asking that we look for more ways to help families get ahead. In fact, at every moment of economic change throughout our history, this country has taken bold action to adapt to new circumstances and to make sure everyone gets a fair shot. We set up worker protections, Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid to protect ourselves from the harshest adversity. We gave our citizens schools and colleges, infrastructure and the Internet--tools they needed to go as far as their efforts and their dreams will take them. That is what middle class economics is: the idea that this country does best when everyone gets their fair shot, everyone does their fair share, and everyone plays by the same set of rules. We don't just want everyone to share in America's success; we want everyone to contribute to our success. So what does middle class economics require in our time? First, middle class economics means helping working families feel more secure in a world of constant change. That means helping folks afford childcare, college, health care, a home, retirement; and my budget will address each of these issues, lowering the taxes of working families and putting thousands of dollars back into their pockets each year. Here is one example. During World War II, when men like my grandfather went off to war, having women like my grandmother in the workforce was a national security priority, so this country provided universal childcare. In today's economy, when having both parents in the workforce is an economic necessity for many families, we need affordable, high-quality childcare more than ever. It is not a nice-to-have; it is a must-have. It is time we stop treating childcare as a side issue or a women's issue and treat it like the national economic priority that it is for all of us, and that is [[Page H421]] why my plan will make quality childcare more available and more affordable for every middle class and low-income family with young children in America--by creating more slots and a new tax cut of up to $3,000 per child, per year. Here is another example. Today, we are the only advanced country on Earth that doesn't guarantee paid sick leave or paid maternity leave to our workers. Forty-three million workers have no paid sick leave. Forty-three million. Think about that. And that forces too many parents to make the gut-wrenching choice between a paycheck and a sick kid at home. So I will be taking new action to help States adopt paid leave laws of their own. And since paid sick leave won where it was on the ballot last November, let's put it to a vote right here in Washington. Send me a bill that gives every worker in America the opportunity to earn 7 days of paid sick leave. It is the right thing to do. Of course, nothing helps families make ends meet like higher wages. That is why this Congress still needs to pass a law that makes sure a woman is paid the same as a man for doing the same work. Really. It is 2015. It is time. We still need to make sure employees get the overtime they have earned. And to everyone in this Congress who still refuses to raise the minimum wage, I say this: If you truly believe you could work full time and support a family on less than $15,000 a year, try it. If not, vote to give millions of the hardest-working people in America a raise. Now, these ideas won't make everybody rich, won't relieve every hardship. That is not the job of government. To give working families a fair shot, we still need more employers to see beyond next quarter's earnings and recognize that investing in their workforce is in their company's long-term interest. We still need laws that strengthen, rather than weaken, unions and give American workers a voice. But, you know, things like child care and sick leave and equal pay, things like lower mortgage premiums and a higher minimum wage, these ideas will make a meaningful difference in the lives of millions of families. That is a fact. And that is what all of us, Republicans and Democrats alike, were sent here to do. Now, second, to make sure folks keep earning higher wages down the road, we have to do more to help Americans upgrade their skills. America thrived in the 20th century because we made high school free, sent a generation of GIs to college, trained the best workforce in the world. We were ahead of the curve. But other countries caught on, and in a 21st century economy that rewards knowledge like never before, we need to up our game. We need to do more. By the end of this decade, two in three job openings will require some higher education, two in three. And yet, we still live in a country where too many bright, striving Americans are priced out of the education they need. It is not fair to them, and it is sure not smart for our future. That is why I am sending this Congress a bold new plan to lower the cost of community college to zero. Keep in mind, 40 percent of our college students choose community college. Some are young and starting out. Some are older and looking for a better job. Some are veterans and single parents trying to transition back into the job market. Whoever you are, this plan is your chance to graduate ready for the new economy without a load of debt. Understand, you have got to earn it. You have got to keep your grades up and graduate on time. Tennessee, a State with Republican leadership, and Chicago, a city with Democratic leadership, are showing that free community college is possible. I want to spread that idea all across America, that 2 years of college becomes as free and universal in America as high school is today. Let's stay ahead of the curve. And I want to work with this Congress to make sure those already burdened with student loans can reduce their monthly payments so that student debt doesn't derail anyone's dreams. Thanks to Vice President Biden's great work to update our job training system, we are connecting community colleges with local employers to train workers to fill high-paying jobs like coding and nursing and robotics. Tonight I am also asking more businesses to follow the lead of companies like CVS and UPS and offer more educational benefits and paid apprenticeships, opportunities that give workers the chance to earn higher-paying jobs even if they don't have a higher education. And as a new generation of veterans comes home, we owe them every opportunity to live the American Dream they helped defend. Already, we have made strides towards ensuring that every veteran has access to the highest-quality care. We are slashing the backlog that had too many veterans waiting years to get the benefits they need, and we are making it easier for vets to translate their training and experience into civilian jobs. And Joining Forces, the national campaign launched by Michelle and Jill Biden--thank you, Michelle; thank you, Jill--has helped nearly 700,000 veterans and military spouses get a new job. So to every CEO in America, let me repeat: If you want somebody who is going to get the job done and done right, hire a veteran. Finally, as we better train our workers, we need the new economy to keep churning out high-wage jobs for our workers to fill. Since 2010, America has put more people back to work than Europe, Japan, and all advanced economies combined. Our manufacturers have added almost 800,000 new jobs. Some of our bedrock sectors, like our auto industry, are booming. But there are also millions of Americans who work jobs that didn't even exist 10 or 20 years ago, jobs at companies like Google and eBay and Tesla. So no one knows for certain which industries will generate the jobs of the future. But we do know we want them here in America. We know that. And that is why the third part of middle class economics is all about building the most competitive economy anywhere, the place where businesses want to locate and hire. Twenty-first century businesses need 21st century infrastructure, modern ports and stronger bridges, faster trains and the fastest Internet. Democrats and Republicans used to agree on this. So let's set our sights higher than a single oil pipeline. Let's pass a bipartisan infrastructure plan that could create more than 30 times as many jobs per year and make this country stronger for decades to come. Let's do it. Let's get it done. Let's get it done. Twenty-first century businesses, including small businesses, need to sell more American products overseas. Today, our businesses export more than ever, and exporters tend to pay their workers higher wages. But as we speak, China wants to write the rules for the world's fastest- growing region. That would put our workers and our businesses at a disadvantage. Why would we let that happen? We should write those rules. We should level the playing field. That is why I am asking both parties to give me trade promotion authority to protect American workers with strong new trade deals from Asia to Europe that aren't just free but are also fair. It is the right thing to do. Look, I am the first one to admit that past trade deals haven't always lived up to the hype, and that is why we have gone after countries that break the rules at our expense. But 95 percent of the world's customers live outside our borders. We can't close ourselves off from those opportunities. More than half of manufacturing executives have said they are actively looking to bring jobs back from China. Let's give them one more reason to get it done. Twenty-first century businesses will rely on American science and technology, research and development. I want the country that eliminated polio and mapped the human genome to lead a new era of medicine, one that delivers the right treatment at the right time. In some patients with cystic fibrosis, this approach has reversed a disease once thought unstoppable. So tonight, I am launching a new Precision Medicine Initiative to bring us closer to curing diseases like cancer and diabetes, and to give all of us access to the personalized information we need to keep ourselves and our families healthier. We can do this. I intend to protect a free and open Internet, extend its reach to every [[Page H422]] classroom and every community, and help folks build the fastest networks so that the next generation of digital innovators and entrepreneurs have the platform to keep reshaping our world. I want Americans to win the race for the kinds of discoveries that unleash new jobs: converting sunlight into liquid fuel; creating revolutionary prosthetics so that a veteran who gave his arms for his country can play catch with his kids again; pushing out into the solar system not just to visit, but to stay. Now, last month, we launched a new spacecraft as part of a reenergized space program that will send American astronauts to Mars; and in 2 months, to prepare us for those missions, Scott Kelly will begin a year-long stay in space. So good luck, Captain. Make sure to Instagram it. We are proud of you. Now, the truth is, when it comes to issues like infrastructure and basic research, I know there is bipartisan support in this Chamber. Members of both parties have told me so. Where we too often run onto the rocks is how to pay for these investments. As Americans, we don't mind paying our fair share of taxes as long as everybody else does too. But for far too long, lobbyists have rigged the Tax Code with loopholes that let some corporations pay nothing while others pay full freight. They have riddled it with giveaways that the superrich don't need while denying a break to middle class families who do. This year, we have an opportunity to change that. Let's close loopholes so we stop rewarding companies that keep profits abroad and reward those that invest here in America. Let's use those savings to rebuild our infrastructure and to make it more attractive for companies to bring jobs home. Let's simplify the system and let a small business owner file based on her actual bank statement instead of the number of accountants she can afford. And let's close the loopholes that lead to inequality, by allowing the top 1 percent to avoid paying taxes on their accumulated wealth. We can use that money to help more families pay for child care and send their kids to college. We need a Tax Code that truly helps working Americans try to get a leg up in the new economy. And we can achieve that together. We can achieve it together. Helping hardworking families make ends meet, giving them the tools they need for good-paying jobs in this new economy, and maintaining the conditions of growth and competitiveness, this is where America needs to go. I believe it is where the American people want to go. It will make our economy stronger a year from now, 15 years from now, and deep into the century ahead. Of course, if there is one thing this new century has taught us, it is that we cannot separate our work here at home from challenges beyond our shores. My first duty as Commander in Chief is to defend the United States of America. In doing so, the question is not whether America leads in the world, but how. When we make rash decisions--reacting to the headlines instead of using our heads--when the first response to a challenge is to send in our military, then we risk getting drawn into unnecessary conflicts and neglect the broader strategy we need for a safer, more prosperous world. That is what our enemies want us to do. I believe in a smarter kind of American leadership. We lead best when we combine military power with strong diplomacy, when we leverage our power with coalition building, when we don't let our fears blind us to the opportunities that this new century presents. That is exactly what we are doing right now, and around the globe, it is making a difference. First, we stand united with people around the world who have been targeted by terrorists, from a school in Pakistan to the streets of Paris. We will continue to hunt down terrorists and dismantle their networks; and we reserve the right to act unilaterally, as we have done relentlessly since I took office, to take out terrorists who pose a direct threat to us and our allies. At the same time, we have learned some costly lessons over the last 13 years. Instead of Americans patrolling the valleys of Afghanistan, we have trained their security forces, who have now taken the lead; and we have honored our troops' sacrifice by supporting that country's first democratic transition. Instead of sending large ground forces overseas, we are partnering with nations from south Asia to north Africa to deny safe haven to terrorists who threaten America. In Iraq and Syria, American leadership, including our military power, is stopping ISIL's advance. Instead of getting dragged into another ground war in the Middle East, we are leading a broad coalition, including Arab nations, to degrade and ultimately destroy this terrorist group. We are also supporting a moderate opposition in Syria that can help us in this effort and are assisting people everywhere who stand up to the bankrupt ideology of violent extremism. Now, this effort will take time. It will require focus. But we will succeed. And tonight, I call on this Congress to show the world that we are united in this mission by passing a resolution to authorize the use of force against ISIL. We need that authority. Second, we are demonstrating the power of American strength and diplomacy. We are upholding the principle that bigger nations can't bully the small, by opposing Russian aggression and supporting Ukraine's democracy and reassuring our NATO allies. Last year, as we were doing the hard work of imposing sanctions, along with our allies, as we were reinforcing our presence with the frontline States, Mr. Putin's aggression, it was suggested, was a masterful display of strategy and strength. That is what I heard from some folks. Well, today it is America that stands strong and united with our allies, while Russia is isolated with its economy in tatters. That is how America leads--not with bluster but with persistent, steady resolve. In Cuba, we are ending a policy that was long past its expiration date. When what you are doing doesn't work for 50 years, it is time to try something new. Our shift in Cuba policy has the potential to end a legacy of mistrust in our hemisphere. It removes a phony excuse for restrictions in Cuba, stands up for democratic values, and extends the hand of friendship to the Cuban people. And this year, Congress should begin the work of ending the embargo. As His Holiness, Pope Francis, has said, diplomacy is the work of ``small steps.'' These small steps have added up to new hope for the future in Cuba. And after years in prison, we are overjoyed that Alan Gross is back home where he belongs. Welcome home, Alan. We are glad you are here. Our diplomacy is at work with respect to Iran where, for the first time in a decade, we have halted the progress of its nuclear program and reduced its stockpile of nuclear material. Between now and this spring, we have a chance to negotiate a comprehensive agreement that prevents a nuclear-armed Iran, secures America and our allies-- including Israel--while avoiding yet another Middle East conflict There are no guarantees that negotiations will succeed, and I keep all options on the table to prevent a nuclear Iran. But new sanctions passed by this Congress at this moment in time will all but guarantee that diplomacy fails--alienating America from its allies, making it harder to maintain sanctions, and ensuring that Iran starts up its nuclear program again. It doesn't make sense, and that is why I will veto any new sanctions bill that threatens to undo this progress. The American people expect us to only go to war as a last resort, and I intend to stay true to that wisdom. Third, we are looking beyond the issues that have consumed us in the past to shape the coming century. No foreign nation and no hacker should be able to shut down our networks, steal our trade secrets, or invade the privacy of American families, especially our kids. So we are making sure our government integrates intelligence to combat cyber threats, just as we have done to combat terrorism. Tonight, I urge this Congress to finally pass the legislation we need to better meet the evolving threat of cyber attacks, combat identity theft, and protect our children's information. That should be a bipartisan effort. If we don't act, we will leave our Nation and our economy vulnerable. If we [[Page H423]] do, we can continue to protect the technologies that have unleashed untold opportunities for people around the globe. In west Africa, our troops, our scientists, our doctors, our nurses, and our health care workers are rolling back Ebola, saving countless lives and stopping the spread of disease. I could not be prouder of them, and I thank this Congress for your bipartisan support of their efforts. But the job is not yet done, and the world needs to use this lesson to build a more effective global effort to prevent the spread of future pandemics, invest in smart development, and eradicate extreme poverty. In the Asia Pacific, we are modernizing alliances while making sure that other nations play by the rules in how they trade, how they resolve maritime disputes, and how they participate in meeting common international challenges like nonproliferation and disaster relief; and no challenge poses a greater threat to future generations than climate change. 2014 was the planet's warmest year on record. Now, 1 year doesn't make a trend, but this does: 14 of the 15 warmest years on record have all fallen in the first 15 years of this century. I have heard some folks try to dodge the evidence by saying they are not scientists and that we don't have enough information to act. Well, I am not a scientist either, but you know what, I know a lot of really good scientists at NASA, at NOAA, and at our major universities. The best scientists in the world are all telling us that our activities are changing the climate, and if we don't act forcefully, we will continue to see rising oceans; longer, hotter heat waves; dangerous droughts and floods; and massive disruptions that can trigger greater migration, conflict, and hunger around the globe. The Pentagon says that climate change poses immediate risks to our national security. We should act like it. That is why, over the past 6 years, we have done more than ever to combat climate change, from the way we produce energy to the way we use it; that is why we have set aside more public lands and waters than any administration in history; and that is why I will not let this Congress endanger the health of our children by turning back the clock on our efforts. I am determined to make sure that American leadership drives international action. In Beijing, we made an historic announcement. The United States will double the pace at which we cut carbon pollution, and China committed for the first time to limiting their emissions. Because the world's two largest economies came together, other nations are now stepping up and offering hope that, this year, the world will finally reach an agreement to protect the one planet we have got. There is one last pillar of our leadership, and that is the example of our values. As Americans, we respect human dignity even when we are threatened, which is why I have prohibited torture and worked to make sure our use of new technology, like drones, is properly constrained. It is why we speak out against the deplorable anti-Semitism that has resurfaced in certain parts of the world. It is why we continue to reject offensive stereotypes of Muslims, the vast majority of whom share our commitment to peace. That is why we defend free speech; advocate for political prisoners; and condemn the persecution of women or religious minorities or people who are lesbian, gay, bisexual, or transgender. We do these things not only because they are the right thing to do, but because, ultimately, they will make us safer. As Americans, we have a profound commitment to justice, so it makes no sense to spend $3 million per prisoner to keep open a prison that the world condemns and terrorists use to recruit. Since I have been President, we have worked responsibly to cut the population of GTMO in half. Now, it is time to finish the job, and I will not relent in my determination to shut it down. It is not who we are. It is time to close GTMO. As Americans, we cherish our civil liberties, and we need to uphold that commitment if we want maximum cooperation from other countries and industry in our fight against terrorist networks. So while some have moved on from the debates over our surveillance programs, I have not. As promised, our intelligence agencies have worked hard with the recommendations of privacy advocates to increase transparency and build more safeguards against potential abuse. Next month, we will issue a report on how we are keeping our promise to keep our country safe while strengthening privacy. Looking to the future instead of the past, making sure we match our power with diplomacy and use force wisely, building coalitions to meet new challenges and opportunities, and leading always with the example of our values, that is what makes us exceptional. That is what keeps us strong. That is why we have to keep striving to hold ourselves to the highest of standards: our own. Just over a decade ago, I gave a speech in Boston where I said that there wasn't a liberal America or a conservative America, or a Black America or a White America, but a United States of America. I said this because I had seen it in my own life in a nation that gave someone like me a chance; because I grew up in Hawaii, a melting pot of races and customs; because I made Illinois my home, a State of small towns, rich farmlands, and one of the world's great cities, a microcosm of the country where Democrats, Republicans, and Independents--good people of every ethnicity and every faith--share certain bedrock values. Over the past 6 years the pundits have pointed out more than once that my Presidency hasn't delivered on this vision. How ironic, they say, that our politics seem more divided than ever. It is held up as proof not just of my own flaws--of which there are many--but also as proof that the vision itself is misguided, naive; that there are too many people in this town who actually benefit from partisanship and gridlock for us to ever do anything about it. I know how tempting such cynicism may be, but I still think the cynics are wrong. I still believe that we are one people. I still believe that together we can do great things, even when the odds are long. I believe this because over and over, in my 6 years in office, I have seen America at its best. I have seen the hopeful faces of young graduates from New York to California and our newest officers at West Point, Annapolis, Colorado Springs, and New London. I have mourned with grieving families in Tucson and Newtown; in Boston; in West, Texas; and West Virginia. I have watched Americans beat back adversity from the gulf coast to the Great Plains, from Midwest assembly lines to the Mid-Atlantic seaboard. I have seen something like gay marriage go from a wedge issue used to drive us apart to a story of freedom across our country, a civil right now legal in States that seven in 10 Americans call home. So I know the good and optimistic and big-hearted generosity of the American people, who every day live the idea that we are our brother's keeper and our sister's keeper, and I know they expect those of us who serve here to set a better example. So the question for those of us here tonight is how we--all of us-- can better reflect America's hopes. I have served in Congress with many of you. I know many of you well. There are a lot of good people here, on both sides of the aisle. And many of you have told me that this isn't what you signed up for-- arguing past each other on cable shows, the constant fundraising, always looking over your shoulder at how the base will react to every decision. Imagine if we broke out of these tired old patterns. Imagine if we did something different. Understand--a better politics isn't one where Democrats abandon their agenda or Republicans simply embrace mine. A better politics is one where we appeal to each other's basic decency instead of our basest fears. A better politics is one where we debate without demonizing each other, where we talk issues and values and principles and facts rather than gotcha moments or trivial gaffes or fake controversies that have nothing to do with people's daily lives. A better politics is one where we spend less time drowning in dark [[Page H424]] money for ads that pull us into the gutter and spend more time lifting young people up with a sense of purpose and possibility, asking them to join in the great mission of building America. If we are going to have arguments, let's have arguments, but let's make them debates worthy of this body and worthy of this country. We still may not agree on a woman's right to choose, but surely we can agree it is a good thing that teen pregnancies and abortions are nearing all-time lows and that every woman should have access to the health care that she needs. Yes, passions still fly on immigration, but surely we can all see something of ourselves in the striving young student and agree that no one benefits when a hardworking mom is snatched from her child, and that it is possible to shape a law that upholds our tradition as a nation of laws and a nation of immigrants. I have talked to Republicans and Democrats about that. That is something that we can share. We may go at it in campaign season, but surely we can agree that the right to vote is sacred, that it is being denied to too many, and that on this 50th anniversary of the great march from Selma to Montgomery and the passage of the Voting Rights Act, we can come together, Democrats and Republicans, to make voting easier for every single American. We may have different takes on the events of Ferguson and New York, but surely we can understand a father who fears his son can't walk home without being harassed, and surely we can understand the wife who won't rest until the police officer she married walks through the front door at the end of his shift, and surely we can agree that it is a good thing that for the first time in 40 years the crime rate and the incarceration rate have come down together, and use that as a starting point for Democrats and Republicans, community leaders and law enforcement, to reform America's criminal justice system so that it protects and serves all of us. That is a better politics. That is how we start rebuilding trust. That is how we move this country forward. That is what the American people want. That is what they deserve. I have no more campaigns to run. I know, because I won both of them. My only agenda for the next 2 years is the same as the one I have had since the day I swore an oath on the steps of this Capitol--to do what I believe is best for America. If you share the broad vision I outlined tonight, I ask you to join me in the work at hand. If you disagree with parts of it, I hope you will at least work with me where you do agree. And I commit to every Republican here tonight that I will not only seek out your ideas, I will seek to work with you to make this country stronger. Because I want this Chamber, I want this city to reflect the truth-- that for all our blind spots and shortcomings, we are a people with the strength and generosity of spirit to bridge divides, to unite in common effort, and to help our neighbors, whether down the street or on the other side of the world. I want our actions to tell every child, in every neighborhood: Your life matters, and we are committed to improving your life chances, as committed as we are to working on behalf of our own kids. I want future generations to know that we are a people who see our differences as a great gift, that we are a people who value the dignity and worth of every citizen--man and woman, young and old, Black and White, Latino, Asian, immigrant, Native American, gay, straight, Americans with mental illness or physical disability. Everybody matters. I want them to grow up in a country that shows the world what we still know to be true: that we are still more than a collection of red states and blue states; that we are the United States of America. I want them to grow up in a country where a young mom can sit down and write a letter to her President with a story that sums up these past 6 years: ``It is amazing what you can bounce back from when you have to . . . we are a strong, tight-knit family who has made it through some very, very hard times.'' My fellow Americans, we, too, are a strong, tight-knit family. We, too, have made it through some hard times. Fifteen years into this new century, we have picked ourselves up, dusted ourselves off, and begun again the work of remaking America. We have laid a new foundation. A brighter future is ours to write. Let's begin this new chapter-- together--and let's start the work right now. Thank you, God bless you, and God bless this country we love.

(applause, the members rising.) the speaker. members of the congress, i have the high privilege and the distinct honor of presenting to you the president of the united states. (applause, the members rising.) the president. mr. speaker, mr. vice president, members of congress, my fellow americans: we are 15 years into this new century--15 years that dawned with terror touching our shores, that unfolded with a new generation fighting two long and costly wars, that saw a vicious recession spread across our nation and the world. it has been, and still is, a hard time for many. but, tonight, we turn the page. tonight, after a breakthrough year for america, our economy is growing and creating jobs at the fastest pace since 1999. our unemployment rate is now lower than it was before the financial crisis. more of our kids are graduating than ever before. more of our people are insured than ever before. and we are as free from the grip of foreign oil as we have been in almost 30 years. [[page h420]] tonight, for the first time since 9/11, our combat mission in afghanistan is over. six years ago, nearly 180,000 american troops served in iraq and afghanistan. today, fewer than 15,000 remain. and we salute the courage and sacrifice of every man and woman in this 9/11 generation who has served to keep us safe. we are humbled and grateful for your service. america, for all that we have endured, for all the grit and hard work required to come back, for all the tasks that lie ahead, know this: the shadow of crisis has passed, and the state of the union is strong. at this moment, with a growing economy, shrinking deficits, bustling industry, and booming energy production, we have risen from recession freer to write our own future than any other nation on earth. it is now up to us to choose who we want to be over the next 15 years and for decades to come. will we accept an economy where only a few of us do spectacularly well, or will we commit ourselves to an economy that generates rising incomes and chances for everyone who makes the effort? will we approach the world fearful and reactive, dragged into costly conflicts that strain our military and set back our standing, or will we lead wisely, using all elements of our power to defeat new threats and protect our planet? will we allow ourselves to be sorted into factions and turned against one another, or will we recapture the sense of common purpose that has always propelled america forward? in 2 weeks, i will send this congress a budget filled with ideas that are practical, not partisan; and in the months ahead, i will crisscross the country, making a case for those ideas. so, tonight, i want to focus less on a checklist of proposals and focus more on the values at stake in the choices before us. it begins with our economy. seven years ago, rebekah and ben erler of minneapolis were newlyweds. she waited tables. he worked construction. their first child, jack, was on the way. they were young and in love in america, and it doesn't get much better than that. ``if only we had known,'' rebekah wrote to me last spring, ``what was about to happen to the housing and construction market.'' as the crisis worsened, ben's business dried up, so he took what jobs he could find even if they kept him on the road for long stretches of time. rebekah took out student loans, enrolled in community college, and retrained for a new career. they sacrificed for each other, and, slowly, it paid off. they bought their first home. they had a second son, henry. rebekah got a better job and then a raise. ben is back in construction and home for dinner every night. ``it is amazing,'' rebekah wrote, ``what you can bounce back from when you have to . . . we are a strong, tight-knit family who has made it through some very, very hard times.'' we are a strong, tight-knit family who has made it through some very, very hard times. america, rebekah and ben's story is our story. they represent the millions who have worked hard and scrimped and sacrificed and retooled. you are the reason that i ran for this office. you are the people i was thinking of 6 years ago today, in the darkest months of the crisis, when i stood on the steps of this capitol and promised we would rebuild our economy on a new foundation; and it has been your resilience--your effort--that has made it possible for our country to emerge stronger. we believed we could reverse the tide of outsourcing and draw new jobs to our shores, and over the past 5 years, our businesses have created more than 11 million new jobs. we believed we could reduce our dependence on foreign oil and protect our planet, and, today, america is number one in oil and gas. america is number one in wind power. every 3 weeks, we bring online as much solar power as we did in all of 2008. and thanks to lower gas prices and higher fuel standards, the typical family this year should save about $750 at the pump. we believed we could prepare our kids for a more competitive world, and, today, our younger students have earned the highest math and reading scores on record. our high school graduation rate has hit an all-time high, and more americans finish college than ever before. we believed that sensible regulations could prevent another crisis, shield families from ruin, and encourage fair competition. today, we have new tools to stop taxpayer-funded bailouts and a new consumer watchdog to protect us from predatory lending and abusive credit card practices, and in the past year alone, about 10 million uninsured americans finally gained the security of health coverage. at every step, we were told our goals were misguided or too ambitious, that we would crush jobs and explode deficits. instead, we have seen the fastest economic growth in over a decade, our deficits cut by two-thirds, a stock market that has doubled, and health care inflation at its lowest rate in 50 years. this is good news, people. so the verdict is clear. middle class economics works, expanding opportunity works, and these policies will continue to work, as long as politics don't get in the way. we can't slow down businesses or put our economy at risk with government shutdowns or fiscal showdowns. we can't put the security of families at risk by taking away their health insurance or unraveling the new rules on wall street or refighting past battles on immigration when we have got to fix a broken system. and if a bill comes to my desk that tries to do any of these things, i will veto it. it will earn my veto. today, thanks to a growing economy, the recovery is touching more and more lives. wages are finally starting to rise again. we know that more small business owners plan to raise their employees' pay than at any time since 2007. but here is the thing. those of us here tonight, we need to set our sights higher than just making sure government doesn't screw things up and halt the progress we are making. we need to do more than just do no harm. tonight, together, let's do more to restore the link between hard work and growing opportunity for every american because families like rebekah's still need our help. she and ben are working as hard as ever but have to forego vacations and a new car so that they can pay off student loans and save for retirement. friday-night pizza, that is a big splurge. basic childcare for jack and henry costs more than their mortgage and almost as much as a year at the university of minnesota. like millions of hardworking americans, rebekah isn't asking for a handout, but she is asking that we look for more ways to help families get ahead. in fact, at every moment of economic change throughout our history, this country has taken bold action to adapt to new circumstances and to make sure everyone gets a fair shot. we set up worker protections, social security, medicare, and medicaid to protect ourselves from the harshest adversity. we gave our citizens schools and colleges, infrastructure and the internet--tools they needed to go as far as their efforts and their dreams will take them. that is what middle class economics is: the idea that this country does best when everyone gets their fair shot, everyone does their fair share, and everyone plays by the same set of rules. we don't just want everyone to share in america's success; we want everyone to contribute to our success. so what does middle class economics require in our time? first, middle class economics means helping working families feel more secure in a world of constant change. that means helping folks afford childcare, college, health care, a home, retirement; and my budget will address each of these issues, lowering the taxes of working families and putting thousands of dollars back into their pockets each year. here is one example. during world war ii, when men like my grandfather went off to war, having women like my grandmother in the workforce was a national security priority, so this country provided universal childcare. in today's economy, when having both parents in the workforce is an economic necessity for many families, we need affordable, high-quality childcare more than ever. it is not a nice-to-have; it is a must-have. it is time we stop treating childcare as a side issue or a women's issue and treat it like the national economic priority that it is for all of us, and that is [[page h421]] why my plan will make quality childcare more available and more affordable for every middle class and low-income family with young children in america--by creating more slots and a new tax cut of up to $3,000 per child, per year. here is another example. today, we are the only advanced country on earth that doesn't guarantee paid sick leave or paid maternity leave to our workers. forty-three million workers have no paid sick leave. forty-three million. think about that. and that forces too many parents to make the gut-wrenching choice between a paycheck and a sick kid at home. so i will be taking new action to help states adopt paid leave laws of their own. and since paid sick leave won where it was on the ballot last november, let's put it to a vote right here in washington. send me a bill that gives every worker in america the opportunity to earn 7 days of paid sick leave. it is the right thing to do. of course, nothing helps families make ends meet like higher wages. that is why this congress still needs to pass a law that makes sure a woman is paid the same as a man for doing the same work. really. it is 2015. it is time. we still need to make sure employees get the overtime they have earned. and to everyone in this congress who still refuses to raise the minimum wage, i say this: if you truly believe you could work full time and support a family on less than $15,000 a year, try it. if not, vote to give millions of the hardest-working people in america a raise. now, these ideas won't make everybody rich, won't relieve every hardship. that is not the job of government. to give working families a fair shot, we still need more employers to see beyond next quarter's earnings and recognize that investing in their workforce is in their company's long-term interest. we still need laws that strengthen, rather than weaken, unions and give american workers a voice. but, you know, things like child care and sick leave and equal pay, things like lower mortgage premiums and a higher minimum wage, these ideas will make a meaningful difference in the lives of millions of families. that is a fact. and that is what all of us, republicans and democrats alike, were sent here to do. now, second, to make sure folks keep earning higher wages down the road, we have to do more to help americans upgrade their skills. america thrived in the 20th century because we made high school free, sent a generation of gis to college, trained the best workforce in the world. we were ahead of the curve. but other countries caught on, and in a 21st century economy that rewards knowledge like never before, we need to up our game. we need to do more. by the end of this decade, two in three job openings will require some higher education, two in three. and yet, we still live in a country where too many bright, striving americans are priced out of the education they need. it is not fair to them, and it is sure not smart for our future. that is why i am sending this congress a bold new plan to lower the cost of community college to zero. keep in mind, 40 percent of our college students choose community college. some are young and starting out. some are older and looking for a better job. some are veterans and single parents trying to transition back into the job market. whoever you are, this plan is your chance to graduate ready for the new economy without a load of debt. understand, you have got to earn it. you have got to keep your grades up and graduate on time. tennessee, a state with republican leadership, and chicago, a city with democratic leadership, are showing that free community college is possible. i want to spread that idea all across america, that 2 years of college becomes as free and universal in america as high school is today. let's stay ahead of the curve. and i want to work with this congress to make sure those already burdened with student loans can reduce their monthly payments so that student debt doesn't derail anyone's dreams. thanks to vice president biden's great work to update our job training system, we are connecting community colleges with local employers to train workers to fill high-paying jobs like coding and nursing and robotics. tonight i am also asking more businesses to follow the lead of companies like cvs and ups and offer more educational benefits and paid apprenticeships, opportunities that give workers the chance to earn higher-paying jobs even if they don't have a higher education. and as a new generation of veterans comes home, we owe them every opportunity to live the american dream they helped defend. already, we have made strides towards ensuring that every veteran has access to the highest-quality care. we are slashing the backlog that had too many veterans waiting years to get the benefits they need, and we are making it easier for vets to translate their training and experience into civilian jobs. and joining forces, the national campaign launched by michelle and jill biden--thank you, michelle; thank you, jill--has helped nearly 700,000 veterans and military spouses get a new job. so to every ceo in america, let me repeat: if you want somebody who is going to get the job done and done right, hire a veteran. finally, as we better train our workers, we need the new economy to keep churning out high-wage jobs for our workers to fill. since 2010, america has put more people back to work than europe, japan, and all advanced economies combined. our manufacturers have added almost 800,000 new jobs. some of our bedrock sectors, like our auto industry, are booming. but there are also millions of americans who work jobs that didn't even exist 10 or 20 years ago, jobs at companies like google and ebay and tesla. so no one knows for certain which industries will generate the jobs of the future. but we do know we want them here in america. we know that. and that is why the third part of middle class economics is all about building the most competitive economy anywhere, the place where businesses want to locate and hire. twenty-first century businesses need 21st century infrastructure, modern ports and stronger bridges, faster trains and the fastest internet. democrats and republicans used to agree on this. so let's set our sights higher than a single oil pipeline. let's pass a bipartisan infrastructure plan that could create more than 30 times as many jobs per year and make this country stronger for decades to come. let's do it. let's get it done. let's get it done. twenty-first century businesses, including small businesses, need to sell more american products overseas. today, our businesses export more than ever, and exporters tend to pay their workers higher wages. but as we speak, china wants to write the rules for the world's fastest- growing region. that would put our workers and our businesses at a disadvantage. why would we let that happen? we should write those rules. we should level the playing field. that is why i am asking both parties to give me trade promotion authority to protect american workers with strong new trade deals from asia to europe that aren't just free but are also fair. it is the right thing to do. look, i am the first one to admit that past trade deals haven't always lived up to the hype, and that is why we have gone after countries that break the rules at our expense. but 95 percent of the world's customers live outside our borders. we can't close ourselves off from those opportunities. more than half of manufacturing executives have said they are actively looking to bring jobs back from china. let's give them one more reason to get it done. twenty-first century businesses will rely on american science and technology, research and development. i want the country that eliminated polio and mapped the human genome to lead a new era of medicine, one that delivers the right treatment at the right time. in some patients with cystic fibrosis, this approach has reversed a disease once thought unstoppable. so tonight, i am launching a new precision medicine initiative to bring us closer to curing diseases like cancer and diabetes, and to give all of us access to the personalized information we need to keep ourselves and our families healthier. we can do this. i intend to protect a free and open internet, extend its reach to every [[page h422]] classroom and every community, and help folks build the fastest networks so that the next generation of digital innovators and entrepreneurs have the platform to keep reshaping our world. i want americans to win the race for the kinds of discoveries that unleash new jobs: converting sunlight into liquid fuel; creating revolutionary prosthetics so that a veteran who gave his arms for his country can play catch with his kids again; pushing out into the solar system not just to visit, but to stay. now, last month, we launched a new spacecraft as part of a reenergized space program that will send american astronauts to mars; and in 2 months, to prepare us for those missions, scott kelly will begin a year-long stay in space. so good luck, captain. make sure to instagram it. we are proud of you. now, the truth is, when it comes to issues like infrastructure and basic research, i know there is bipartisan support in this chamber. members of both parties have told me so. where we too often run onto the rocks is how to pay for these investments. as americans, we don't mind paying our fair share of taxes as long as everybody else does too. but for far too long, lobbyists have rigged the tax code with loopholes that let some corporations pay nothing while others pay full freight. they have riddled it with giveaways that the superrich don't need while denying a break to middle class families who do. this year, we have an opportunity to change that. let's close loopholes so we stop rewarding companies that keep profits abroad and reward those that invest here in america. let's use those savings to rebuild our infrastructure and to make it more attractive for companies to bring jobs home. let's simplify the system and let a small business owner file based on her actual bank statement instead of the number of accountants she can afford. and let's close the loopholes that lead to inequality, by allowing the top 1 percent to avoid paying taxes on their accumulated wealth. we can use that money to help more families pay for child care and send their kids to college. we need a tax code that truly helps working americans try to get a leg up in the new economy. and we can achieve that together. we can achieve it together. helping hardworking families make ends meet, giving them the tools they need for good-paying jobs in this new economy, and maintaining the conditions of growth and competitiveness, this is where america needs to go. i believe it is where the american people want to go. it will make our economy stronger a year from now, 15 years from now, and deep into the century ahead. of course, if there is one thing this new century has taught us, it is that we cannot separate our work here at home from challenges beyond our shores. my first duty as commander in chief is to defend the united states of america. in doing so, the question is not whether america leads in the world, but how. when we make rash decisions--reacting to the headlines instead of using our heads--when the first response to a challenge is to send in our military, then we risk getting drawn into unnecessary conflicts and neglect the broader strategy we need for a safer, more prosperous world. that is what our enemies want us to do. i believe in a smarter kind of american leadership. we lead best when we combine military power with strong diplomacy, when we leverage our power with coalition building, when we don't let our fears blind us to the opportunities that this new century presents. that is exactly what we are doing right now, and around the globe, it is making a difference. first, we stand united with people around the world who have been targeted by terrorists, from a school in pakistan to the streets of paris. we will continue to hunt down terrorists and dismantle their networks; and we reserve the right to act unilaterally, as we have done relentlessly since i took office, to take out terrorists who pose a direct threat to us and our allies. at the same time, we have learned some costly lessons over the last 13 years. instead of americans patrolling the valleys of afghanistan, we have trained their security forces, who have now taken the lead; and we have honored our troops' sacrifice by supporting that country's first democratic transition. instead of sending large ground forces overseas, we are partnering with nations from south asia to north africa to deny safe haven to terrorists who threaten america. in iraq and syria, american leadership, including our military power, is stopping isil's advance. instead of getting dragged into another ground war in the middle east, we are leading a broad coalition, including arab nations, to degrade and ultimately destroy this terrorist group. we are also supporting a moderate opposition in syria that can help us in this effort and are assisting people everywhere who stand up to the bankrupt ideology of violent extremism. now, this effort will take time. it will require focus. but we will succeed. and tonight, i call on this congress to show the world that we are united in this mission by passing a resolution to authorize the use of force against isil. we need that authority. second, we are demonstrating the power of american strength and diplomacy. we are upholding the principle that bigger nations can't bully the small, by opposing russian aggression and supporting ukraine's democracy and reassuring our nato allies. last year, as we were doing the hard work of imposing sanctions, along with our allies, as we were reinforcing our presence with the frontline states, mr. putin's aggression, it was suggested, was a masterful display of strategy and strength. that is what i heard from some folks. well, today it is america that stands strong and united with our allies, while russia is isolated with its economy in tatters. that is how america leads--not with bluster but with persistent, steady resolve. in cuba, we are ending a policy that was long past its expiration date. when what you are doing doesn't work for 50 years, it is time to try something new. our shift in cuba policy has the potential to end a legacy of mistrust in our hemisphere. it removes a phony excuse for restrictions in cuba, stands up for democratic values, and extends the hand of friendship to the cuban people. and this year, congress should begin the work of ending the embargo. as his holiness, pope francis, has said, diplomacy is the work of ``small steps.'' these small steps have added up to new hope for the future in cuba. and after years in prison, we are overjoyed that alan gross is back home where he belongs. welcome home, alan. we are glad you are here. our diplomacy is at work with respect to iran where, for the first time in a decade, we have halted the progress of its nuclear program and reduced its stockpile of nuclear material. between now and this spring, we have a chance to negotiate a comprehensive agreement that prevents a nuclear-armed iran, secures america and our allies-- including israel--while avoiding yet another middle east conflict there are no guarantees that negotiations will succeed, and i keep all options on the table to prevent a nuclear iran. but new sanctions passed by this congress at this moment in time will all but guarantee that diplomacy fails--alienating america from its allies, making it harder to maintain sanctions, and ensuring that iran starts up its nuclear program again. it doesn't make sense, and that is why i will veto any new sanctions bill that threatens to undo this progress. the american people expect us to only go to war as a last resort, and i intend to stay true to that wisdom. third, we are looking beyond the issues that have consumed us in the past to shape the coming century. no foreign nation and no hacker should be able to shut down our networks, steal our trade secrets, or invade the privacy of american families, especially our kids. so we are making sure our government integrates intelligence to combat cyber threats, just as we have done to combat terrorism. tonight, i urge this congress to finally pass the legislation we need to better meet the evolving threat of cyber attacks, combat identity theft, and protect our children's information. that should be a bipartisan effort. if we don't act, we will leave our nation and our economy vulnerable. if we [[page h423]] do, we can continue to protect the technologies that have unleashed untold opportunities for people around the globe. in west africa, our troops, our scientists, our doctors, our nurses, and our health care workers are rolling back ebola, saving countless lives and stopping the spread of disease. i could not be prouder of them, and i thank this congress for your bipartisan support of their efforts. but the job is not yet done, and the world needs to use this lesson to build a more effective global effort to prevent the spread of future pandemics, invest in smart development, and eradicate extreme poverty. in the asia pacific, we are modernizing alliances while making sure that other nations play by the rules in how they trade, how they resolve maritime disputes, and how they participate in meeting common international challenges like nonproliferation and disaster relief; and no challenge poses a greater threat to future generations than climate change. 2014 was the planet's warmest year on record. now, 1 year doesn't make a trend, but this does: 14 of the 15 warmest years on record have all fallen in the first 15 years of this century. i have heard some folks try to dodge the evidence by saying they are not scientists and that we don't have enough information to act. well, i am not a scientist either, but you know what, i know a lot of really good scientists at nasa, at noaa, and at our major universities. the best scientists in the world are all telling us that our activities are changing the climate, and if we don't act forcefully, we will continue to see rising oceans; longer, hotter heat waves; dangerous droughts and floods; and massive disruptions that can trigger greater migration, conflict, and hunger around the globe. the pentagon says that climate change poses immediate risks to our national security. we should act like it. that is why, over the past 6 years, we have done more than ever to combat climate change, from the way we produce energy to the way we use it; that is why we have set aside more public lands and waters than any administration in history; and that is why i will not let this congress endanger the health of our children by turning back the clock on our efforts. i am determined to make sure that american leadership drives international action. in beijing, we made an historic announcement. the united states will double the pace at which we cut carbon pollution, and china committed for the first time to limiting their emissions. because the world's two largest economies came together, other nations are now stepping up and offering hope that, this year, the world will finally reach an agreement to protect the one planet we have got. there is one last pillar of our leadership, and that is the example of our values. as americans, we respect human dignity even when we are threatened, which is why i have prohibited torture and worked to make sure our use of new technology, like drones, is properly constrained. it is why we speak out against the deplorable anti-semitism that has resurfaced in certain parts of the world. it is why we continue to reject offensive stereotypes of muslims, the vast majority of whom share our commitment to peace. that is why we defend free speech; advocate for political prisoners; and condemn the persecution of women or religious minorities or people who are lesbian, gay, bisexual, or transgender. we do these things not only because they are the right thing to do, but because, ultimately, they will make us safer. as americans, we have a profound commitment to justice, so it makes no sense to spend $3 million per prisoner to keep open a prison that the world condemns and terrorists use to recruit. since i have been president, we have worked responsibly to cut the population of gtmo in half. now, it is time to finish the job, and i will not relent in my determination to shut it down. it is not who we are. it is time to close gtmo. as americans, we cherish our civil liberties, and we need to uphold that commitment if we want maximum cooperation from other countries and industry in our fight against terrorist networks. so while some have moved on from the debates over our surveillance programs, i have not. as promised, our intelligence agencies have worked hard with the recommendations of privacy advocates to increase transparency and build more safeguards against potential abuse. next month, we will issue a report on how we are keeping our promise to keep our country safe while strengthening privacy. looking to the future instead of the past, making sure we match our power with diplomacy and use force wisely, building coalitions to meet new challenges and opportunities, and leading always with the example of our values, that is what makes us exceptional. that is what keeps us strong. that is why we have to keep striving to hold ourselves to the highest of standards: our own. just over a decade ago, i gave a speech in boston where i said that there wasn't a liberal america or a conservative america, or a black america or a white america, but a united states of america. i said this because i had seen it in my own life in a nation that gave someone like me a chance; because i grew up in hawaii, a melting pot of races and customs; because i made illinois my home, a state of small towns, rich farmlands, and one of the world's great cities, a microcosm of the country where democrats, republicans, and independents--good people of every ethnicity and every faith--share certain bedrock values. over the past 6 years the pundits have pointed out more than once that my presidency hasn't delivered on this vision. how ironic, they say, that our politics seem more divided than ever. it is held up as proof not just of my own flaws--of which there are many--but also as proof that the vision itself is misguided, naive; that there are too many people in this town who actually benefit from partisanship and gridlock for us to ever do anything about it. i know how tempting such cynicism may be, but i still think the cynics are wrong. i still believe that we are one people. i still believe that together we can do great things, even when the odds are long. i believe this because over and over, in my 6 years in office, i have seen america at its best. i have seen the hopeful faces of young graduates from new york to california and our newest officers at west point, annapolis, colorado springs, and new london. i have mourned with grieving families in tucson and newtown; in boston; in west, texas; and west virginia. i have watched americans beat back adversity from the gulf coast to the great plains, from midwest assembly lines to the mid-atlantic seaboard. i have seen something like gay marriage go from a wedge issue used to drive us apart to a story of freedom across our country, a civil right now legal in states that seven in 10 americans call home. so i know the good and optimistic and big-hearted generosity of the american people, who every day live the idea that we are our brother's keeper and our sister's keeper, and i know they expect those of us who serve here to set a better example. so the question for those of us here tonight is how we--all of us-- can better reflect america's hopes. i have served in congress with many of you. i know many of you well. there are a lot of good people here, on both sides of the aisle. and many of you have told me that this isn't what you signed up for-- arguing past each other on cable shows, the constant fundraising, always looking over your shoulder at how the base will react to every decision. imagine if we broke out of these tired old patterns. imagine if we did something different. understand--a better politics isn't one where democrats abandon their agenda or republicans simply embrace mine. a better politics is one where we appeal to each other's basic decency instead of our basest fears. a better politics is one where we debate without demonizing each other, where we talk issues and values and principles and facts rather than gotcha moments or trivial gaffes or fake controversies that have nothing to do with people's daily lives. a better politics is one where we spend less time drowning in dark [[page h424]] money for ads that pull us into the gutter and spend more time lifting young people up with a sense of purpose and possibility, asking them to join in the great mission of building america. if we are going to have arguments, let's have arguments, but let's make them debates worthy of this body and worthy of this country. we still may not agree on a woman's right to choose, but surely we can agree it is a good thing that teen pregnancies and abortions are nearing all-time lows and that every woman should have access to the health care that she needs. yes, passions still fly on immigration, but surely we can all see something of ourselves in the striving young student and agree that no one benefits when a hardworking mom is snatched from her child, and that it is possible to shape a law that upholds our tradition as a nation of laws and a nation of immigrants. i have talked to republicans and democrats about that. that is something that we can share. we may go at it in campaign season, but surely we can agree that the right to vote is sacred, that it is being denied to too many, and that on this 50th anniversary of the great march from selma to montgomery and the passage of the voting rights act, we can come together, democrats and republicans, to make voting easier for every single american. we may have different takes on the events of ferguson and new york, but surely we can understand a father who fears his son can't walk home without being harassed, and surely we can understand the wife who won't rest until the police officer she married walks through the front door at the end of his shift, and surely we can agree that it is a good thing that for the first time in 40 years the crime rate and the incarceration rate have come down together, and use that as a starting point for democrats and republicans, community leaders and law enforcement, to reform america's criminal justice system so that it protects and serves all of us. that is a better politics. that is how we start rebuilding trust. that is how we move this country forward. that is what the american people want. that is what they deserve. i have no more campaigns to run. i know, because i won both of them. my only agenda for the next 2 years is the same as the one i have had since the day i swore an oath on the steps of this capitol--to do what i believe is best for america. if you share the broad vision i outlined tonight, i ask you to join me in the work at hand. if you disagree with parts of it, i hope you will at least work with me where you do agree. and i commit to every republican here tonight that i will not only seek out your ideas, i will seek to work with you to make this country stronger. because i want this chamber, i want this city to reflect the truth-- that for all our blind spots and shortcomings, we are a people with the strength and generosity of spirit to bridge divides, to unite in common effort, and to help our neighbors, whether down the street or on the other side of the world. i want our actions to tell every child, in every neighborhood: your life matters, and we are committed to improving your life chances, as committed as we are to working on behalf of our own kids. i want future generations to know that we are a people who see our differences as a great gift, that we are a people who value the dignity and worth of every citizen--man and woman, young and old, black and white, latino, asian, immigrant, native american, gay, straight, americans with mental illness or physical disability. everybody matters. i want them to grow up in a country that shows the world what we still know to be true: that we are still more than a collection of red states and blue states; that we are the united states of america. i want them to grow up in a country where a young mom can sit down and write a letter to her president with a story that sums up these past 6 years: ``it is amazing what you can bounce back from when you have to . . . we are a strong, tight-knit family who has made it through some very, very hard times.'' my fellow americans, we, too, are a strong, tight-knit family. we, too, have made it through some hard times. fifteen years into this new century, we have picked ourselves up, dusted ourselves off, and begun again the work of remaking america. we have laid a new foundation. a brighter future is ours to write. let's begin this new chapter-- together--and let's start the work right now. thank you, god bless you, and god bless this country we love. (applause, the members rising.) at 10 o'clock and 20 minutes p.m., the president of the united states, accompanied by the committee of escort, retired from the hall of the house of representatives. the assistant to the sergeant at arms escorted the invited guests from the chamber in the following order: the members of the president's cabinet; the chief justice of the united states and the associate justices of the supreme court; the dean of the diplomatic corps. the speaker. the chair declares the joint session of the two houses now dissolved. accordingly, at 10 o'clock and 21 minutes p.m., the joint session of the two houses was dissolved. the members of the senate retired to their chamber. ____________________",43092

Mr. President, tonight we will welcome President Obama to the Capitol. We look forward to hearing what he has to say. We are looking forward to Senator Ernst's address, as well. Joni Ernst understands the concerns of hard-working families in a way much of Washington has not. That is why the people of her State sent her here--to fight for them. She will explain the commitment of this new Congress to work for policies aimed at the good jobs and better wages Americans deserve. Tonight is a big moment for the President--and for our country. The tone he strikes and the issues he highlights will tell us a lot about what to expect in his Presidency's final act. There is a lot riding on it, and we will be listening closely. One option is the path he has been on for so many years. I sincerely hope he makes a different choice. The American people just spoke in clear terms about this direction. They called for a new one. We should work together to make Washington focus on their concerns. Working with the new Congress for positive change--that is the second option for President Obama. It is the one struggling families and serious policymakers urge him to choose. The new Congress has already started to take up smart, bipartisan ideas focused on jobs and reform. But when we have asked the White House for constructive engagement, what we have seen, at least so far, has been pretty discouraging. We need to change this dynamic. We need to turn the page. The State of the Union offers that opportunity. The American people aren't demanding talking point proposals designed to excite the base but not designed to pass. What they said they are hungry for is substance and accomplishment. They want Washington to get back to work and focus on a serious jobs and reform agenda. They said they are ready to see more constructive cooperation, especially on bipartisan jobs initiatives--bipartisan jobs initiatives such as the Keystone infrastructure bill. Keystone has support in both parties. It is an important piece of infrastructure for our country. According to what the Obama administration's own State Department has said previously, constructing a pipeline would support literally thousands of jobs. It has already passed the House. We are currently working to pass it through the Senate. It will be on the President's desk before long. We see no reason for him to veto these jobs. But whatever he decides, we are going to keep working for positive, middle-class jobs ideas here in Congress. As I have said before, we are not here to protect the President from a good idea. If the President is willing to work with us, there is much we can get accomplished for the American people. [[Page S250]] We have already identified several areas of potential cooperation, such as tearing down trade barriers in places such as Europe and the Pacific, building jobs with comprehensive progrowth tax simplification, and working to prevent cyber attacks. On each of these issues, the President has previously sent some positive signals. Now we need some constructive engagement. We will be looking for signs of that in the speech he delivers tonight. What I hope is that he presents some positive, bipartisan ideas of his own that can pass the Congress Americans just voted for. Give us new ideas to prevent Iran from becoming a country with nuclear weapons or to confront the threats posed by terrorism or to remove regulations that hurt struggling coal families. Challenge us with truly serious, realistic reforms that focus on growth and raising middle-class incomes--reforms that don't just spend more money we don't have. And if the President is ready for a new beginning beyond canceled health plans and partisan executive overreach, work with us to pursue an achievement that history will actually remember. Reach across the aisle to allow us to save and strengthen Medicare. Cooperate with both parties to save Social Security. The President should tell America his plan for responsible reforms that aim to balance the budget and not just more tired tax hikes. Achieving important reforms such as these would represent a win for hard-working families. It would deliver the kind of commonsense progress Americans deserve. So we welcome the President tonight. We look to his address with interest. If the President is ready to play offense, then we urge him to join the new Congress in playing offense on behalf of the American people. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 9 (Tuesday, January 20, 2015)] [Senate] [Pages S249-S250] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] WORKING TOGETHER FOR POSITIVE CHANGE Mr. McCONNELL.

CREC-2015-01-20-pt1-PgS250-2,CREC-2015-01-20,114,NEW IDEAS FOR AMERICA,"[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 9 (Tuesday, January 20, 2015)] [Senate] [Pages S250-S251] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] NEW IDEAS FOR AMERICA Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, tonight President Obama will deliver his State of the Union Address to outline his plan to make life better for middle-income families and those struggling in our strengthening economy. I have heard from both sides--Democrats and Republicans--the lament that even though many hard-working families are doing their best and businesses are more profitable because our workers are more productive, a lot of families don't see it in their paychecks. They struggle from paycheck to paycheck to pay for the basics in life. So we have to ask ourselves: What will we do about this? Will we do anything? I worry that the comments just made by the majority leader suggest that he is relying on faith alone--faith in our free market system; faith in the belief that if we have an expanding economy, which we do, and if we have profitability in corporations, which we do, that it will translate into a better standard of living for working families. Well, it may be an article of faith, but it is one that can be challenged because that is exactly what has been happening in America for years. The economy has been growing, and we have seen an increase in jobs for 58 straight months. At the same time, we have noted that working families across America don't see any change in their lives. They don't see any income change. Then we look at the reality. The reality shows that the gap between the rich and poor in America just grows larger and larger. We can talk separately about the compensation for CEOs and corporations. It is reaching record levels--far beyond the excesses of previous moments in American economic history. What we are finding is that people at the very top of the corporate ladder are taking out more money from the economy than the workers who are generating the profits they are gleaning. That is not right. The President is going to challenge us to get beyond faith in our free market system to good works by Congress. He is going to talk about specifics--ideas the average family can understand and appreciate, such as the earned income tax credit. Here is an effort to say if you are working, we will make sure that your tax burden gives you a break so that you have additional money for your family to pay for daycare for the kids, to make certain you can pay for the utility bills and the basics of life. I have joined with Sherrod Brown of Ohio. We want to try to make the earned income tax credit available to more and more working Americans so we can supplement their income as they struggle to get by paycheck to paycheck. That is one of the first ideas we can pursue. The second initiative the President will address is college affordability. There are plenty of critics of the President's plan, but I think he has put his finger on reality. We can no longer be satisfied by saying it is the responsibility of our society to provide education from kindergarten through the grade 12. That doesn't reflect the reality of work today. In just a few years, more than a third of the jobs across America will require a college degree. What are we doing to prepare the workforce in America for 21st century requirements when it comes to education? Now, we know what is happening. More and more students are getting deeper and deeper in debt, and many are dropping out because of it. Those who finish and earn a diploma are saddled with a debt which changes their lives. President Obama has said: Let us start moving forward to make 2 years of community college a commitment in America for those students who are in need, No. 1, and No. 2, are willing to meet the standards. And the standards are graduation within 3 years. I look at some of the comments made in criticism of this, and they overlook the second part of the President's proposal--that part which demands that those students perform in order to receive assistance from our government in paying for community college. We have to look at a new model in America--in Arkansas, in Illinois, and across America--that is a K-14 model. That is reality. Certainly, we have to improve the K-12 performance. When two-thirds of community college students in many States, including my own, come to community colleges not performing at the 12th grade level, there is work to be done in the lower grades. But let's assume the obvious: If people want a good-paying job in the future, they need additional training. The affordable place to go is a community college, and we ought to make that a pathway that is affordable for every dedicated, hard-working student and their family. That isn't all. The President also acknowledges and will acknowledge tonight the reality of the housing market. Since 2009, our housing market in America has been recovering from a recession. Home building has more than doubled, yielding a lot of jobs for construction workers. Home prices are going back up. Millions of families whose home value was less than what they owed on their mortgage are now turning the corner. But for many Americans, buying a home is still out of reach. The President plans to reduce the FHA mortgage insurance premiums which is going to help responsible Americans afford a home. We need faith in our free market but good works by Congress when it comes to these essentials. The President is also going to propose a Healthy Families Act. Here is something that gets to the reality of life for working Americans. It would provide for businesses with 15 or more employees up to 7 paid sick days each year. You might say to yourself: What is a business going to do with people taking 7 days off in sick leave? What we found is if the employer will stand behind the employees when it comes to the basics such as sick leave, they will get more loyalty and more performance from those employees. That is a fair trade. It is one the President will propose this evening. I would say to the majority leader and those who share his position, faith in the free market is a good thing but not enough. We need to step in and make sure we have faith in working families, faith in the belief that if they can improve their lot in life, if their struggle paycheck to paycheck is somehow lessened, we are all going to be better off for it. I support the President's message this evening and look forward to hearing it delivered.

Mr. President, tonight President Obama will deliver his State of the Union Address to outline his plan to make life better for middle-income families and those struggling in our strengthening economy. I have heard from both sides--Democrats and Republicans--the lament that even though many hard-working families are doing their best and businesses are more profitable because our workers are more productive, a lot of families don't see it in their paychecks. They struggle from paycheck to paycheck to pay for the basics in life. So we have to ask ourselves: What will we do about this? Will we do anything? I worry that the comments just made by the majority leader suggest that he is relying on faith alone--faith in our free market system; faith in the belief that if we have an expanding economy, which we do, and if we have profitability in corporations, which we do, that it will translate into a better standard of living for working families. Well, it may be an article of faith, but it is one that can be challenged because that is exactly what has been happening in America for years. The economy has been growing, and we have seen an increase in jobs for 58 straight months. At the same time, we have noted that working families across America don't see any change in their lives. They don't see any income change. Then we look at the reality. The reality shows that the gap between the rich and poor in America just grows larger and larger. We can talk separately about the compensation for CEOs and corporations. It is reaching record levels--far beyond the excesses of previous moments in American economic history. What we are finding is that people at the very top of the corporate ladder are taking out more money from the economy than the workers who are generating the profits they are gleaning. That is not right. The President is going to challenge us to get beyond faith in our free market system to good works by Congress. He is going to talk about specifics--ideas the average family can understand and appreciate, such as the earned income tax credit. Here is an effort to say if you are working, we will make sure that your tax burden gives you a break so that you have additional money for your family to pay for daycare for the kids, to make certain you can pay for the utility bills and the basics of life. I have joined with Sherrod Brown of Ohio. We want to try to make the earned income tax credit available to more and more working Americans so we can supplement their income as they struggle to get by paycheck to paycheck. That is one of the first ideas we can pursue. The second initiative the President will address is college affordability. There are plenty of critics of the President's plan, but I think he has put his finger on reality. We can no longer be satisfied by saying it is the responsibility of our society to provide education from kindergarten through the grade 12. That doesn't reflect the reality of work today. In just a few years, more than a third of the jobs across America will require a college degree. What are we doing to prepare the workforce in America for 21st century requirements when it comes to education? Now, we know what is happening. More and more students are getting deeper and deeper in debt, and many are dropping out because of it. Those who finish and earn a diploma are saddled with a debt which changes their lives. President Obama has said: Let us start moving forward to make 2 years of community college a commitment in America for those students who are in need, No. 1, and No. 2, are willing to meet the standards.

CREC-2015-01-20-pt1-PgS251-2,CREC-2015-01-20,114,DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY,"[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 9 (Tuesday, January 20, 2015)] [Senate] [Pages S251-S252] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY Mr. DURBIN. The last point I would like to make relates to a motion that was made this morning by the majority leader. It was related to the appropriations bill for the Department of Homeland Security. Why are we bringing up this appropriations bill at this moment? Because when we agreed last December to fund our government, the Republicans in the House insisted we carve out the Department of Homeland Security and not give it its regular budget, instead give it emergency spending, a continuing resolution. This is not the way to run any department of government, certainly not the Department of Homeland Security. Why is it important to fund this department? One need only look to what has happened in the last few days in Paris to understand that the threat of terrorism to the world is still very real. One of our first lines of defense when it comes to terrorism is our Department of Homeland Security. There is no excuse for us to be dealing with this continuing resolution to fund this department. They should have the resources they need to keep America safe, but instead what has happened is this: The House of Representatives last week said they will only agree to fund this department properly if they can provide certain riders and changes in the law as part of it. I would tell you that the change that has been proposed by the House of Representatives is unacceptable. The President has said he is going to veto it if it is sent to his desk, and I totally support his position. Here is what they have come up with in the House of Representatives. If you are familiar with the DREAM Act, which I introduced in Congress 14 years ago, it says: If a young person is brought to the United States at an early age, parents making the decision to come to this country, and that young person grows up in the United States, finishes high school, no serious criminal problems, willing to go forward to higher education or to the military, we will give them a chance of becoming legal in America. That is the DREAM Act. It has been considered and passed on the floor of the Senate, considered and passed on the floor of the House but never in the same session, and so it is not the law of the land. President Obama, a little over 2 years ago, came out with an Executive order program known as DACA. DACA said to these young people who would qualify under this law: If you will come forward and register with our government, if you will pay the filing fee, if you will allow us to do the background check, we will allow you to stay, go to school, and work in America and not be deported. Six hundred thousand young people have come forward. We estimate there are some 2 million eligible, and 600,000 have come forward. Thirty thousand are from my State of Illinois. Who are these young people? Let me introduce you to one of them, Oscar Vazquez. Oscar Vazquez grew up in Phoenix, AZ. His mother and father brought him to that city from Mexico, and he was undocumented. He attended Carl Hayden High School in Phoenix. He was a member of the Junior ROTC. His goal was to serve in the U.S. Army. When he went to the recruiter to sign up, the recruiter said: I need your birth certificate. Oscar said: Come on. We are fighting a war. Can't you look the other way and just let me join? He said: No, young man. You don't have the proper documents. You can't enlist in the U.S. Army. He was despondent because that was his goal. He went home and got engaged in another project which is the subject of a new movie called ``Spare Parts,'' which George Lopez produced, directed, and starred in, which I saw last week. I will not give away the whole story, but I can tell you this: Oscar Vazquez and three other students at Carl Hayden High School entered into an underwater robotics competition. They competed with colleges such as MIT and they won. Their high school team won the underwater robotics competition. The talented young man, Oscar, said: I am going to Arizona State University. Without any government assistance, he graduated with a degree in mechanical engineering. After he got his degree and a wife and a baby, he [[Page S252]] said: Now I have to get right with America. I have to resolve this issue of being undocumented. That means Oscar decided to move back to Mexico. He was living in Mexico--the law required him to stay there for 10 years. That is how the law is written. He petitioned the United States for a chance to come back in. Eventually he was given a waiver. Oscar Vazquez came back, became a citizen of the United States of America, and the first thing he did was enlist in the U.S. Army. He went into combat in Afghanistan, and he came home after having served our Nation honorably and now is working for a major railroad in the State of Montana, with his wife and children. That is the story of one DREAMer, one DREAMer who was given a chance and has made a difference in America. He not only served in our military, but he had a degree in mechanical engineering. He is going to be a job creator, a job builder himself. So what do the House Republicans want to do to people such as Oscar Vazquez? Deport them. That is exactly what they called for. They are dream killers. That isn't right. We ought to give Oscar, young men and women just like him a chance to succeed and a chance to make America better. I have stood on this floor over 50 times with color photographs such as this one by my side and told the stories of DREAMers. This last weekend I was in Chicago and six of them came forward and told their stories. Each and every one of them had a compelling reason for us to defeat this mean-spirited amendment that came out of the House of Representatives. The President will veto it if it gets to his desk, but I hope we will do better in the Senate. I hope there are enough Senators on both sides of the aisle, 60-plus, who will stand up for the DREAMers of America. This is a test. It is a test as to whether we believe in fairness and justice and the value that immigrants such as Oscar Vazquez bring to the future of America. The House of Representatives just doesn't see it. They are blinded by their hatred for these immigrants, and they continue to pass these mean-spirited amendments. We can do better. We must do better as a nation. Let us stand up for the DREAMers, and let us all be dedicated to passing comprehensive immigration reform. Our immigration laws are broken. Our system is broken. It is time for us to accept our responsibility and repair it. We passed a bill a year and a half ago on the floor of the Senate with 68 votes--14 Republicans--Republicans and Democrats voted for it and sent it over to the House of Representatives and it languished for a year and a half. They refused to even call it or consider it. Our immigration system is still broken. Withholding money from the Department of Homeland Security, threatening with these riders that are dream killers for so many young people in America, that is unacceptable. I will stand on this floor as long as it takes to defend this DREAM Act and people such as Oscar Vazquez, who contribute to America and make it a better nation. I hope we will have bipartisan support for defeating the House of Representatives' riders that have been branded by the President as unacceptable and he will veto. I yield floor. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 9 (Tuesday, January 20, 2015)] [Senate] [Pages S251-S252] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY Mr. DURBIN.

I hope there are enough Senators on both sides of the aisle, 60-plus, who will stand up for the DREAMers of America. This is a test. It is a test as to whether we believe in fairness and justice and the value that immigrants such as Oscar Vazquez bring to the future of America. The House of Representatives just doesn't see it. They are blinded by their hatred for these immigrants, and they continue to pass these mean-spirited amendments. We can do better. We must do better as a nation. Let us stand up for the DREAMers, and let us all be dedicated to passing comprehensive immigration reform. Our immigration laws are broken. Our system is broken. It is time for us to accept our responsibility and repair it. We passed a bill a year and a half ago on the floor of the Senate with 68 votes--14 Republicans--Republicans and Democrats voted for it and sent it over to the House of Representatives and it languished for a year and a half. They refused to even call it or consider it. Our immigration system is still broken. Withholding money from the Department of Homeland Security, threatening with these riders that are dream killers for so many young people in America, that is unacceptable. I will stand on this floor as long as it takes to defend this DREAM Act and people such as Oscar Vazquez, who contribute to America and make it a better nation. I hope we will have bipartisan support for defeating the House of Representatives' riders that have been branded by the President as unacceptable and he will veto. I yield floor. ____________________","Congressional Record, Volume 161 Issue 9 (Tuesday, January 20, 2015) [Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 9 (Tuesday, January 20, 2015)] [Senate] [Pages S251-S252] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY Mr. DURBIN. The last point I would like to make relates to a motion that was made this morning by the majority leader. It was related to the appropriations bill for the Department of Homeland Security. Why are we bringing up this appropriations bill at this moment? Because when we agreed last December to fund our government, the Republicans in the House insisted we carve out the Department of Homeland Security and not give it its regular budget, instead give it emergency spending, a continuing resolution. This is not the way to run any department of government, certainly not the Department of Homeland Security. Why is it important to fund this department? One need only look to what has happened in the last few days in Paris to understand that the threat of terrorism to the world is still very real. One of our first lines of defense when it comes to terrorism is our Department of Homeland Security. There is no excuse for us to be dealing with this continuing resolution to fund this department. They should have the resources they need to keep America safe, but instead what has happened is this: The House of Representatives last week said they will only agree to fund this department properly if they can provide certain riders and changes in the law as part of it. I would tell you that the change that has been proposed by the House of Representatives is unacceptable. The President has said he is going to veto it if it is sent to his desk, and I totally support his position. Here is what they have come up with in the House of Representatives. If you are familiar with the DREAM Act, which I introduced in Congress 14 years ago, it says: If a young person is brought to the United States at an early age, parents making the decision to come to this country, and that young person grows up in the United States, finishes high school, no serious criminal problems, willing to go forward to higher education or to the military, we will give them a chance of becoming legal in America. That is the DREAM Act. It has been considered and passed on the floor of the Senate, considered and passed on the floor of the House but never in the same session, and so it is not the law of the land. President Obama, a little over 2 years ago, came out with an Executive order program known as DACA. DACA said to these young people who would qualify under this law: If you will come forward and register with our government, if you will pay the filing fee, if you will allow us to do the background check, we will allow you to stay, go to school, and work in America and not be deported. Six hundred thousand young people have come forward. We estimate there are some 2 million eligible, and 600,000 have come forward. Thirty thousand are from my State of Illinois. Who are these young people? Let me introduce you to one of them, Oscar Vazquez. Oscar Vazquez grew up in Phoenix, AZ. His mother and father brought him to that city from Mexico, and he was undocumented. He attended Carl Hayden High School in Phoenix. He was a member of the Junior ROTC. His goal was to serve in the U.S. Army. When he went to the recruiter to sign up, the recruiter said: I need your birth certificate. Oscar said: Come on. We are fighting a war. Can't you look the other way and just let me join? He said: No, young man. You don't have the proper documents. You can't enlist in the U.S. Army. He was despondent because that was his goal. He went home and got engaged in another project which is the subject of a new movie called ``Spare Parts,'' which George Lopez produced, directed, and starred in, which I saw last week. I will not give away the whole story, but I can tell you this: Oscar Vazquez and three other students at Carl Hayden High School entered into an underwater robotics competition. They competed with colleges such as MIT and they won. Their high school team won the underwater robotics competition. The talented young man, Oscar, said: I am going to Arizona State University. Without any government assistance, he graduated with a degree in mechanical engineering. After he got his degree and a wife and a baby, he [[Page S252]] said: Now I have to get right with America. I have to resolve this issue of being undocumented. That means Oscar decided to move back to Mexico. He was living in Mexico--the law required him to stay there for 10 years. That is how the law is written. He petitioned the United States for a chance to come back in. Eventually he was given a waiver. Oscar Vazquez came back, became a citizen of the United States of America, and the first thing he did was enlist in the U.S. Army. He went into combat in Afghanistan, and he came home after having served our Nation honorably and now is working for a major railroad in the State of Montana, with his wife and children. That is the story of one DREAMer, one DREAMer who was given a chance and has made a difference in America. He not only served in our military, but he had a degree in mechanical engineering. He is going to be a job creator, a job builder himself. So what do the House Republicans want to do to people such as Oscar Vazquez? Deport them. That is exactly what they called for. They are dream killers. That isn't right. We ought to give Oscar, young men and women just like him a chance to succeed and a chance to make America better. I have stood on this floor over 50 times with color photographs such as this one by my side and told the stories of DREAMers. This last weekend I was in Chicago and six of them came forward and told their stories. Each and every one of them had a compelling reason for us to defeat this mean-spirited amendment that came out of the House of Representatives. The President will veto it if it gets to his desk, but I hope we will do better in the Senate. I hope there are enough Senators on both sides of the aisle, 60-plus, who will stand up for the DREAMers of America. This is a test. It is a test as to whether we believe in fairness and justice and the value that immigrants such as Oscar Vazquez bring to the future of America. The House of Representatives just doesn't see it. They are blinded by their hatred for these immigrants, and they continue to pass these mean-spirited amendments. We can do better. We must do better as a nation.

On a separate topic, late last night I returned from Havana, Cuba, with Senator Patrick Leahy, Senator Stabenow, Senator Whitehouse, Congressman Van Hollen, and Congressman Welch of Vermont. It was a whirlwind trip. In a matter of 2 days we had a number of visits with a variety of different people in Havana. They included government officials. Bruno Rodriguez, who is the Foreign Minister of the Cuban Government; we had a lengthy meeting with him yesterday. We had a meeting with about 10 different Ambassadors to Cuba from foreign countries. We met as well with a dozen reformers or dissidents, opponents of the current Castro regime in Cuba, and had individual meetings with ministries. This was a productive and important delegation trip, important because starting tomorrow we are going to have face-to-face negotiations in Havana between the United States and Cuba pursuant to President Obama's December 17 announcement. We are setting out to change the foreign policy of the United States as it regards Cuba. It is time for change. For over 50 years we have been committed to a policy of exclusion, believing if we had embargoes and blockades we could force internal change in Cuba. The policy failed. The Castro brothers still reign, and life in Cuba is not what we want to see. What the President has said is let's engage them at a different level, a constructive level where we try to find ways to open the Cuban economy and Cuban society. That, to me, is the best course. It isn't just a theory that is the best course, it has been proven. When the Soviet Empire came to an end, what happened to the Warsaw Pact nations allied with the Soviet Union? They opened their doors to the West, they saw what they could anticipate to be part of their life in the future, and they made the conscious choice to move toward democracy, to move toward a free market economy. I think the same can happen in Cuba. One young man came to speak to us. He had gotten in trouble because he challenged the Cuban Government. They put him back on a pig farm to work, but he was still determined to aspire to a better place in Cuba in the future. He said to us: What President Obama's announcement has done is to pull the blanket off the caged bird in Cuba. Those of us who live in Cuba are still in the cage of communism, but we can see out now about opportunities and a future. That, I believe, is part of what the President's new policy is all about. When we were discussing our current blockade with Cuba with their leadership, we learned that powdered milk comes to Cuban citizens from New Zealand--halfway around the world--when there is an ample supply in the United States. What we are trying to do is to not only open the Cuban economy to powdered milk but to the power of ideas, the exchange of values, the belief that if the Cuban people see a better model for their future, they will gravitate toward that model. This negotiation which opens this week is the beginning of this conversation. The President is moving in areas of trade and travel, as we hope he will do, to expand these opportunities, but we have to do our part in Congress. As contentious and spirited as the debate may be about changing our policy in Cuba, it wasn't that long ago that we stood on the floor of the Senate and considered establishing diplomatic relations with Vietnam. There were some with fresh memories of all we had lost, over 40,000 American lives in Vietnam, who said we shouldn't have a normal relationship with what is a repressive regime in a country we just concluded a war with. Others with cooler minds prevailed, and we established diplomatic relations and I think to the betterment of both nations. Let us move forward, not forsaking our principles, not turning our back on our belief that the Cuban society should be more open, fair, and legitimized by the voters at the polls but believing we can work with this country as we have with others around the world, even when we disagree with their form of government and their practices, to try to strive to reach that democratic ideal. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 9 (Tuesday, January 20, 2015)] [Senate] [Page S251] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] CUBA Mr. DURBIN.

CREC-2015-01-20-pt1-PgS252-3,CREC-2015-01-20,114,REMEMBERING PAT GRAY,"[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 9 (Tuesday, January 20, 2015)] [Senate] [Pages S252-S253] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] REMEMBERING PAT GRAY Mrs. McCASKILL. Mr. President, people who work in politics sometimes suffer a bad image. People who run for office, obviously, sometimes suffer a bad image. But sometimes even worse is the image that what we call the political handlers have--those people who have made a career of professionally helping people get elected. They are seen as ruthless, as hired guns, as aggressive, even soulless, unprincipled. I am here to talk about one of those political operatives, but this political operative was special. This political operative was my friend. He was principled, he was brave, but most of all he was a patriot. Pat Gray passed away very recently and he will be missed. Pat grew up in Oklahoma. After serving 4 years in the Navy, he moved to Kansas City where he took a job with the Kansas City Power and Light Company. He also became very active in the Jaycees. He found that work as part of the Jaycee organization was exhilarating. He had his first taste of working on campaigns to improve the community and he was hooked. Very quickly he moved into advertising. That advertising job then morphed into working on political campaigns. Pat made his bones in 1982 as a political consultant when he took on the city incumbent county executive in Jackson County, MO. Jackson County is the county where the person who used to have this desk is from, Harry Truman. Jackson County is the county that contains Kansas City. It was then and still is a place where Democrats do well. So for Pat Gray to take on a candidate to be a sitting incumbent county executive was quite brave because, as I am sure the Presiding Officer understands, politics is rough locally. When someone takes on a powerful person in the predominating party in a community, there is usually a price to pay, but Pat was not deterred. His candidate, Bill Waris, beat that sitting county executive, Dale Baumgardner, in 1982. The following year Pat was hired in an important mayoral campaign where he was also successful, electing the Kansas City mayor. Pat was low key, but he was aggressive. Pat had little ego but lots of laser- like strategy. He was very easy going, but he was very hard on his opponents. As one Kansas Citian put it after Pat had passed away: Pat slid into second with his spikes in the air. So you either had to make a very good throw or get out of the way. That was his style, very hands-on. He wanted to win badly. Pat was instrumental in electing the first woman as Jackson County executive, the first woman as Jackson County prosecutor--my campaign for that office in 1992--and the first woman as mayor of Kansas City. He helped to elect mayors, legislators, city council members, too many for me to name, too many campaigns, too many candidates. Nine out of ten times he was successful. He helped me throughout my career. I remember vividly in 1990, when I was running for the county legislature, his coming to my home in Coleman Highlands with a camera and shooting a commercial with me sitting on my living room couch, just the two of us. He became a trusted advisor and my dear friend until his death. As I stand at the very desk Harry Truman used in the Senate, I stand here in part because of his help and his loyalty. I will be reaching for the phone to call Pat Gray countless times in the coming years. While he helped many candidates, including me, it was on community issues that his record was particularly impressive. The e-tax renewal in Kansas City, which many thought had no chance, Pat successfully steered; the renewal and invigoration of our sports complex in Kansas City, the home of the division champion Kansas City Royals and our Kansas City Chiefs. Pat Gray strategized a brilliant campaign to revitalize downtown Kansas City through the building of a major sports arena, which has now resulted in blocks and blocks of revitalization. In fact, real estate in Kansas City--residential real estate in downtown Kansas City--is now a hot ticket in large part because of Pat Gray; the very first area transportation tax, which gave a lifeline to thousands of Kansas Citians in the urban center, allowing them to find that way to get to work; a property tax for indigent care at Truman Medical Center. Can you imagine anything that might be more difficult to pass? Asking people to pay more property taxes to help care for the poor who were turning up in the emergency room at our major local hospital, Pat Gray did that; additional tax moneys for both police and [[Page S253]] fire and an issue very near and dear to my heart. He helped me renew the community antidrug tax in Kansas City, which has been so instrumental in doing research and development on the antidrug strategies that work--not just more police, not just more prosecutors, not just more jail space but also prevention and treatment. Pat Gray was there helping me as we started one of the very first drug courts in the country in Kansas City, as a result of his help with the COMBAT tax initiative. Pat adored his family. His wife Brenda always patient and smiling, he really adored Brenda. She climbed into the roller coaster with Pat Gray in the late 1970s. While she had to hold on hard during part of the ride, there was never any question that they were a team and she was his rock. His children, Christopher, Donna, and Lauren, he was their guiding light and they were his pride and joy. Pat loved this country. He loved his family. He loved his city. He loved his friends and he loved his work. But most of all, he loved this country. Pat's biggest secret, as a sometimes rough-and-tumble political brawler: he was an idealist who was inspired every day by our grand and glorious democracy. He had deep respect for the system he worked within. He understood that in America a good idea is sometimes enough; a good idea helped along by a professional consultant who was a patriot. We will miss you, Pat Gray. We will miss you, Pat Gray, the patriot. I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.

CREC-2015-01-20-pt1-PgS253,CREC-2015-01-20,114,KEYSTONE XL PIPELINE,"[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 9 (Tuesday, January 20, 2015)] [Senate] [Page S253] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] KEYSTONE XL PIPELINE Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, this morning I rise in support of two amendments that will make it clear to the American people exactly what this bill to authorize the Keystone XL Pipeline is all about and whom our Republican friends from across the aisle are trying to help. The amendments offered by Senators Markey and Franken would ensure that the pipeline benefits the American consumer and the American economy. Without them, the bill to authorize the pipeline will benefit narrow special interests, such as foreign oil companies, not hard- working Americans. We have heard from several of my friends on the other side of the aisle, including the lead sponsor, that the Keystone bill is a jobs bill and an energy bill. That may be true, but without Senator Markey's amendment it is nothing but a Canadian energy bill, and without Senator Franken's amendment it is a paltry jobs bill. First, on energy, in short, the Keystone bill will allow one Canadian company to use the United States as a middleman to ship oil to the highest bidder abroad. The Canadian oil company, TransCanada, refuses to commit to keeping the crude oil or the refined products in America. Canadian tar sands oil is already traveling through gulf coast refineries on its way to foreign markets, and, as the Wall Street Journal has reported, much of the crude oil that would flow through the Keystone XL Pipeline would ultimately be exported as refined product. Why not add to this bill a requirement that any oil products transported through the Keystone XL Pipeline be consumed in America? Plain and simple, that is exactly what Senator Markey's amendment would do. If Republicans are serious about improving our energy security, they will support Senator Markey's amendment. Second, let's talk about whether this is a real jobs bill. Republicans and supporters of the project like to cite that building the pipeline will support American industries and American jobs in iron and steel, but a 2011 analysis by Cornell University found that 50 percent or more of the steel pipe will be manufactured outside the United States. It is no wonder that even the most optimistic job projections about the Keystone Pipeline are a drop in the bucket compared to just 1 month of job growth in our country. In the final tally, the State Department report says it will create only 35 permanent jobs. Why not guarantee in the bill that U.S.-made iron, steel, and manufactured goods be used to build the pipeline? That is exactly what Democrats have offered in an amendment worked out by Senators Franken and Wyden. These amendments should be bipartisan. Republicans have supported several measures in the past. I know many of my Republican colleagues voted to ban the export of oil drilled in the ANWR in Alaska. I hope they will join us on this amendment as well. If Republicans oppose us, they will be making it crystal clear to Americans that they are on the side of narrow special interests instead of on the side of America's middle class. They will be supporting special interests over American jobs. Let me be clear. We think the Keystone Pipeline should not be built, and there are several reasons for that, among them that the pipeline may accelerate global climate change. Tar sands oil is far dirtier than conventional crude oil. Democrats would much rather see an energy bill that promotes clean energy sources such as solar and wind, industries which create far more jobs, both construction and manufacturing, using far cleaner energy than the pipeline. Why not have a policy that produces many more jobs with the cleanest of energy rather than very few jobs with the dirtiest energy on the North American continent? But if Keystone is going to be built, we think it shouldn't only benefit Canadian oil companies and overseas steel manufacturers but should actually benefit average families and the American worker. To conclude, I note that instead of a real energy bill or a real jobs bill or a real infrastructure bill or immigration or any bill to address the greatest problems facing our country at the moment--the decline in middle-class incomes and the lack of middle-class jobs--for their first proposed action in the 114th Congress, S. 1, Republicans have chosen a permit for a foreign oil company that would create 35 permanent jobs. This is not an opening with a bang; this is an opening with a whimper. It is like leading off a new baseball game with a bunt. Democrats can't change what bills Republicans put on the calendar, but our amendments will show a clear and stark contrast if Republicans vote no. On these amendments and more, Republicans are going to have to make a choice: Will they continue to fight for narrow special interests or will they work with Democrats to advance America's middle class by creating more jobs and putting more money in the pockets of American families? Time and these votes will tell. I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. THUNE. Mr. President. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Without them, the bill to authorize the pipeline will benefit narrow special interests, such as foreign oil companies, not hard- working Americans. We have heard from several of my friends on the other side of the aisle, including the lead sponsor, that the Keystone bill is a jobs bill and an energy bill. That may be true, but without Senator Markey's amendment it is nothing but a Canadian energy bill, and without Senator Franken's amendment it is a paltry jobs bill. First, on energy, in short, the Keystone bill will allow one Canadian company to use the United States as a middleman to ship oil to the highest bidder abroad. The Canadian oil company, TransCanada, refuses to commit to keeping the crude oil or the refined products in America. Canadian tar sands oil is already traveling through gulf coast refineries on its way to foreign markets, and, as the Wall Street Journal has reported, much of the crude oil that would flow through the Keystone XL Pipeline would ultimately be exported as refined product. Why not add to this bill a requirement that any oil products transported through the Keystone XL Pipeline be consumed in America? Plain and simple, that is exactly what Senator Markey's amendment would do. If Republicans are serious about improving our energy security, they will support Senator Markey's amendment. Second, let's talk about whether this is a real jobs bill. Republicans and supporters of the project like to cite that building the pipeline will support American industries and American jobs in iron and steel, but a 2011 analysis by Cornell University found that 50 percent or more of the steel pipe will be manufactured outside the United States. It is no wonder that even the most optimistic job projections about the Keystone Pipeline are a drop in the bucket compared to just 1 month of job growth in our country. In the final tally, the State Department report says it will create only 35 permanent jobs. Why not guarantee in the bill that U.S.-made iron, steel, and manufactured goods be used to build the pipeline? That is exactly what Democrats have offered in an amendment worked out by Senators Franken and Wyden. These amendments should be bipartisan. Republicans have supported several measures in the past. I know many of my Republican colleagues voted to ban the export of oil drilled in the ANWR in Alaska. I hope they will join us on this amendment as well. If Republicans oppose us, they will be making it crystal clear to Americans that they are on the side of narrow special interests instead of on the side of America's middle class. They will be supporting special interests over American jobs. Let me be clear. We think the Keystone Pipeline should not be built, and there are several reasons for that, among them that the pipeline may accelerate global climate change. Tar sands oil is far dirtier than conventional crude oil. Democrats would much rather see an energy bill that promotes clean energy sources such as solar and wind, industries which create far more jobs, both construction and manufacturing, using far cleaner energy than the pipeline. Why not have a policy that produces many more jobs with the cleanest of energy rather than very few jobs with the dirtiest energy on the North American continent? But if Keystone is going to be built, we think it shouldn't only benefit Canadian oil companies and overseas steel manufacturers but should actually benefit average families and the American worker. To conclude, I note that instead of a real energy bill or a real jobs bill or a real infrastructure bill or immigration or any bill to address the greatest problems facing our country at the moment--the decline in middle-class incomes and the lack of middle-class jobs--for their first proposed action in the 114th Congress, S. 1, Republicans have chosen a permit for a foreign oil company that would create 35 permanent jobs. This is not an opening with a bang; this is an opening with a whimper. It is like leading off a new baseball game with a bunt. Democrats can't change what bills Republicans put on the calendar, but our amendments will show a clear and stark contrast if Republicans vote no. On these amendments and more, Republicans are going to have to make a choice: Will they continue to fight for narrow special interests or will they work with Democrats to advance America's middle class by creating more jobs and putting more money in the pockets of American families? Time and these votes will tell. I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. THUNE. Mr. President. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. ____________________","Congressional Record, Volume 161 Issue 9 (Tuesday, January 20, 2015) [Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 9 (Tuesday, January 20, 2015)] [Senate] [Page S253] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] KEYSTONE XL PIPELINE Mr. SCHUMER.

CREC-2015-01-20-pt1-PgS253-2,CREC-2015-01-20,114,THE ECONOMY,"[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 9 (Tuesday, January 20, 2015)] [Senate] [Pages S253-S254] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] THE ECONOMY Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, tonight the President of the United States will lay out his agenda for the year, but unfortunately it sounds as if much of it will be a rehash of the same stale, top-down ideas Democrats have been trotting out for the past 6 years: more taxes, more spending, more regulation--in other words, more government. If Democrats could sum up their agenda in one phrase, it would be ``government knows best.'' But the past 6 years have very clearly demonstrated that government does not know best. The past 6 years of the Obama economy have not been kind to American families. It is time for new ideas. It is time to change the focus from building up government to building up people. Americans need more jobs, better wages, and lower costs for health care, education, and energy, and the Republicans' priority is meeting those challenges. We want to rebuild the economy from the ground up and increase economic opportunity for every American. [[Page S254]] Tonight the President will talk about helping middle-class families, and Republicans are pleased to see the President pivoting back to middle-class concerns--something Republicans have never looked away from. We hope President Obama is serious about wanting to work with Republicans to address the challenges facing the middle class, but it is a little hard to take the President seriously when he is talking about helping middle-class families while simultaneously issuing veto threats for bills that would benefit them. Within the past 2 weeks, the President has issued veto threats for two bills that would help create jobs for middle-class families--a bill to fix ObamaCare's 30-hour workweek provision, which is affecting employees' hours and wages, and a bill to approve the Keystone Pipeline. The House passed both of these bills earlier this month, and the Senate is currently in the process of considering the Keystone legislation. If it weren't for the President's veto threat, Keystone XL could be approved in the next few weeks, but thanks to the President, the future of the pipeline is still in doubt. The Keystone XL Pipeline is supported by bipartisan majorities in both Houses of Congress. Six of the Senate Keystone bill's original sponsors are Democrats. The American people support the pipeline. Unions--a traditionally Democratic constituency--support the pipeline because their members want the jobs the pipeline would create. In fact, a number of unions sent letters just this month reiterating their support for the pipeline. This is what James P. Hoffa, president of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, said: The Teamsters Union continues to believe that the Keystone XL pipeline will contribute to enhanced energy security, economic prosperity, and, of critical importance, the creation of good-paying jobs. Those aren't Republican talking points; that is a letter from James Hoffa, president of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters. Edwin D. Hill, president of the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, said something similar: At a time when job creation should be a top priority, the Keystone XL Pipeline project will put Americans back to work and have ripple benefits throughout the economy. During construction the project is expected to support at least 42,000 jobs and contribute $3.4 billion to the U.S. Gross Domestic Product. Again, that is from Edwin D. Hill, president of the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers. Yet, despite all this support, President Obama is willing to turn his back on American workers to appease the only people who seem to oppose the pipeline; that is, members of the far-left environmental wing of the Democratic Party. Over the years, the President has offered various excuses for why he is not yet ready to approve the pipeline. He has cited environmental concerns. The only problem with that, of course, is that the President's own State Department has stated the project will have minimal impact on the environment. The President has also cited the court case over the pipeline's Nebraska route as a reason for waiting on the pipeline approval. Well, as of a week and a half ago that excuse is gone. The Nebraska Supreme Court has now upheld the pipeline's route. The administration responded by reiterating the President's veto threat. President Obama has tried to minimize the impact of the pipeline delays by diminishing the importance of the jobs the pipeline would create. He has repeatedly mentioned that most of the jobs the pipeline would create would be temporary. Well, tell that to a construction worker who is looking for a job. Does the President oppose all infrastructure projects because some of the jobs they create are temporary? Or does he just oppose projects when the jobs they create are opposed by the fringe elements of his party? The Keystone XL Pipeline will be a boon to our economy and to American workers. The President's own State Department has stated that the pipeline would support more than 42,000 jobs during construction and contribute $3.4 billion to the economy. In my home State of South Dakota the pipeline will support 3,000 to 4,000 jobs during construction and generate over $100 million in earnings, according to the President's State Department. These are not my figures. These are figures from the President's own State Department. Keystone will bring in millions of dollars in State and local taxes for a host of local priorities--from schools to law enforcement to roads and bridges. In addition to providing jobs and generating revenue for State and local governments, the Keystone XL Pipeline will also help America's farmers get their goods to the market. Rail backlogs this fall left too many farmers struggling to ship their harvests. Keystone XL would help alleviate future backlogs by taking 100,000 barrels of North Dakota and Montana oil off the rails, which would free up substantial space for farmers and for other rail shippers. Finally, the Keystone XL Pipeline will strengthen our energy security by reducing our dependence upon energy supplies from volatile countries. This increased energy security will also keep energy prices low for American families. Recent gas price reductions are largely due to increased North American energy development which has reduced our dependence on oil from countries such as Venezuela, Russia, and Iran. The Keystone XL Pipeline will help us continue to replace oil imports from volatile countries with our own oil and imports from our friend and ally Canada. That in turn will help keep American families' energy bills low. With energy bills accounting for more than a quarter of after-tax income for families making less than $30,000, lowering Americans' energy costs should be a priority. It is time for the President of the United States to fish or cut bait. Approving the Keystone XL Pipeline should be a no-brainer. Republicans support it, Democrats support it, unions support it, and the American people support it. The pipeline would create jobs. It would increase revenue for local governments. It would strengthen our energy security, and it would do all of this--all of this--without spending a dime of taxpayer money. President Obama can talk all he wants tonight about helping American workers and middle-class families, but it is his actions that will show whether he really means what he says. If the President is serious about helping middle-class families, if he is serious about standing with American workers, then he will approve the Keystone XL bill when it gets to his desk. Mr. President, I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Flake). The Senator from Arkansas. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 9 (Tuesday, January 20, 2015)] [Senate] [Pages S253-S254] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] THE ECONOMY Mr. THUNE.

Finally, the Keystone XL Pipeline will strengthen our energy security by reducing our dependence upon energy supplies from volatile countries. This increased energy security will also keep energy prices low for American families. Recent gas price reductions are largely due to increased North American energy development which has reduced our dependence on oil from countries such as Venezuela, Russia, and Iran. The Keystone XL Pipeline will help us continue to replace oil imports from volatile countries with our own oil and imports from our friend and ally Canada. That in turn will help keep American families' energy bills low. With energy bills accounting for more than a quarter of after-tax income for families making less than $30,000, lowering Americans' energy costs should be a priority. It is time for the President of the United States to fish or cut bait. Approving the Keystone XL Pipeline should be a no-brainer. Republicans support it, Democrats support it, unions support it, and the American people support it. The pipeline would create jobs. It would increase revenue for local governments. It would strengthen our energy security, and it would do all of this--all of this--without spending a dime of taxpayer money. President Obama can talk all he wants tonight about helping American workers and middle-class families, but it is his actions that will show whether he really means what he says. If the President is serious about helping middle-class families, if he is serious about standing with American workers, then he will approve the Keystone XL bill when it gets to his desk. Mr. President, I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Flake). The Senator from Arkansas. ____________________",package_114_126.csv,7895,7895,7964,"[congressional record volume 161, number 9 (tuesday, january 20, 2015)] [senate] [pages s253-s254] from the congressional record online through the government publishing office [ www.gpo.gov ] the economy mr. thune. mr. president, tonight the president of the united states will lay out his agenda for the year, but unfortunately it sounds as if much of it will be a rehash of the same stale, top-down ideas democrats have been trotting out for the past 6 years: more taxes, more spending, more regulation--in other words, more government. if democrats could sum up their agenda in one phrase, it would be ``government knows best.'' but the past 6 years have very clearly demonstrated that government does not know best. the past 6 years of the obama economy have not been kind to american families. it is time for new ideas. it is time to change the focus from building up government to building up people. americans need more jobs, better wages, and lower costs for health care, education, and energy, and the republicans' priority is meeting those challenges. we want to rebuild the economy from the ground up and increase economic opportunity for every american. [[page s254]] tonight the president will talk about helping middle-class families, and republicans are pleased to see the president pivoting back to middle-class concerns--something republicans have never looked away from. we hope president obama is serious about wanting to work with republicans to address the challenges facing the middle class, but it is a little hard to take the president seriously when he is talking about helping middle-class families while simultaneously issuing veto threats for bills that would benefit them. within the past 2 weeks, the president has issued veto threats for two bills that would help create jobs for middle-class families--a bill to fix obamacare's 30-hour workweek provision, which is affecting employees' hours and wages, and a bill to approve the keystone pipeline. the house passed both of these bills earlier this month, and the senate is currently in the process of considering the keystone legislation. if it weren't for the president's veto threat, keystone xl could be approved in the next few weeks, but thanks to the president, the future of the pipeline is still in doubt. the keystone xl pipeline is supported by bipartisan majorities in both houses of congress. six of the senate keystone bill's original sponsors are democrats. the american people support the pipeline. unions--a traditionally democratic constituency--support the pipeline because their members want the jobs the pipeline would create. in fact, a number of unions sent letters just this month reiterating their support for the pipeline. this is what james p. hoffa, president of the international brotherhood of teamsters, said: the teamsters union continues to believe that the keystone xl pipeline will contribute to enhanced energy security, economic prosperity, and, of critical importance, the creation of good-paying jobs. those aren't republican talking points; that is a letter from james hoffa, president of the international brotherhood of teamsters. edwin d. hill, president of the international brotherhood of electrical workers, said something similar: at a time when job creation should be a top priority, the keystone xl pipeline project will put americans back to work and have ripple benefits throughout the economy. during construction the project is expected to support at least 42,000 jobs and contribute $3.4 billion to the u.s. gross domestic product. again, that is from edwin d. hill, president of the international brotherhood of electrical workers. yet, despite all this support, president obama is willing to turn his back on american workers to appease the only people who seem to oppose the pipeline; that is, members of the far-left environmental wing of the democratic party. over the years, the president has offered various excuses for why he is not yet ready to approve the pipeline. he has cited environmental concerns. the only problem with that, of course, is that the president's own state department has stated the project will have minimal impact on the environment. the president has also cited the court case over the pipeline's nebraska route as a reason for waiting on the pipeline approval. well, as of a week and a half ago that excuse is gone. the nebraska supreme court has now upheld the pipeline's route. the administration responded by reiterating the president's veto threat. president obama has tried to minimize the impact of the pipeline delays by diminishing the importance of the jobs the pipeline would create. he has repeatedly mentioned that most of the jobs the pipeline would create would be temporary. well, tell that to a construction worker who is looking for a job. does the president oppose all infrastructure projects because some of the jobs they create are temporary? or does he just oppose projects when the jobs they create are opposed by the fringe elements of his party? the keystone xl pipeline will be a boon to our economy and to american workers. the president's own state department has stated that the pipeline would support more than 42,000 jobs during construction and contribute $3.4 billion to the economy. in my home state of south dakota the pipeline will support 3,000 to 4,000 jobs during construction and generate over $100 million in earnings, according to the president's state department. these are not my figures. these are figures from the president's own state department. keystone will bring in millions of dollars in state and local taxes for a host of local priorities--from schools to law enforcement to roads and bridges. in addition to providing jobs and generating revenue for state and local governments, the keystone xl pipeline will also help america's farmers get their goods to the market. rail backlogs this fall left too many farmers struggling to ship their harvests. keystone xl would help alleviate future backlogs by taking 100,000 barrels of north dakota and montana oil off the rails, which would free up substantial space for farmers and for other rail shippers. finally, the keystone xl pipeline will strengthen our energy security by reducing our dependence upon energy supplies from volatile countries. this increased energy security will also keep energy prices low for american families. recent gas price reductions are largely due to increased north american energy development which has reduced our dependence on oil from countries such as venezuela, russia, and iran. the keystone xl pipeline will help us continue to replace oil imports from volatile countries with our own oil and imports from our friend and ally canada. that in turn will help keep american families' energy bills low. with energy bills accounting for more than a quarter of after-tax income for families making less than $30,000, lowering americans' energy costs should be a priority. it is time for the president of the united states to fish or cut bait. approving the keystone xl pipeline should be a no-brainer. republicans support it, democrats support it, unions support it, and the american people support it. the pipeline would create jobs. it would increase revenue for local governments. it would strengthen our energy security, and it would do all of this--all of this--without spending a dime of taxpayer money. president obama can talk all he wants tonight about helping american workers and middle-class families, but it is his actions that will show whether he really means what he says. if the president is serious about helping middle-class families, if he is serious about standing with american workers, then he will approve the keystone xl bill when it gets to his desk. mr. president, i yield the floor. the presiding officer (mr. flake). the senator from arkansas. ____________________",7895

Mr. President, tonight we will gather in the House Chamber to listen to the President's State of the Union Address. This will be the first time in Barack Obama's Presidency that he delivers a State of the Union Address to a Republican-led House and Senate. Some see this as a prescription for gridlock. Others, including myself, see this as an opportunity for the executive branch and the legislative branch to work together to actually get some things done. There is recent precedent that shows this arrangement can work. In fact, it is a period of our history where an Arkansan played a huge role. During the final 6 years of Bill Clinton's Presidency, he faced the same situation as our current President. He worked with Republicans to reform the welfare system. He worked with Republicans to balance the budget--an accomplishment that hasn't been repeated since. He worked with Congress--not tried to go around them. Now, I don't expect us to always agree. There are stark ideological differences between President Obama and our Republican majority for which there is really no agreement to be had without one side or the other abandoning their principles, and certainly I do not intend to do that. I don't see the President doing that either. What I do hope is that the President will find common ground with not only Congress but the American people. When that happens, work gets done here. Even in the last Congress, with a Democratic majority in the Senate blocking almost everything in an effort to protect President Obama, we still had flashes of bipartisan agreement. We agreed on the new farm bill, which [[Page S255]] ensures the continued safety, affordability, and reliability of our food supply while achieving real savings in Federal spending. We reformed the VA to address the horrific wait times our veterans face while trying to receive the health care they earned. And we passed a spending agreement that brings discretionary spending to its lowest level in almost a decade and has a number of provisions that adhere to conservative principles. Both parties did not get everything they wanted in any of these instances, but the final product was the result of individuals coming from different starting points and arriving at the same finish line. That is what the American people want, but that takes an honest commitment from all parties involved. One way the President can show he is really ready to work with Congress is to abandon his misguided plan to circumvent Congress and grant amnesty to millions of illegal immigrants. I anticipate that President Obama will try tonight, once again, to defend his actions by blaming Congress for not passing immigration reform. The truth is everyone in this Chamber is eager to tackle immigration reform. The President is acting unilaterally because he knows Congress does not support his amnesty proposal. He knows the final product of our work will not include that provision. So he intends to go around Congress to get his way. Now the President seems intent to dig his heels in deeper by threatening to veto our efforts to defund his actions. This is just one of the veto threats President Obama has already issued just weeks into the new Congress. This start doesn't bode well for bipartisanship. I hope tonight's speech is light on the veto threats and heavy on the areas where we can find common agreement. I think those are plentiful, and I sincerely believe it is possible. A fair and simple tax system, creating jobs, and making Washington more efficient, effective and accountable--these are the issues that Americans want us to address and areas where compromise is possible.

CREC-2015-01-20-pt1-PgS255-2,CREC-2015-01-20,114,KEYSTONE XL PIPELINE ACT,"[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 9 (Tuesday, January 20, 2015)] [Senate] [Pages S255-S259] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] KEYSTONE XL PIPELINE ACT The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senate will resume consideration of S. 1, which the clerk will report. The bill clerk read as follows: A bill (S. 1) to approve the Keystone XL Pipeline. Pending: Murkowski amendment No. 2, in the nature of a substitute. Markey/Baldwin amendment No. 13 (to amendment No. 2), to ensure that oil transported through the Keystone XL Pipeline into the United States is used to reduce U.S. dependence on Middle Eastern oil. Portman/Shaheen amendment No. 3 (to amendment No. 2), to promote energy efficiency. Cantwell (for Franken) amendment No. 17 (to amendment No. 2), to require the use of iron, steel, and manufactured goods produced in the United States in the construction of the Keystone XL Pipeline and facilities. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska. Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, we are back on the bill before us, a measure that would allow for the permit to be approved to allow for construction of the Keystone XL Pipeline from Canada into the United States. We had good discussion last week, certainly on Friday. We have several amendments that are pending before the body. The Senator from Massachusetts has one on oil exports, Senator Portman on energy efficiency, and there is another measure sponsored by Senator Franken relating to American steel. Obviously, it is important that we begin to process these amendments because we have a significant amount of interest in the issues in front of us. At this point in time there are--we had over 50 filed amendments as of Friday evening. As of this morning, we maybe have more on deck. There is clearly a great deal of interest not only on Keystone XL but other energy-related amendments as well. As we work through finalizing the events for this afternoon, I would like to alert Members that we would like to have votes on at least the three pending amendments that are before us that I just mentioned, hopefully by midafternoon. We are aware the Senate will close early today because of the President's State of the Union this evening. So my hope is that we would be able to process these three. It has come to our attention that Senator Portman's amendment may need to be modified. He is in the process of doing that, and it may be that we will be able to accept that amendment this afternoon by voice vote. At this point in time, I would encourage Members to come to us as the floor managers here, and let's figure out how we can get these amendments pending before the Senate. On the Republican side we have three folks who are queued up ready to offer theirs when it is appropriate. As we had agreed last week, we will go from side to side in terms of the amendments that will be considered. Hopefully this will be the beginning of a good, constructive week as we turn to regular order here in the Senate processing amendments. With that, I would turn to my colleague on the energy committee, Senator Cantwell, for any comments she might care to make. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington. Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, just to reiterate our opposition to this legislation, new polling has come out showing that the American public really does--over 60 percent--support going through a normal process and not subverting what are environmental laws. But we are going to move forward in getting this legislation voted on. My colleague just outlined a process for this afternoon. So I would encourage Members to come to the floor to offer their amendments. I know Senator Franken is coming to speak on his amendment, and I see the Senator from Massachusetts here to speak on his amendment. So hopefully while they are speaking we can get a vote schedule firmed up and talk about other amendments besides the three we have pending. But I would agree with the Senator from Alaska that Members should come down here and talk on their amendments and we should keep the process moving. With that, I am not sure who is queued up to speak. Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I believe the sponsor of this legislation, Senator Hoeven, would like to address the Chamber for a few minutes this afternoon not only on the amendments that are pending but the bigger picture of Keystone XL. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington. Ms. CANTWELL. May I inquire of the Senator from Alaska and Senator Hoeven how long he intends to speak to make sure our colleague from Massachusetts knows he has his time before we get locked out for lunch? The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota. Mr. HOEVEN. Mr. President, my inquiry would be: How much time does the Senator from Massachusetts need? I would be willing to defer my time until later, as long as I know I would have approximately 10 minutes before the hard break of 12:30 p.m. Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I would think that if it is OK to allow the Senator from Massachusetts to proceed, knowing that our hard stop is 12:30 p.m., that at least--I would make this request: that both Senators be allowed to speak for 10 minutes, starting [[Page S256]] with Senator Markey, followed by Senator Hoeven. If they want to extend their remarks, they can make a unanimous consent request to do so. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The Senator from Massachusetts. Mr. MARKEY. May I ask a parliamentary inquiry. It would be this. Is it possible for me to speak for 5 minutes, then reserve the remainder of my time and have the Senator from North Dakota speak, and then I can reclaim the remainder of my time? The PRESIDING OFFICER. That will take unanimous consent. Mr. HOEVEN. I have no objection. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The Senator from Massachusetts. Amendment No. 13 Mr. MARKEY. Mr. President, we are about to engage in a historic debate; that is, over whether the Canadians--a Canadian oil company-- should be allowed to take the dirtiest oil in the world, the Canadian tar sands oil, to have the United States accede to the construction of a pipeline, like a straw through our country, which would then go down to the Gulf of Mexico, with no promise from the Canadians that they will not export the oil from the United States. So the issue which is raised, of course, is what is in it for the United States, since there is a very small number of jobs for our country once the pipeline is completed? We understand why the Canadian company wants to do this. If they can get that oil out onto the global marketplace, using the United States as the conduit, they can get a dramatically higher price for that oil. We understand their motivation. But what is in it for the United States of America? Ultimately, we have to decide what is in our best interests. My amendment says that if this pipeline is constructed, the oil stays here, our country gets the benefit, and our consumers get the benefit. Otherwise, it is not about energy independence; it is not about North American energy independence. It is about a Canadian company exporting the oil, using the United States as a conduit, as a straw, as a pipeline. That is it. What is in it for us? The American people right now are enjoying historically low oil prices. They love it. It is like a tax cut to every American. If this Canadian oil gets exported, you better believe it is going to act as a spur to raise the price of oil. The more oil that is here, the better for us. The more oil that leaves our country, the worse for us. I will give you another number, if you want to know, because this is a Canadian export pipeline. The United States of America right now is the leading importing country for oil in the world. We are No. 1. We import net about 5 million barrels of oil a day. We are No. 1. We are the No. 1 importing country. Then comes China, then comes India, then Japan. Five million barrels a day--how can we be exporting oil when we are the leading importer of oil? What countries do we import the oil from today, 2015? We import the oil from Saudi Arabia, from Venezuela, from Iraq, from Russia, from Nigeria. How can we be exporting our young men and women in uniform over to the Middle East in order to protect these ships coming in with oil in them and simultaneously be exporting oil out of the United States, while we are still importing 5 million barrels of oil a day? That is what this debate is all about. It does not make any sense. This is the dirtiest oil in the world. This oil is going to dangerously add to the warming of the planet. The Canadian--the American Petroleum Institute will not promise the oil stays here, even though their ads on TV say that it is all about North American energy independence. So we have a huge choice we have to make here. Do we want to help our economy? Do we want to help our national security, help our consumers, help our manufacturers by giving them this lower price of energy--which except for labor is the No. 1 component in industry in the United States--and keep that price low? The Markey amendment says: Yes, that oil stays here in the United States of America for our own strength, our own economy, our own consumers, our own job creation, and will not be sent off onto the world so the Canadian oil company can get a much higher price for that oil while we take all of the risk. We would not be Uncle Sam, we would be Uncle Sucker if we did not keep that oil here. I reserve the remainder of my time. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota. Mr. HOEVEN. Mr. President, I appreciate this opportunity to engage in a discussion with my colleague from Massachusetts on the important issues. He has raised several issues in regard to oil export and then also in regard to the environmental aspects. If I could take a minute to address both of those, for starters, I would point out that it is interesting that the Senator, my good friend from Massachusetts, is opposed to this pipeline project and talks about our need to import oil, and therefore we should not allow any exports, because we need to import oil. Yet he is opposed to a project that would not only bring Canadian oil to our country, 830,000 barrels a day, but also would help us move 100,000 barrels of oil a day from my State of North Dakota and my neighboring State of Montana--light sweet Bakken crude. So he objects to that, and he talks about our need to import oil. The irony here is that if he is successful and he and the other critics or opponents of this pipeline and the infrastructure are successful, then what Canada will do is they will build a pipeline to the west coast of Canada, and they will export that oil to China--100 percent of it. So it appears that his argument is that because some portion of this oil may be exported if we build the pipeline, somehow it is better to force Canada to export 100 percent of it to China. Now, I do not begin to understand that argument. So if we cannot have 100 percent--every single drop--stay here, then we are better off to send all 100 percent to China. That is my opponent's argument. I do not understand it. It does not make sense to me. The second point I would like to make is if he goes to the environmental impact statement issued by the Obama State Department, the environmental impact statement says that the oil would be used in the United States. If he looks at the Obama administration's Department of Energy report, he will see that the report also indicates that this oil is going to be used in the United States. Now, that does not mean that we use every drop of it. I will give you some statistics. The United States retains 99 percent of all crude oil within the country that we produce. The United States uses 97 percent of the gasoline that we refine in this country. So, remember, this oil comes to refineries in Patoka, IL, and to the gulf coast. It goes to Cushing, and it gets refined. The statistics are that we use 97 percent of that gasoline from oil that is refined in our country. The other thing I would point out is that the oil that comes in on this pipeline, along with the crude that comes from the Bakken, is both Canadian and domestic oil. That cannot be exported without approval from the Secretary of Commerce of the Obama administration. So here again, my good friend from Massachusetts is putting forth an amendment that absolutely no oil in this one pipeline can be exported at any time to anywhere from the country, yet they already have provisions in law that it cannot be exported without the Secretary of Commerce's approval. The Secretary of Commerce is appointed by President Obama. So, again, if you look at the administration's own reports, and they have been done over more than 6 years that this project has been pending--the administration now has had 6 years to review this project, has done so, and has produced five environmental impact statements. The conclusion of those environmental impact statements is ``no significant environmental impact.'' That is the administration's own environmental impact statements produced by the State Department. But after 6 years, they have come out and said: This oil will be used here, and to be exported, it would have to be approved by the Secretary of Commerce, as other oil exports are handled in this country. Furthermore, if we do not build the pipeline, it is either all going to be sent to China--so then we would not get any of it--or we are going to have to move it via railcars--1,400 railcars a day, creating more congestion on our railways. [[Page S257]] So at this point, I would inquire as to how much time I have used of my 10 minutes. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has used 5 minutes. Mr. HOEVEN. At this point, I would yield back to my good friend from Massachusetts. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts. Mr. MARKEY. I thank the Senator very much. Year 2014 has just been reported by NASA as the single warmest year ever recorded in the history of the planet, going back to the earliest records. You do not have to be a detective to figure out what is going on. The world is dangerously warming. The United States can no longer preach temperance from a bar stool and tell the rest of the world they should be better while we continue to burn these fuels. But if they are going to build this pipeline, at least the American people should be the beneficiaries of the Canadian activity to sell all of this oil out onto the global market. What we are being told is: No, we do not want any restrictions. We do not want there to be any way in which we can keep that oil here, to keep prices at least low for the American consumer and for American job creation, to keep oil here so we can maybe back out the Saudi Arabian oil, maybe back out the Kuwaiti oil, maybe back out the Russian oil that we are importing right now as we sit here. But we are being told we cannot do that. We are being told the Republican leadership thinks that is a bad idea. When I asked the head of the TransCanada pipeline in the hearing if he agree to keep the oil in the United States, he just looked at me and said no. So this is what is going on. What happens for the American consumer? Well, I will tell you what happens. It is a very simple formula. Every time there is a $10 increase in the price of a barrel of oil, it knocks two-tenths of a point to three-tenths of a percentage point off of the growth rate of the American economy. When Americans pay less for American oil and we import less foreign oil, consumers have more money in their pockets from that discounted American oil. That is like a direct economic stimulus for middle-class families and small businesses across the country. Analysts say the drop in oil prices will give hundreds of billions back to consumers and other parts of our economy. Every penny reduction in gas prices translates into $1 billion in consumer savings. So when the polling is done on this issue and the American people are asked if they would support the exportation of American oil, by a 3-to- 1 margin people say, all across the country, regardless of party: No, do not export it. Keep that oil here to make America stronger here at home. That is not Democrat. That is not Republican. That is not Independent. That is all people being polled across the board. That is just common sense because they know the more oil we export, the higher the prices are going to be for consumers here because we have less oil. This is a simple debate. The planet is running a fever. There are no emergency rooms for planets. We have to engage in preventive care. The Republican leadership thinks they have the votes in order to pass this bill which will dangerously warm the planet. My amendment says if that is going to be the case--and I am not voting for that bill--at least let's keep the oil here, at least let's get the benefit for consumers so we keep prices low for gasoline, prices low for home heating oil, prices low for jet fuel, prices low for diesel. Let's keep the oil here, let's get the benefit in our economy, and let's not allow oil companies to set the agenda. The Republican leadership keeps saying it is all of the above. Ladies and gentlemen, this bill basically says: No. No, it is oil above all. That is what it is all about. It is not even oil that is necessarily going to stay in the United States, so it is a very simple argument I am making. We import 5 million barrels of oil a day. They come from the worst places in the world that we should be dependent upon--5 million barrels a day. We export young men and women over to the Middle East to protect that oil coming in. The least we owe to those young men and women is when we get a chance to reduce our dependence upon imported oil, we take that chance, that we send that message to the rest of the world that we understand our Achille's heel. We understand what makes us weak. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cruz). The time of the Senator has expired. Mr. MARKEY. I thank the Presiding Officer, and I urge an ``aye'' vote on the Markey amendment. Mr. HOEVEN. Mr. President, I appreciate this debate. It is an important debate to have. Clearly, the Senator from Massachusetts and I have very different ideas about how this should be addressed, but this is the debate we should have. This is about the energy future we are building for this country. I am pleased we are engaged in this debate. Let's work to build the kind of energy plan that is going to truly make our country energy secure. To do that, we not only need to produce energy domestically, we need to work with our closest friend and ally, Canada. At the same time, as we produce that energy, we need the infrastructure to move it to our markets rather than sending it overseas. So it is ironic on the one hand the Senator is proposing an amendment saying: Oh, no. If we get any of this oil, we have to have all of it. He is making an argument that doesn't work in a global economy, where he is saying if we can't have 100 percent of it every single day--not one drop leaves--then export all of it. I want 100 percent or nothing. That doesn't make sense. The whole point is we have just finished showing that the oil will be used here, and for any of it to be exported we need the Secretary of Commerce's approval. But we have to talk about it in a larger context because this debate we are having isn't only about the Keystone Pipeline, it is about the future of energy security for our country. Are we going to work to produce oil and gas domestically? Are we going to work with Canada to bring their oil and gas that they produce as well to us, rather than having them export it to China, so we are energy secure? What I mean by that is we produce more oil and gas in North America than we consume. When we do that we become energy secure. As far as this argument about any kind of other source of energy or renewable, that this somehow precludes it, it doesn't. Let's produce all those other energy sources as well. They are not mutually exclusive. Preventing us from producing more oil and gas and working with Canada to produce more oil and gas so we don't have to get it from OPEC in no way excludes any other type of energy development. They are not mutually exclusive. So, yes, let's do it all but don't block this effort to make us energy secure in oil and gas so we don't have to depend upon OPEC. That is the real issue underlying this debate. That is why we have to build this vital infrastructure. Right now when Americans go to the pump, they are paying--I think I saw today the national average is about $2.05 for gasoline. Why is that? As I have said before on this floor, it is not because OPEC decided to give us a Christmas present. When OPEC can, they will try to push those gas prices right back up. The reason gas prices at the pump are down now for all our consumers and for all our small businesses is because we are producing more oil and gas at home and we are getting more from Canada. The United States uses about 18 million barrels per day of oil. Right now we produce about 11 million barrels in the United States. We import another 3 million from Canada. That gets us up to about 14 million, so we are down to only importing about 4 million a day. If we continue to work with Canada and develop our own energy resources, pretty soon we will be at that point where we produce more energy than we consume, but we have to have this discussion about needing the infrastructure and also our ability to operate in global markets. I will talk more about that, because if we produce more oil and gas, it puts downward pressure on oil prices on the world market. Most of those world markets are priced off of Brent crude. As we produce more oil, we not only help ourselves, we help our allies. So [[Page S258]] we have to understand what it takes to build an energy plan and do it the right way rather than blocking the very infrastructure and doing the very things that have led to incredible benefits today for our consumers at the pump. If that were a tax cut, that reduction of more than $1 in the gas prices is $100 billion in our consumers' pockets. That is the impact. So it is about jobs. It is about energy, it is about jobs, it is about growing our economy, it is about national security--but not by blocking these efforts that are benefitting our consumers, making our country stronger, safer, and helping our allies but by continuing to move forward with them. I look forward to discussing that more and the environmental impact. One more statistic before I turn to my good colleague from Nebraska. Since 1990, the greenhouse gas emissions from oil sands-produced oil have gone down 28 percent, almost one-third, because in Alberta they are taking huge steps to continue to improve the environmental stewardship of this production. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has used 10 minutes. Mr. HOEVEN. I look forward to discussing that further. I think I have control of the floor time until 12:30. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time is not controlled. Mr. HOEVEN. All right. Under prior agreement, I turn to my colleague from Nebraska. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington. Ms. CANTWELL. I see my colleague from Minnesota who wanted to speak on his amendment which is pending, and I know our colleague from Nebraska is here. She has been waiting, so I hope before we adjourn we could accommodate both of them. Mr. HOEVEN. I ask unanimous consent that we turn to my colleague from Nebraska, and I would be willing to confer, as far as time, to the Senator from Minnesota. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is so ordered. The Senator from Nebraska. Mrs. FISCHER. I thank the Senator from North Dakota for his comments. Mr. President, I, too, come to the floor to speak on the great improvements to our economy due to energy production. The American oil and gas surge has created jobs across this country and renewed investments in infrastructure, transforming many unlikely States and cities into energy hubs for fuel production. Over the past 5 years alone the United States has increased our domestic supply of oil and gas by 50 percent. In an amazing turnaround the United States is now on track to overtake Saudi Arabia as the world's top oil producer, resulting in the creation of thousands of American jobs and greater savings for consumers. The natural gas industry has also grown tremendously and in the United States has become one of the world's No. 1 producers. Across this great Nation we are fortunate to have a diverse portfolio of energy resources, including coal, nuclear, hydroelectric, natural gas, and multiple renewable energy resources such as ethanol, wind, and solar. These resources can be used to improve the lives of all Americans. American consumers are now blessed with multiple options to obtain the affordable, reliable energy that is being produced in an environmentally responsible manner, but in order to maintain and grow our domestic energy security we need to have policies that support that goal. Unfortunately, President Obama has given only lip service to an ``all of the above'' energy strategy while pushing a counteragenda that has restricted domestic production and energy choices. That costs Americans billions of dollars. Meanwhile, the EPA is taking this anti-American energy agenda to a new level with proposals that jeopardize the affordability and reliability of electricity for all Americans. The EPA's proposed rule for existing powerplants would force the premature retirement of efficient, low-cost coal-fueled generation, leading to the potential loss of billions of dollars of investments made over the past decade to make coal plants cleaner. These proposals would make it nearly impossible for the United States--which possesses the world's largest reserves of coal--to continue to utilize this affordable and abundant energy source. Nebraska's families and businesses, which depend on coal-fired generation for nearly two-thirds of their electric needs, are going to be disproportionately penalized under this plan. Under this administration the Federal Government has quashed energy projects by slow-walking, politicizing, and rejecting routine permits to build energy infrastructure such as the Keystone Pipeline. This important project has the clear capacity to grow our economy and maintain our energy security. On this floor we have heard many comments during this debate about the Nebraska Legislature and what was done with regard to the Keystone Pipeline. Let me set the record straight. I was in the Nebraska Legislature at that time. In fact, the proposed pipeline route crosses my former legislative district. By the way, I am a cattle rancher. I live in the Nebraska Sandhills and I live over the Ogalalla Aquifer. The legislation was not coerced and the Nebraska Legislature was certainly not confused, as some of my colleagues on the other side have implied. The Nebraska Legislature is a very open and public process. Every bill--every single bill that is introduced--has a public hearing, and our citizens are welcome and encouraged to come to those public hearings to express their opinions before legislative committees. We also have three stages of debate. We have three stages of debate on every single bill before that final vote. The Nebraska Legislature made decisions dealing with the pipeline siting within our borders. The bill passed on a 44-to-5 vote. I would also mention that the entire Nebraska congressional delegation--which does include a Democratic Congressman from the Second Congressional District who also served in the Nebraska Legislature--is united in our support for this bill. Last week this bill was called an opening gambit or spin by some of my colleagues. For the vast majority of Nebraskans, this is about certainty. Nebraskans want a decision made. This has been going on for 6 years. It is time for the President to make a decision. I am also working on some commonsense amendments to improve the arduous NEPA approval process and to protect private property energy production. I am also going to be offering amendments to set commonsense limitations for Federal land designation. I am excited about the opportunities we have to pursue policies where we can champion the productive use of America's energy resources in this Congress and where we will be able to capitalize on our country's energy prosperity. I am excited and looking forward to an open amendment process where we can do our jobs, where we can offer amendments, where we can debate those amendments, and most importantly where we can vote because that is the only way we are held accountable to our constituents, the American people. I thank the Presiding Officer, and I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota. Mr. FRANKEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator Murphy be recognized for up to 5 minutes following my remarks. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Amendment No. 17 Mr. FRANKEN. Mr. President, I rise to talk about an amendment I have offered with Senators Stabenow and Manchin, which is amendment No. 17 to S. 1. Our amendment recognizes the importance of the iron and steel industries in our country and ensures that if the pipeline is built, it is built with American iron and steel so we can create more jobs and strengthen our economy. Congress has had a long history of using ``Buy American'' provisions in order to maximize the economic benefits of infrastructure projects. ``Buy American'' provisions ensure that more goods and manufactured items used in infrastructure and other projects are [[Page S259]] produced here at home. In fact, as recently as 2013 Congress passed a provision in the WRDA Act--the Water Resources Development Act--to require the use of iron, steel, and other domestically produced goods in water infrastructure projects. That is important because it means that we keep jobs and profits here at home instead of sending them abroad. Unfortunately, there is no such requirement when it comes to construction of the Keystone XL Pipeline. In fact, according to TransCanada itself, half of the pipe for the U.S. portion of the pipeline would be sourced from foreign countries. And for the other half that would be put together here in the United States, much of the raw material, such as the steel that goes into the pipe, could be sourced from overseas. This is the problem our amendment addresses. Our amendment would require the use of domestic iron, steel, and other manufactured goods in the construction of the Keystone XL Pipeline, provided the material is readily available and affordable. If adopted, the amendment would create jobs for iron ore miners, such as the ones across the Iron Range in my State of Minnesota. It would create more jobs for shippers who ship the ore across the Great Lakes or by rail or down the Mississippi River. It would create more jobs for our steelworkers who work in steel mills across this country. At the same time, we specify in our amendment that these requirements would be implemented consistent with our trade agreements. Some of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle have said we shouldn't put such restrictions on a private company. But we have to remember that this isn't your typical private company. The underlying bill to authorize the pipeline would throw out the established approval process for the construction of a cross-border pipeline by a foreign corporation. That means all of the important assessments regarding things such as safety and the environment that our Federal agencies might have made on this project are tossed by the wayside. So if Congress is going to intervene on behalf of this foreign company, then the least we can do is to make sure the company building the pipeline uses American-made iron and steel. This is a very pragmatic amendment. We all have different views on the approval process for this pipeline, and while I believe Congress should not circumvent the approval process we have in place, I think we can all agree that we want jobs here in America. So I invite my colleagues to stand up for our domestic iron and steel producers by supporting my amendment. Thank you, Mr. President. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut. Mr. MURPHY. Thank you very much, Mr. President. I come to the floor to support the amendment which is the pending business on the floor today. This is only my second session in the Senate, but I imagine that it means something to be Senate bill 1. It probably means something even more to be Senate bill 1 in the new Republican-majority Senate. Why? Because my colleagues on the other side of the aisle had 8 years in the minority to think about what should be the first bill, the No. 1 priority of this new Republican Senate, 8 years to think about every problem American families are facing, to vet every possible solution to these problems and decide what is going to be the first bill we are going to debate to make this country a better place. There were a lot of measures the new majority could have chosen. We could have been sitting here talking about a tax cut for the middle class or we could have been talking about a proposal to make college more affordable. We could have been talking about a proposal to grow small businesses all across the country. But we are not talking about those things. After 8 years of stewing over the problems America faces, Senate bill 1 is an oil pipeline. As my colleagues who are in opposition to the underlying bill have said, this isn't just any oil pipeline; this is a pipeline to ship foreign oil right through the heartland of the United States, most likely on its way to foreign customers. And it is not just any oil; it is the dirtiest oil you can dream up. Building this pipeline and increasing the development of tar sands in Canada is the pollution equivalent, according to one study, of putting 4 million new cars on North American roads. But not to worry, say many of the proponents of the bill. Admittedly, many dispute some of those underlying studies. But the real point here is jobs. It is about creating jobs here in the United States. This is a sight which is familiar to every single American. It is a McDonald's franchise. On average, a McDonald's franchise employs about 30 to 40 people. That is nothing to sneeze at. Thirty to forty people having jobs is a big deal. But the Senate doesn't normally worry itself with debating the establishment of a new McDonald's franchise. It is a big deal to a local community, but it is not something that necessarily moves the needle in terms of the national economy. Yet the Keystone Pipeline would create the same number of permanent full-time jobs as the average McDonald's franchise. Yes, it creates construction jobs, and I don't want to discount the fact that it puts a lot of people to work building the pipeline. But do you know what also puts people to work? Building a new high school. Building a new rail line. Improving our crumbling infrastructure. That puts a lot of people to work as well. In the end, the added value to the economy of a new school or a new bridge or a new rail line dwarfs that of a pipeline which, without the adoption of the Markey amendment to be offered later, will quite possibly just take the oil from one country and send it through the United States to another country--never mind all of the environmental side effects of continuing to develop this oil. So I am going to oppose the underlying bill, but I am here to support Senator Franken's amendment because if we are going to approve this pipeline, let's do everything we can to ensure that even though we are only going to create 40 full-time jobs, that we are creating as many part-time jobs as possible. That is why it makes sense to require that the iron and steel that are going into this pipeline come from America. And we know we need to pass this amendment because Keystone has already promised that half of the steel and half of the iron is going to come from overseas companies. Mr. President, 330,000 tons of pipeline is going to come from overseas companies. This concept is not new. We do it all the time. We just passed the WRDA bill with bipartisan consensus. ``Buy American'' provisions were in there. The American Recovery Act--``Buy American'' provisions were in there. We have had laws on the books for a long time that apply ``Buy American'' provisions to private companies that are doing business in and around industries regulated or funded by the U.S. Government. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired. Mr. MURPHY. So this amendment will just make sure that at least in the short-term we are going to put a few more Americans to work, even if we are not going to do anything about the rather paltry economic numbers in the long run. I am supporting the Franken amendment, and I encourage my colleagues to support it as well. Mr. President, I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota. Mr. HOEVEN. I would like to make a couple of points. One is that in regard to this amendment, to my knowledge, they are talking about situations where a project is publicly funded, funded with taxpayer dollars. In this case, I would point out by way of closing that this is roughly an $8 billion project, but it is privately financed. This isn't a publicly funded project; it is financed by private companies and, in fact, will create hundreds of millions of dollars in revenue--State, local, and Federal Government level--to provide dollars back to the taxpayers, with absolutely no tax increase. With that, Mr. President, I yield the floor. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 9 (Tuesday, January 20, 2015)] [Senate] [Pages S255-S259] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] KEYSTONE XL PIPELINE ACT The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senate will resume consideration of S. 1, which the clerk will report. The bill clerk read as follows: A bill (S. 1) to approve the Keystone XL Pipeline. Pending: Murkowski amendment No. 2, in the nature of a substitute. Markey/Baldwin amendment No. 13 (to amendment No. 2), to ensure that oil transported through the Keystone XL Pipeline into the United States is used to reduce U.S. dependence on Middle Eastern oil. Portman/Shaheen amendment No. 3 (to amendment No. 2), to promote energy efficiency. Cantwell (for Franken) amendment No. 17 (to amendment No. 2), to require the use of iron, steel, and manufactured goods produced in the United States in the construction of the Keystone XL Pipeline and facilities. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska. Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, we are back on the bill before us, a measure that would allow for the permit to be approved to allow for construction of the Keystone XL Pipeline from Canada into the United States. We had good discussion last week, certainly on Friday. We have several amendments that are pending before the body. The Senator from Massachusetts has one on oil exports, Senator Portman on energy efficiency, and there is another measure sponsored by Senator Franken relating to American steel. Obviously, it is important that we begin to process these amendments because we have a significant amount of interest in the issues in front of us. At this point in time there are--we had over 50 filed amendments as of Friday evening. As of this morning, we maybe have more on deck. There is clearly a great deal of interest not only on Keystone XL but other energy-related amendments as well. As we work through finalizing the events for this afternoon, I would like to alert Members that we would like to have votes on at least the three pending amendments that are before us that I just mentioned, hopefully by midafternoon. We are aware the Senate will close early today because of the President's State of the Union this evening. So my hope is that we would be able to process these three. It has come to our attention that Senator Portman's amendment may need to be modified. He is in the process of doing that, and it may be that we will be able to accept that amendment this afternoon by voice vote. At this point in time, I would encourage Members to come to us as the floor managers here, and let's figure out how we can get these amendments pending before the Senate. On the Republican side we have three folks who are queued up ready to offer theirs when it is appropriate. As we had agreed last week, we will go from side to side in terms of the amendments that will be considered. Hopefully this will be the beginning of a good, constructive week as we turn to regular order here in the Senate processing amendments. With that, I would turn to my colleague on the energy committee, Senator Cantwell, for any comments she might care to make. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington. Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, just to reiterate our opposition to this legislation, new polling has come out showing that the American public really does--over 60 percent--support going through a normal process and not subverting what are environmental laws. But we are going to move forward in getting this legislation voted on. My colleague just outlined a process for this afternoon. So I would encourage Members to come to the floor to offer their amendments. I know Senator Franken is coming to speak on his amendment, and I see the Senator from Massachusetts here to speak on his amendment. So hopefully while they are speaking we can get a vote schedule firmed up and talk about other amendments besides the three we have pending. But I would agree with the Senator from Alaska that Members should come down here and talk on their amendments and we should keep the process moving. With that, I am not sure who is queued up to speak. Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I believe the sponsor of this legislation, Senator Hoeven, would like to address the Chamber for a few minutes this afternoon not only on the amendments that are pending but the bigger picture of Keystone XL. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington. Ms. CANTWELL. May I inquire of the Senator from Alaska and Senator Hoeven how long he intends to speak to make sure our colleague from Massachusetts knows he has his time before we get locked out for lunch? The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota. Mr. HOEVEN. Mr. President, my inquiry would be: How much time does the Senator from Massachusetts need? I would be willing to defer my time until later, as long as I know I would have approximately 10 minutes before the hard break of 12:30 p.m. Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I would think that if it is OK to allow the Senator from Massachusetts to proceed, knowing that our hard stop is 12:30 p.m., that at least--I would make this request: that both Senators be allowed to speak for 10 minutes, starting [[Page S256]] with Senator Markey, followed by Senator Hoeven. If they want to extend their remarks, they can make a unanimous consent request to do so. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The Senator from Massachusetts. Mr. MARKEY. May I ask a parliamentary inquiry. It would be this. Is it possible for me to speak for 5 minutes, then reserve the remainder of my time and have the Senator from North Dakota speak, and then I can reclaim the remainder of my time? The PRESIDING OFFICER. That will take unanimous consent. Mr. HOEVEN. I have no objection. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The Senator from Massachusetts. Amendment No. 13 Mr. MARKEY. Mr. President, we are about to engage in a historic debate; that is, over whether the Canadians--a Canadian oil company-- should be allowed to take the dirtiest oil in the world, the Canadian tar sands oil, to have the United States accede to the construction of a pipeline, like a straw through our country, which would then go down to the Gulf of Mexico, with no promise from the Canadians that they will not export the oil from the United States. So the issue which is raised, of course, is what is in it for the United States, since there is a very small number of jobs for our country once the pipeline is completed? We understand why the Canadian company wants to do this. If they can get that oil out onto the global marketplace, using the United States as the conduit, they can get a dramatically higher price for that oil. We understand their motivation. But what is in it for the United States of America? Ultimately, we have to decide what is in our best interests. My amendment says that if this pipeline is constructed, the oil stays here, our country gets the benefit, and our consumers get the benefit. Otherwise, it is not about energy independence; it is not about North American energy independence. It is about a Canadian company exporting the oil, using the United States as a conduit, as a straw, as a pipeline. That is it. What is in it for us? The American people right now are enjoying historically low oil prices. They love it. It is like a tax cut to every American. If this Canadian oil gets exported, you better believe it is going to act as a spur to raise the price of oil. The more oil that is here, the better for us. The more oil that leaves our country, the worse for us. I will give you another number, if you want to know, because this is a Canadian export pipeline. The United States of America right now is the leading importing country for oil in the world. We are No. 1. We import net about 5 million barrels of oil a day. We are No. 1. We are the No. 1 importing country. Then comes China, then comes India, then Japan. Five million barrels a day--how can we be exporting oil when we are the leading importer of oil? What countries do we import the oil from today, 2015? We import the oil from Saudi Arabia, from Venezuela, from Iraq, from Russia, from Nigeria. How can we be exporting our young men and women in uniform over to the Middle East in order to protect these ships coming in with oil in them and simultaneously be exporting oil out of the United States, while we are still importing 5 million barrels of oil a day? That is what this debate is all about. It does not make any sense. This is the dirtiest oil in the world. This oil is going to dangerously add to the warming of the planet. The Canadian--the American Petroleum Institute will not promise the oil stays here, even though their ads on TV say that it is all about North American energy independence. So we have a huge choice we have to make here. Do we want to help our economy? Do we want to help our national security, help our consumers, help our manufacturers by giving them this lower price of energy--which except for labor is the No. 1 component in industry in the United States--and keep that price low? The Markey amendment says: Yes, that oil stays here in the United States of America for our own strength, our own economy, our own consumers, our own job creation, and will not be sent off onto the world so the Canadian oil company can get a much higher price for that oil while we take all of the risk. We would not be Uncle Sam, we would be Uncle Sucker if we did not keep that oil here. I reserve the remainder of my time. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota. Mr. HOEVEN. Mr. President, I appreciate this opportunity to engage in a discussion with my colleague from Massachusetts on the important issues. He has raised several issues in regard to oil export and then also in regard to the environmental aspects. If I could take a minute to address both of those, for starters, I would point out that it is interesting that the Senator, my good friend from Massachusetts, is opposed to this pipeline project and talks about our need to import oil, and therefore we should not allow any exports, because we need to import oil. Yet he is opposed to a project that would not only bring Canadian oil to our country, 830,000 barrels a day, but also would help us move 100,000 barrels of oil a day from my State of North Dakota and my neighboring State of Montana--light sweet Bakken crude. So he objects to that, and he talks about our need to import oil. The irony here is that if he is successful and he and the other critics or opponents of this pipeline and the infrastructure are successful, then what Canada will do is they will build a pipeline to the west coast of Canada, and they will export that oil to China--100 percent of it. So it appears that his argument is that because some portion of this oil may be exported if we build the pipeline, somehow it is better to force Canada to export 100 percent of it to China. Now, I do not begin to understand that argument. So if we cannot have 100 percent--every single drop--stay here, then we are better off to send all 100 percent to China. That is my opponent's argument. I do not understand it. It does not make sense to me. The second point I would like to make is if he goes to the environmental impact statement issued by the Obama State Department, the environmental impact statement says that the oil would be used in the United States. If he looks at the Obama administration's Department of Energy report, he will see that the report also indicates that this oil is going to be used in the United States. Now, that does not mean that we use every drop of it. I will give you some statistics. The United States retains 99 percent of all crude oil within the country that we produce. The United States uses 97 percent of the gasoline that we refine in this country. So, remember, this oil comes to refineries in Patoka, IL, and to the gulf coast. It goes to Cushing, and it gets refined. The statistics are that we use 97 percent of that gasoline from oil that is refined in our country. The other thing I would point out is that the oil that comes in on this pipeline, along with the crude that comes from the Bakken, is both Canadian and domestic oil. That cannot be exported without approval from the Secretary of Commerce of the Obama administration. So here again, my good friend from Massachusetts is putting forth an amendment that absolutely no oil in this one pipeline can be exported at any time to anywhere from the country, yet they already have provisions in law that it cannot be exported without the Secretary of Commerce's approval. The Secretary of Commerce is appointed by President Obama. So, again, if you look at the administration's own reports, and they have been done over more than 6 years that this project has been pending--the administration now has had 6 years to review this project, has done so, and has produced five environmental impact statements. The conclusion of those environmental impact statements is ``no significant environmental impact.'' That is the administration's own environmental impact statements produced by the State Department. But after 6 years, they have come out and said: This oil will be used here, and to be exported, it would have to be approved by the Secretary of Commerce, as other oil exports are handled in this country. Furthermore, if we do not build the pipeline, it is either all going to be sent to China--so then we would not get any of it--or we are going to have to move it via railcars--1,400 railcars a day, creating more congestion on our railways. [[Page S257]] So at this point, I would inquire as to how much time I have used of my 10 minutes. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has used 5 minutes. Mr. HOEVEN. At this point, I would yield back to my good friend from Massachusetts. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts. Mr. MARKEY. I thank the Senator very much. Year 2014 has just been reported by NASA as the single warmest year ever recorded in the history of the planet, going back to the earliest records. You do not have to be a detective to figure out what is going on. The world is dangerously warming. The United States can no longer preach temperance from a bar stool and tell the rest of the world they should be better while we continue to burn these fuels. But if they are going to build this pipeline, at least the American people should be the beneficiaries of the Canadian activity to sell all of this oil out onto the global market. What we are being told is: No, we do not want any restrictions. We do not want there to be any way in which we can keep that oil here, to keep prices at least low for the American consumer and for American job creation, to keep oil here so we can maybe back out the Saudi Arabian oil, maybe back out the Kuwaiti oil, maybe back out the Russian oil that we are importing right now as we sit here. But we are being told we cannot do that. We are being told the Republican leadership thinks that is a bad idea. When I asked the head of the TransCanada pipeline in the hearing if he agree to keep the oil in the United States, he just looked at me and said no. So this is what is going on. What happens for the American consumer? Well, I will tell you what happens. It is a very simple formula. Every time there is a $10 increase in the price of a barrel of oil, it knocks two-tenths of a point to three-tenths of a percentage point off of the growth rate of the American economy. When Americans pay less for American oil and we import less foreign oil, consumers have more money in their pockets from that discounted American oil. That is like a direct economic stimulus for middle-class families and small businesses across the country. Analysts say the drop in oil prices will give hundreds of billions back to consumers and other parts of our economy. Every penny reduction in gas prices translates into $1 billion in consumer savings. So when the polling is done on this issue and the American people are asked if they would support the exportation of American oil, by a 3-to- 1 margin people say, all across the country, regardless of party: No, do not export it. Keep that oil here to make America stronger here at home. That is not Democrat. That is not Republican. That is not Independent. That is all people being polled across the board. That is just common sense because they know the more oil we export, the higher the prices are going to be for consumers here because we have less oil. This is a simple debate. The planet is running a fever. There are no emergency rooms for planets. We have to engage in preventive care. The Republican leadership thinks they have the votes in order to pass this bill which will dangerously warm the planet. My amendment says if that is going to be the case--and I am not voting for that bill--at least let's keep the oil here, at least let's get the benefit for consumers so we keep prices low for gasoline, prices low for home heating oil, prices low for jet fuel, prices low for diesel. Let's keep the oil here, let's get the benefit in our economy, and let's not allow oil companies to set the agenda. The Republican leadership keeps saying it is all of the above. Ladies and gentlemen, this bill basically says: No. No, it is oil above all. That is what it is all about. It is not even oil that is necessarily going to stay in the United States, so it is a very simple argument I am making. We import 5 million barrels of oil a day. They come from the worst places in the world that we should be dependent upon--5 million barrels a day. We export young men and women over to the Middle East to protect that oil coming in. The least we owe to those young men and women is when we get a chance to reduce our dependence upon imported oil, we take that chance, that we send that message to the rest of the world that we understand our Achille's heel. We understand what makes us weak. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cruz). The time of the Senator has expired. Mr. MARKEY. I thank the Presiding Officer, and I urge an ``aye'' vote on the Markey amendment. Mr. HOEVEN. Mr. President, I appreciate this debate. It is an important debate to have. Clearly, the Senator from Massachusetts and I have very different ideas about how this should be addressed, but this is the debate we should have. This is about the energy future we are building for this country. I am pleased we are engaged in this debate. Let's work to build the kind of energy plan that is going to truly make our country energy secure. To do that, we not only need to produce energy domestically, we need to work with our closest friend and ally, Canada. At the same time, as we produce that energy, we need the infrastructure to move it to our markets rather than sending it overseas. So it is ironic on the one hand the Senator is proposing an amendment saying: Oh, no. If we get any of this oil, we have to have all of it. He is making an argument that doesn't work in a global economy, where he is saying if we can't have 100 percent of it every single day--not one drop leaves--then export all of it. I want 100 percent or nothing. That doesn't make sense. The whole point is we have just finished showing that the oil will be used here, and for any of it to be exported we need the Secretary of Commerce's approval. But we have to talk about it in a larger context because this debate we are having isn't only about the Keystone Pipeline, it is about the future of energy security for our country. Are we going to work to produce oil and gas domestically? Are we going to work with Canada to bring their oil and gas that they produce as well to us, rather than having them export it to China, so we are energy secure? What I mean by that is we produce more oil and gas in North America than we consume. When we do that we become energy secure. As far as this argument about any kind of other source of energy or renewable, that this somehow precludes it, it doesn't. Let's produce all those other energy sources as well. They are not mutually exclusive. Preventing us from producing more oil and gas and working with Canada to produce more oil and gas so we don't have to get it from OPEC in no way excludes any other type of energy development. They are not mutually exclusive. So, yes, let's do it all but don't block this effort to make us energy secure in oil and gas so we don't have to depend upon OPEC. That is the real issue underlying this debate. That is why we have to build this vital infrastructure. Right now when Americans go to the pump, they are paying--I think I saw today the national average is about $2.05 for gasoline. Why is that? As I have said before on this floor, it is not because OPEC decided to give us a Christmas present. When OPEC can, they will try to push those gas prices right back up. The reason gas prices at the pump are down now for all our consumers and for all our small businesses is because we are producing more oil and gas at home and we are getting more from Canada. The United States uses about 18 million barrels per day of oil. Right now we produce about 11 million barrels in the United States. We import another 3 million from Canada. That gets us up to about 14 million, so we are down to only importing about 4 million a day. If we continue to work with Canada and develop our own energy resources, pretty soon we will be at that point where we produce more energy than we consume, but we have to have this discussion about needing the infrastructure and also our ability to operate in global markets. I will talk more about that, because if we produce more oil and gas, it puts downward pressure on oil prices on the world market. Most of those world markets are priced off of Brent crude. As we produce more oil, we not only help ourselves, we help our allies. So [[Page S258]] we have to understand what it takes to build an energy plan and do it the right way rather than blocking the very infrastructure and doing the very things that have led to incredible benefits today for our consumers at the pump. If that were a tax cut, that reduction of more than $1 in the gas prices is $100 billion in our consumers' pockets. That is the impact. So it is about jobs. It is about energy, it is about jobs, it is about growing our economy, it is about national security--but not by blocking these efforts that are benefitting our consumers, making our country stronger, safer, and helping our allies but by continuing to move forward with them. I look forward to discussing that more and the environmental impact. One more statistic before I turn to my good colleague from Nebraska. Since 1990, the greenhouse gas emissions from oil sands-produced oil have gone down 28 percent, almost one-third, because in Alberta they are taking huge steps to continue to improve the environmental stewardship of this production. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has used 10 minutes. Mr. HOEVEN. I look forward to discussing that further. I think I have control of the floor time until 12:30. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time is not controlled. Mr. HOEVEN. All right. Under prior agreement, I turn to my colleague from Nebraska. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington. Ms. CANTWELL. I see my colleague from Minnesota who wanted to speak on his amendment which is pending, and I know our colleague from Nebraska is here. She has been waiting, so I hope before we adjourn we could accommodate both of them. Mr. HOEVEN. I ask unanimous consent that we turn to my colleague from Nebraska, and I would be willing to confer, as far as time, to the Senator from Minnesota. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is so ordered. The Senator from Nebraska. Mrs. FISCHER. I thank the Senator from North Dakota for his comments. Mr. President, I, too, come to the floor to speak on the great improvements to our economy due to energy production. The American oil and gas surge has created jobs across this country and renewed investments in infrastructure, transforming many unlikely States and cities into energy hubs for fuel production. Over the past 5 years alone the United States has increased our domestic supply of oil and gas by 50 percent. In an amazing turnaround the United States is now on track to overtake Saudi Arabia as the world's top oil producer, resulting in the creation of thousands of American jobs and greater savings for consumers. The natural gas industry has also grown tremendously and in the United States has become one of the world's No. 1 producers. Across this great Nation we are fortunate to have a diverse portfolio of energy resources, including coal, nuclear, hydroelectric, natural gas, and multiple renewable energy resources such as ethanol, wind, and solar. These resources can be used to improve the lives of all Americans. American consumers are now blessed with multiple options to obtain the affordable, reliable energy that is being produced in an environmentally responsible manner, but in order to maintain and grow our domestic energy security we need to have policies that support that goal. Unfortunately, President Obama has given only lip service to an ``all of the above'' energy strategy while pushing a counteragenda that has restricted domestic production and energy choices. That costs Americans billions of dollars. Meanwhile, the EPA is taking this anti-American energy agenda to a new level with proposals that jeopardize the affordability and reliability of electricity for all Americans. The EPA's proposed rule for existing powerplants would force the premature retirement of efficient, low-cost coal-fueled generation, leading to the potential loss of billions of dollars of investments made over the past decade to make coal plants cleaner. These proposals would make it nearly impossible for the United States--which possesses the world's largest reserves of coal--to continue to utilize this affordable and abundant energy source. Nebraska's families and businesses, which depend on coal-fired generation for nearly two-thirds of their electric needs, are going to be disproportionately penalized under this plan. Under this administration the Federal Government has quashed energy projects by slow-walking, politicizing, and rejecting routine permits to build energy infrastructure such as the Keystone Pipeline. This important project has the clear capacity to grow our economy and maintain our energy security. On this floor we have heard many comments during this debate about the Nebraska Legislature and what was done with regard to the Keystone Pipeline. Let me set the record straight. I was in the Nebraska Legislature at that time. In fact, the proposed pipeline route crosses my former legislative district. By the way, I am a cattle rancher. I live in the Nebraska Sandhills and I live over the Ogalalla Aquifer. The legislation was not coerced and the Nebraska Legislature was certainly not confused, as some of my colleagues on the other side have implied. The Nebraska Legislature is a very open and public process. Every bill--every single bill that is introduced--has a public hearing, and our citizens are welcome and encouraged to come to those public hearings to express their opinions before legislative committees. We also have three stages of debate. We have three stages of debate on every single bill before that final vote. The Nebraska Legislature made decisions dealing with the pipeline siting within our borders. The bill passed on a 44-to-5 vote. I would also mention that the entire Nebraska congressional delegation--which does include a Democratic Congressman from the Second Congressional District who also served in the Nebraska Legislature--is united in our support for this bill. Last week this bill was called an opening gambit or spin by some of my colleagues. For the vast majority of Nebraskans, this is about certainty. Nebraskans want a decision made. This has been going on for 6 years. It is time for the President to make a decision. I am also working on some commonsense amendments to improve the arduous NEPA approval process and to protect private property energy production. I am also going to be offering amendments to set commonsense limitations for Federal land designation. I am excited about the opportunities we have to pursue policies where we can champion the productive use of America's energy resources in this Congress and where we will be able to capitalize on our country's energy prosperity. I am excited and looking forward to an open amendment process where we can do our jobs, where we can offer amendments, where we can debate those amendments, and most importantly where we can vote because that is the only way we are held accountable to our constituents, the American people. I thank the Presiding Officer, and I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota. Mr. FRANKEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator Murphy be recognized for up to 5 minutes following my remarks. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Amendment No. 17 Mr. FRANKEN. Mr. President, I rise to talk about an amendment I have offered with Senators Stabenow and Manchin, which is amendment No. 17 to S. 1. Our amendment recognizes the importance of the iron and steel industries in our country and ensures that if the pipeline is built, it is built with American iron and steel so we can create more jobs and strengthen our economy. Congress has had a long history of using ``Buy American'' provisions in order to maximize the economic benefits of infrastructure projects. ``Buy American'' provisions ensure that more goods and manufactured items used in infrastructure and other projects are [[Page S259]] produced here at home. In fact, as recently as 2013 Congress passed a provision in the WRDA Act--the Water Resources Development Act--to require the use of iron, steel, and other domestically produced goods in water infrastructure projects. That is important because it means that we keep jobs and profits here at home instead of sending them abroad. Unfortunately, there is no such requirement when it comes to construction of the Keystone XL Pipeline. In fact, according to TransCanada itself, half of the pipe for the U.S. portion of the pipeline would be sourced from foreign countries. And for the other half that would be put together here in the United States, much of the raw material, such as the steel that goes into the pipe, could be sourced from overseas. This is the problem our amendment addresses. Our amendment would require the use of domestic iron, steel, and other manufactured goods in the construction of the Keystone XL Pipeline, provided the material is readily available and affordable. If adopted, the amendment would create jobs for iron ore miners, such as the ones across the Iron Range in my State of Minnesota. It would create more jobs for shippers who ship the ore across the Great Lakes or by rail or down the Mississippi River. It would create more jobs for our steelworkers who work in steel mills across this country. At the same time, we specify in our amendment that these requirements would be implemented consistent with our trade agreements. Some of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle have said we shouldn't put such restrictions on a private company. But we have to remember that this isn't your typical private company. The underlying bill to authorize the pipeline would throw out the established approval process for the construction of a cross-border pipeline by a foreign corporation. That means all of the important assessments regarding things such as safety and the environment that our Federal agencies might have made on this project are tossed by the wayside. So if Congress is going to intervene on behalf of this foreign company, then the least we can do is to make sure the company building the pipeline uses American-made iron and steel. This is a very pragmatic amendment. We all have different views on the approval process for this pipeline, and while I believe Congress should not circumvent the approval process we have in place, I think we can all agree that we want jobs here in America. So I invite my colleagues to stand up for our domestic iron and steel producers by supporting my amendment. Thank you, Mr. President. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut. Mr. MURPHY. Thank you very much, Mr. President. I come to the floor to support the amendment which is the pending business on the floor today. This is only my second session in the Senate, but I imagine that it means something to be Senate bill 1. It probably means something even more to be Senate bill 1 in the new Republican-majority Senate. Why? Because my colleagues on the other side of the aisle had 8 years in the minority to think about what should be the first bill, the No. 1 priority of this new Republican Senate, 8 years to think about every problem American families are facing, to vet every possible solution to these problems and decide what is going to be the first bill we are going to debate to make this country a better place. There were a lot of measures the new majority could have chosen. We could have been sitting here talking about a tax cut for the middle class or we could have been talking about a proposal to make college more affordable. We could have been talking about a proposal to grow small businesses all across the country. But we are not talking about those things. After 8 years of stewing over the problems America faces, Senate bill 1 is an oil pipeline. As my colleagues who are in opposition to the underlying bill have said, this isn't just any oil pipeline; this is a pipeline to ship foreign oil right through the heartland of the United States, most likely on its way to foreign customers. And it is not just any oil; it is the dirtiest oil you can dream up. Building this pipeline and increasing the development of tar sands in Canada is the pollution equivalent, according to one study, of putting 4 million new cars on North American roads. But not to worry, say many of the proponents of the bill. Admittedly, many dispute some of those underlying studies. But the real point here is jobs. It is about creating jobs here in the United States. This is a sight which is familiar to every single American. It is a McDonald's franchise. On average, a McDonald's franchise employs about 30 to 40 people. That is nothing to sneeze at. Thirty to forty people having jobs is a big deal. But the Senate doesn't normally worry itself with debating the establishment of a new McDonald's franchise. It is a big deal to a local community, but it is not something that necessarily moves the needle in terms of the national economy. Yet the Keystone Pipeline would create the same number of permanent full-time jobs as the average McDonald's franchise. Yes, it creates construction jobs, and I don't want to discount the fact that it puts a lot of people to work building the pipeline. But do you know what also puts people to work? Building a new high school. Building a new rail line. Improving our crumbling infrastructure. That puts a lot of people to work as well. In the end, the added value to the economy of a new school or a new bridge or a new rail line dwarfs that of a pipeline which, without the adoption of the Markey amendment to be offered later, will quite possibly just take the oil from one country and send it through the United States to another country--never mind all of the environmental side effects of continuing to develop this oil. So I am going to oppose the underlying bill, but I am here to support Senator Franken's amendment because if we are going to approve this pipeline, let's do everything we can to ensure that even though we are only going to create 40 full-time jobs, that we are creating as many part-time jobs as possible. That is why it makes sense to require that the iron and steel that are going into this pipeline come from America. And we know we need to pass this amendment because Keystone has already promised that half of the steel and half of the iron is going to come from overseas companies. Mr. President, 330,000 tons of pipeline is going to come from overseas companies. This concept is not new. We do it all the time. We just passed the WRDA bill with bipartisan consensus. ``Buy American'' provisions were in there. The American Recovery Act--``Buy American'' provisions were in there. We have had laws on the books for a long time that apply ``Buy American'' provisions to private companies that are doing business in and around industries regulated or funded by the U.S. Government. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired. Mr. MURPHY. So this amendment will just make sure that at least in the short-term we are going to put a few more Americans to work, even if we are not going to do anything about the rather paltry economic numbers in the long run. I am supporting the Franken amendment, and I encourage my colleagues to support it as well. Mr. President, I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota. Mr. HOEVEN. I would like to make a couple of points. One is that in regard to this amendment, to my knowledge, they are talking about situations where a project is publicly funded, funded with taxpayer dollars. In this case, I would point out by way of closing that this is roughly an $8 billion project, but it is privately financed. This isn't a publicly funded project; it is financed by private companies and, in fact, will create hundreds of millions of dollars in revenue--State, local, and Federal Government level--to provide dollars back to the taxpayers, with absolutely no tax increase. With that, Mr. President, I yield the floor. ____________________","Congressional Record, Volume 161 Issue 9 (Tuesday, January 20, 2015) [Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 9 (Tuesday, January 20, 2015)] [Senate] [Pages S255-S259] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] KEYSTONE XL PIPELINE ACT The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senate will resume consideration of S. 1, which the clerk will report. The bill clerk read as follows: A bill (S. 1) to approve the Keystone XL Pipeline. Pending: Murkowski amendment No. 2, in the nature of a substitute. Markey/Baldwin amendment No. 13 (to amendment No. 2), to ensure that oil transported through the Keystone XL Pipeline into the United States is used to reduce U.S. dependence on Middle Eastern oil. Portman/Shaheen amendment No. 3 (to amendment No. 2), to promote energy efficiency. Cantwell (for Franken) amendment No. 17 (to amendment No. 2), to require the use of iron, steel, and manufactured goods produced in the United States in the construction of the Keystone XL Pipeline and facilities. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska. Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, we are back on the bill before us, a measure that would allow for the permit to be approved to allow for construction of the Keystone XL Pipeline from Canada into the United States. We had good discussion last week, certainly on Friday. We have several amendments that are pending before the body. The Senator from Massachusetts has one on oil exports, Senator Portman on energy efficiency, and there is another measure sponsored by Senator Franken relating to American steel. Obviously, it is important that we begin to process these amendments because we have a significant amount of interest in the issues in front of us. At this point in time there are--we had over 50 filed amendments as of Friday evening. As of this morning, we maybe have more on deck. There is clearly a great deal of interest not only on Keystone XL but other energy-related amendments as well. As we work through finalizing the events for this afternoon, I would like to alert Members that we would like to have votes on at least the three pending amendments that are before us that I just mentioned, hopefully by midafternoon. We are aware the Senate will close early today because of the President's State of the Union this evening. So my hope is that we would be able to process these three. It has come to our attention that Senator Portman's amendment may need to be modified. He is in the process of doing that, and it may be that we will be able to accept that amendment this afternoon by voice vote. At this point in time, I would encourage Members to come to us as the floor managers here, and let's figure out how we can get these amendments pending before the Senate. On the Republican side we have three folks who are queued up ready to offer theirs when it is appropriate. As we had agreed last week, we will go from side to side in terms of the amendments that will be considered. Hopefully this will be the beginning of a good, constructive week as we turn to regular order here in the Senate processing amendments. With that, I would turn to my colleague on the energy committee, Senator Cantwell, for any comments she might care to make. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington. Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, just to reiterate our opposition to this legislation, new polling has come out showing that the American public really does--over 60 percent--support going through a normal process and not subverting what are environmental laws. But we are going to move forward in getting this legislation voted on. My colleague just outlined a process for this afternoon. So I would encourage Members to come to the floor to offer their amendments. I know Senator Franken is coming to speak on his amendment, and I see the Senator from Massachusetts here to speak on his amendment. So hopefully while they are speaking we can get a vote schedule firmed up and talk about other amendments besides the three we have pending. But I would agree with the Senator from Alaska that Members should come down here and talk on their amendments and we should keep the process moving. With that, I am not sure who is queued up to speak. Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I believe the sponsor of this legislation, Senator Hoeven, would like to address the Chamber for a few minutes this afternoon not only on the amendments that are pending but the bigger picture of Keystone XL. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington. Ms. CANTWELL. May I inquire of the Senator from Alaska and Senator Hoeven how long he intends to speak to make sure our colleague from Massachusetts knows he has his time before we get locked out for lunch? The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota. Mr. HOEVEN. Mr. President, my inquiry would be: How much time does the Senator from Massachusetts need? I would be willing to defer my time until later, as long as I know I would have approximately 10 minutes before the hard break of 12:30 p.m. Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I would think that if it is OK to allow the Senator from Massachusetts to proceed, knowing that our hard stop is 12:30 p.m., that at least--I would make this request: that both Senators be allowed to speak for 10 minutes, starting [[Page S256]] with Senator Markey, followed by Senator Hoeven. If they want to extend their remarks, they can make a unanimous consent request to do so. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The Senator from Massachusetts. Mr. MARKEY. May I ask a parliamentary inquiry. It would be this. Is it possible for me to speak for 5 minutes, then reserve the remainder of my time and have the Senator from North Dakota speak, and then I can reclaim the remainder of my time? The PRESIDING OFFICER. That will take unanimous consent. Mr. HOEVEN. I have no objection. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The Senator from Massachusetts. Amendment No. 13 Mr. MARKEY. Mr. President, we are about to engage in a historic debate; that is, over whether the Canadians--a Canadian oil company-- should be allowed to take the dirtiest oil in the world, the Canadian tar sands oil, to have the United States accede to the construction of a pipeline, like a straw through our country, which would then go down to the Gulf of Mexico, with no promise from the Canadians that they will not export the oil from the United States. So the issue which is raised, of course, is what is in it for the United States, since there is a very small number of jobs for our country once the pipeline is completed? We understand why the Canadian company wants to do this. If they can get that oil out onto the global marketplace, using the United States as the conduit, they can get a dramatically higher price for that oil. We understand their motivation. But what is in it for the United States of America? Ultimately, we have to decide what is in our best interests. My amendment says that if this pipeline is constructed, the oil stays here, our country gets the benefit, and our consumers get the benefit. Otherwise, it is not about energy independence; it is not about North American energy independence. It is about a Canadian company exporting the oil, using the United States as a conduit, as a straw, as a pipeline. That is it. What is in it for us? The American people right now are enjoying historically low oil prices. They love it. It is like a tax cut to every American. If this Canadian oil gets exported, you better believe it is going to act as a spur to raise the price of oil. The more oil that is here, the better for us. The more oil that leaves our country, the worse for us. I will give you another number, if you want to know, because this is a Canadian export pipeline. The United States of America right now is the leading importing country for oil in the world. We are No. 1. We import net about 5 million barrels of oil a day. We are No. 1. We are the No. 1 importing country. Then comes China, then comes India, then Japan. Five million barrels a day--how can we be exporting oil when we are the leading importer of oil? What countries do we import the oil from today, 2015? We import the oil from Saudi Arabia, from Venezuela, from Iraq, from Russia, from Nigeria. How can we be exporting our young men and women in uniform over to the Middle East in order to protect these ships coming in with oil in them and simultaneously be exporting oil out of the United States, while we are still importing 5 million barrels of oil a day? That is what this debate is all about. It does not make any sense. This is the dirtiest oil in the world. This oil is going to dangerously add to the warming of the planet. The Canadian--the American Petroleum Institute will not promise the oil stays here, even though their ads on TV say that it is all about North American energy independence. So we have a huge choice we have to make here. Do we want to help our economy? Do we want to help our national security, help our consumers, help our manufacturers by giving them this lower price of energy--which except for labor is the No. 1 component in industry in the United States--and keep that price low? The Markey amendment says: Yes, that oil stays here in the United States of America for our own strength, our own economy, our own consumers, our own job creation, and will not be sent off onto the world so the Canadian oil company can get a much higher price for that oil while we take all of the risk. We would not be Uncle Sam, we would be Uncle Sucker if we did not keep that oil here. I reserve the remainder of my time. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota. Mr. HOEVEN. Mr. President, I appreciate this opportunity to engage in a discussion with my colleague from Massachusetts on the important issues. He has raised several issues in regard to oil export and then also in regard to the environmental aspects. If I could take a minute to address both of those, for starters, I would point out that it is interesting that the Senator, my good friend from Massachusetts, is opposed to this pipeline project and talks about our need to import oil, and therefore we should not allow any exports, because we need to import oil. Yet he is opposed to a project that would not only bring Canadian oil to our country, 830,000 barrels a day, but also would help us move 100,000 barrels of oil a day from my State of North Dakota and my neighboring State of Montana--light sweet Bakken crude. So he objects to that, and he talks about our need to import oil. The irony here is that if he is successful and he and the other critics or opponents of this pipeline and the infrastructure are successful, then what Canada will do is they will build a pipeline to the west coast of Canada, and they will export that oil to China--100 percent of it. So it appears that his argument is that because some portion of this oil may be exported if we build the pipeline, somehow it is better to force Canada to export 100 percent of it to China. Now, I do not begin to understand that argument. So if we cannot have 100 percent--every single drop--stay here, then we are better off to send all 100 percent to China. That is my opponent's argument. I do not understand it. It does not make sense to me. The second point I would like to make is if he goes to the environmental impact statement issued by the Obama State Department, the environmental impact statement says that the oil would be used in the United States. If he looks at the Obama administration's Department of Energy report, he will see that the report also indicates that this oil is going to be used in the United States. Now, that does not mean that we use every drop of it. I will give you some statistics. The United States retains 99 percent of all crude oil within the country that we produce. The United States uses 97 percent of the gasoline that we refine in this country. So, remember, this oil comes to refineries in Patoka, IL, and to the gulf coast. It goes to Cushing, and it gets refined. The statistics are that we use 97 percent of that gasoline from oil that is refined in our country. The other thing I would point out is that the oil that comes in on this pipeline, along with the crude that comes from the Bakken, is both Canadian and domestic oil. That cannot be exported without approval from the Secretary of Commerce of the Obama administration. So here again, my good friend from Massachusetts is putting forth an amendment that absolutely no oil in this one pipeline can be exported at any time to anywhere from the country, yet they already have provisions in law that it cannot be exported without the Secretary of Commerce's approval. The Secretary of Commerce is appointed by President Obama. So, again, if you look at the administration's own reports, and they have been done over more than 6 years that this project has been pending--the administration now has had 6 years to review this project, has done so, and has produced five environmental impact statements. The conclusion of those environmental impact statements is ``no significant environmental impact.'' That is the administration's own environmental impact statements produced by the State Department. But after 6 years, they have come out and said: This oil will be used here, and to be exported, it would have to be approved by the Secretary of Commerce, as other oil exports are handled in this country. Furthermore, if we do not build the pipeline, it is either all going to be sent to China--so then we would not get any of it--or we are going to have to move it via railcars--1,400 railcars a day, creating more congestion on our railways. [[Page S257]] So at this point, I would inquire as to how much time I have used of my 10 minutes. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has used 5 minutes. Mr. HOEVEN. At this point, I would yield back to my good friend from Massachusetts. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts. Mr. MARKEY. I thank the Senator very much. Year 2014 has just been reported by NASA as the single warmest year ever recorded in the history of the planet, going back to the earliest records. You do not have to be a detective to figure out what is going on. The world is dangerously warming. The United States can no longer preach temperance from a bar stool and tell the rest of the world they should be better while we continue to burn these fuels. But if they are going to build this pipeline, at least the American people should be the beneficiaries of the Canadian activity to sell all of this oil out onto the global market. What we are being told is: No, we do not want any restrictions. We do not want there to be any way in which we can keep that oil here, to keep prices at least low for the American consumer and for American job creation, to keep oil here so we can maybe back out the Saudi Arabian oil, maybe back out the Kuwaiti oil, maybe back out the Russian oil that we are importing right now as we sit here. But we are being told we cannot do that. We are being told the Republican leadership thinks that is a bad idea. When I asked the head of the TransCanada pipeline in the hearing if he agree to keep the oil in the United States, he just looked at me and said no. So this is what is going on. What happens for the American consumer? Well, I will tell you what happens. It is a very simple formula. Every time there is a $10 increase in the price of a barrel of oil, it knocks two-tenths of a point to three-tenths of a percentage point off of the growth rate of the American economy. When Americans pay less for American oil and we import less foreign oil, consumers have more money in their pockets from that discounted American oil. That is like a direct economic stimulus for middle-class families and small businesses across the country. Analysts say the drop in oil prices will give hundreds of billions back to consumers and other parts of our economy. Every penny reduction in gas prices translates into $1 billion in consumer savings. So when the polling is done on this issue and the American people are asked if they would support the exportation of American oil, by a 3-to- 1 margin people say, all across the country, regardless of party: No, do not export it. Keep that oil here to make America stronger here at home. That is not Democrat. That is not Republican. That is not Independent. That is all people being polled across the board. That is just common sense because they know the more oil we export, the higher the prices are going to be for consumers here because we have less oil. This is a simple debate. The planet is running a fever. There are no emergency rooms for planets. We have to engage in preventive care. The Republican leadership thinks they have the votes in order to pass this bill which will dangerously warm the planet. My amendment says if that is going to be the case--and I am not voting for that bill--at least let's keep the oil here, at least let's get the benefit for consumers so we keep prices low for gasoline, prices low for home heating oil, prices low for jet fuel, prices low for diesel. Let's keep the oil here, let's get the benefit in our economy, and let's not allow oil companies to set the agenda. The Republican leadership keeps saying it is all of the above. Ladies and gentlemen, this bill basically says: No. No, it is oil above all. That is what it is all about. It is not even oil that is necessarily going to stay in the United States, so it is a very simple argument I am making. We import 5 million barrels of oil a day. They come from the worst places in the world that we should be dependent upon--5 million barrels a day. We export young men and women over to the Middle East to protect that oil coming in. The least we owe to those young men and women is when we get a chance to reduce our dependence upon imported oil, we take that chance, that we send that message to the rest of the world that we understand our Achille's heel. We understand what makes us weak. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cruz). The time of the Senator has expired. Mr. MARKEY. I thank the Presiding Officer, and I urge an ``aye'' vote on the Markey amendment. Mr. HOEVEN. Mr. President, I appreciate this debate. It is an important debate to have. Clearly, the Senator from Massachusetts and I have very different ideas about how this should be addressed, but this is the debate we should have. This is about the energy future we are building for this country. I am pleased we are engaged in this debate. Let's work to build the kind of energy plan that is going to truly make our country energy secure. To do that, we not only need to produce energy domestically, we need to work with our closest friend and ally, Canada. At the same time, as we produce that energy, we need the infrastructure to move it to our markets rather than sending it overseas. So it is ironic on the one hand the Senator is proposing an amendment saying: Oh, no. If we get any of this oil, we have to have all of it. He is making an argument that doesn't work in a global economy, where he is saying if we can't have 100 percent of it every single day--not one drop leaves--then export all of it. I want 100 percent or nothing. That doesn't make sense. The whole point is we have just finished showing that the oil will be used here, and for any of it to be exported we need the Secretary of Commerce's approval. But we have to talk about it in a larger context because this debate we are having isn't only about the Keystone Pipeline, it is about the future of energy security for our country. Are we going to work to produce oil and gas domestically? Are we going to work with Canada to bring their oil and gas that they produce as well to us, rather than having them export it to China, so we are energy secure? What I mean by that is we produce more oil and gas in North America than we consume. When we do that we become energy secure. As far as this argument about any kind of other source of energy or renewable, that this somehow precludes it, it doesn't. Let's produce all those other energy sources as well. They are not mutually exclusive. Preventing us from producing more oil and gas and working with Canada to produce more oil and gas so we don't have to get it from OPEC in no way excludes any other type of energy development. They are not mutually exclusive. So, yes, let's do it all but don't block this effort to make us energy secure in oil and gas so we don't have to depend upon OPEC. That is the real issue underlying this debate. That is why we have to build this vital infrastructure. Right now when Americans go to the pump, they are paying--I think I saw today the national average is about $2.05 for gasoline. Why is that? As I have said before on this floor, it is not because OPEC decided to give us a Christmas present. When OPEC can, they will try to push those gas prices right back up. The reason gas prices at the pump are down now for all our consumers and for all our small businesses is because we are producing more oil and gas at home and we are getting more from Canada. The United States uses about 18 million barrels per day of oil. Right now we produce about 11 million barrels in the United States. We import another 3 million from Canada. That gets us up to about 14 million, so we are down to only importing about 4 million a day. If we continue to work with Canada and develop our own energy resources, pretty soon we will be at that point where we produce more energy than we consume, but we have to have this discussion about needing the infrastructure and also our ability to operate in global markets. I will talk more about that, because if we produce more oil and gas, it puts downward pressure on oil prices on the world market. Most of those world markets are priced off of Brent crude. As we produce more oil, we not only help ourselves, we help our allies. So [[Page S258]] we have to understand what it takes to build an energy plan and do it the right way rather than blocking the very infrastructure and doing the very things that have led to incredible benefits today for our consumers at the pump. If that were a tax cut, that reduction of more than $1 in the gas prices is $100 billion in our consumers' pockets. That is the impact. So it is about jobs. It is about energy, it is about jobs, it is about growing our economy, it is about national security--but not by blocking these efforts that are benefitting our consumers, making our country stronger, safer, and helping our allies but by continuing to move forward with them. I look forward to discussing that more and the environmental impact. One more statistic before I turn to my good colleague from Nebraska. Since 1990, the greenhouse gas emissions from oil sands-produced oil have gone down 28 percent, almost one-third, because in Alberta they are taking huge steps to continue to improve the environmental stewardship of this production. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has used 10 minutes. Mr. HOEVEN. I look forward to discussing that further. I think I have control of the floor time until 12:30. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time is not controlled. Mr. HOEVEN. All right. Under prior agreement, I turn to my colleague from Nebraska. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington. Ms. CANTWELL. I see my colleague from Minnesota who wanted to speak on his amendment which is pending, and I know our colleague from Nebraska is here. She has been waiting, so I hope before we adjourn we could accommodate both of them. Mr. HOEVEN. I ask unanimous consent that we turn to my colleague from Nebraska, and I would be willing to confer, as far as time, to the Senator from Minnesota. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is so ordered. The Senator from Nebraska. Mrs. FISCHER. I thank the Senator from North Dakota for his comments. Mr. President, I, too, come to the floor to speak on the great improvements to our economy due to energy production. The American oil and gas surge has created jobs across this country and renewed investments in infrastructure, transforming many unlikely States and cities into energy hubs for fuel production. Over the past 5 years alone the United States has increased our domestic supply of oil and gas by 50 percent. In an amazing turnaround the United States is now on track to overtake Saudi Arabia as the world's top oil producer, resulting in the creation of thousands of American jobs and greater savings for consumers. The natural gas industry has also grown tremendously and in the United States has become one of the world's No. 1 producers. Across this great Nation we are fortunate to have a diverse portfolio of energy resources, including coal, nuclear, hydroelectric, natural gas, and multiple renewable energy resources such as ethanol, wind, and solar. These resources can be used to improve the lives of all Americans. American consumers are now blessed with multiple options to obtain the affordable, reliable energy that is being produced in an environmentally responsible manner, but in order to maintain and grow our domestic energy security we need to have policies that support that goal. Unfortunately, President Obama has given only lip service to an ``all of the above'' energy strategy while pushing a counteragenda that has restricted domestic production and energy choices. That costs Americans billions of dollars. Meanwhile, the EPA is taking this anti-American energy agenda to a new level with proposals that jeopardize the affordability and reliability of electricity for all Americans. The EPA's proposed rule for existing powerplants would force the premature retirement of efficient, low-cost coal-fueled generation, leading to the potential loss of billions of dollars of investments made over the past decade to make coal plants cleaner. These proposals would make it nearly impossible for the United States--which possesses the world's largest reserves of coal--to continue to utilize this affordable and abundant energy source. Nebraska's families and businesses, which depend on coal-fired generation for nearly two-thirds of their electric needs, are going to be disproportionately penalized under this plan. Under this administration the Federal Government has quashed energy projects by slow-walking, politicizing, and rejecting routine permits to build energy infrastructure such as the Keystone Pipeline. This important project has the clear capacity to grow our economy and maintain our energy security. On this floor we have heard many comments during this debate about the Nebraska Legislature and what was done with regard to the Keystone Pipeline. Let me set the record straight. I was in the Nebraska Legislature at that time. In fact, the proposed pipeline route crosses my former legislative district. By the way, I am a cattle rancher. I live in the Nebraska Sandhills and I live over the Ogalalla Aquifer. The legislation was not coerced and the Nebraska Legislature was certainly not confused, as some of my colleagues on the other side have implied. The Nebraska Legislature is a very open and public process. Every bill--every single bill that is introduced--has a public hearing, and our citizens are welcome and encouraged to come to those public hearings to express their opinions before legislative committees. We also have three stages of debate. We have three stages of debate on every single bill before that final vote. The Nebraska Legislature made decisions dealing with the pipeline siting within our borders. The bill passed on a 44-to-5 vote. I would also mention that the entire Nebraska congressional delegation--which does include a Democratic Congressman from the Second Congressional District who also served in the Nebraska Legislature--is united in our support for this bill. Last week this bill was called an opening gambit or spin by some of my colleagues. For the vast majority of Nebraskans, this is about certainty. Nebraskans want a decision made. This has been going on for 6 years. It is time for the President to make a decision. I am also working on some commonsense amendments to improve the arduous NEPA approval process and to protect private property energy production. I am also going to be offering amendments to set commonsense limitations for Federal land designation. I am excited about the opportunities we have to pursue policies where we can champion the productive use of America's energy resources in this Congress and where we will be able to capitalize on our country's energy prosperity. I am excited and looking forward to an open amendment process where we can do our jobs, where we can offer amendments, where we can debate those amendments, and most importantly where we can vote because that is the only way we are held accountable to our constituents, the American people. I thank the Presiding Officer, and I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota. Mr. FRANKEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator Murphy be recognized for up to 5 minutes following my remarks. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Amendment No. 17 Mr. FRANKEN. Mr. President, I rise to talk about an amendment I have offered with Senators Stabenow and Manchin, which is amendment No. 17 to S. 1. Our amendment recognizes the importance of the iron and steel industries in our country and ensures that if the pipeline is built, it is built with American iron and steel so we can create more jobs and strengthen our economy. Congress has had a long history of using ``Buy American'' provisions in order to maximize the economic benefits of infrastructure projects. ``Buy American'' provisions ensure that more goods and manufactured items used in infrastructure and other projects are [[Page S259]] produced here at home. In fact, as recently as 2013 Congress passed a provision in the WRDA Act--the Water Resources Development Act--to require the use of iron, steel, and other domestically produced goods in water infrastructure projects. That is important because it means that we keep jobs and profits here at home instead of sending them abroad. Unfortunately, there is no such requirement when it comes to construction of the Keystone XL Pipeline. In fact, according to TransCanada itself, half of the pipe for the U.S. portion of the pipeline would be sourced from foreign countries. And for the other half that would be put together here in the United States, much of the raw material, such as the steel that goes into the pipe, could be sourced from overseas. This is the problem our amendment addresses. Our amendment would require the use of domestic iron, steel, and other manufactured goods in the construction of the Keystone XL Pipeline, provided the material is readily available and affordable. If adopted, the amendment would create jobs for iron ore miners, such as the ones across the Iron Range in my State of Minnesota. It would create more jobs for shippers who ship the ore across the Great Lakes or by rail or down the Mississippi River. It would create more jobs for our steelworkers who work in steel mills across this country. At the same time, we specify in our amendment that these requirements would be implemented consistent with our trade agreements. Some of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle have said we shouldn't put such restrictions on a private company. But we have to remember that this isn't your typical private company. The underlying bill to authorize the pipeline would throw out the established approval process for the construction of a cross-border pipeline by a foreign corporation. That means all of the important assessments regarding things such as safety and the environment that our Federal agencies might have made on this project are tossed by the wayside. So if Congress is going to intervene on behalf of this foreign company, then the least we can do is to make sure the company building the pipeline uses American-made iron and steel. This is a very pragmatic amendment. We all have different views on the approval process for this pipeline, and while I believe Congress should not circumvent the approval process we have in place, I think we can all agree that we want jobs here in America. So I invite my colleagues to stand up for our domestic iron and steel producers by supporting my amendment. Thank you, Mr. President. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut. Mr. MURPHY. Thank you very much, Mr. President. I come to the floor to support the amendment which is the pending business on the floor today. This is only my second session in the Senate, but I imagine that it means something to be Senate bill 1. It probably means something even more to be Senate bill 1 in the new Republican-majority Senate. Why? Because my colleagues on the other side of the aisle had 8 years in the minority to think about what should be the first bill, the No. 1 priority of this new Republican Senate, 8 years to think about every problem American families are facing, to vet every possible solution to these problems and decide what is going to be the first bill we are going to debate to make this country a better place. There were a lot of measures the new majority could have chosen. We could have been sitting here talking about a tax cut for the middle class or we could have been talking about a proposal to make college more affordable. We could have been talking about a proposal to grow small businesses all across the country. But we are not talking about those things. After 8 years of stewing over the problems America faces, Senate bill 1 is an oil pipeline. As my colleagues who are in opposition to the underlying bill have said, this isn't just any oil pipeline; this is a pipeline to ship foreign oil right through the heartland of the United States, most likely on its way to foreign customers. And it is not just any oil; it is the dirtiest oil you can dream up. Building this pipeline and increasing the development of tar sands in Canada is the pollution equivalent, according to one study, of putting 4 million new cars on North American roads. But not to worry, say many of the proponents of the bill. Admittedly, many dispute some of those underlying studies. But the real point here is jobs. It is about creating jobs here in the United States. This is a sight which is familiar to every single American. It is a McDonald's franchise. On average, a McDonald's franchise employs about 30 to 40 people. That is nothing to sneeze at. Thirty to forty people having jobs is a big deal. But the Senate doesn't normally worry itself with debating the establishment of a new McDonald's franchise. It is a big deal to a local community, but it is not something that necessarily moves the needle in terms of the national economy. Yet the Keystone Pipeline would create the same number of permanent full-time jobs as the average McDonald's franchise. Yes, it creates construction jobs, and I don't want to discount the fact that it puts a lot of people to work building the pipeline. But do you know what also puts people to work? Building a new high school. Building a new rail line. Improving our crumbling infrastructure. That puts a lot of people to work as well. In the end, the added value to the economy of a new school or a new bridge or a new rail line dwarfs that of a pipeline which, without the adoption of the Markey amendment to be offered later, will quite possibly just take the oil from one country and send it through the United States to another country--never mind all of the environmental side effects of continuing to develop this oil. So I am going to oppose the underlying bill, but I am here to support Senator Franken's amendment because if we are going to approve this pipeline, let's do everything we can to ensure that even though we are only going to create 40 full-time jobs, that we are creating as many part-time jobs as possible. That is why it makes sense to require that the iron and steel that are going into this pipeline come from America. And we know we need to pass this amendment because Keystone has already promised that half of the steel and half of the iron is going to come from overseas companies. Mr. President, 330,000 tons of pipeline is going to come from overseas companies. This concept is not new. We do it all the time. We just passed the WRDA bill with bipartisan consensus. ``Buy American'' provisions were in there. The American Recovery Act--``Buy American'' provisions were in there. We have had laws on the books for a long time that apply ``Buy American'' provisions to private companies that are doing business in and around industries regulated or funded by the U.S. Government. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired. Mr. MURPHY. So this amendment will just make sure that at least in the short-term we are going to put a few more Americans to work, even if we are not going to do anything about the rather paltry economic numbers in the long run. I am supporting the Franken amendment, and I encourage my colleagues to support it as well. Mr. President, I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota. Mr. HOEVEN. I would like to make a couple of points. One is that in regard to this amendment, to my knowledge, they are talking about situations where a project is publicly funded, funded with taxpayer dollars. In this case, I would point out by way of closing that this is roughly an $8 billion project, but it is privately financed. This isn't a publicly funded project; it is financed by private companies and, in fact, will create hundreds of millions of dollars in revenue--State, local, and Federal Government level--to provide dollars back to the taxpayers, with absolutely no tax increase. With that, Mr. President, I yield the floor. ____________________",package_114_126.csv,37914,37914,37983,"[congressional record volume 161, number 9 (tuesday, january 20, 2015)] [senate] [pages s255-s259] from the congressional record online through the government publishing office [ www.gpo.gov ] keystone xl pipeline act the presiding officer. under the previous order, the senate will resume consideration of s. 1, which the clerk will report. the bill clerk read as follows: a bill (s. 1) to approve the keystone xl pipeline. pending: murkowski amendment no. 2, in the nature of a substitute. markey/baldwin amendment no. 13 (to amendment no. 2), to ensure that oil transported through the keystone xl pipeline into the united states is used to reduce u.s. dependence on middle eastern oil. portman/shaheen amendment no. 3 (to amendment no. 2), to promote energy efficiency. cantwell (for franken) amendment no. 17 (to amendment no. 2), to require the use of iron, steel, and manufactured goods produced in the united states in the construction of the keystone xl pipeline and facilities. the presiding officer. the senator from alaska. ms. murkowski. mr. president, we are back on the bill before us, a measure that would allow for the permit to be approved to allow for construction of the keystone xl pipeline from canada into the united states. we had good discussion last week, certainly on friday. we have several amendments that are pending before the body. the senator from massachusetts has one on oil exports, senator portman on energy efficiency, and there is another measure sponsored by senator franken relating to american steel. obviously, it is important that we begin to process these amendments because we have a significant amount of interest in the issues in front of us. at this point in time there are--we had over 50 filed amendments as of friday evening. as of this morning, we maybe have more on deck. there is clearly a great deal of interest not only on keystone xl but other energy-related amendments as well. as we work through finalizing the events for this afternoon, i would like to alert members that we would like to have votes on at least the three pending amendments that are before us that i just mentioned, hopefully by midafternoon. we are aware the senate will close early today because of the president's state of the union this evening. so my hope is that we would be able to process these three. it has come to our attention that senator portman's amendment may need to be modified. he is in the process of doing that, and it may be that we will be able to accept that amendment this afternoon by voice vote. at this point in time, i would encourage members to come to us as the floor managers here, and let's figure out how we can get these amendments pending before the senate. on the republican side we have three folks who are queued up ready to offer theirs when it is appropriate. as we had agreed last week, we will go from side to side in terms of the amendments that will be considered. hopefully this will be the beginning of a good, constructive week as we turn to regular order here in the senate processing amendments. with that, i would turn to my colleague on the energy committee, senator cantwell, for any comments she might care to make. the presiding officer. the senator from washington. ms. cantwell. mr. president, just to reiterate our opposition to this legislation, new polling has come out showing that the american public really does--over 60 percent--support going through a normal process and not subverting what are environmental laws. but we are going to move forward in getting this legislation voted on. my colleague just outlined a process for this afternoon. so i would encourage members to come to the floor to offer their amendments. i know senator franken is coming to speak on his amendment, and i see the senator from massachusetts here to speak on his amendment. so hopefully while they are speaking we can get a vote schedule firmed up and talk about other amendments besides the three we have pending. but i would agree with the senator from alaska that members should come down here and talk on their amendments and we should keep the process moving. with that, i am not sure who is queued up to speak. ms. murkowski. mr. president, i believe the sponsor of this legislation, senator hoeven, would like to address the chamber for a few minutes this afternoon not only on the amendments that are pending but the bigger picture of keystone xl. the presiding officer. the senator from washington. ms. cantwell. may i inquire of the senator from alaska and senator hoeven how long he intends to speak to make sure our colleague from massachusetts knows he has his time before we get locked out for lunch? the presiding officer. the senator from north dakota. mr. hoeven. mr. president, my inquiry would be: how much time does the senator from massachusetts need? i would be willing to defer my time until later, as long as i know i would have approximately 10 minutes before the hard break of 12:30 p.m. ms. cantwell. mr. president, i would think that if it is ok to allow the senator from massachusetts to proceed, knowing that our hard stop is 12:30 p.m., that at least--i would make this request: that both senators be allowed to speak for 10 minutes, starting [[page s256]] with senator markey, followed by senator hoeven. if they want to extend their remarks, they can make a unanimous consent request to do so. the presiding officer. without objection, it is so ordered. the senator from massachusetts. mr. markey. may i ask a parliamentary inquiry. it would be this. is it possible for me to speak for 5 minutes, then reserve the remainder of my time and have the senator from north dakota speak, and then i can reclaim the remainder of my time? the presiding officer. that will take unanimous consent. mr. hoeven. i have no objection. the presiding officer. without objection, it is so ordered. the senator from massachusetts. amendment no. 13 mr. markey. mr. president, we are about to engage in a historic debate; that is, over whether the canadians--a canadian oil company-- should be allowed to take the dirtiest oil in the world, the canadian tar sands oil, to have the united states accede to the construction of a pipeline, like a straw through our country, which would then go down to the gulf of mexico, with no promise from the canadians that they will not export the oil from the united states. so the issue which is raised, of course, is what is in it for the united states, since there is a very small number of jobs for our country once the pipeline is completed? we understand why the canadian company wants to do this. if they can get that oil out onto the global marketplace, using the united states as the conduit, they can get a dramatically higher price for that oil. we understand their motivation. but what is in it for the united states of america? ultimately, we have to decide what is in our best interests. my amendment says that if this pipeline is constructed, the oil stays here, our country gets the benefit, and our consumers get the benefit. otherwise, it is not about energy independence; it is not about north american energy independence. it is about a canadian company exporting the oil, using the united states as a conduit, as a straw, as a pipeline. that is it. what is in it for us? the american people right now are enjoying historically low oil prices. they love it. it is like a tax cut to every american. if this canadian oil gets exported, you better believe it is going to act as a spur to raise the price of oil. the more oil that is here, the better for us. the more oil that leaves our country, the worse for us. i will give you another number, if you want to know, because this is a canadian export pipeline. the united states of america right now is the leading importing country for oil in the world. we are no. 1. we import net about 5 million barrels of oil a day. we are no. 1. we are the no. 1 importing country. then comes china, then comes india, then japan. five million barrels a day--how can we be exporting oil when we are the leading importer of oil? what countries do we import the oil from today, 2015? we import the oil from saudi arabia, from venezuela, from iraq, from russia, from nigeria. how can we be exporting our young men and women in uniform over to the middle east in order to protect these ships coming in with oil in them and simultaneously be exporting oil out of the united states, while we are still importing 5 million barrels of oil a day? that is what this debate is all about. it does not make any sense. this is the dirtiest oil in the world. this oil is going to dangerously add to the warming of the planet. the canadian--the american petroleum institute will not promise the oil stays here, even though their ads on tv say that it is all about north american energy independence. so we have a huge choice we have to make here. do we want to help our economy? do we want to help our national security, help our consumers, help our manufacturers by giving them this lower price of energy--which except for labor is the no. 1 component in industry in the united states--and keep that price low? the markey amendment says: yes, that oil stays here in the united states of america for our own strength, our own economy, our own consumers, our own job creation, and will not be sent off onto the world so the canadian oil company can get a much higher price for that oil while we take all of the risk. we would not be uncle sam, we would be uncle sucker if we did not keep that oil here. i reserve the remainder of my time. the presiding officer. the senator from north dakota. mr. hoeven. mr. president, i appreciate this opportunity to engage in a discussion with my colleague from massachusetts on the important issues. he has raised several issues in regard to oil export and then also in regard to the environmental aspects. if i could take a minute to address both of those, for starters, i would point out that it is interesting that the senator, my good friend from massachusetts, is opposed to this pipeline project and talks about our need to import oil, and therefore we should not allow any exports, because we need to import oil. yet he is opposed to a project that would not only bring canadian oil to our country, 830,000 barrels a day, but also would help us move 100,000 barrels of oil a day from my state of north dakota and my neighboring state of montana--light sweet bakken crude. so he objects to that, and he talks about our need to import oil. the irony here is that if he is successful and he and the other critics or opponents of this pipeline and the infrastructure are successful, then what canada will do is they will build a pipeline to the west coast of canada, and they will export that oil to china--100 percent of it. so it appears that his argument is that because some portion of this oil may be exported if we build the pipeline, somehow it is better to force canada to export 100 percent of it to china. now, i do not begin to understand that argument. so if we cannot have 100 percent--every single drop--stay here, then we are better off to send all 100 percent to china. that is my opponent's argument. i do not understand it. it does not make sense to me. the second point i would like to make is if he goes to the environmental impact statement issued by the obama state department, the environmental impact statement says that the oil would be used in the united states. if he looks at the obama administration's department of energy report, he will see that the report also indicates that this oil is going to be used in the united states. now, that does not mean that we use every drop of it. i will give you some statistics. the united states retains 99 percent of all crude oil within the country that we produce. the united states uses 97 percent of the gasoline that we refine in this country. so, remember, this oil comes to refineries in patoka, il, and to the gulf coast. it goes to cushing, and it gets refined. the statistics are that we use 97 percent of that gasoline from oil that is refined in our country. the other thing i would point out is that the oil that comes in on this pipeline, along with the crude that comes from the bakken, is both canadian and domestic oil. that cannot be exported without approval from the secretary of commerce of the obama administration. so here again, my good friend from massachusetts is putting forth an amendment that absolutely no oil in this one pipeline can be exported at any time to anywhere from the country, yet they already have provisions in law that it cannot be exported without the secretary of commerce's approval. the secretary of commerce is appointed by president obama. so, again, if you look at the administration's own reports, and they have been done over more than 6 years that this project has been pending--the administration now has had 6 years to review this project, has done so, and has produced five environmental impact statements. the conclusion of those environmental impact statements is ``no significant environmental impact.'' that is the administration's own environmental impact statements produced by the state department. but after 6 years, they have come out and said: this oil will be used here, and to be exported, it would have to be approved by the secretary of commerce, as other oil exports are handled in this country. furthermore, if we do not build the pipeline, it is either all going to be sent to china--so then we would not get any of it--or we are going to have to move it via railcars--1,400 railcars a day, creating more congestion on our railways. [[page s257]] so at this point, i would inquire as to how much time i have used of my 10 minutes. the presiding officer. the senator has used 5 minutes. mr. hoeven. at this point, i would yield back to my good friend from massachusetts. the presiding officer. the senator from massachusetts. mr. markey. i thank the senator very much. year 2014 has just been reported by nasa as the single warmest year ever recorded in the history of the planet, going back to the earliest records. you do not have to be a detective to figure out what is going on. the world is dangerously warming. the united states can no longer preach temperance from a bar stool and tell the rest of the world they should be better while we continue to burn these fuels. but if they are going to build this pipeline, at least the american people should be the beneficiaries of the canadian activity to sell all of this oil out onto the global market. what we are being told is: no, we do not want any restrictions. we do not want there to be any way in which we can keep that oil here, to keep prices at least low for the american consumer and for american job creation, to keep oil here so we can maybe back out the saudi arabian oil, maybe back out the kuwaiti oil, maybe back out the russian oil that we are importing right now as we sit here. but we are being told we cannot do that. we are being told the republican leadership thinks that is a bad idea. when i asked the head of the transcanada pipeline in the hearing if he agree to keep the oil in the united states, he just looked at me and said no. so this is what is going on. what happens for the american consumer? well, i will tell you what happens. it is a very simple formula. every time there is a $10 increase in the price of a barrel of oil, it knocks two-tenths of a point to three-tenths of a percentage point off of the growth rate of the american economy. when americans pay less for american oil and we import less foreign oil, consumers have more money in their pockets from that discounted american oil. that is like a direct economic stimulus for middle-class families and small businesses across the country. analysts say the drop in oil prices will give hundreds of billions back to consumers and other parts of our economy. every penny reduction in gas prices translates into $1 billion in consumer savings. so when the polling is done on this issue and the american people are asked if they would support the exportation of american oil, by a 3-to- 1 margin people say, all across the country, regardless of party: no, do not export it. keep that oil here to make america stronger here at home. that is not democrat. that is not republican. that is not independent. that is all people being polled across the board. that is just common sense because they know the more oil we export, the higher the prices are going to be for consumers here because we have less oil. this is a simple debate. the planet is running a fever. there are no emergency rooms for planets. we have to engage in preventive care. the republican leadership thinks they have the votes in order to pass this bill which will dangerously warm the planet. my amendment says if that is going to be the case--and i am not voting for that bill--at least let's keep the oil here, at least let's get the benefit for consumers so we keep prices low for gasoline, prices low for home heating oil, prices low for jet fuel, prices low for diesel. let's keep the oil here, let's get the benefit in our economy, and let's not allow oil companies to set the agenda. the republican leadership keeps saying it is all of the above. ladies and gentlemen, this bill basically says: no. no, it is oil above all. that is what it is all about. it is not even oil that is necessarily going to stay in the united states, so it is a very simple argument i am making. we import 5 million barrels of oil a day. they come from the worst places in the world that we should be dependent upon--5 million barrels a day. we export young men and women over to the middle east to protect that oil coming in. the least we owe to those young men and women is when we get a chance to reduce our dependence upon imported oil, we take that chance, that we send that message to the rest of the world that we understand our achille's heel. we understand what makes us weak. the presiding officer (mr. cruz). the time of the senator has expired. mr. markey. i thank the presiding officer, and i urge an ``aye'' vote on the markey amendment. mr. hoeven. mr. president, i appreciate this debate. it is an important debate to have. clearly, the senator from massachusetts and i have very different ideas about how this should be addressed, but this is the debate we should have. this is about the energy future we are building for this country. i am pleased we are engaged in this debate. let's work to build the kind of energy plan that is going to truly make our country energy secure. to do that, we not only need to produce energy domestically, we need to work with our closest friend and ally, canada. at the same time, as we produce that energy, we need the infrastructure to move it to our markets rather than sending it overseas. so it is ironic on the one hand the senator is proposing an amendment saying: oh, no. if we get any of this oil, we have to have all of it. he is making an argument that doesn't work in a global economy, where he is saying if we can't have 100 percent of it every single day--not one drop leaves--then export all of it. i want 100 percent or nothing. that doesn't make sense. the whole point is we have just finished showing that the oil will be used here, and for any of it to be exported we need the secretary of commerce's approval. but we have to talk about it in a larger context because this debate we are having isn't only about the keystone pipeline, it is about the future of energy security for our country. are we going to work to produce oil and gas domestically? are we going to work with canada to bring their oil and gas that they produce as well to us, rather than having them export it to china, so we are energy secure? what i mean by that is we produce more oil and gas in north america than we consume. when we do that we become energy secure. as far as this argument about any kind of other source of energy or renewable, that this somehow precludes it, it doesn't. let's produce all those other energy sources as well. they are not mutually exclusive. preventing us from producing more oil and gas and working with canada to produce more oil and gas so we don't have to get it from opec in no way excludes any other type of energy development. they are not mutually exclusive. so, yes, let's do it all but don't block this effort to make us energy secure in oil and gas so we don't have to depend upon opec. that is the real issue underlying this debate. that is why we have to build this vital infrastructure. right now when americans go to the pump, they are paying--i think i saw today the national average is about $2.05 for gasoline. why is that? as i have said before on this floor, it is not because opec decided to give us a christmas present. when opec can, they will try to push those gas prices right back up. the reason gas prices at the pump are down now for all our consumers and for all our small businesses is because we are producing more oil and gas at home and we are getting more from canada. the united states uses about 18 million barrels per day of oil. right now we produce about 11 million barrels in the united states. we import another 3 million from canada. that gets us up to about 14 million, so we are down to only importing about 4 million a day. if we continue to work with canada and develop our own energy resources, pretty soon we will be at that point where we produce more energy than we consume, but we have to have this discussion about needing the infrastructure and also our ability to operate in global markets. i will talk more about that, because if we produce more oil and gas, it puts downward pressure on oil prices on the world market. most of those world markets are priced off of brent crude. as we produce more oil, we not only help ourselves, we help our allies. so [[page s258]] we have to understand what it takes to build an energy plan and do it the right way rather than blocking the very infrastructure and doing the very things that have led to incredible benefits today for our consumers at the pump. if that were a tax cut, that reduction of more than $1 in the gas prices is $100 billion in our consumers' pockets. that is the impact. so it is about jobs. it is about energy, it is about jobs, it is about growing our economy, it is about national security--but not by blocking these efforts that are benefitting our consumers, making our country stronger, safer, and helping our allies but by continuing to move forward with them. i look forward to discussing that more and the environmental impact. one more statistic before i turn to my good colleague from nebraska. since 1990, the greenhouse gas emissions from oil sands-produced oil have gone down 28 percent, almost one-third, because in alberta they are taking huge steps to continue to improve the environmental stewardship of this production. the presiding officer. the senator has used 10 minutes. mr. hoeven. i look forward to discussing that further. i think i have control of the floor time until 12:30. the presiding officer. the time is not controlled. mr. hoeven. all right. under prior agreement, i turn to my colleague from nebraska. the presiding officer. the senator from washington. ms. cantwell. i see my colleague from minnesota who wanted to speak on his amendment which is pending, and i know our colleague from nebraska is here. she has been waiting, so i hope before we adjourn we could accommodate both of them. mr. hoeven. i ask unanimous consent that we turn to my colleague from nebraska, and i would be willing to confer, as far as time, to the senator from minnesota. the presiding officer. is there objection? without objection, it is so ordered. the senator from nebraska. mrs. fischer. i thank the senator from north dakota for his comments. mr. president, i, too, come to the floor to speak on the great improvements to our economy due to energy production. the american oil and gas surge has created jobs across this country and renewed investments in infrastructure, transforming many unlikely states and cities into energy hubs for fuel production. over the past 5 years alone the united states has increased our domestic supply of oil and gas by 50 percent. in an amazing turnaround the united states is now on track to overtake saudi arabia as the world's top oil producer, resulting in the creation of thousands of american jobs and greater savings for consumers. the natural gas industry has also grown tremendously and in the united states has become one of the world's no. 1 producers. across this great nation we are fortunate to have a diverse portfolio of energy resources, including coal, nuclear, hydroelectric, natural gas, and multiple renewable energy resources such as ethanol, wind, and solar. these resources can be used to improve the lives of all americans. american consumers are now blessed with multiple options to obtain the affordable, reliable energy that is being produced in an environmentally responsible manner, but in order to maintain and grow our domestic energy security we need to have policies that support that goal. unfortunately, president obama has given only lip service to an ``all of the above'' energy strategy while pushing a counteragenda that has restricted domestic production and energy choices. that costs americans billions of dollars. meanwhile, the epa is taking this anti-american energy agenda to a new level with proposals that jeopardize the affordability and reliability of electricity for all americans. the epa's proposed rule for existing powerplants would force the premature retirement of efficient, low-cost coal-fueled generation, leading to the potential loss of billions of dollars of investments made over the past decade to make coal plants cleaner. these proposals would make it nearly impossible for the united states--which possesses the world's largest reserves of coal--to continue to utilize this affordable and abundant energy source. nebraska's families and businesses, which depend on coal-fired generation for nearly two-thirds of their electric needs, are going to be disproportionately penalized under this plan. under this administration the federal government has quashed energy projects by slow-walking, politicizing, and rejecting routine permits to build energy infrastructure such as the keystone pipeline. this important project has the clear capacity to grow our economy and maintain our energy security. on this floor we have heard many comments during this debate about the nebraska legislature and what was done with regard to the keystone pipeline. let me set the record straight. i was in the nebraska legislature at that time. in fact, the proposed pipeline route crosses my former legislative district. by the way, i am a cattle rancher. i live in the nebraska sandhills and i live over the ogalalla aquifer. the legislation was not coerced and the nebraska legislature was certainly not confused, as some of my colleagues on the other side have implied. the nebraska legislature is a very open and public process. every bill--every single bill that is introduced--has a public hearing, and our citizens are welcome and encouraged to come to those public hearings to express their opinions before legislative committees. we also have three stages of debate. we have three stages of debate on every single bill before that final vote. the nebraska legislature made decisions dealing with the pipeline siting within our borders. the bill passed on a 44-to-5 vote. i would also mention that the entire nebraska congressional delegation--which does include a democratic congressman from the second congressional district who also served in the nebraska legislature--is united in our support for this bill. last week this bill was called an opening gambit or spin by some of my colleagues. for the vast majority of nebraskans, this is about certainty. nebraskans want a decision made. this has been going on for 6 years. it is time for the president to make a decision. i am also working on some commonsense amendments to improve the arduous nepa approval process and to protect private property energy production. i am also going to be offering amendments to set commonsense limitations for federal land designation. i am excited about the opportunities we have to pursue policies where we can champion the productive use of america's energy resources in this congress and where we will be able to capitalize on our country's energy prosperity. i am excited and looking forward to an open amendment process where we can do our jobs, where we can offer amendments, where we can debate those amendments, and most importantly where we can vote because that is the only way we are held accountable to our constituents, the american people. i thank the presiding officer, and i yield the floor. the presiding officer. the senator from minnesota. mr. franken. mr. president, i ask unanimous consent that senator murphy be recognized for up to 5 minutes following my remarks. the presiding officer. without objection, it is so ordered. amendment no. 17 mr. franken. mr. president, i rise to talk about an amendment i have offered with senators stabenow and manchin, which is amendment no. 17 to s. 1. our amendment recognizes the importance of the iron and steel industries in our country and ensures that if the pipeline is built, it is built with american iron and steel so we can create more jobs and strengthen our economy. congress has had a long history of using ``buy american'' provisions in order to maximize the economic benefits of infrastructure projects. ``buy american'' provisions ensure that more goods and manufactured items used in infrastructure and other projects are [[page s259]] produced here at home. in fact, as recently as 2013 congress passed a provision in the wrda act--the water resources development act--to require the use of iron, steel, and other domestically produced goods in water infrastructure projects. that is important because it means that we keep jobs and profits here at home instead of sending them abroad. unfortunately, there is no such requirement when it comes to construction of the keystone xl pipeline. in fact, according to transcanada itself, half of the pipe for the u.s. portion of the pipeline would be sourced from foreign countries. and for the other half that would be put together here in the united states, much of the raw material, such as the steel that goes into the pipe, could be sourced from overseas. this is the problem our amendment addresses. our amendment would require the use of domestic iron, steel, and other manufactured goods in the construction of the keystone xl pipeline, provided the material is readily available and affordable. if adopted, the amendment would create jobs for iron ore miners, such as the ones across the iron range in my state of minnesota. it would create more jobs for shippers who ship the ore across the great lakes or by rail or down the mississippi river. it would create more jobs for our steelworkers who work in steel mills across this country. at the same time, we specify in our amendment that these requirements would be implemented consistent with our trade agreements. some of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle have said we shouldn't put such restrictions on a private company. but we have to remember that this isn't your typical private company. the underlying bill to authorize the pipeline would throw out the established approval process for the construction of a cross-border pipeline by a foreign corporation. that means all of the important assessments regarding things such as safety and the environment that our federal agencies might have made on this project are tossed by the wayside. so if congress is going to intervene on behalf of this foreign company, then the least we can do is to make sure the company building the pipeline uses american-made iron and steel. this is a very pragmatic amendment. we all have different views on the approval process for this pipeline, and while i believe congress should not circumvent the approval process we have in place, i think we can all agree that we want jobs here in america. so i invite my colleagues to stand up for our domestic iron and steel producers by supporting my amendment. thank you, mr. president. the presiding officer. the senator from connecticut. mr. murphy. thank you very much, mr. president. i come to the floor to support the amendment which is the pending business on the floor today. this is only my second session in the senate, but i imagine that it means something to be senate bill 1. it probably means something even more to be senate bill 1 in the new republican-majority senate. why? because my colleagues on the other side of the aisle had 8 years in the minority to think about what should be the first bill, the no. 1 priority of this new republican senate, 8 years to think about every problem american families are facing, to vet every possible solution to these problems and decide what is going to be the first bill we are going to debate to make this country a better place. there were a lot of measures the new majority could have chosen. we could have been sitting here talking about a tax cut for the middle class or we could have been talking about a proposal to make college more affordable. we could have been talking about a proposal to grow small businesses all across the country. but we are not talking about those things. after 8 years of stewing over the problems america faces, senate bill 1 is an oil pipeline. as my colleagues who are in opposition to the underlying bill have said, this isn't just any oil pipeline; this is a pipeline to ship foreign oil right through the heartland of the united states, most likely on its way to foreign customers. and it is not just any oil; it is the dirtiest oil you can dream up. building this pipeline and increasing the development of tar sands in canada is the pollution equivalent, according to one study, of putting 4 million new cars on north american roads. but not to worry, say many of the proponents of the bill. admittedly, many dispute some of those underlying studies. but the real point here is jobs. it is about creating jobs here in the united states. this is a sight which is familiar to every single american. it is a mcdonald's franchise. on average, a mcdonald's franchise employs about 30 to 40 people. that is nothing to sneeze at. thirty to forty people having jobs is a big deal. but the senate doesn't normally worry itself with debating the establishment of a new mcdonald's franchise. it is a big deal to a local community, but it is not something that necessarily moves the needle in terms of the national economy. yet the keystone pipeline would create the same number of permanent full-time jobs as the average mcdonald's franchise. yes, it creates construction jobs, and i don't want to discount the fact that it puts a lot of people to work building the pipeline. but do you know what also puts people to work? building a new high school. building a new rail line. improving our crumbling infrastructure. that puts a lot of people to work as well. in the end, the added value to the economy of a new school or a new bridge or a new rail line dwarfs that of a pipeline which, without the adoption of the markey amendment to be offered later, will quite possibly just take the oil from one country and send it through the united states to another country--never mind all of the environmental side effects of continuing to develop this oil. so i am going to oppose the underlying bill, but i am here to support senator franken's amendment because if we are going to approve this pipeline, let's do everything we can to ensure that even though we are only going to create 40 full-time jobs, that we are creating as many part-time jobs as possible. that is why it makes sense to require that the iron and steel that are going into this pipeline come from america. and we know we need to pass this amendment because keystone has already promised that half of the steel and half of the iron is going to come from overseas companies. mr. president, 330,000 tons of pipeline is going to come from overseas companies. this concept is not new. we do it all the time. we just passed the wrda bill with bipartisan consensus. ``buy american'' provisions were in there. the american recovery act--``buy american'' provisions were in there. we have had laws on the books for a long time that apply ``buy american'' provisions to private companies that are doing business in and around industries regulated or funded by the u.s. government. the presiding officer. the senator's time has expired. mr. murphy. so this amendment will just make sure that at least in the short-term we are going to put a few more americans to work, even if we are not going to do anything about the rather paltry economic numbers in the long run. i am supporting the franken amendment, and i encourage my colleagues to support it as well. mr. president, i yield the floor. the presiding officer. the senator from north dakota. mr. hoeven. i would like to make a couple of points. one is that in regard to this amendment, to my knowledge, they are talking about situations where a project is publicly funded, funded with taxpayer dollars. in this case, i would point out by way of closing that this is roughly an $8 billion project, but it is privately financed. this isn't a publicly funded project; it is financed by private companies and, in fact, will create hundreds of millions of dollars in revenue--state, local, and federal government level--to provide dollars back to the taxpayers, with absolutely no tax increase. with that, mr. president, i yield the floor. ____________________",37914

CREC-2015-01-20-pt1-PgS260,CREC-2015-01-20,114,KEYSTONE XL PIPELINE ACT--Continued,"[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 9 (Tuesday, January 20, 2015)] [Senate] [Pages S260-S272] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] KEYSTONE XL PIPELINE ACT--Continued The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey. Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, parliamentary inquiry: I understand we are on the bill. The PRESIDING OFFICER. We are on the bill. Mr. MENENDEZ. I thank the Presiding Officer. Mr. President, let me say that I rise in general opposition to the Keystone Pipeline, and I rise in favor of Senator Markey's amendment. After long and careful deliberation--and after having had the benefit of a hearing on the pipeline in the Senate Foreign Relations Committee--I have decided to oppose this bill for four basic reasons. First, on the bill, I am deeply concerned that if approved this pipeline will be the first of many pipelines opening one of the largest sources of carbon on Earth to exploitation. Second, contrary to what many believe, I am convinced this pipeline will simply not enhance, help or--in any positive way--improve our energy profile. Third, in my view, it is completely absurd for Congress to take the role of permitting pipelines. It is a role we have never assumed and should not assume now. Fourth, I believe it is ridiculous that our Republican colleagues insist on language banning eminent domain for national parks legislation but oppose it when it comes to foreign or private projects such as Keystone. Furthermore, we cannot underestimate the environmental impacts of this pipeline. The facts are clear. The resource in Alberta is enormous; the tar sands formation is the size of Iowa; tar sands oil is 17 percent more greenhouse gas intensive than other forms of oil because it takes an enormous industrial process to extract it. It has been estimated that if this resource were fully exploited, it would release more carbon dioxide in the air than the United States has emitted in its entire history. As James Hansen, one of the foremost climate scientists in the world, has said, building the Keystone pipeline would be ``game over for the planet.'' There are also more local risks. Over the weekend, landowners are seeing the pipeline spill in the Yellowstone River in Montana. It is happening right now, and landowners are wondering if their family farm will be the victim of a similar spill, wondering if property that has been in their family for generations can still be farmed and passed on to the next generation. While some jobs will be created by the pipeline, the fact is--after 2 years of construction--it will create only 35 permanent jobs--35. That is not a lot of jobs. If we want to create millions of permanent infrastructure jobs, I urge the supporters of the pipeline to support our efforts to increase transportation funding. I urge them to continue incentives for clean energy. I ask them to do all they can to help local governments rebuild local infrastructure systems. That is how we create permanent jobs that build our economy and help us keep our competitive advantage. By comparison, the number of jobs created by Keystone is hardly an argument for passage of this legislation. As you all know, we also have the issue of eminent domain--the power of any governmental entity to take private property and convert it to public use subject to reasonable compensation. Many, including some of my most conservative friends on the other side, were outraged by the idea that eminent domain proceedings could be used to seize private property for private gain. I have been working very closely with Senator Cantwell on an amendment, and we agree with our conservative colleagues that using eminent domain proceedings for private gain is pretty outrageous. Here, on the issue of Keystone, a foreign-owned company is using eminent domain to seize private property so it can better export Canadian oil--a foreign-owned company using eminent domain to seize private property so it can better export Canadian oil. The project is not in the public interest but clearly in the private interest. Senator Cantwell and I feel this amendment should be a no-brainer--an easy amendment every Senator can support. In recent years Republicans have insisted on similar language prohibiting the use of eminent domain when we establish national parks. If eminent domain cannot be used to establish a national park in the public interest to conserve our national treasures and preserve America's beauty for future generations, then surely--surely--it should not be used to benefit private interests; in this case, in the interest of a foreign-owned oil company seeking to ship its product around the world, which brings me to the amendment of the Senator from Massachusetts. Amendment No. 13 We know the oil that will flow through this pipeline will flow directly to foreign markets. That is why I support the amendment from the Senator from Massachusetts. Foreign oil is not subject to America's crude oil export ban, but whether it is shipped as crude or refined here and then exported, we all know this oil is not going to help the American consumers. The intent of the Markey amendment can be summed up very simply, using an old adage that President Reagan was fond of: ``Trust but verify.'' For months now supporters of the Keystone XL Pipeline have been telling us the tar sands that will travel through the United States will help advance our energy security. They have been telling us the pipeline will bring a reliable source of fuel from a close ally and that it will reduce prices at the pump, helping U.S. consumers and businesses. The Markey amendment does nothing more than confirm the promises made--time and time again--by supporters of the pipeline. It would require the tar sands that travel through the United States stay in the United States. It says that if Americans are to accept all of the downsides of the pipeline, if U.S. property owners are to have their lands taken away for TransCanada's benefit, if Americans are forced to live with the risk of an oilspill of dirty tar sands that we do not even know how to clean up properly, then the very least we can do is get a guarantee in law that the United States will reap the benefits that come with all of these risks. So all this amendment does is put into writing the promises we have heard over and over again from supporters of the pipeline. It codifies in law what we previously had to take on faith. I thank my colleague from Massachusetts for offering the amendment, and I would note he has a long history of working to improve America's energy security. He and I have worked closely since he came to the Senate to protect the longstanding requirement that U.S.-produced crude oil stay here at home to benefit the U.S. consumer rather than being shipped across the globe. This amendment is another commonsense protection to make sure our Nation's energy policy is aimed at helping consumers rather than helping oil companies' bottom line, and I encourage my colleagues to support it. For the last several Congresses I have introduced the American Oil for American Families Act, a bill to ensure that oil or petroleum products that originate within America's public lands or waters are not exported as crude or in refined form. That bill would increase our energy supply at home, lowering prices for consumers and businesses, and I intend to reintroduce that legislation in this Congress. For these reasons, I urge my colleagues to support the Markey amendment. I intend to vote against the bill, which in my view is nothing more than an earmark for Big Oil. The pipeline will have enormous environmental impacts, it will not significantly help the American economy, it will not benefit American consumers, and it will needlessly harm landowners for generations. With that, I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas. State of the Union Address Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, tonight the President of the United States will address the Nation on the state of our Union and talk a little bit about his priorities for the coming year. [[Page S261]] I am not sure how much more there is for the President to say than has already been leaked in the press in the drip, drip, drip of social media and other stories, but I am concerned he simply did not get the message that was delivered loud and clear on November 4 by the American voters. Just a couple of months ago they sent a message that was loud and it was clear. They are fed up with the way things operate in Washington, DC. They are fed up with the dysfunction, and they are fed up with the lack of real leadership that focuses on their concerns, not Washington's concerns--concerns such as more money in their pocket. I was amused to listen to our good friend, our colleague from New Jersey, complaining about additional exports of oil or actually gasoline and other fuel. It is actually the supply, the glut of gasoline onto the global markets that has caused a pay raise for most hard-working, middle-class families. The price of gasoline has plummeted because of the glut of supply. But we ought to be focused like a laser on how we put more money into the pocketbook of hard-working American taxpayers--after years of stagnant jobs and stagnant wages, the stagnant number of jobs for the record number of Americans who have been looking for them. So after sending a message loud and clear on November 4, what is the President's response? He says more of the same. He is set to announce a $320 billion tax hike and hundreds of billions of dollars in more spending--yes, hundreds of billions of dollars more in taxes and hundreds of billions of dollars in more Federal spending. Sadly, the President has doubled down on the same agenda which, in his own words, was on the ballot this last fall and was soundly rejected. But this agenda and these policies are not only wrong for America today, they are certainly wrong for the America of our future. Future generations deserve a country that provides them more opportunity than our parents had or than we have. That is called the American dream. But hundreds of billions of dollars in new spending and new taxes--when we already face an $18 trillion debt--well, that makes the American promise one unlikely to be fulfilled. The cause of this problem is pretty clear: The President remains focused on the priorities in Washington, DC, and not on the priorities of hard-working American taxpayers working from paycheck to paycheck, dealing with rising costs of living when it comes to food and other commodities and who are sorely in need of additional money in their pocket. Things clearly need to change. That to me was what the voters said on November 4. I think I speak for many Americans and many Texans when I say: Mr. President, enough is enough. The American people expect better, and, more importantly, they deserve better. Sure, we know there are always going to be big challenges, and they are not easy to deal with by any stretch of the imagination. But surely--surely--we can come up with better solutions than more taxes and more spending. This is really doubling down over the last 6 years. One would think that the President, giving the State of the Union now in his seventh year in office, could come up with something a little bit different, particularly after his own party lost nine Senate seats after this referendum on his failed policies that took place on November 4. The great news--and there is good news--is we do not have to start from scratch. We need to look no further than some of the laboratories of democracy--that is what Louis Brandeis called the State: the laboratories of democracy--to see what actually works. We know what does not work. So let's look and see what does work. We could learn a lot from States such as Arizona, where the Presiding Officer is from, and my home State of Texas. We are not perfect, but I think we have learned a few important lessons we could teach to the policymakers in the White House. Many policymakers in Washington seem to have forgotten the secret sauce, the formula, the recipe by which strong, sustainable economic growth that lifts the middle class in Texas and in so many other States across the country--why that is alive and well and why those policies actually work. Just last Friday I had the opportunity to visit Southeast Texas. I was in Beaumont, TX, actually, where the existing gulf coast leg of the Keystone Pipeline is already operating. I bet many of my colleagues would be amazed to know that we are already transporting Canadian crude from Canada all the way across the country, by and large on railcars, to refineries on the gulf coast. The Keystone XL Pipeline--the legislation that we will be voting on today-- will increase the supply, which means more product, and hopefully, that will result in downward pressure on prices for hard-working American taxpayers. While the President stood in the way of the building of this completed pipeline and the tens of thousands of jobs it would support, the gulf coast leg of the Keystone Pipeline in Texas is already booming. But they are hungry for more crude feedstock so they can produce more and thereby create more jobs. It has been good for communities. I talked to the mayor of Beaumont and other communities. I talked to a county judge. These taxes, which are provided by investment from the Keystone XL Pipeline, not only create good jobs, but the tax base is necessary to educate our kids in K-12 education. They provide the products and services from local businesses that sell goods. In other words, projects such as the Keystone XL Pipeline is a force multiplier when it comes to our economy and economic growth and opportunity, and of course, it has been good for thousands of construction workers who built the pipeline. I heard our colleagues on the other side of the aisle try to denigrate these construction jobs. They say that they are just temporary jobs. Mr. President, you and I have a temporary job. We are elected for a term of office, and if we are not reelected, it is a temporary job. In effect, every job is a temporary job. But to denigrate these good, high-paying construction jobs, including those performed by welders--in Texas, properly trained welders can make $140,000 to $150,000 a year. Those are good, high-paying jobs, and we ought to respect and encourage them. That is just one example of how some of the folks at the White House look down their nose at these construction jobs and try to denigrate the economic contribution of projects such as the Keystone XL Pipeline and what they could learn from this project. In my State we reduced taxes, cut red tape in favor of sensible regulations, and encouraged businesses to come to Texas to grow and create jobs. If I heard the story one time, I heard it 100 times. In my State, Governor Perry has contacted people in California and said: Come to Texas, where you are welcome and the cost of doing business is lower and the cost of living is cheaper. You can actually buy an affordable home for your family. People have voted with their feet and have come where the opportunity is. If we add it all up, over the last 6 years two-thirds of all new net jobs created in the United States of America came from just one State, and that is my home State. Another thing Washington could learn from Texas is how to balance a budget. We actually balance our budget every year. Earlier I mentioned that the President seems to be proud of the fact that the deficit is actually going down. As the Presiding Officer knows, that is the annual difference between what we take in and what we spend. What he doesn't tell you is that we are actually adding to the debt every year because we are still spending more money than we are bringing in, and it has now gone up about $8 trillion during his administration to an unprecedented $18 trillion national debt. We need to roll up our sleeves, and we invite the President to join us and take on the priorities of hard-working American taxpayers in every State across the country. We know this is not going to be easy, but that is what we volunteered for. I know there are colleagues here in the Senate--Republicans and Democrats alike--who are eager to address the challenges that confront our country--whether it is economic, national security, or you name it. These are things that need to get done. At the end of the day, it doesn't really matter what I think the State of our [[Page S262]] Union is or, for that matter, it doesn't really matter what the President thinks the State of our Union is. What matters is whether the teacher in Katy, TX, believes his students will have the opportunities he did growing up or whether the single mom waiting tables in Fort Worth can find enough work to feed her family. Our Nation is truly strong when its people believe it to be, and I hope the President understands that and tries something new rather than the same old failed policies of the past. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Portman). The Senator from Minnesota. Mr. FRANKEN. I thank the Presiding Officer. Amendment No. 17 I wish to urge my colleagues to oppose any motion to table my amendment. My amendment is about making sure that, if we do build the Keystone XL Pipeline, it is built with American iron and steel. Those are jobs. I don't wish to short-circuit the process here, but if the pipeline is built, it should be built with American steel. The Presiding Officer's State produces a lot of American steel and very often with iron ore from my State. These are American jobs. TransCanada has said that 50 percent of the iron and steel will be outsourced from other countries, and the iron and steel for some of the other pipes could come from other countries. They also said they can use those pipes in other projects, including other projects in Canada. I agree with Senator Cornyn when he said these construction jobs that will help build the pipeline are real jobs. Just because they are not permanent jobs does not mean they are not real jobs. Providing the iron and steel and other manufactured products for this project will also provide real jobs. Our amendment will do this entirely and consistently within the language of the bill and within our trade obligations. I ask that my colleagues not vote to table this amendment because a vote to table this is a vote against American jobs. It is a vote against jobs in Ohio and Minnesota. It is a vote against the shippers who ship our iron ore over the Great Lakes or by rail or over the Mississippi so it can be used to make steel. We have done ``Buy America'' legislation before. We just did it in 2013 on the WRDA bill. I ask that my colleagues please not vote against American jobs. I thank the Presiding Officer. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska. Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I will take a couple of minutes before we vote to speak to the Franken amendment. I think all of us want to buy American and buy local whenever and wherever we can. We strongly support that since it does mean jobs--whether we are talking about a pipeline or otherwise. But I think the bigger question here--and what we have in front of us with the Keystone XL Pipeline--is what this amendment would do. This amendment would mandate specific materials for the Keystone XL pipeline, and I think we need to put this into context. This pipeline is a private project. This is not a federally funded infrastructure project. This would be the first time that Congress has directed or forced private parties to purchase domestic goods and materials. We actually asked the Congressional Research Service to look into this to see if there was any other instance at the Federal level where private parties were told that they must purchase 100-percent domestic goods and materials, and so far the answer to that inquiry has been that they can find no instance of that. I think we need to be careful about this as a precedent because if we are going to direct this particular project--the Keystone XL--to have this requirement on it, where do we go next? What will happen to the next project that we have? Will it be the next pipeline or the next renewable energy project? Where does this slippery slope go? I think it is fair to note that TransCanada has made a commitment to have 75 percent of the pipes for this project come from North America, and fully half of that--more than 332,000 tons of steel will come from the State of Arkansas. I am with the Senator from Minnesota. We want to make sure we get as many jobs as we absolutely can and make sure they are good-paying jobs--whether it is in steel making or widget making or welders. This is about jobs. This is what we want to do to encourage jobs. I think we need to be very cognizant of what this particular amendment would do. This amendment--for the first time ever--would direct a private entity to utilize all American-made products throughout the process of the construction. It is important to note that the American Iron and Steel Institute has been a strong supporter of the Keystone XL Pipeline. We have all received a letter--they called it a Steelgram--from the American Iron and Steel Institute. They let us know very clearly and in no uncertain terms that they support Keystone XL. They said it is essential that Congress act to ensure the approval of the Keystone XL Pipeline without further delay. Again, I agree. We need to get moving on it. We need to do it without delay. I do think it is interesting to note that the amendment does allow for the President to waive the requirements for American materials based on certain findings he can make. I appreciate that is in there, and I think that is good. But think about where we are. It has been 3,200- and-some-odd days now where we have been waiting for the President to act to make a decision on the Keystone XL Pipeline. So I don't have any real confidence that he will move to act quickly on any kind of a waiver requirement. I just wanted to put that out there before we moved to take up the amendments that we have pending before us this afternoon and note that we will be doing that in a few short minutes. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota. Mr. FRANKEN. Mr. President, I have the greatest respect for the Senator from Alaska. I wish to say a few things about this private company. This company is asking us to do an extraordinary thing. We are debating this on the floor because they are asking us to circumvent the environmental and safety process here and possibly expose the United States--and the path of this pipeline--to tremendous environmental damage. This is very different. The Senator asked: Why won't this extend to every private enterprise? This is something we are here debating and voting on, and that should say something about the nature of this issue. The United Steelworkers have endorsed my amendment. This is about American jobs. The question is: If we do build this pipeline, should it be built with American steel or should it be built with steel from other countries? Again, in the bill, we make sure this is compliant with our trade obligations. There is nothing to stop us from doing this. This is a private foreign company that is asking us to circumvent our normal processes, and because of that, I feel we have the right to say this should be made with American steel and with jobs in the State of Ohio and in the State of Minnesota--American jobs. If this is about American jobs, let's make it about American jobs. Again, this is a company that is asking us to circumvent our normal processes. So all I will say is that TransCanada has said the pipes that have been made for this can be used in other projects in Canada. If we are going to build this project, let's make it about American jobs. I thank the Presiding Officer. Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise today to talk about jobs-- especially jobs in the U.S. steel industry. This November I went to a ceremony at Sparrows Point a former steel plant in Maryland. It was a bittersweet day. I was there to honor the legacy of Bethlehem Steel and all of the Steelworkers in Baltimore. The site is being demolished but Sparrows Point has over 3,000 acres of land, access to ports, rails, and roads to attract companies to create jobs today and tomorrow. We don't have steel in Maryland anymore. Many of us still mourn its loss. But we still have steel in America and I am still for steel. If this Keystone bill is really a jobs bill, then let us put some made-in-America jobs in it and show our support for American steel. [[Page S263]] For over a hundred years, workers at Sparrows Point produced the steel that built America. Members of my own family worked at this steel mill. My father would open the doors to his grocery store early so that Bethlehem Steel workers could pick up their lunch on their way to work. America's steel and steelworkers protect the United States and our freedom. At Sparrows Point, they rolled gun barrels, made steel for grenades, shells and landing craft during World War II. God help us all if America stops making steel. During times of war-- will we depend on foreign steel to build our ships, aircraft carriers and weapons? American steelworkers work hard, play by the rules and serve their country. In war: building ships, tanks and weapons. In peace: making steel for our buildings and cars. Yet for over 50 years, the steel industry withered--not because steel was unproductive or overpriced. The steel industry withered in America because Congress didn't do everything possible to protect American steel from factors in the international steel market, raw material costs, slumping demand, low steels prices, and a global recession. The government looked the other way when foreign imports began to drive down our prices and drive down our steel mills. Our government singles out specific industries all the time when it is in our national interest. We single out specific industries and then talk about their value to America. I agree with that. We single out industries when it is in our national interest because we need them as part of our economy or as part of our national production. Helping the farmers or the airlines because of the national interest means national responsibility. In 2008, we bailed out the banks and we bailed out the auto industry for stability, security, and American independence. Where is the help for the steel industry and the steelworkers? I have fought for steel in the past. Now I am fighting for steel again. I fought so hard year after year to protect the lives and livelihoods in Baltimore, in Dundalk. I have fought for more than 25 years to reverse this tide against American manufacturing and against American steel. I am going to keep on fighting. I fought to keep Sparrows Point open. And when that wasn't possible, I fought for a safety net for workers Trade Adjustment Assistance, unemployment insurance and health care benefits. I think about Maryland steelworkers every day--what they are going through these past few years have been tough on workers, their families, and the community. I am supporting an amendment that protects American steel like steel has protected us. It is simple. Let us put American workers back to work in good, solid steel jobs, by requiring that the pipeline's construction, connection, operation, and maintenance all be done with made-in-America, U.S. steel. Let us get to work for American workers and let us put the jobs in this jobs bill. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska. Amendment No. 3, as Modified Ms. MURKOWSKI.

Amendment No. 13 Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, at this time I call for regular order with respect to Markey amendment No. 13. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment is now pending. Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I move to table the Markey amendment and ask for the yeas and nays. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There is a sufficient second. Mr. MARKEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to be recognized for 1 minute. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? There is a unanimous consent request. Is there objection? The Senator from Alaska. Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I have a parliamentary inquiry. Is there a request from the Senator from Massachusetts to speak to this amendment for 1 minute? What is the request? The PRESIDING OFFICER. He asked unanimous consent to speak for 1 minute. Mr. MARKEY. To this amendment. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The Senator from Massachusetts is recognized. Mr. MARKEY. Mr. President, this is a motion to table the Markey amendment, which is an amendment to have every Member of the Senate be put on record as to whether or not the oil coming through the Keystone Pipeline [[Page S266]] is then exported out of the United States. Each Member of the Senate should be recorded on that issue. We import 5 million barrels of oil per day into the United States. We should not allow the Canadians to use the United States as a straw to be able to then go down to the Gulf of Mexico and send that oil out of the country. We export young men and women over to the Middle East in order to protect oil coming in from Saudi Arabia and Kuwait. This is a chance to keep oil in America so we don't have to export it. I do not believe the appropriate vote for Members is to support a tabling of the Markey amendment so that we don't actually reach the heart of this substantive issue, which is that we should be working to have energy independence in America. When we are importing 5 million barrels of oil a day from Russia, Saudi Arabia, and Kuwait, we are in no way independent. I thank the Presiding Officer for the opportunity to speak. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the motion. The yeas and nays have previously been ordered. The clerk will call the roll. The assistant legislative clerk called the roll. Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the Senator from Nevada (Mr. Reid) is necessarily absent. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Lankford). Are there any other Senators in the Chamber desiring to vote?

Amendment No. 3, as Modified Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator Shaheen be recognized to speak for 1 minute and that Senator Portman be recognized to speak for 1 minute. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is so ordered. The Senator from New Hampshire. Mrs. SHAHEEN. Mr. President, I join my colleague Senator Portman from Ohio in a bipartisan amendment on energy efficiency. This is a very short version that passed overwhelmingly in the House last year. It doesn't pick favorites in terms of fuel sources, and it is good for every region of the country. This is something we all ought to be able to get behind. I am very pleased and hope we get a very strong vote in the Senate. I am pleased to support this amendment, and I thank my colleague from Ohio, Senator Portman, for his leadership. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio. Mr. PORTMAN. The Senator from New Hampshire said it well. This is a no-brainer. It is three relatively small provisions, one of which is very timely with regard to water heaters, about which we are very concerned. I ask that we move on this amendment in a bipartisan way. It has already passed the House, so it shouldn't be controversial over there either. We hope we will be able to bring the larger legislation to the floor in the future, but this is a good downpayment. Ms. MURKOWSKI. I know of no further debate on the amendment. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment, as modified. Mr. WICKER. I ask for the yeas and nays. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There appears to be a sufficient second. The clerk will call the roll. The legislative clerk called the roll. Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the Senator from Nevada (Mr. Reid) is necessarily absent. The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote. Mrs. FISCHER. I move to lay that motion on the table. The motion to lay on the table was agreed to. Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, we have disposed of three pending amendments that were before us. As we mentioned earlier, we are looking forward to Members coming down to the floor to offer their amendments. We have agreed to a process here this afternoon. Today will be a somewhat truncated day on the Senate floor because of the State of the Union Address, but it is our hope that we will be able to get three amendments pending on our side and three amendments pending on the Democrats' side. The Senator from Nebraska, Mrs. Fischer, is prepared to speak to her amendment, and then we will move to the other side of the aisle. After that, I will be calling up an amendment from Senator Lee. We will then go to the Democratic side and come back here for a third round. Just to give Members an idea of what we will have in front of us, we will not be having votes on these amendments today, but I do think it should be clear to Members that we will be looking forward to doing a similar series of votes tomorrow. So I would encourage folks to come to the floor, talk to us, and let's get this process moving. With that, Mr. President, I yield to the Senator from Nebraska. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska. Amendment No. 18 to Amendment No. 2 Mrs. FISCHER. Mr. President, I call up my amendment No. 18. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report. The assistant legislative clerk read as follows: The Senator from Nebraska [Mrs. Fischer] proposes an amendment numbered 18 to amendment No. 2. Mrs. FISCHER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the amendment be dispensed with. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The amendment is as follows: (Purpose: To provide limits on the designation of new federally protected land) At the end of the bill, add the following: SEC. __. LIMITATION ON DESIGNATION OF NEW FEDERALLY PROTECTED LAND. (a) Definition of Federally Protected Land.--In this section, the term ``federally protected land'' means any area designated or acquired by the Federal Government for the purpose of conserving historic, cultural, environmental, scenic, recreational, developmental, or biological resources. (b) Findings Required.--New federally protected land shall not be designated unless the Secretary, prior to the designation, publishes in the Federal Register-- (1) a finding that the addition of the new federally protected land would not have a negative impact on the administration of existing federally protected land; and (2) a finding that, as of the date of the finding, sufficient resources are available to effectively implement management plans for existing units of federally protected land. Mrs. FISCHER. Mr. President, this amendment would create limitations for new Federal land designations to ensure responsible management of our natural resources. These limitations are modeled on those in the National Marine Sanctuaries Act, which authorizes the protection of national marine sanctuaries. Under the act, the Commerce Secretary cannot designate a new sanctuary unless the Secretary publishes a finding that, No. 1, the addition of a new sanctuary will not have a negative impact on the overall system, and No. 2, sufficient resources were available in the fiscal year in which the finding is made to effectively implement management plans for each sanctuary in the system. These are commonsense limitations that ensure the administration will not add more land to the Federal system without considering the impacts to the overall system and without sufficient funds to manage those resources effectively. At a time when the national park system has a $13 billion maintenance backlog, we need to consider the impacts to the overall system and whether there are sufficient resources to effectively manage additional land holdings. In the context of energy policy, we should also consider our stewardship choices. American energy production on private and State- owned lands has increased significantly in recent years while decreasing on Federal lands. Through leasing restrictions and permitting delays, the Obama administration has tied up energy production on Federal lands in redtape. Since 2009 oil production on Federal lands is down by 6 percent, and natural gas production on Federal lands is down 28 percent. Meanwhile, oil production on non- Federal land has risen by 61 percent, and natural gas production on non-Federal land is up by 33 percent. By limiting Federal land designations, more land should continue to be held privately or managed by States and local governments, increasing the opportunity for productive and beneficial use. Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington. Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, as we go back and forth on offering amendments, I wish to turn to the Senator from Hawaii for him to offer his amendment. Mr. SCHATZ. I thank the Senator from Washington. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Hawaii. Amendment No. 58 to Amendment No. 2 Mr. SCHATZ. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate set aside the pending amendment in order to call up amendment No. 58. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk will report. The assistant legislative clerk read as follows: The Senator from Hawaii [Mr. Schatz] proposes an amendment numbered 58 to amendment No. 2. Mr. SCHATZ. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the amendment be dispensed with. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The amendment is as follows: (Purpose: To express the sense of Congress regarding climate change) At the appropriate place, insert the following: SEC. __. SENSE OF CONGRESS. (a) Findings.--The environmental analysis contained in the Final Supplemental Environmental Impact Statement referred to in section 2(a) and deemed to satisfy the requirements of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (42 U.S.C. 4321 et seq.) as described in section 2(a), states that-- (1) ``[W]arming of the climate system is unequivocal and each of the last [3] decades has been successively warmer at the Earth's surface than any preceding decade since 1850.''; (2) ``The [Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change], in addition to other institutions, such as the National Research Council and the United States (U.S.) Global Change Research Program (USGCRP), have concluded that it is extremely likely that global increases in atmospheric [greenhouse gas] concentrations and global temperatures are caused by human activities.''; and (3) ``A warmer planet causes large-scale changes that reverberate throughout the climate system of the Earth, including higher sea levels, changes in precipitation, and altered weather patterns (e.g. an increase in more extreme weather events).''. (b) Sense of Congress.--Consistent with the findings under subsection (a), it is the sense of Congress that-- (1) climate change is real; and (2) human activity significantly contributes to climate change. Mr. SCHATZ. This amendment affirms something very simple; that is, climate change is real and human activities significantly contribute to climate change. It also states that a warmer planet causes large-scale changes, including higher sea levels, changes in precipitation, and altered weather patterns, such as increases in more extreme weather events. This amendment cites for its evidence the findings of national and international scientific institutions, including the IPCC, the National Research Council, and the U.S. Global Change Research Program. All of these organizations are cited and quoted in the State Department's final supplemental environmental impact statement on Keystone XL Pipeline. This is the same environmental review document that plays a prominent role in the text of the underlying bill, S. 1, and the substitute amendment. [[Page S268]] The purpose of this amendment is simply to acknowledge and restate a set of observable facts. It is not intended to place a value judgment on those facts or to suggest a specific course of action in response to those facts. It is just a set of facts derived from decades of careful study of our land, air, and water. I urge my colleagues to support this amendment. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska. Amendment No. 33 to Amendment No. 2 Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to set aside the pending amendment to call up Senator Lee's amendment No. 33. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk will report. The assistant legislative clerk read as follows: The Senator from Alaska [Ms. Murkowski], for Mr. Lee, proposes an amendment numbered 33 to amendment No. 2. Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the amendment be dispensed with. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The amendment is as follows: (Purpose: To conform citizen suits under the Endangered Species Act of 1973) At the appropriate place, insert the following: SEC. ___. AWARD OF LITIGATION COSTS TO PREVAILING PARTIES IN ACCORDANCE WITH EXISTING LAW. Section 11(g)(4) of the Endangered Species Act of 1973 (16 U.S.C. 1540(g)(4)) is amended by striking ``to any'' and all that follows through the end of the sentence and inserting ``to any prevailing party in accordance with section 2412 of title 28, United States Code.''. Ms. MURKOWSKI. Very briefly on Senator Lee's amendment--he will be here to speak to it--this is a measure which would ensure that the rate of legal fees that are paid in Endangered Species Act cases would be consistent with those in other cases that are eligible for lawyer's fee compensation. Right now there is no cap on the hourly rate lawyers can be paid in connection with lawsuits that are brought regarding violations under the ESA. So this amendment would standardize the award of attorney's fees to parties prevailing against the Federal Government by applying a $125-an-hour rate cap under the Equal Access to Justice Act requirement. This applies to small business-related claims, among other things, and this would apply the same standard to ESA cases. This is a measure Senator Lee will come to the floor to speak to further, but I would just give a little preview of that. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington. Ms. CANTWELL. I would like to call on the Senator from Illinois to offer his amendment. Amendment No. 69 to Amendment No. 2 Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to set aside the pending amendment to call up amendment No. 69. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk will report. The assistant legislative clerk read as follows: The Senator from Illinois [Mr. Durbin] proposes an amendment numbered 69 to amendment No. 2. Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the amendment be dispensed with. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The amendment is as follows: (Purpose: To ensure that the storage and transportation of petroleum coke is regulated in a manner that ensures the protection of public and ecological health) At the appropriate place, insert the following: SEC. ___. REGULATION OF TRANSPORTATION AND STORAGE OF PETROLEUM COKE. This Act shall not take effect prior to the date that-- (1) the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, in consultation with the Secretary of Transportation, promulgates rules concerning the storage and transportation of petroleum coke that ensure the protection of public and ecological health; and (2) petroleum coke is no longer exempt from regulation under section 101(14) of the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980 (42 U.S.C. 9601(14)), which may be established either by an Act of Congress or any regulations, rules, or guidance issued by the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency. Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, about 1 year ago I was invited to go to the southeast part of the city of Chicago. It is an area that used to be populated by steel mills and now there are a lot of struggling families. The manufacturing jobs were not replaced. These are hard-working people--many are Mexican-American people. They sustain what you might expect--great parishes and churches and a great spirit among them, but now they are in a constant struggle. They live in a part of Chicago that has seen better days. They are doing their darndest for their families. They invited me to see something. They wanted me to see what they were living next door to. I went down to that part of the city of Chicago--within the boundaries of the city of Chicago--and I could not believe what I saw. They live in little houses such as these, and across from them is a mountainous gathering of something called petcoke. What is petcoke? If you take the Canadian tar sands that will move through the Keystone XL Pipeline to a refinery and put them through a process where you can end up with a viable product, such as gasoline, jet fuel, diesel fuel or whatever it might be, you have to clean out all of this petcoke that creates the tar sands composition that they are dealing with. When it is all over with--and if the process has been successful-- there is a lot of waste. In fact, there are 61 pounds of petcoke for every barrel of oil. Keep in mind that the Senator who is sponsoring the underlying legislation--we are dealing with moving hundreds of thousands of barrels a day through this pipeline. Now take every one of those barrels and have 61 pounds of petcoke left over as a result of the refining process. What happens to it? This is what happened to it in Chicago. It was dumped in the neighborhood. The people invited me to come to their homes, and I did. I walked into this woman's home, and she said: I have sealed the windows. I taped them shut because this black, sooty petcoke blows through my windows night and day. I cannot stop it. Is it something to worry about? It turns out that the petcoke is not a benign material. We are not talking about dust in the air. We are talking about a composition that includes--according to those who have taken a close look at it--heavy metals. Would you want your baby in your home--or my home or my grandchildren--breathing in this filthy, petcoke-infested dust night and day? They are not making it up. They showed me the window sills, and you could see the black, sooty petcoke. I will tell you the details of the story. The environmental review for the project of Keystone XL notes that communities throughout the Midwest have noticed large piles of petroleum coke--or petcoke-- building up as more and more tar sands are processed. This picture tells a story. This is near a body of water which is carrying this petcoke on the water. These poor folks deal with it as it blows through the air. This type of crude oil is carried by the Keystone XL Pipeline, a pipeline which the Republican majority has decided is their No. 1 priority in the Senate. Under the new Republican majority it is S. 1. This pipeline, on behalf of a Canadian company, TransCanada, is the topic we are facing. We just had a vote and unfortunately could not prevail with the notion that at least the oil that comes out of the pipeline ought to be for the benefit of American consumers. We lost that vote. I think the vote was 57 to 42. It was tabled. Let's talk about the actual process itself. According to the EPA--as I mentioned, the environmental impact statement--every barrel of tar sands contains 61 pounds of petcoke. That means the Keystone XL Pipeline alone will produce 15,400 metric tons of petcoke every day-- 15,400 metric tons of petcoke every day. Would you like to live next door to that? That is what is happening in the city of Chicago, but it not the only one. This petcoke comes from the BP, British Petroleum, refinery in Whiting, IN. It is on the very southern tip of Lake Michigan. We can see it from the city of Chicago. They went through a [[Page S269]] $4 billion upgrade and put in new equipment so they could start processing the Canadian tar sands which will come down through the Keystone XL Pipeline. Soon after they started this processing with $4 billion of new equipment, the people living in this part of Chicago looked out their windows to see the massive piles of petcoke building up, and as a consequence they got worried. They are worried for their children. On windy days--it is, in fact, the ``Windy City''--black clouds of this dust blow from piles into this working-class neighborhood. It always seems to be the case, doesn't it? If somebody tried to put this on the North Shore of Chicago, they would scream bloody murder. But the company that owns this petcoke put it outside a poor neighborhood--a working-class neighborhood in Chicago. The petcoke dust settles on window sills and porches. I met the kids running outside. They are producing 6,000 tons of petcoke every single day at the British Petroleum refinery in Whiting, IN--6,000 tons a day. At that rate the plant only has room to store a few days' worth of production onsite. So they ended up selling the petcoke to a company called KCBX. It is a subsidiary company owned by the Koch brothers--yes, those Koch brothers. Connect the dots. The highest priority of the Republican majority in the Senate was to call up a bill for a Canadian company to transport tar sands across the United States with no promise that the American consumers would ever be able to access it, and the process of refining the Canadian tar sands ends up inuring to the benefit of many companies, such as British Petroleum and KCBX, which again is owned by the Koch brothers. These are the same Koch brothers who are viable political players in our political campaigns. This means the people in southeast Chicago are forced to breathe this dirty air that members of National Nurses United say causes severe health threats. Petcoke contains high levels of heavy metals, such as vanadium and nickel, and dust particles get trapped in residents' lungs, triggering asthma and exacerbating heart and lung conditions. When I go to a school--whether it is rural or urban--I make a point to ask a very basic question: Does any student here know anyone with asthma? Half of the hands are up in every classroom. Our pages are starting to raise their hands, of course. So here we have a national problem, a respiratory problem, which has been made dramatically worse by the byproduct, petcoke, of the Keystone XL Pipeline. That is a fact. What I have argued to you now so far is indisputable. The community and members of the Southeast Environmental Task Force that I visited with in Chicago are fighting back with the help of the National Resources Defense Council. They worked with Mayor Emanuel and Chicago officials to put standards in place for petcoke storage sites that protect public and environmental health. They have come up with a radical notion--if you want to store this dangerous petcoke, then for goodness' sake put it inside a building so it doesn't blow all over the neighborhood. They are suing KCBX and Koch Industries for the damages caused by petcoke piles after the Environmental Protection Agency issued a notice to the company of Clean Air Act violations. The people who hate the EPA like the devil hates holy water do not want them to come in and look at something as outrageous as this and tell you the obvious. This is a public health danger. Petcoke from Canadian tar sands, and part of the Keystone XL Pipeline, is a public health hazard. Unfortunately, petcoke just isn't an issue in Chicago or Illinois. My colleague from Michigan, Senator Gary Peters, told me a story earlier. He can tell you what happened in Detroit when another Koch brothers- owned company decided to store large piles of petcoke on the Detroit River. If you look online, you can still find the YouTube video of black clouds blowing off the piles of the Koch brothers' petcoke into the river. In fact, Senator Peters said that at one point this black cloud was so dense it obscured the Ambassador Bridge between the United States and Canada. You could not see it. It took years of complaints and lawsuits from local communities to get shipping ports in California to require piles of petcoke that was being stored there to be kept in enclosed facilities and covered at all times. Other communities continue to fight, including my city of Chicago, which I am proud to represent. As the U.S. refines more and more tar sands--that is what this bill is all about, refining more and more Canadian tar sands. Every single day tons of this petcoke is produced with no end in sight and no way of protecting the people who live around that area from the damage it will cause to the lungs of children and other vulnerable people, such as elderly people with respiratory challenges. Residents in Houston, TX, and the State of Ohio have complained about how these petcoke piles stored in their neighborhoods are damaging their homes and health, but many Americans affected by petcoke don't have the money or power to take on big companies, so it is up to Congress. It is up to us to ensure that every person in America--rich or poor, whether they live in a good neighborhood or a struggling neighborhood--has the protection against public health hazards. There is a current exemption of petcoke from environmental laws. When you think of all of the things blowing in the air, how in the world did petcoke end up being treated like fairy dust? It is exempt from laws relating to basic things, such as the Superfund. It is exempt from laws relating to hazardous waste and materials. They must have had friends in high places to make sure this miserable source of respiratory problems would be exempt from Federal law. My amendment would change that. It would end this exemption so they would be held to environmental and public health standards when it comes to this miserable byproduct of Canadian tar sands and the Keystone XL Pipeline. My amendment goes on to require the EPA and the Department of Transportation to implement rules for petcoke storage and transportation to protect the public health and environment. Is there anyone here who will tell you that the folks, TransCanada or those refining this, should not have that responsibility? I would not want to see this anywhere. I would not want to see it in Alaska, and I would not want to see it in Oklahoma. I sure don't want to even see it in the city of Chicago. But to think it goes unregulated--absolutely unregulated--is amazing, and that is what my amendment addresses. The United States already produces millions of tons of petcoke each year. Building this pipeline is just going to add dramatically to that amount. By fixing the legal status of petcoke and making it subject to the same laws as all other dangerous materials, we can help ensure that clean air and clean water is something everyone enjoys, whether they are rich or poor and no matter what State they happen to live in. I hope the Senate will have a chance to vote on my amendment to close this loophole for petcoke and establish reasonable guidelines for handling the material. It is time we put the health and well-being of Americans ahead of the profits of any industry involved in the processing of Canadian tar sands because no community--especially the southeast side of Chicago-- should be considered a dumping ground for companies to make money off the lungs and health of vulnerable children, elderly, and poor people. No family should be forced to live next door to a three-story-high pile of petcoke, and that is what is going on. No kid should have to move from a ball field to play inside so they are not exposed to hazardous chemicals. I know what will happen. Somebody is going to make a motion to table this amendment. We can run, but we can't hide, just as we can run, but we can't hide from blowing petcoke. If my colleagues won't allow a vote on this amendment to classify this as a material that should be regulated for the safety of the environment and public health, they will be on record if they vote to table this amendment. I urge my colleagues--even if they dearly love the Keystone XL Pipeline [[Page S270]] and even if they can't wait to bring in the Canadian tar sands--think about this as if this were your hometown, your neighborhood, and you lived in a house such as this and you looked across the road at that miserable pile, three stories high, of petcoke blowing in for your children and your grandchildren to breathe every day. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska. Amendment No. 41 to Amendment No. 2 Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, at this time I ask unanimous consent to set aside the pending amendment to call up the Toomey amendment No. 41. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk will report. The assistant legislative clerk read as follows: The Senator from Alaska, [Ms. Murkowski], for Mr. Toomey, for himself, Mr. Casey, and Mr. Hatch, proposes an amendment numbered 41 to amendment No. 2. Ms. MURKOWSKI. I ask unanimous consent that reading of the amendment be dispensed with. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The amendment is as follows: (Purpose: To continue cleaning up fields and streams while protecting neighborhoods, generating affordable energy, and creating jobs) At the appropriate place, insert the following: SEC. __. STANDARDS FOR COAL REFUSE POWER PLANTS. (a) Findings.--Congress finds that-- (1) 19th-century mining operations left behind more than 2,000,000,000 tons of coal refuse on surface land in various coal mining regions of the United States; (2) coal refuse piles-- (A) pose significant environmental risks; (B) have contaminated more than 180,000 acres of land and streams; and (C) are susceptible to fires that endanger public health and emit an estimated 9,000,000 tons of carbon dioxide each year, in addition to other uncontrolled pollutants; (3) the Environmental Protection Agency, the Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement, and the Department of Environmental Protection of the State of Pennsylvania recognize the significant public health benefits of power plants that use coal refuse as fuel; (4) since the inception of coal refuse power plants, the plants have removed 210,000,000 tons of coal refuse and restored 8,200 acres of contaminated land; and (5) due to the unique nature of coal refuse and the power plants that use coal refuse as a fuel, those plants face distinct economic and technical obstacles to achieving compliance with regulatory standards established for traditional coal-fired power plants. (b) Definition of Coal Refuse.--In this section, the term ``coal refuse'' means any byproduct of coal mining, physical coal cleaning, or coal preparation operations that contains coal, matrix material, clay, and other organic and inorganic material. (c) Emission Limitations for Certain Electric Utility Steam Generating Units.-- (1) In general.--The general emission limitations established by the Environmental Protection Agency in the final rule entitled ``Federal Implementation Plans: Interstate Transport of Fine Particulate Matter and Ozone and Correction of SIP Approvals'' (76 Fed. Reg. 48208 (August 8, 2011)) (or a successor regulation) shall not apply to an electric utility steam generating unit described in paragraph (3). (2) Hydrogen chloride and sulfur dioxide.--The emission limitations for hydrogen chloride and sulfur dioxide contained in table 2 of subpart UUUUU of part 63 of title 40, Code of Federal Regulations (or successor regulations), entitled ``Emission Limits for Existing EGUs'' shall not apply to an electric utility steam generating unit described in paragraph (3). (3) Description of electric utility steam generating units.--An electric utility steam generating unit referred to in paragraphs (1) and (2) is an electric utility steam generating unit that-- (A) is in operation as of the date of enactment of this Act; (B) uses fluidized bed combustion technology to convert coal refuse into energy; and (C) uses coal refuse as at least 50 percent of the annual fuel consumed, by weight, of the unit. (d) Effective Date.--Notwithstanding any other provision of this Act, this section takes effect on the date of enactment of this Act. Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, obviously, Senator Toomey will come to the floor to speak to his amendment. I wish to follow up on the comments of the Senator from Illinois, who was referring to petcoke. Senator Toomey in his amendment is attempting to deal with a situation in specific parts of the country that are impacted by coal refuse. Coal refuse, as it is defined in his amendment, effectively comes about from some centuries-old, 19th century mining operations that left behind this coal refuse in certain parts of the coal mining regions around the country. They remain a legacy problem that is acknowledged, a legacy problem that creates environmental issues, including contamination of local streams with heavy metals, acid, and mine drainage, that, again, I think we all recognize there is a responsibility to address. The good news is there is a solution to cleaning up this problem. Coal refuse powerplants take this coal and these waste piles and turn them into energy and heat for consumers, for businesses. They follow EPA regulations. This is not a situation where we are bypassing EPA regulations when it comes to the emissions issues. But remediating these mine sites, removing these waste piles, and at the same time generating electricity with the coal and applying the basic ash from the process reclaims the land at a lower cost. So we are able to do several things at the same time. We are dealing with an environmental issue that has been in place for far too long. We are generating electricity that can be used to the benefit of consumers and businesses, and we are also able to reclaim the land. So it is viewed, clearly, as a win here. It also creates some jobs. It improves the environment and it boosts economic growth. Burning these coal waste piles is basically a carbon-neutral process because the carbon in these piles is currently being emitted into the atmosphere through the slow chemical process that is at play there, and we also have fires that burn within these piles. So just sitting there is not an answer to a better environment and reduced emissions. The plants that burn this waste coal cannot economically be as clean as plants using higher quality coal. But the side benefits of removing these waste piles, again, from the perspective of dealing with emissions, generating electricity, and reclaiming the land--the benefits do compensate for the differences that are out there. Historically, environmental regulators have recognized these benefits. They have carved out the plants from regulatory standards that would cause them to shut down. There have been EPA regulations recently that have failed to sustain this approach and, thus there is the amendment of the Senator from Pennsylvania that would allow these coal waste plants to run. I encourage my colleagues to look at this amendment in front of us and consider the merits as Senator Toomey has laid out. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington. Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I know we are running against a time clock here in getting ready for the State of the Union Address tonight. I appreciate my colleague from Alaska going back and forth on these amendments and allowing both sides of the aisle to set up some pending amendments. I will just say the Toomey amendment asks for an exemption of the Clean Air Act which I wouldn't support. I know we will have a chance later on to have that discussion. Our colleague from Nebraska came to the floor and offered an amendment that would make it incredibly difficult without first proving there was negative management of Federal land to get any more national monuments. National monuments have been big economic drivers in a lot of communities and have preserved some very unique parts of our country. We will have a chance to talk about that a little bit later. But I wish to make sure we get our colleague recognized so he can offer his amendment. Then, I think we will probably, as my colleague from Alaska said, be finished for this afternoon as it relates to offering amendments back and forth. I wish to recognize the Senator from Rhode Island for his amendment. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island. Amendment No. 29 to Amendment No. 2 (Purpose: to express the sense of the Senate that climate change is real and not a hoax) Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to lay aside the pending amendment so that I may call up my amendment No. 29. [[Page S271]] The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk will report. The assistant legislative clerk read as follows: The Senator from Rhode Island [Mr. Whitehouse] proposes an amendment numbered 29 to amendment No. 2. On page 3, between lines 19 and 20, insert the following: SEC. __. SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING CLIMATE CHANGE. It is the sense of the Senate that climate change is real and not a hoax. Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I first wish to thank the distinguished chairman of the energy committee and her ranking member for allowing this process to go forward to the point where I am able to call up this amendment. It is a convention here when amendments are called up to ask unanimous consent that the reading be dispensed with, but in this amendment, the effective language is only eight words: ``Climate change is real and not a hoax.'' So I went ahead and allowed the clerical staff to read the whole operative text of this amendment. This is an extremely simple amendment. We are here in this remarkable body in which so much history has taken place and in which so many great achievements have been fought through, many of them with powerful interests and strong arguments on opposite sides. And through that conflict, here in this body, we have been able to generate some of the great compromises and some of the great resolutions that have defined the course of the history of this country. So what a wonderful place this is to have the opportunity to serve. Now, in this great deliberative body, called by many the greatest deliberative body, we have a great issue before us--perhaps as many say, the issue of our time--and that is what our carbon pollution--the excess carbon that we burn when we burn fossil fuels--is doing to our atmosphere and what it is doing to our oceans. There is no factual debate about what it is doing to our atmosphere and our oceans. It is crystal clear, and the consequences are crystal clear as well. If my colleagues don't believe me, fine, go ask the U.S. military. Ask Admiral Locklear. Ask the Secretary of the Navy. Ask the Joint Chiefs of Staff. If my colleagues don't want to believe in the military, ask our religious leaders. Ask the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops. If my colleagues only believe what corporations tell us, ask some of our biggest and most successful American corporations. Ask Walmart. Ask Coca-Cola. Ask Nike, ask Apple, ask Google. Go on through the corporate heraldry, and virtually every American corporation that is not actively involved in the fossil fuel industry will tell us this is a real and serious problem. And many of them are dedicating an enormous amount of internal effort to try to solve it within their corporate boundaries. Again, Walmart and Coca-Cola come right to the head of the list. Of course, we don't have to ask our scientists any longer. They are pretty clear. They use words such as ``unequivocal'' and ``undeniable'' at every single scientific society that represents the major elements of the profession in this country. Every single one has made this a priority. If people just want to go out to farmers, foresters, and fishermen, they are already seeing the changes around them. So here we are in this great deliberative body with this extraordinarily important issue that we have to face, and what do we see? Silence, virtually dead silence, because one side of this body won't even discuss the question. Many refuse to believe that climate change even exists, and for those who do, the political perils of using that phrase have now become so great that there is no serious conversation back and forth about climate change. In the first week we debated the Keystone Pipeline, which the environmental impact statement said will have a dramatic effect on climate change--the equivalent of 6 million added cars on our highways for 50 years, not to mention the petcoke and the byproducts, and just the carbon effect of it--no mention. The only time it was mentioned was when our distinguished energy committee chairman mentioned the testimony of a witness in her committee. She was good enough to make sure that climate change was raised in her committee, and she mentioned that there had been a witness who in turn mentioned climate change. But there was no direct mention in all of the debate that we heard in that week about climate change. It is the word that cannot be said. That is wrong. We cannot ignore this problem. It is too real for my fishermen in Rhode Island. It is to real for the people who are living near coasts and are seeing beaches they used to be able to play on eaten away. It is too real for the people whose homes have fallen into the sea. It is too real for us not to discuss it. Now, it is not going to be easy, and we have to start somewhere. So this is a start. I am going to ask my colleagues to vote on such a simple question: Is climate change real or is it a hoax? Both points of view have been expressed in this body. Where do we come down? Let's actually find out if there are people on the Republican side of the aisle who are willing to say climate change is real. My moose up in New Hampshire, one could say, are suffering unprecedented infestations of ticks because there is no snow for them to fall off and die, and the moose are getting overwhelmed. We could say that in the University of Oklahoma, the leading dean is an IPCC member and led the establishment of Climate Central. One could go to the Carolina coasts and hear from the coastal agencies about sea level rise. One could go to Arizona and hear about the desertification and the drought. We can go all over the place and find these things, and they are real. We have to have this conversation. It has to begin with as simple a proposition as this. Then, I hope if we can build off this if we can find a few Republican Senators who will say publicly that climate change is real. We can then go on to if it is real, let's have a conversation about what we do about it, because recklessly continuing to dump megatons of carbon into the atmosphere every year is not a solution. And I don't want to be a part of a generation of which our kids and our grandchildren look back and ask: Where were they? Why could they not address this question? There they were in this great deliberative body. There they were with this great issue of our time. Why would they not even discuss it? So I hope this amendment gets the conversation under way. It is one I look forward to. I think there are very sensible ways to solve this problem, including ways that have been supported by everyone from Republican Secretaries of the Treasury to the lead economist for Ronald Reagan, the famous Mr. Laffer. There are ways we can make these adjustments. But we have to have the conversation, and I hope this begins it. With that, I yield the floor. Again, I thank the distinguished chairman of the energy committee for her courtesy in allowing us to proceed. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska. Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I thank my colleague. I think discussions we have had just in the past hour here since we have had the vote and the various amendments we now have pending before us--this is a good conversation. This is a good discussion and debate for us to be having as a body. We haven't had energy-related issues brought before this floor in some years now. We had a very limited debate on Keystone back in December, but I am hopeful that with the opportunity for amendments--and again, not just some amendments we on our side have handpicked and then decided what the Democrats might be able to move on their side--an opportunity for some real issues to be brought forward and to be debated on this floor. The Senator from Rhode Island is very passionate on the issue of climate change. I think it is fair to say that he has singlehandedly raised the awareness not only in this body but for those loyal followers on C-SPAN. When it comes to the issue of climate change, I think the Senator comes up once a week with his charts and a series of speeches that I think is meant to educate colleagues. I don't agree with all of it. I think that is a fair statement to say. But what is equally fair is that there is a care and concern for not only our country and our country's environment--truly the public [[Page S272]] safety of our people, a care for our land, the stewardship we have as Americans--but it goes well beyond our borders to that of our entire globe, our entire planet, and how we care for planet Earth and how we move forward responsibly. One aspect of the energy debate that I continue to advance is that we must ensure that if we are to make advances when it comes to caring for our environment and truly the whole issue of global climate, we have to be a nation that is economically secure in the sense that the technologies we will have to help us be cleaner in all that we do, do not come without cost. Here in this country, we have been the leaders, we have been the innovators when it comes to clean-energy technologies, and we should challenge ourselves every day to do more in that regard, to build out, to push out that R&D so that we are making--whether it is making clean coal truly clean, whether it is advancing those clean energy technologies. I, for one, coming from a fossil fuel-producing State, am a huge proponent of nuclear-powered generation in this country because I believe very strongly that it is the cleanest energy source we have at this point in time. So what are we doing in this country to make sure our energy is abundant, affordable, clean, diverse, and secure? These are the challenges I put out to my colleagues. I clearly appreciate the need that we have in this body and in this country to be moving forward with technologies that allow us to have reduced emissions, to have a cleaner environment, but I also want to make sure we do so in a way that doesn't cripple our economy. So how we lead in this way, which I believe we must, while keeping our economy where it must be--in the front and moving forward all the time--is our great challenge. Again, I look forward to the debate we will have. I am pleased we were able to process the amendments we had before us today. I look forward to advancing those that we have pending in front of us now and to good, continued, and robust discussion on this floor. I note the majority leader is here, and I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 9 (Tuesday, January 20, 2015)] [Senate] [Pages S260-S272] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] KEYSTONE XL PIPELINE ACT--Continued The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey. Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, parliamentary inquiry: I understand we are on the bill. The PRESIDING OFFICER. We are on the bill. Mr. MENENDEZ. I thank the Presiding Officer. Mr. President, let me say that I rise in general opposition to the Keystone Pipeline, and I rise in favor of Senator Markey's amendment. After long and careful deliberation--and after having had the benefit of a hearing on the pipeline in the Senate Foreign Relations Committee--I have decided to oppose this bill for four basic reasons. First, on the bill, I am deeply concerned that if approved this pipeline will be the first of many pipelines opening one of the largest sources of carbon on Earth to exploitation. Second, contrary to what many believe, I am convinced this pipeline will simply not enhance, help or--in any positive way--improve our energy profile. Third, in my view, it is completely absurd for Congress to take the role of permitting pipelines. It is a role we have never assumed and should not assume now. Fourth, I believe it is ridiculous that our Republican colleagues insist on language banning eminent domain for national parks legislation but oppose it when it comes to foreign or private projects such as Keystone. Furthermore, we cannot underestimate the environmental impacts of this pipeline. The facts are clear. The resource in Alberta is enormous; the tar sands formation is the size of Iowa; tar sands oil is 17 percent more greenhouse gas intensive than other forms of oil because it takes an enormous industrial process to extract it. It has been estimated that if this resource were fully exploited, it would release more carbon dioxide in the air than the United States has emitted in its entire history. As James Hansen, one of the foremost climate scientists in the world, has said, building the Keystone pipeline would be ``game over for the planet.'' There are also more local risks. Over the weekend, landowners are seeing the pipeline spill in the Yellowstone River in Montana. It is happening right now, and landowners are wondering if their family farm will be the victim of a similar spill, wondering if property that has been in their family for generations can still be farmed and passed on to the next generation. While some jobs will be created by the pipeline, the fact is--after 2 years of construction--it will create only 35 permanent jobs--35. That is not a lot of jobs. If we want to create millions of permanent infrastructure jobs, I urge the supporters of the pipeline to support our efforts to increase transportation funding. I urge them to continue incentives for clean energy. I ask them to do all they can to help local governments rebuild local infrastructure systems. That is how we create permanent jobs that build our economy and help us keep our competitive advantage. By comparison, the number of jobs created by Keystone is hardly an argument for passage of this legislation. As you all know, we also have the issue of eminent domain--the power of any governmental entity to take private property and convert it to public use subject to reasonable compensation. Many, including some of my most conservative friends on the other side, were outraged by the idea that eminent domain proceedings could be used to seize private property for private gain. I have been working very closely with Senator Cantwell on an amendment, and we agree with our conservative colleagues that using eminent domain proceedings for private gain is pretty outrageous. Here, on the issue of Keystone, a foreign-owned company is using eminent domain to seize private property so it can better export Canadian oil--a foreign-owned company using eminent domain to seize private property so it can better export Canadian oil. The project is not in the public interest but clearly in the private interest. Senator Cantwell and I feel this amendment should be a no-brainer--an easy amendment every Senator can support. In recent years Republicans have insisted on similar language prohibiting the use of eminent domain when we establish national parks. If eminent domain cannot be used to establish a national park in the public interest to conserve our national treasures and preserve America's beauty for future generations, then surely--surely--it should not be used to benefit private interests; in this case, in the interest of a foreign-owned oil company seeking to ship its product around the world, which brings me to the amendment of the Senator from Massachusetts. Amendment No. 13 We know the oil that will flow through this pipeline will flow directly to foreign markets. That is why I support the amendment from the Senator from Massachusetts. Foreign oil is not subject to America's crude oil export ban, but whether it is shipped as crude or refined here and then exported, we all know this oil is not going to help the American consumers. The intent of the Markey amendment can be summed up very simply, using an old adage that President Reagan was fond of: ``Trust but verify.'' For months now supporters of the Keystone XL Pipeline have been telling us the tar sands that will travel through the United States will help advance our energy security. They have been telling us the pipeline will bring a reliable source of fuel from a close ally and that it will reduce prices at the pump, helping U.S. consumers and businesses. The Markey amendment does nothing more than confirm the promises made--time and time again--by supporters of the pipeline. It would require the tar sands that travel through the United States stay in the United States. It says that if Americans are to accept all of the downsides of the pipeline, if U.S. property owners are to have their lands taken away for TransCanada's benefit, if Americans are forced to live with the risk of an oilspill of dirty tar sands that we do not even know how to clean up properly, then the very least we can do is get a guarantee in law that the United States will reap the benefits that come with all of these risks. So all this amendment does is put into writing the promises we have heard over and over again from supporters of the pipeline. It codifies in law what we previously had to take on faith. I thank my colleague from Massachusetts for offering the amendment, and I would note he has a long history of working to improve America's energy security. He and I have worked closely since he came to the Senate to protect the longstanding requirement that U.S.-produced crude oil stay here at home to benefit the U.S. consumer rather than being shipped across the globe. This amendment is another commonsense protection to make sure our Nation's energy policy is aimed at helping consumers rather than helping oil companies' bottom line, and I encourage my colleagues to support it. For the last several Congresses I have introduced the American Oil for American Families Act, a bill to ensure that oil or petroleum products that originate within America's public lands or waters are not exported as crude or in refined form. That bill would increase our energy supply at home, lowering prices for consumers and businesses, and I intend to reintroduce that legislation in this Congress. For these reasons, I urge my colleagues to support the Markey amendment. I intend to vote against the bill, which in my view is nothing more than an earmark for Big Oil. The pipeline will have enormous environmental impacts, it will not significantly help the American economy, it will not benefit American consumers, and it will needlessly harm landowners for generations. With that, I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas. State of the Union Address Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, tonight the President of the United States will address the Nation on the state of our Union and talk a little bit about his priorities for the coming year. [[Page S261]] I am not sure how much more there is for the President to say than has already been leaked in the press in the drip, drip, drip of social media and other stories, but I am concerned he simply did not get the message that was delivered loud and clear on November 4 by the American voters. Just a couple of months ago they sent a message that was loud and it was clear. They are fed up with the way things operate in Washington, DC. They are fed up with the dysfunction, and they are fed up with the lack of real leadership that focuses on their concerns, not Washington's concerns--concerns such as more money in their pocket. I was amused to listen to our good friend, our colleague from New Jersey, complaining about additional exports of oil or actually gasoline and other fuel. It is actually the supply, the glut of gasoline onto the global markets that has caused a pay raise for most hard-working, middle-class families. The price of gasoline has plummeted because of the glut of supply. But we ought to be focused like a laser on how we put more money into the pocketbook of hard-working American taxpayers--after years of stagnant jobs and stagnant wages, the stagnant number of jobs for the record number of Americans who have been looking for them. So after sending a message loud and clear on November 4, what is the President's response? He says more of the same. He is set to announce a $320 billion tax hike and hundreds of billions of dollars in more spending--yes, hundreds of billions of dollars more in taxes and hundreds of billions of dollars in more Federal spending. Sadly, the President has doubled down on the same agenda which, in his own words, was on the ballot this last fall and was soundly rejected. But this agenda and these policies are not only wrong for America today, they are certainly wrong for the America of our future. Future generations deserve a country that provides them more opportunity than our parents had or than we have. That is called the American dream. But hundreds of billions of dollars in new spending and new taxes--when we already face an $18 trillion debt--well, that makes the American promise one unlikely to be fulfilled. The cause of this problem is pretty clear: The President remains focused on the priorities in Washington, DC, and not on the priorities of hard-working American taxpayers working from paycheck to paycheck, dealing with rising costs of living when it comes to food and other commodities and who are sorely in need of additional money in their pocket. Things clearly need to change. That to me was what the voters said on November 4. I think I speak for many Americans and many Texans when I say: Mr. President, enough is enough. The American people expect better, and, more importantly, they deserve better. Sure, we know there are always going to be big challenges, and they are not easy to deal with by any stretch of the imagination. But surely--surely--we can come up with better solutions than more taxes and more spending. This is really doubling down over the last 6 years. One would think that the President, giving the State of the Union now in his seventh year in office, could come up with something a little bit different, particularly after his own party lost nine Senate seats after this referendum on his failed policies that took place on November 4. The great news--and there is good news--is we do not have to start from scratch. We need to look no further than some of the laboratories of democracy--that is what Louis Brandeis called the State: the laboratories of democracy--to see what actually works. We know what does not work. So let's look and see what does work. We could learn a lot from States such as Arizona, where the Presiding Officer is from, and my home State of Texas. We are not perfect, but I think we have learned a few important lessons we could teach to the policymakers in the White House. Many policymakers in Washington seem to have forgotten the secret sauce, the formula, the recipe by which strong, sustainable economic growth that lifts the middle class in Texas and in so many other States across the country--why that is alive and well and why those policies actually work. Just last Friday I had the opportunity to visit Southeast Texas. I was in Beaumont, TX, actually, where the existing gulf coast leg of the Keystone Pipeline is already operating. I bet many of my colleagues would be amazed to know that we are already transporting Canadian crude from Canada all the way across the country, by and large on railcars, to refineries on the gulf coast. The Keystone XL Pipeline--the legislation that we will be voting on today-- will increase the supply, which means more product, and hopefully, that will result in downward pressure on prices for hard-working American taxpayers. While the President stood in the way of the building of this completed pipeline and the tens of thousands of jobs it would support, the gulf coast leg of the Keystone Pipeline in Texas is already booming. But they are hungry for more crude feedstock so they can produce more and thereby create more jobs. It has been good for communities. I talked to the mayor of Beaumont and other communities. I talked to a county judge. These taxes, which are provided by investment from the Keystone XL Pipeline, not only create good jobs, but the tax base is necessary to educate our kids in K-12 education. They provide the products and services from local businesses that sell goods. In other words, projects such as the Keystone XL Pipeline is a force multiplier when it comes to our economy and economic growth and opportunity, and of course, it has been good for thousands of construction workers who built the pipeline. I heard our colleagues on the other side of the aisle try to denigrate these construction jobs. They say that they are just temporary jobs. Mr. President, you and I have a temporary job. We are elected for a term of office, and if we are not reelected, it is a temporary job. In effect, every job is a temporary job. But to denigrate these good, high-paying construction jobs, including those performed by welders--in Texas, properly trained welders can make $140,000 to $150,000 a year. Those are good, high-paying jobs, and we ought to respect and encourage them. That is just one example of how some of the folks at the White House look down their nose at these construction jobs and try to denigrate the economic contribution of projects such as the Keystone XL Pipeline and what they could learn from this project. In my State we reduced taxes, cut red tape in favor of sensible regulations, and encouraged businesses to come to Texas to grow and create jobs. If I heard the story one time, I heard it 100 times. In my State, Governor Perry has contacted people in California and said: Come to Texas, where you are welcome and the cost of doing business is lower and the cost of living is cheaper. You can actually buy an affordable home for your family. People have voted with their feet and have come where the opportunity is. If we add it all up, over the last 6 years two-thirds of all new net jobs created in the United States of America came from just one State, and that is my home State. Another thing Washington could learn from Texas is how to balance a budget. We actually balance our budget every year. Earlier I mentioned that the President seems to be proud of the fact that the deficit is actually going down. As the Presiding Officer knows, that is the annual difference between what we take in and what we spend. What he doesn't tell you is that we are actually adding to the debt every year because we are still spending more money than we are bringing in, and it has now gone up about $8 trillion during his administration to an unprecedented $18 trillion national debt. We need to roll up our sleeves, and we invite the President to join us and take on the priorities of hard-working American taxpayers in every State across the country. We know this is not going to be easy, but that is what we volunteered for. I know there are colleagues here in the Senate--Republicans and Democrats alike--who are eager to address the challenges that confront our country--whether it is economic, national security, or you name it. These are things that need to get done. At the end of the day, it doesn't really matter what I think the State of our [[Page S262]] Union is or, for that matter, it doesn't really matter what the President thinks the State of our Union is. What matters is whether the teacher in Katy, TX, believes his students will have the opportunities he did growing up or whether the single mom waiting tables in Fort Worth can find enough work to feed her family. Our Nation is truly strong when its people believe it to be, and I hope the President understands that and tries something new rather than the same old failed policies of the past. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Portman). The Senator from Minnesota. Mr. FRANKEN. I thank the Presiding Officer. Amendment No. 17 I wish to urge my colleagues to oppose any motion to table my amendment. My amendment is about making sure that, if we do build the Keystone XL Pipeline, it is built with American iron and steel. Those are jobs. I don't wish to short-circuit the process here, but if the pipeline is built, it should be built with American steel. The Presiding Officer's State produces a lot of American steel and very often with iron ore from my State. These are American jobs. TransCanada has said that 50 percent of the iron and steel will be outsourced from other countries, and the iron and steel for some of the other pipes could come from other countries. They also said they can use those pipes in other projects, including other projects in Canada. I agree with Senator Cornyn when he said these construction jobs that will help build the pipeline are real jobs. Just because they are not permanent jobs does not mean they are not real jobs. Providing the iron and steel and other manufactured products for this project will also provide real jobs. Our amendment will do this entirely and consistently within the language of the bill and within our trade obligations. I ask that my colleagues not vote to table this amendment because a vote to table this is a vote against American jobs. It is a vote against jobs in Ohio and Minnesota. It is a vote against the shippers who ship our iron ore over the Great Lakes or by rail or over the Mississippi so it can be used to make steel. We have done ``Buy America'' legislation before. We just did it in 2013 on the WRDA bill. I ask that my colleagues please not vote against American jobs. I thank the Presiding Officer. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska. Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I will take a couple of minutes before we vote to speak to the Franken amendment. I think all of us want to buy American and buy local whenever and wherever we can. We strongly support that since it does mean jobs--whether we are talking about a pipeline or otherwise. But I think the bigger question here--and what we have in front of us with the Keystone XL Pipeline--is what this amendment would do. This amendment would mandate specific materials for the Keystone XL pipeline, and I think we need to put this into context. This pipeline is a private project. This is not a federally funded infrastructure project. This would be the first time that Congress has directed or forced private parties to purchase domestic goods and materials. We actually asked the Congressional Research Service to look into this to see if there was any other instance at the Federal level where private parties were told that they must purchase 100-percent domestic goods and materials, and so far the answer to that inquiry has been that they can find no instance of that. I think we need to be careful about this as a precedent because if we are going to direct this particular project--the Keystone XL--to have this requirement on it, where do we go next? What will happen to the next project that we have? Will it be the next pipeline or the next renewable energy project? Where does this slippery slope go? I think it is fair to note that TransCanada has made a commitment to have 75 percent of the pipes for this project come from North America, and fully half of that--more than 332,000 tons of steel will come from the State of Arkansas. I am with the Senator from Minnesota. We want to make sure we get as many jobs as we absolutely can and make sure they are good-paying jobs--whether it is in steel making or widget making or welders. This is about jobs. This is what we want to do to encourage jobs. I think we need to be very cognizant of what this particular amendment would do. This amendment--for the first time ever--would direct a private entity to utilize all American-made products throughout the process of the construction. It is important to note that the American Iron and Steel Institute has been a strong supporter of the Keystone XL Pipeline. We have all received a letter--they called it a Steelgram--from the American Iron and Steel Institute. They let us know very clearly and in no uncertain terms that they support Keystone XL. They said it is essential that Congress act to ensure the approval of the Keystone XL Pipeline without further delay. Again, I agree. We need to get moving on it. We need to do it without delay. I do think it is interesting to note that the amendment does allow for the President to waive the requirements for American materials based on certain findings he can make. I appreciate that is in there, and I think that is good. But think about where we are. It has been 3,200- and-some-odd days now where we have been waiting for the President to act to make a decision on the Keystone XL Pipeline. So I don't have any real confidence that he will move to act quickly on any kind of a waiver requirement. I just wanted to put that out there before we moved to take up the amendments that we have pending before us this afternoon and note that we will be doing that in a few short minutes. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota. Mr. FRANKEN. Mr. President, I have the greatest respect for the Senator from Alaska. I wish to say a few things about this private company. This company is asking us to do an extraordinary thing. We are debating this on the floor because they are asking us to circumvent the environmental and safety process here and possibly expose the United States--and the path of this pipeline--to tremendous environmental damage. This is very different. The Senator asked: Why won't this extend to every private enterprise? This is something we are here debating and voting on, and that should say something about the nature of this issue. The United Steelworkers have endorsed my amendment. This is about American jobs. The question is: If we do build this pipeline, should it be built with American steel or should it be built with steel from other countries? Again, in the bill, we make sure this is compliant with our trade obligations. There is nothing to stop us from doing this. This is a private foreign company that is asking us to circumvent our normal processes, and because of that, I feel we have the right to say this should be made with American steel and with jobs in the State of Ohio and in the State of Minnesota--American jobs. If this is about American jobs, let's make it about American jobs. Again, this is a company that is asking us to circumvent our normal processes. So all I will say is that TransCanada has said the pipes that have been made for this can be used in other projects in Canada. If we are going to build this project, let's make it about American jobs. I thank the Presiding Officer. Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise today to talk about jobs-- especially jobs in the U.S. steel industry. This November I went to a ceremony at Sparrows Point a former steel plant in Maryland. It was a bittersweet day. I was there to honor the legacy of Bethlehem Steel and all of the Steelworkers in Baltimore. The site is being demolished but Sparrows Point has over 3,000 acres of land, access to ports, rails, and roads to attract companies to create jobs today and tomorrow. We don't have steel in Maryland anymore. Many of us still mourn its loss. But we still have steel in America and I am still for steel. If this Keystone bill is really a jobs bill, then let us put some made-in-America jobs in it and show our support for American steel. [[Page S263]] For over a hundred years, workers at Sparrows Point produced the steel that built America. Members of my own family worked at this steel mill. My father would open the doors to his grocery store early so that Bethlehem Steel workers could pick up their lunch on their way to work. America's steel and steelworkers protect the United States and our freedom. At Sparrows Point, they rolled gun barrels, made steel for grenades, shells and landing craft during World War II. God help us all if America stops making steel. During times of war-- will we depend on foreign steel to build our ships, aircraft carriers and weapons? American steelworkers work hard, play by the rules and serve their country. In war: building ships, tanks and weapons. In peace: making steel for our buildings and cars. Yet for over 50 years, the steel industry withered--not because steel was unproductive or overpriced. The steel industry withered in America because Congress didn't do everything possible to protect American steel from factors in the international steel market, raw material costs, slumping demand, low steels prices, and a global recession. The government looked the other way when foreign imports began to drive down our prices and drive down our steel mills. Our government singles out specific industries all the time when it is in our national interest. We single out specific industries and then talk about their value to America. I agree with that. We single out industries when it is in our national interest because we need them as part of our economy or as part of our national production. Helping the farmers or the airlines because of the national interest means national responsibility. In 2008, we bailed out the banks and we bailed out the auto industry for stability, security, and American independence. Where is the help for the steel industry and the steelworkers? I have fought for steel in the past. Now I am fighting for steel again. I fought so hard year after year to protect the lives and livelihoods in Baltimore, in Dundalk. I have fought for more than 25 years to reverse this tide against American manufacturing and against American steel. I am going to keep on fighting. I fought to keep Sparrows Point open. And when that wasn't possible, I fought for a safety net for workers Trade Adjustment Assistance, unemployment insurance and health care benefits. I think about Maryland steelworkers every day--what they are going through these past few years have been tough on workers, their families, and the community. I am supporting an amendment that protects American steel like steel has protected us. It is simple. Let us put American workers back to work in good, solid steel jobs, by requiring that the pipeline's construction, connection, operation, and maintenance all be done with made-in-America, U.S. steel. Let us get to work for American workers and let us put the jobs in this jobs bill. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska. Amendment No. 3, as Modified Ms. MURKOWSKI.

Amendment No. 13 Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, at this time I call for regular order with respect to Markey amendment No. 13. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment is now pending. Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I move to table the Markey amendment and ask for the yeas and nays. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There is a sufficient second. Mr. MARKEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to be recognized for 1 minute. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? There is a unanimous consent request. Is there objection? The Senator from Alaska. Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I have a parliamentary inquiry. Is there a request from the Senator from Massachusetts to speak to this amendment for 1 minute? What is the request? The PRESIDING OFFICER. He asked unanimous consent to speak for 1 minute. Mr. MARKEY. To this amendment. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The Senator from Massachusetts is recognized. Mr. MARKEY. Mr. President, this is a motion to table the Markey amendment, which is an amendment to have every Member of the Senate be put on record as to whether or not the oil coming through the Keystone Pipeline [[Page S266]] is then exported out of the United States. Each Member of the Senate should be recorded on that issue. We import 5 million barrels of oil per day into the United States. We should not allow the Canadians to use the United States as a straw to be able to then go down to the Gulf of Mexico and send that oil out of the country. We export young men and women over to the Middle East in order to protect oil coming in from Saudi Arabia and Kuwait. This is a chance to keep oil in America so we don't have to export it. I do not believe the appropriate vote for Members is to support a tabling of the Markey amendment so that we don't actually reach the heart of this substantive issue, which is that we should be working to have energy independence in America. When we are importing 5 million barrels of oil a day from Russia, Saudi Arabia, and Kuwait, we are in no way independent. I thank the Presiding Officer for the opportunity to speak. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the motion. The yeas and nays have previously been ordered. The clerk will call the roll. The assistant legislative clerk called the roll. Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the Senator from Nevada (Mr. Reid) is necessarily absent. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Lankford). Are there any other Senators in the Chamber desiring to vote? The result was announced--yeas 57, nays 42, as follows: [Rollcall Vote No. 4 Leg.] YEAS--57 Alexander Ayotte Barrasso Blunt Boozman Burr Capito Cassidy Coats Cochran Collins Corker Cornyn Cotton Crapo Cruz Daines Enzi Ernst Fischer Flake Gardner Graham Grassley Hatch Heitkamp Heller Hoeven Inhofe Isakson Johnson Kirk Lankford Lee Manchin McCain McConnell Moran Murkowski Paul Perdue Portman Risch Roberts Rounds Rubio Sasse Scott Sessions Shelby Sullivan Thune Tillis Toomey Vitter Warner Wicker NAYS--42 Baldwin Bennet Blumenthal Booker Boxer Brown Cantwell Cardin Carper Casey Coons Donnelly Durbin Feinstein Franken Gillibrand Heinrich Hirono Kaine King Klobuchar Leahy Markey McCaskill Menendez Merkley Mikulski Murphy Murray Nelson Peters Reed Sanders Schatz Schumer Shaheen Stabenow Tester Udall Warren Whitehouse Wyden NOT VOTING--1 Reid The motion was agreed to. Ms. MURKOWSKI. I move to reconsider the vote. Mr. WICKER. I move to lay that motion on the table. The motion to lay on the table was agreed to. Vote on Amendment No. 17 Ms. MURKOWSKI. I now move to table the Franken amendment, No. 17, and I ask for the yeas and nays. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There is a sufficient second. The question is on agreeing to the motion. The clerk will call the roll. The assistant legislative clerk called the roll. Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the Senator from Nevada (Mr. Reid) is necessarily absent. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Are there any other Senators in the Chamber desiring to vote?

Ms. MURKOWSKI. I move to reconsider the vote. Mr. BURR. I move to lay that motion on the table. The motion to lay on the table was agreed to. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska. Amendment No. 3, as Modified Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator Shaheen be recognized to speak for 1 minute and that Senator Portman be recognized to speak for 1 minute. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is so ordered. The Senator from New Hampshire. Mrs. SHAHEEN. Mr. President, I join my colleague Senator Portman from Ohio in a bipartisan amendment on energy efficiency. This is a very short version that passed overwhelmingly in the House last year. It doesn't pick favorites in terms of fuel sources, and it is good for every region of the country. This is something we all ought to be able to get behind. I am very pleased and hope we get a very strong vote in the Senate. I am pleased to support this amendment, and I thank my colleague from Ohio, Senator Portman, for his leadership. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio. Mr. PORTMAN. The Senator from New Hampshire said it well. This is a no-brainer. It is three relatively small provisions, one of which is very timely with regard to water heaters, about which we are very concerned. I ask that we move on this amendment in a bipartisan way. It has already passed the House, so it shouldn't be controversial over there either. We hope we will be able to bring the larger legislation to the floor in the future, but this is a good downpayment. Ms. MURKOWSKI. I know of no further debate on the amendment. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment, as modified. Mr. WICKER. I ask for the yeas and nays. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There appears to be a sufficient second. The clerk will call the roll. The legislative clerk called the roll. Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the Senator from Nevada (Mr. Reid) is necessarily absent. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Are there any other Senators in the Chamber desiring to vote? The result was announced--yeas 94, nays 5, as follows: [Rollcall Vote No. 6 Leg.] YEAS--94 Alexander Ayotte Baldwin Barrasso Bennet Blumenthal Blunt Booker Boozman Boxer Brown Burr Cantwell Capito Cardin Carper Casey Cassidy Coats Cochran Collins Coons Corker Cornyn Cotton Crapo Daines Donnelly Durbin Enzi Ernst Feinstein Fischer Flake Franken Gardner Gillibrand Graham Grassley Hatch Heinrich Heitkamp Heller Hirono Hoeven Inhofe Isakson Johnson Kaine King Kirk Klobuchar Leahy Manchin Markey McCain McCaskill McConnell Menendez Merkley Mikulski Moran Murkowski Murphy Murray Nelson Perdue Peters Portman Reed Risch Roberts Rounds Rubio Sanders Schatz Schumer Scott Sessions Shaheen Shelby Stabenow Sullivan Tester Thune Tillis Toomey Udall Vitter Warner Warren Whitehouse Wicker Wyden [[Page S267]] NAYS--5 Cruz Lankford Lee Paul Sasse NOT VOTING--1 Reid The amendment (No. 3), as modified, was agreed to. Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote. Mrs. FISCHER. I move to lay that motion on the table. The motion to lay on the table was agreed to. Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, we have disposed of three pending amendments that were before us. As we mentioned earlier, we are looking forward to Members coming down to the floor to offer their amendments. We have agreed to a process here this afternoon. Today will be a somewhat truncated day on the Senate floor because of the State of the Union Address, but it is our hope that we will be able to get three amendments pending on our side and three amendments pending on the Democrats' side. The Senator from Nebraska, Mrs. Fischer, is prepared to speak to her amendment, and then we will move to the other side of the aisle. After that, I will be calling up an amendment from Senator Lee. We will then go to the Democratic side and come back here for a third round. Just to give Members an idea of what we will have in front of us, we will not be having votes on these amendments today, but I do think it should be clear to Members that we will be looking forward to doing a similar series of votes tomorrow. So I would encourage folks to come to the floor, talk to us, and let's get this process moving. With that, Mr. President, I yield to the Senator from Nebraska. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska. Amendment No. 18 to Amendment No. 2 Mrs. FISCHER. Mr. President, I call up my amendment No. 18. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report. The assistant legislative clerk read as follows: The Senator from Nebraska [Mrs. Fischer] proposes an amendment numbered 18 to amendment No. 2. Mrs. FISCHER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the amendment be dispensed with. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The amendment is as follows: (Purpose: To provide limits on the designation of new federally protected land) At the end of the bill, add the following: SEC. __. LIMITATION ON DESIGNATION OF NEW FEDERALLY PROTECTED LAND. (a) Definition of Federally Protected Land.--In this section, the term ``federally protected land'' means any area designated or acquired by the Federal Government for the purpose of conserving historic, cultural, environmental, scenic, recreational, developmental, or biological resources. (b) Findings Required.--New federally protected land shall not be designated unless the Secretary, prior to the designation, publishes in the Federal Register-- (1) a finding that the addition of the new federally protected land would not have a negative impact on the administration of existing federally protected land; and (2) a finding that, as of the date of the finding, sufficient resources are available to effectively implement management plans for existing units of federally protected land. Mrs. FISCHER. Mr. President, this amendment would create limitations for new Federal land designations to ensure responsible management of our natural resources. These limitations are modeled on those in the National Marine Sanctuaries Act, which authorizes the protection of national marine sanctuaries. Under the act, the Commerce Secretary cannot designate a new sanctuary unless the Secretary publishes a finding that, No. 1, the addition of a new sanctuary will not have a negative impact on the overall system, and No. 2, sufficient resources were available in the fiscal year in which the finding is made to effectively implement management plans for each sanctuary in the system. These are commonsense limitations that ensure the administration will not add more land to the Federal system without considering the impacts to the overall system and without sufficient funds to manage those resources effectively. At a time when the national park system has a $13 billion maintenance backlog, we need to consider the impacts to the overall system and whether there are sufficient resources to effectively manage additional land holdings. In the context of energy policy, we should also consider our stewardship choices. American energy production on private and State- owned lands has increased significantly in recent years while decreasing on Federal lands. Through leasing restrictions and permitting delays, the Obama administration has tied up energy production on Federal lands in redtape. Since 2009 oil production on Federal lands is down by 6 percent, and natural gas production on Federal lands is down 28 percent. Meanwhile, oil production on non- Federal land has risen by 61 percent, and natural gas production on non-Federal land is up by 33 percent. By limiting Federal land designations, more land should continue to be held privately or managed by States and local governments, increasing the opportunity for productive and beneficial use. Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington. Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, as we go back and forth on offering amendments, I wish to turn to the Senator from Hawaii for him to offer his amendment. Mr. SCHATZ. I thank the Senator from Washington. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Hawaii. Amendment No. 58 to Amendment No. 2 Mr. SCHATZ. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate set aside the pending amendment in order to call up amendment No. 58. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk will report. The assistant legislative clerk read as follows: The Senator from Hawaii [Mr. Schatz] proposes an amendment numbered 58 to amendment No. 2. Mr. SCHATZ. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the amendment be dispensed with. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The amendment is as follows: (Purpose: To express the sense of Congress regarding climate change) At the appropriate place, insert the following: SEC. __. SENSE OF CONGRESS. (a) Findings.--The environmental analysis contained in the Final Supplemental Environmental Impact Statement referred to in section 2(a) and deemed to satisfy the requirements of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (42 U.S.C. 4321 et seq.) as described in section 2(a), states that-- (1) ``[W]arming of the climate system is unequivocal and each of the last [3] decades has been successively warmer at the Earth's surface than any preceding decade since 1850.''; (2) ``The [Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change], in addition to other institutions, such as the National Research Council and the United States (U.S.) Global Change Research Program (USGCRP), have concluded that it is extremely likely that global increases in atmospheric [greenhouse gas] concentrations and global temperatures are caused by human activities.''; and (3) ``A warmer planet causes large-scale changes that reverberate throughout the climate system of the Earth, including higher sea levels, changes in precipitation, and altered weather patterns (e.g. an increase in more extreme weather events).''. (b) Sense of Congress.--Consistent with the findings under subsection (a), it is the sense of Congress that-- (1) climate change is real; and (2) human activity significantly contributes to climate change. Mr. SCHATZ. This amendment affirms something very simple; that is, climate change is real and human activities significantly contribute to climate change. It also states that a warmer planet causes large-scale changes, including higher sea levels, changes in precipitation, and altered weather patterns, such as increases in more extreme weather events. This amendment cites for its evidence the findings of national and international scientific institutions, including the IPCC, the National Research Council, and the U.S. Global Change Research Program. All of these organizations are cited and quoted in the State Department's final supplemental environmental impact statement on Keystone XL Pipeline. This is the same environmental review document that plays a prominent role in the text of the underlying bill, S. 1, and the substitute amendment. [[Page S268]] The purpose of this amendment is simply to acknowledge and restate a set of observable facts. It is not intended to place a value judgment on those facts or to suggest a specific course of action in response to those facts. It is just a set of facts derived from decades of careful study of our land, air, and water. I urge my colleagues to support this amendment. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska. Amendment No. 33 to Amendment No. 2 Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to set aside the pending amendment to call up Senator Lee's amendment No. 33. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk will report. The assistant legislative clerk read as follows: The Senator from Alaska [Ms. Murkowski], for Mr. Lee, proposes an amendment numbered 33 to amendment No. 2. Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the amendment be dispensed with. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The amendment is as follows: (Purpose: To conform citizen suits under the Endangered Species Act of 1973) At the appropriate place, insert the following: SEC. ___. AWARD OF LITIGATION COSTS TO PREVAILING PARTIES IN ACCORDANCE WITH EXISTING LAW. Section 11(g)(4) of the Endangered Species Act of 1973 (16 U.S.C. 1540(g)(4)) is amended by striking ``to any'' and all that follows through the end of the sentence and inserting ``to any prevailing party in accordance with section 2412 of title 28, United States Code.''. Ms. MURKOWSKI. Very briefly on Senator Lee's amendment--he will be here to speak to it--this is a measure which would ensure that the rate of legal fees that are paid in Endangered Species Act cases would be consistent with those in other cases that are eligible for lawyer's fee compensation. Right now there is no cap on the hourly rate lawyers can be paid in connection with lawsuits that are brought regarding violations under the ESA. So this amendment would standardize the award of attorney's fees to parties prevailing against the Federal Government by applying a $125-an-hour rate cap under the Equal Access to Justice Act requirement. This applies to small business-related claims, among other things, and this would apply the same standard to ESA cases. This is a measure Senator Lee will come to the floor to speak to further, but I would just give a little preview of that. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington. Ms. CANTWELL. I would like to call on the Senator from Illinois to offer his amendment. Amendment No. 69 to Amendment No. 2 Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to set aside the pending amendment to call up amendment No. 69. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk will report. The assistant legislative clerk read as follows: The Senator from Illinois [Mr. Durbin] proposes an amendment numbered 69 to amendment No. 2. Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the amendment be dispensed with. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The amendment is as follows: (Purpose: To ensure that the storage and transportation of petroleum coke is regulated in a manner that ensures the protection of public and ecological health) At the appropriate place, insert the following: SEC. ___. REGULATION OF TRANSPORTATION AND STORAGE OF PETROLEUM COKE. This Act shall not take effect prior to the date that-- (1) the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, in consultation with the Secretary of Transportation, promulgates rules concerning the storage and transportation of petroleum coke that ensure the protection of public and ecological health; and (2) petroleum coke is no longer exempt from regulation under section 101(14) of the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980 (42 U.S.C. 9601(14)), which may be established either by an Act of Congress or any regulations, rules, or guidance issued by the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency. Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, about 1 year ago I was invited to go to the southeast part of the city of Chicago. It is an area that used to be populated by steel mills and now there are a lot of struggling families. The manufacturing jobs were not replaced. These are hard-working people--many are Mexican-American people. They sustain what you might expect--great parishes and churches and a great spirit among them, but now they are in a constant struggle. They live in a part of Chicago that has seen better days. They are doing their darndest for their families. They invited me to see something. They wanted me to see what they were living next door to. I went down to that part of the city of Chicago--within the boundaries of the city of Chicago--and I could not believe what I saw. They live in little houses such as these, and across from them is a mountainous gathering of something called petcoke. What is petcoke? If you take the Canadian tar sands that will move through the Keystone XL Pipeline to a refinery and put them through a process where you can end up with a viable product, such as gasoline, jet fuel, diesel fuel or whatever it might be, you have to clean out all of this petcoke that creates the tar sands composition that they are dealing with. When it is all over with--and if the process has been successful-- there is a lot of waste. In fact, there are 61 pounds of petcoke for every barrel of oil. Keep in mind that the Senator who is sponsoring the underlying legislation--we are dealing with moving hundreds of thousands of barrels a day through this pipeline. Now take every one of those barrels and have 61 pounds of petcoke left over as a result of the refining process. What happens to it? This is what happened to it in Chicago. It was dumped in the neighborhood. The people invited me to come to their homes, and I did. I walked into this woman's home, and she said: I have sealed the windows. I taped them shut because this black, sooty petcoke blows through my windows night and day. I cannot stop it. Is it something to worry about? It turns out that the petcoke is not a benign material. We are not talking about dust in the air. We are talking about a composition that includes--according to those who have taken a close look at it--heavy metals. Would you want your baby in your home--or my home or my grandchildren--breathing in this filthy, petcoke-infested dust night and day? They are not making it up. They showed me the window sills, and you could see the black, sooty petcoke. I will tell you the details of the story. The environmental review for the project of Keystone XL notes that communities throughout the Midwest have noticed large piles of petroleum coke--or petcoke-- building up as more and more tar sands are processed. This picture tells a story. This is near a body of water which is carrying this petcoke on the water. These poor folks deal with it as it blows through the air. This type of crude oil is carried by the Keystone XL Pipeline, a pipeline which the Republican majority has decided is their No. 1 priority in the Senate. Under the new Republican majority it is S. 1. This pipeline, on behalf of a Canadian company, TransCanada, is the topic we are facing. We just had a vote and unfortunately could not prevail with the notion that at least the oil that comes out of the pipeline ought to be for the benefit of American consumers. We lost that vote. I think the vote was 57 to 42. It was tabled. Let's talk about the actual process itself. According to the EPA--as I mentioned, the environmental impact statement--every barrel of tar sands contains 61 pounds of petcoke. That means the Keystone XL Pipeline alone will produce 15,400 metric tons of petcoke every day-- 15,400 metric tons of petcoke every day. Would you like to live next door to that? That is what is happening in the city of Chicago, but it not the only one. This petcoke comes from the BP, British Petroleum, refinery in Whiting, IN. It is on the very southern tip of Lake Michigan. We can see it from the city of Chicago. They went through a [[Page S269]] $4 billion upgrade and put in new equipment so they could start processing the Canadian tar sands which will come down through the Keystone XL Pipeline. Soon after they started this processing with $4 billion of new equipment, the people living in this part of Chicago looked out their windows to see the massive piles of petcoke building up, and as a consequence they got worried. They are worried for their children. On windy days--it is, in fact, the ``Windy City''--black clouds of this dust blow from piles into this working-class neighborhood. It always seems to be the case, doesn't it? If somebody tried to put this on the North Shore of Chicago, they would scream bloody murder. But the company that owns this petcoke put it outside a poor neighborhood--a working-class neighborhood in Chicago. The petcoke dust settles on window sills and porches. I met the kids running outside. They are producing 6,000 tons of petcoke every single day at the British Petroleum refinery in Whiting, IN--6,000 tons a day. At that rate the plant only has room to store a few days' worth of production onsite. So they ended up selling the petcoke to a company called KCBX. It is a subsidiary company owned by the Koch brothers--yes, those Koch brothers. Connect the dots. The highest priority of the Republican majority in the Senate was to call up a bill for a Canadian company to transport tar sands across the United States with no promise that the American consumers would ever be able to access it, and the process of refining the Canadian tar sands ends up inuring to the benefit of many companies, such as British Petroleum and KCBX, which again is owned by the Koch brothers. These are the same Koch brothers who are viable political players in our political campaigns. This means the people in southeast Chicago are forced to breathe this dirty air that members of National Nurses United say causes severe health threats. Petcoke contains high levels of heavy metals, such as vanadium and nickel, and dust particles get trapped in residents' lungs, triggering asthma and exacerbating heart and lung conditions. When I go to a school--whether it is rural or urban--I make a point to ask a very basic question: Does any student here know anyone with asthma? Half of the hands are up in every classroom. Our pages are starting to raise their hands, of course. So here we have a national problem, a respiratory problem, which has been made dramatically worse by the byproduct, petcoke, of the Keystone XL Pipeline. That is a fact. What I have argued to you now so far is indisputable. The community and members of the Southeast Environmental Task Force that I visited with in Chicago are fighting back with the help of the National Resources Defense Council. They worked with Mayor Emanuel and Chicago officials to put standards in place for petcoke storage sites that protect public and environmental health. They have come up with a radical notion--if you want to store this dangerous petcoke, then for goodness' sake put it inside a building so it doesn't blow all over the neighborhood. They are suing KCBX and Koch Industries for the damages caused by petcoke piles after the Environmental Protection Agency issued a notice to the company of Clean Air Act violations. The people who hate the EPA like the devil hates holy water do not want them to come in and look at something as outrageous as this and tell you the obvious. This is a public health danger. Petcoke from Canadian tar sands, and part of the Keystone XL Pipeline, is a public health hazard. Unfortunately, petcoke just isn't an issue in Chicago or Illinois. My colleague from Michigan, Senator Gary Peters, told me a story earlier. He can tell you what happened in Detroit when another Koch brothers- owned company decided to store large piles of petcoke on the Detroit River. If you look online, you can still find the YouTube video of black clouds blowing off the piles of the Koch brothers' petcoke into the river. In fact, Senator Peters said that at one point this black cloud was so dense it obscured the Ambassador Bridge between the United States and Canada. You could not see it. It took years of complaints and lawsuits from local communities to get shipping ports in California to require piles of petcoke that was being stored there to be kept in enclosed facilities and covered at all times. Other communities continue to fight, including my city of Chicago, which I am proud to represent. As the U.S. refines more and more tar sands--that is what this bill is all about, refining more and more Canadian tar sands. Every single day tons of this petcoke is produced with no end in sight and no way of protecting the people who live around that area from the damage it will cause to the lungs of children and other vulnerable people, such as elderly people with respiratory challenges. Residents in Houston, TX, and the State of Ohio have complained about how these petcoke piles stored in their neighborhoods are damaging their homes and health, but many Americans affected by petcoke don't have the money or power to take on big companies, so it is up to Congress. It is up to us to ensure that every person in America--rich or poor, whether they live in a good neighborhood or a struggling neighborhood--has the protection against public health hazards. There is a current exemption of petcoke from environmental laws. When you think of all of the things blowing in the air, how in the world did petcoke end up being treated like fairy dust? It is exempt from laws relating to basic things, such as the Superfund. It is exempt from laws relating to hazardous waste and materials. They must have had friends in high places to make sure this miserable source of respiratory problems would be exempt from Federal law. My amendment would change that. It would end this exemption so they would be held to environmental and public health standards when it comes to this miserable byproduct of Canadian tar sands and the Keystone XL Pipeline. My amendment goes on to require the EPA and the Department of Transportation to implement rules for petcoke storage and transportation to protect the public health and environment. Is there anyone here who will tell you that the folks, TransCanada or those refining this, should not have that responsibility? I would not want to see this anywhere. I would not want to see it in Alaska, and I would not want to see it in Oklahoma. I sure don't want to even see it in the city of Chicago. But to think it goes unregulated--absolutely unregulated--is amazing, and that is what my amendment addresses. The United States already produces millions of tons of petcoke each year. Building this pipeline is just going to add dramatically to that amount. By fixing the legal status of petcoke and making it subject to the same laws as all other dangerous materials, we can help ensure that clean air and clean water is something everyone enjoys, whether they are rich or poor and no matter what State they happen to live in. I hope the Senate will have a chance to vote on my amendment to close this loophole for petcoke and establish reasonable guidelines for handling the material. It is time we put the health and well-being of Americans ahead of the profits of any industry involved in the processing of Canadian tar sands because no community--especially the southeast side of Chicago-- should be considered a dumping ground for companies to make money off the lungs and health of vulnerable children, elderly, and poor people. No family should be forced to live next door to a three-story-high pile of petcoke, and that is what is going on. No kid should have to move from a ball field to play inside so they are not exposed to hazardous chemicals. I know what will happen. Somebody is going to make a motion to table this amendment. We can run, but we can't hide, just as we can run, but we can't hide from blowing petcoke. If my colleagues won't allow a vote on this amendment to classify this as a material that should be regulated for the safety of the environment and public health, they will be on record if they vote to table this amendment. I urge my colleagues--even if they dearly love the Keystone XL Pipeline [[Page S270]] and even if they can't wait to bring in the Canadian tar sands--think about this as if this were your hometown, your neighborhood, and you lived in a house such as this and you looked across the road at that miserable pile, three stories high, of petcoke blowing in for your children and your grandchildren to breathe every day. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska. Amendment No. 41 to Amendment No. 2 Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, at this time I ask unanimous consent to set aside the pending amendment to call up the Toomey amendment No. 41. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk will report. The assistant legislative clerk read as follows: The Senator from Alaska, [Ms. Murkowski], for Mr. Toomey, for himself, Mr. Casey, and Mr. Hatch, proposes an amendment numbered 41 to amendment No. 2. Ms. MURKOWSKI. I ask unanimous consent that reading of the amendment be dispensed with. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The amendment is as follows: (Purpose: To continue cleaning up fields and streams while protecting neighborhoods, generating affordable energy, and creating jobs) At the appropriate place, insert the following: SEC. __. STANDARDS FOR COAL REFUSE POWER PLANTS. (a) Findings.--Congress finds that-- (1) 19th-century mining operations left behind more than 2,000,000,000 tons of coal refuse on surface land in various coal mining regions of the United States; (2) coal refuse piles-- (A) pose significant environmental risks; (B) have contaminated more than 180,000 acres of land and streams; and (C) are susceptible to fires that endanger public health and emit an estimated 9,000,000 tons of carbon dioxide each year, in addition to other uncontrolled pollutants; (3) the Environmental Protection Agency, the Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement, and the Department of Environmental Protection of the State of Pennsylvania recognize the significant public health benefits of power plants that use coal refuse as fuel; (4) since the inception of coal refuse power plants, the plants have removed 210,000,000 tons of coal refuse and restored 8,200 acres of contaminated land; and (5) due to the unique nature of coal refuse and the power plants that use coal refuse as a fuel, those plants face distinct economic and technical obstacles to achieving compliance with regulatory standards established for traditional coal-fired power plants. (b) Definition of Coal Refuse.--In this section, the term ``coal refuse'' means any byproduct of coal mining, physical coal cleaning, or coal preparation operations that contains coal, matrix material, clay, and other organic and inorganic material. (c) Emission Limitations for Certain Electric Utility Steam Generating Units.-- (1) In general.--The general emission limitations established by the Environmental Protection Agency in the final rule entitled ``Federal Implementation Plans: Interstate Transport of Fine Particulate Matter and Ozone and Correction of SIP Approvals'' (76 Fed. Reg. 48208 (August 8, 2011)) (or a successor regulation) shall not apply to an electric utility steam generating unit described in paragraph (3). (2) Hydrogen chloride and sulfur dioxide.--The emission limitations for hydrogen chloride and sulfur dioxide contained in table 2 of subpart UUUUU of part 63 of title 40, Code of Federal Regulations (or successor regulations), entitled ``Emission Limits for Existing EGUs'' shall not apply to an electric utility steam generating unit described in paragraph (3). (3) Description of electric utility steam generating units.--An electric utility steam generating unit referred to in paragraphs (1) and (2) is an electric utility steam generating unit that-- (A) is in operation as of the date of enactment of this Act; (B) uses fluidized bed combustion technology to convert coal refuse into energy; and (C) uses coal refuse as at least 50 percent of the annual fuel consumed, by weight, of the unit. (d) Effective Date.--Notwithstanding any other provision of this Act, this section takes effect on the date of enactment of this Act. Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, obviously, Senator Toomey will come to the floor to speak to his amendment. I wish to follow up on the comments of the Senator from Illinois, who was referring to petcoke. Senator Toomey in his amendment is attempting to deal with a situation in specific parts of the country that are impacted by coal refuse. Coal refuse, as it is defined in his amendment, effectively comes about from some centuries-old, 19th century mining operations that left behind this coal refuse in certain parts of the coal mining regions around the country. They remain a legacy problem that is acknowledged, a legacy problem that creates environmental issues, including contamination of local streams with heavy metals, acid, and mine drainage, that, again, I think we all recognize there is a responsibility to address. The good news is there is a solution to cleaning up this problem. Coal refuse powerplants take this coal and these waste piles and turn them into energy and heat for consumers, for businesses. They follow EPA regulations. This is not a situation where we are bypassing EPA regulations when it comes to the emissions issues. But remediating these mine sites, removing these waste piles, and at the same time generating electricity with the coal and applying the basic ash from the process reclaims the land at a lower cost. So we are able to do several things at the same time. We are dealing with an environmental issue that has been in place for far too long. We are generating electricity that can be used to the benefit of consumers and businesses, and we are also able to reclaim the land. So it is viewed, clearly, as a win here. It also creates some jobs. It improves the environment and it boosts economic growth. Burning these coal waste piles is basically a carbon-neutral process because the carbon in these piles is currently being emitted into the atmosphere through the slow chemical process that is at play there, and we also have fires that burn within these piles. So just sitting there is not an answer to a better environment and reduced emissions. The plants that burn this waste coal cannot economically be as clean as plants using higher quality coal. But the side benefits of removing these waste piles, again, from the perspective of dealing with emissions, generating electricity, and reclaiming the land--the benefits do compensate for the differences that are out there. Historically, environmental regulators have recognized these benefits. They have carved out the plants from regulatory standards that would cause them to shut down. There have been EPA regulations recently that have failed to sustain this approach and, thus there is the amendment of the Senator from Pennsylvania that would allow these coal waste plants to run. I encourage my colleagues to look at this amendment in front of us and consider the merits as Senator Toomey has laid out. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington. Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I know we are running against a time clock here in getting ready for the State of the Union Address tonight. I appreciate my colleague from Alaska going back and forth on these amendments and allowing both sides of the aisle to set up some pending amendments. I will just say the Toomey amendment asks for an exemption of the Clean Air Act which I wouldn't support. I know we will have a chance later on to have that discussion. Our colleague from Nebraska came to the floor and offered an amendment that would make it incredibly difficult without first proving there was negative management of Federal land to get any more national monuments. National monuments have been big economic drivers in a lot of communities and have preserved some very unique parts of our country. We will have a chance to talk about that a little bit later. But I wish to make sure we get our colleague recognized so he can offer his amendment. Then, I think we will probably, as my colleague from Alaska said, be finished for this afternoon as it relates to offering amendments back and forth. I wish to recognize the Senator from Rhode Island for his amendment. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island. Amendment No. 29 to Amendment No. 2 (Purpose: to express the sense of the Senate that climate change is real and not a hoax) Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to lay aside the pending amendment so that I may call up my amendment No. 29. [[Page S271]] The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk will report. The assistant legislative clerk read as follows: The Senator from Rhode Island [Mr. Whitehouse] proposes an amendment numbered 29 to amendment No. 2. On page 3, between lines 19 and 20, insert the following: SEC. __. SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING CLIMATE CHANGE. It is the sense of the Senate that climate change is real and not a hoax. Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I first wish to thank the distinguished chairman of the energy committee and her ranking member for allowing this process to go forward to the point where I am able to call up this amendment. It is a convention here when amendments are called up to ask unanimous consent that the reading be dispensed with, but in this amendment, the effective language is only eight words: ``Climate change is real and not a hoax.'' So I went ahead and allowed the clerical staff to read the whole operative text of this amendment. This is an extremely simple amendment. We are here in this remarkable body in which so much history has taken place and in which so many great achievements have been fought through, many of them with powerful interests and strong arguments on opposite sides. And through that conflict, here in this body, we have been able to generate some of the great compromises and some of the great resolutions that have defined the course of the history of this country. So what a wonderful place this is to have the opportunity to serve. Now, in this great deliberative body, called by many the greatest deliberative body, we have a great issue before us--perhaps as many say, the issue of our time--and that is what our carbon pollution--the excess carbon that we burn when we burn fossil fuels--is doing to our atmosphere and what it is doing to our oceans. There is no factual debate about what it is doing to our atmosphere and our oceans. It is crystal clear, and the consequences are crystal clear as well. If my colleagues don't believe me, fine, go ask the U.S. military. Ask Admiral Locklear. Ask the Secretary of the Navy. Ask the Joint Chiefs of Staff. If my colleagues don't want to believe in the military, ask our religious leaders. Ask the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops. If my colleagues only believe what corporations tell us, ask some of our biggest and most successful American corporations. Ask Walmart. Ask Coca-Cola. Ask Nike, ask Apple, ask Google. Go on through the corporate heraldry, and virtually every American corporation that is not actively involved in the fossil fuel industry will tell us this is a real and serious problem. And many of them are dedicating an enormous amount of internal effort to try to solve it within their corporate boundaries. Again, Walmart and Coca-Cola come right to the head of the list. Of course, we don't have to ask our scientists any longer. They are pretty clear. They use words such as ``unequivocal'' and ``undeniable'' at every single scientific society that represents the major elements of the profession in this country. Every single one has made this a priority. If people just want to go out to farmers, foresters, and fishermen, they are already seeing the changes around them. So here we are in this great deliberative body with this extraordinarily important issue that we have to face, and what do we see? Silence, virtually dead silence, because one side of this body won't even discuss the question. Many refuse to believe that climate change even exists, and for those who do, the political perils of using that phrase have now become so great that there is no serious conversation back and forth about climate change. In the first week we debated the Keystone Pipeline, which the environmental impact statement said will have a dramatic effect on climate change--the equivalent of 6 million added cars on our highways for 50 years, not to mention the petcoke and the byproducts, and just the carbon effect of it--no mention. The only time it was mentioned was when our distinguished energy committee chairman mentioned the testimony of a witness in her committee. She was good enough to make sure that climate change was raised in her committee, and she mentioned that there had been a witness who in turn mentioned climate change. But there was no direct mention in all of the debate that we heard in that week about climate change. It is the word that cannot be said. That is wrong. We cannot ignore this problem. It is too real for my fishermen in Rhode Island. It is to real for the people who are living near coasts and are seeing beaches they used to be able to play on eaten away. It is too real for the people whose homes have fallen into the sea. It is too real for us not to discuss it. Now, it is not going to be easy, and we have to start somewhere. So this is a start. I am going to ask my colleagues to vote on such a simple question: Is climate change real or is it a hoax? Both points of view have been expressed in this body. Where do we come down? Let's actually find out if there are people on the Republican side of the aisle who are willing to say climate change is real. My moose up in New Hampshire, one could say, are suffering unprecedented infestations of ticks because there is no snow for them to fall off and die, and the moose are getting overwhelmed. We could say that in the University of Oklahoma, the leading dean is an IPCC member and led the establishment of Climate Central. One could go to the Carolina coasts and hear from the coastal agencies about sea level rise. One could go to Arizona and hear about the desertification and the drought. We can go all over the place and find these things, and they are real. We have to have this conversation. It has to begin with as simple a proposition as this. Then, I hope if we can build off this if we can find a few Republican Senators who will say publicly that climate change is real. We can then go on to if it is real, let's have a conversation about what we do about it, because recklessly continuing to dump megatons of carbon into the atmosphere every year is not a solution. And I don't want to be a part of a generation of which our kids and our grandchildren look back and ask: Where were they? Why could they not address this question? There they were in this great deliberative body. There they were with this great issue of our time. Why would they not even discuss it? So I hope this amendment gets the conversation under way. It is one I look forward to. I think there are very sensible ways to solve this problem, including ways that have been supported by everyone from Republican Secretaries of the Treasury to the lead economist for Ronald Reagan, the famous Mr. Laffer. There are ways we can make these adjustments. But we have to have the conversation, and I hope this begins it. With that, I yield the floor. Again, I thank the distinguished chairman of the energy committee for her courtesy in allowing us to proceed. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska. Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I thank my colleague. I think discussions we have had just in the past hour here since we have had the vote and the various amendments we now have pending before us--this is a good conversation. This is a good discussion and debate for us to be having as a body. We haven't had energy-related issues brought before this floor in some years now. We had a very limited debate on Keystone back in December, but I am hopeful that with the opportunity for amendments--and again, not just some amendments we on our side have handpicked and then decided what the Democrats might be able to move on their side--an opportunity for some real issues to be brought forward and to be debated on this floor. The Senator from Rhode Island is very passionate on the issue of climate change. I think it is fair to say that he has singlehandedly raised the awareness not only in this body but for those loyal followers on C-SPAN. When it comes to the issue of climate change, I think the Senator comes up once a week with his charts and a series of speeches that I think is meant to educate colleagues. I don't agree with all of it. I think that is a fair statement to say. But what is equally fair is that there is a care and concern for not only our country and our country's environment--truly the public [[Page S272]] safety of our people, a care for our land, the stewardship we have as Americans--but it goes well beyond our borders to that of our entire globe, our entire planet, and how we care for planet Earth and how we move forward responsibly. One aspect of the energy debate that I continue to advance is that we must ensure that if we are to make advances when it comes to caring for our environment and truly the whole issue of global climate, we have to be a nation that is economically secure in the sense that the technologies we will have to help us be cleaner in all that we do, do not come without cost. Here in this country, we have been the leaders, we have been the innovators when it comes to clean-energy technologies, and we should challenge ourselves every day to do more in that regard, to build out, to push out that R&D so that we are making--whether it is making clean coal truly clean, whether it is advancing those clean energy technologies. I, for one, coming from a fossil fuel-producing State, am a huge proponent of nuclear-powered generation in this country because I believe very strongly that it is the cleanest energy source we have at this point in time. So what are we doing in this country to make sure our energy is abundant, affordable, clean, diverse, and secure? These are the challenges I put out to my colleagues. I clearly appreciate the need that we have in this body and in this country to be moving forward with technologies that allow us to have reduced emissions, to have a cleaner environment, but I also want to make sure we do so in a way that doesn't cripple our economy. So how we lead in this way, which I believe we must, while keeping our economy where it must be--in the front and moving forward all the time--is our great challenge. Again, I look forward to the debate we will have. I am pleased we were able to process the amendments we had before us today. I look forward to advancing those that we have pending in front of us now and to good, continued, and robust discussion on this floor. I note the majority leader is here, and I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader. ____________________","Congressional Record, Volume 161 Issue 9 (Tuesday, January 20, 2015) [Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 9 (Tuesday, January 20, 2015)] [Senate] [Pages S260-S272] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] KEYSTONE XL PIPELINE ACT--Continued The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey. Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, parliamentary inquiry: I understand we are on the bill. The PRESIDING OFFICER. We are on the bill. Mr. MENENDEZ. I thank the Presiding Officer. Mr. President, let me say that I rise in general opposition to the Keystone Pipeline, and I rise in favor of Senator Markey's amendment. After long and careful deliberation--and after having had the benefit of a hearing on the pipeline in the Senate Foreign Relations Committee--I have decided to oppose this bill for four basic reasons. First, on the bill, I am deeply concerned that if approved this pipeline will be the first of many pipelines opening one of the largest sources of carbon on Earth to exploitation. Second, contrary to what many believe, I am convinced this pipeline will simply not enhance, help or--in any positive way--improve our energy profile. Third, in my view, it is completely absurd for Congress to take the role of permitting pipelines. It is a role we have never assumed and should not assume now. Fourth, I believe it is ridiculous that our Republican colleagues insist on language banning eminent domain for national parks legislation but oppose it when it comes to foreign or private projects such as Keystone. Furthermore, we cannot underestimate the environmental impacts of this pipeline. The facts are clear. The resource in Alberta is enormous; the tar sands formation is the size of Iowa; tar sands oil is 17 percent more greenhouse gas intensive than other forms of oil because it takes an enormous industrial process to extract it. It has been estimated that if this resource were fully exploited, it would release more carbon dioxide in the air than the United States has emitted in its entire history. As James Hansen, one of the foremost climate scientists in the world, has said, building the Keystone pipeline would be ``game over for the planet.'' There are also more local risks. Over the weekend, landowners are seeing the pipeline spill in the Yellowstone River in Montana. It is happening right now, and landowners are wondering if their family farm will be the victim of a similar spill, wondering if property that has been in their family for generations can still be farmed and passed on to the next generation. While some jobs will be created by the pipeline, the fact is--after 2 years of construction--it will create only 35 permanent jobs--35. That is not a lot of jobs. If we want to create millions of permanent infrastructure jobs, I urge the supporters of the pipeline to support our efforts to increase transportation funding. I urge them to continue incentives for clean energy. I ask them to do all they can to help local governments rebuild local infrastructure systems. That is how we create permanent jobs that build our economy and help us keep our competitive advantage. By comparison, the number of jobs created by Keystone is hardly an argument for passage of this legislation. As you all know, we also have the issue of eminent domain--the power of any governmental entity to take private property and convert it to public use subject to reasonable compensation. Many, including some of my most conservative friends on the other side, were outraged by the idea that eminent domain proceedings could be used to seize private property for private gain. I have been working very closely with Senator Cantwell on an amendment, and we agree with our conservative colleagues that using eminent domain proceedings for private gain is pretty outrageous. Here, on the issue of Keystone, a foreign-owned company is using eminent domain to seize private property so it can better export Canadian oil--a foreign-owned company using eminent domain to seize private property so it can better export Canadian oil. The project is not in the public interest but clearly in the private interest. Senator Cantwell and I feel this amendment should be a no-brainer--an easy amendment every Senator can support. In recent years Republicans have insisted on similar language prohibiting the use of eminent domain when we establish national parks. If eminent domain cannot be used to establish a national park in the public interest to conserve our national treasures and preserve America's beauty for future generations, then surely--surely--it should not be used to benefit private interests; in this case, in the interest of a foreign-owned oil company seeking to ship its product around the world, which brings me to the amendment of the Senator from Massachusetts. Amendment No. 13 We know the oil that will flow through this pipeline will flow directly to foreign markets. That is why I support the amendment from the Senator from Massachusetts. Foreign oil is not subject to America's crude oil export ban, but whether it is shipped as crude or refined here and then exported, we all know this oil is not going to help the American consumers. The intent of the Markey amendment can be summed up very simply, using an old adage that President Reagan was fond of: ``Trust but verify.'' For months now supporters of the Keystone XL Pipeline have been telling us the tar sands that will travel through the United States will help advance our energy security. They have been telling us the pipeline will bring a reliable source of fuel from a close ally and that it will reduce prices at the pump, helping U.S. consumers and businesses. The Markey amendment does nothing more than confirm the promises made--time and time again--by supporters of the pipeline. It would require the tar sands that travel through the United States stay in the United States. It says that if Americans are to accept all of the downsides of the pipeline, if U.S. property owners are to have their lands taken away for TransCanada's benefit, if Americans are forced to live with the risk of an oilspill of dirty tar sands that we do not even know how to clean up properly, then the very least we can do is get a guarantee in law that the United States will reap the benefits that come with all of these risks. So all this amendment does is put into writing the promises we have heard over and over again from supporters of the pipeline. It codifies in law what we previously had to take on faith. I thank my colleague from Massachusetts for offering the amendment, and I would note he has a long history of working to improve America's energy security. He and I have worked closely since he came to the Senate to protect the longstanding requirement that U.S.-produced crude oil stay here at home to benefit the U.S. consumer rather than being shipped across the globe. This amendment is another commonsense protection to make sure our Nation's energy policy is aimed at helping consumers rather than helping oil companies' bottom line, and I encourage my colleagues to support it. For the last several Congresses I have introduced the American Oil for American Families Act, a bill to ensure that oil or petroleum products that originate within America's public lands or waters are not exported as crude or in refined form. That bill would increase our energy supply at home, lowering prices for consumers and businesses, and I intend to reintroduce that legislation in this Congress. For these reasons, I urge my colleagues to support the Markey amendment. I intend to vote against the bill, which in my view is nothing more than an earmark for Big Oil. The pipeline will have enormous environmental impacts, it will not significantly help the American economy, it will not benefit American consumers, and it will needlessly harm landowners for generations. With that, I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas. State of the Union Address Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, tonight the President of the United States will address the Nation on the state of our Union and talk a little bit about his priorities for the coming year. [[Page S261]] I am not sure how much more there is for the President to say than has already been leaked in the press in the drip, drip, drip of social media and other stories, but I am concerned he simply did not get the message that was delivered loud and clear on November 4 by the American voters. Just a couple of months ago they sent a message that was loud and it was clear. They are fed up with the way things operate in Washington, DC. They are fed up with the dysfunction, and they are fed up with the lack of real leadership that focuses on their concerns, not Washington's concerns--concerns such as more money in their pocket. I was amused to listen to our good friend, our colleague from New Jersey, complaining about additional exports of oil or actually gasoline and other fuel. It is actually the supply, the glut of gasoline onto the global markets that has caused a pay raise for most hard-working, middle-class families. The price of gasoline has plummeted because of the glut of supply. But we ought to be focused like a laser on how we put more money into the pocketbook of hard-working American taxpayers--after years of stagnant jobs and stagnant wages, the stagnant number of jobs for the record number of Americans who have been looking for them. So after sending a message loud and clear on November 4, what is the President's response? He says more of the same. He is set to announce a $320 billion tax hike and hundreds of billions of dollars in more spending--yes, hundreds of billions of dollars more in taxes and hundreds of billions of dollars in more Federal spending. Sadly, the President has doubled down on the same agenda which, in his own words, was on the ballot this last fall and was soundly rejected. But this agenda and these policies are not only wrong for America today, they are certainly wrong for the America of our future. Future generations deserve a country that provides them more opportunity than our parents had or than we have. That is called the American dream. But hundreds of billions of dollars in new spending and new taxes--when we already face an $18 trillion debt--well, that makes the American promise one unlikely to be fulfilled. The cause of this problem is pretty clear: The President remains focused on the priorities in Washington, DC, and not on the priorities of hard-working American taxpayers working from paycheck to paycheck, dealing with rising costs of living when it comes to food and other commodities and who are sorely in need of additional money in their pocket. Things clearly need to change. That to me was what the voters said on November 4. I think I speak for many Americans and many Texans when I say: Mr. President, enough is enough. The American people expect better, and, more importantly, they deserve better. Sure, we know there are always going to be big challenges, and they are not easy to deal with by any stretch of the imagination. But surely--surely--we can come up with better solutions than more taxes and more spending. This is really doubling down over the last 6 years. One would think that the President, giving the State of the Union now in his seventh year in office, could come up with something a little bit different, particularly after his own party lost nine Senate seats after this referendum on his failed policies that took place on November 4. The great news--and there is good news--is we do not have to start from scratch. We need to look no further than some of the laboratories of democracy--that is what Louis Brandeis called the State: the laboratories of democracy--to see what actually works. We know what does not work. So let's look and see what does work. We could learn a lot from States such as Arizona, where the Presiding Officer is from, and my home State of Texas. We are not perfect, but I think we have learned a few important lessons we could teach to the policymakers in the White House. Many policymakers in Washington seem to have forgotten the secret sauce, the formula, the recipe by which strong, sustainable economic growth that lifts the middle class in Texas and in so many other States across the country--why that is alive and well and why those policies actually work. Just last Friday I had the opportunity to visit Southeast Texas. I was in Beaumont, TX, actually, where the existing gulf coast leg of the Keystone Pipeline is already operating. I bet many of my colleagues would be amazed to know that we are already transporting Canadian crude from Canada all the way across the country, by and large on railcars, to refineries on the gulf coast. The Keystone XL Pipeline--the legislation that we will be voting on today-- will increase the supply, which means more product, and hopefully, that will result in downward pressure on prices for hard-working American taxpayers. While the President stood in the way of the building of this completed pipeline and the tens of thousands of jobs it would support, the gulf coast leg of the Keystone Pipeline in Texas is already booming. But they are hungry for more crude feedstock so they can produce more and thereby create more jobs. It has been good for communities. I talked to the mayor of Beaumont and other communities. I talked to a county judge. These taxes, which are provided by investment from the Keystone XL Pipeline, not only create good jobs, but the tax base is necessary to educate our kids in K-12 education. They provide the products and services from local businesses that sell goods. In other words, projects such as the Keystone XL Pipeline is a force multiplier when it comes to our economy and economic growth and opportunity, and of course, it has been good for thousands of construction workers who built the pipeline. I heard our colleagues on the other side of the aisle try to denigrate these construction jobs. They say that they are just temporary jobs. Mr. President, you and I have a temporary job. We are elected for a term of office, and if we are not reelected, it is a temporary job. In effect, every job is a temporary job. But to denigrate these good, high-paying construction jobs, including those performed by welders--in Texas, properly trained welders can make $140,000 to $150,000 a year. Those are good, high-paying jobs, and we ought to respect and encourage them. That is just one example of how some of the folks at the White House look down their nose at these construction jobs and try to denigrate the economic contribution of projects such as the Keystone XL Pipeline and what they could learn from this project. In my State we reduced taxes, cut red tape in favor of sensible regulations, and encouraged businesses to come to Texas to grow and create jobs. If I heard the story one time, I heard it 100 times. In my State, Governor Perry has contacted people in California and said: Come to Texas, where you are welcome and the cost of doing business is lower and the cost of living is cheaper. You can actually buy an affordable home for your family. People have voted with their feet and have come where the opportunity is. If we add it all up, over the last 6 years two-thirds of all new net jobs created in the United States of America came from just one State, and that is my home State. Another thing Washington could learn from Texas is how to balance a budget. We actually balance our budget every year. Earlier I mentioned that the President seems to be proud of the fact that the deficit is actually going down. As the Presiding Officer knows, that is the annual difference between what we take in and what we spend. What he doesn't tell you is that we are actually adding to the debt every year because we are still spending more money than we are bringing in, and it has now gone up about $8 trillion during his administration to an unprecedented $18 trillion national debt. We need to roll up our sleeves, and we invite the President to join us and take on the priorities of hard-working American taxpayers in every State across the country. We know this is not going to be easy, but that is what we volunteered for. I know there are colleagues here in the Senate--Republicans and Democrats alike--who are eager to address the challenges that confront our country--whether it is economic, national security, or you name it. These are things that need to get done. At the end of the day, it doesn't really matter what I think the State of our [[Page S262]] Union is or, for that matter, it doesn't really matter what the President thinks the State of our Union is. What matters is whether the teacher in Katy, TX, believes his students will have the opportunities he did growing up or whether the single mom waiting tables in Fort Worth can find enough work to feed her family. Our Nation is truly strong when its people believe it to be, and I hope the President understands that and tries something new rather than the same old failed policies of the past. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Portman). The Senator from Minnesota. Mr. FRANKEN. I thank the Presiding Officer. Amendment No. 17 I wish to urge my colleagues to oppose any motion to table my amendment. My amendment is about making sure that, if we do build the Keystone XL Pipeline, it is built with American iron and steel. Those are jobs. I don't wish to short-circuit the process here, but if the pipeline is built, it should be built with American steel. The Presiding Officer's State produces a lot of American steel and very often with iron ore from my State. These are American jobs. TransCanada has said that 50 percent of the iron and steel will be outsourced from other countries, and the iron and steel for some of the other pipes could come from other countries. They also said they can use those pipes in other projects, including other projects in Canada. I agree with Senator Cornyn when he said these construction jobs that will help build the pipeline are real jobs. Just because they are not permanent jobs does not mean they are not real jobs. Providing the iron and steel and other manufactured products for this project will also provide real jobs. Our amendment will do this entirely and consistently within the language of the bill and within our trade obligations. I ask that my colleagues not vote to table this amendment because a vote to table this is a vote against American jobs. It is a vote against jobs in Ohio and Minnesota. It is a vote against the shippers who ship our iron ore over the Great Lakes or by rail or over the Mississippi so it can be used to make steel. We have done ``Buy America'' legislation before. We just did it in 2013 on the WRDA bill. I ask that my colleagues please not vote against American jobs. I thank the Presiding Officer. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska. Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I will take a couple of minutes before we vote to speak to the Franken amendment. I think all of us want to buy American and buy local whenever and wherever we can. We strongly support that since it does mean jobs--whether we are talking about a pipeline or otherwise. But I think the bigger question here--and what we have in front of us with the Keystone XL Pipeline--is what this amendment would do. This amendment would mandate specific materials for the Keystone XL pipeline, and I think we need to put this into context. This pipeline is a private project. This is not a federally funded infrastructure project. This would be the first time that Congress has directed or forced private parties to purchase domestic goods and materials. We actually asked the Congressional Research Service to look into this to see if there was any other instance at the Federal level where private parties were told that they must purchase 100-percent domestic goods and materials, and so far the answer to that inquiry has been that they can find no instance of that. I think we need to be careful about this as a precedent because if we are going to direct this particular project--the Keystone XL--to have this requirement on it, where do we go next? What will happen to the next project that we have? Will it be the next pipeline or the next renewable energy project? Where does this slippery slope go? I think it is fair to note that TransCanada has made a commitment to have 75 percent of the pipes for this project come from North America, and fully half of that--more than 332,000 tons of steel will come from the State of Arkansas. I am with the Senator from Minnesota. We want to make sure we get as many jobs as we absolutely can and make sure they are good-paying jobs--whether it is in steel making or widget making or welders. This is about jobs. This is what we want to do to encourage jobs. I think we need to be very cognizant of what this particular amendment would do. This amendment--for the first time ever--would direct a private entity to utilize all American-made products throughout the process of the construction. It is important to note that the American Iron and Steel Institute has been a strong supporter of the Keystone XL Pipeline. We have all received a letter--they called it a Steelgram--from the American Iron and Steel Institute. They let us know very clearly and in no uncertain terms that they support Keystone XL. They said it is essential that Congress act to ensure the approval of the Keystone XL Pipeline without further delay. Again, I agree. We need to get moving on it. We need to do it without delay. I do think it is interesting to note that the amendment does allow for the President to waive the requirements for American materials based on certain findings he can make. I appreciate that is in there, and I think that is good. But think about where we are. It has been 3,200- and-some-odd days now where we have been waiting for the President to act to make a decision on the Keystone XL Pipeline. So I don't have any real confidence that he will move to act quickly on any kind of a waiver requirement. I just wanted to put that out there before we moved to take up the amendments that we have pending before us this afternoon and note that we will be doing that in a few short minutes. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota. Mr. FRANKEN. Mr. President, I have the greatest respect for the Senator from Alaska. I wish to say a few things about this private company. This company is asking us to do an extraordinary thing. We are debating this on the floor because they are asking us to circumvent the environmental and safety process here and possibly expose the United States--and the path of this pipeline--to tremendous environmental damage. This is very different. The Senator asked: Why won't this extend to every private enterprise? This is something we are here debating and voting on, and that should say something about the nature of this issue. The United Steelworkers have endorsed my amendment. This is about American jobs. The question is: If we do build this pipeline, should it be built with American steel or should it be built with steel from other countries? Again, in the bill, we make sure this is compliant with our trade obligations. There is nothing to stop us from doing this. This is a private foreign company that is asking us to circumvent our normal processes, and because of that, I feel we have the right to say this should be made with American steel and with jobs in the State of Ohio and in the State of Minnesota--American jobs. If this is about American jobs, let's make it about American jobs. Again, this is a company that is asking us to circumvent our normal processes. So all I will say is that TransCanada has said the pipes that have been made for this can be used in other projects in Canada. If we are going to build this project, let's make it about American jobs. I thank the Presiding Officer. Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise today to talk about jobs-- especially jobs in the U.S. steel industry. This November I went to a ceremony at Sparrows Point a former steel plant in Maryland. It was a bittersweet day. I was there to honor the legacy of Bethlehem Steel and all of the Steelworkers in Baltimore. The site is being demolished but Sparrows Point has over 3,000 acres of land, access to ports, rails, and roads to attract companies to create jobs today and tomorrow. We don't have steel in Maryland anymore. Many of us still mourn its loss. But we still have steel in America and I am still for steel. If this Keystone bill is really a jobs bill, then let us put some made-in-America jobs in it and show our support for American steel. [[Page S263]] For over a hundred years, workers at Sparrows Point produced the steel that built America. Members of my own family worked at this steel mill. My father would open the doors to his grocery store early so that Bethlehem Steel workers could pick up their lunch on their way to work. America's steel and steelworkers protect the United States and our freedom. At Sparrows Point, they rolled gun barrels, made steel for grenades, shells and landing craft during World War II. God help us all if America stops making steel. During times of war-- will we depend on foreign steel to build our ships, aircraft carriers and weapons? American steelworkers work hard, play by the rules and serve their country. In war: building ships, tanks and weapons. In peace: making steel for our buildings and cars. Yet for over 50 years, the steel industry withered--not because steel was unproductive or overpriced. The steel industry withered in America because Congress didn't do everything possible to protect American steel from factors in the international steel market, raw material costs, slumping demand, low steels prices, and a global recession. The government looked the other way when foreign imports began to drive down our prices and drive down our steel mills. Our government singles out specific industries all the time when it is in our national interest. We single out specific industries and then talk about their value to America. I agree with that. We single out industries when it is in our national interest because we need them as part of our economy or as part of our national production. Helping the farmers or the airlines because of the national interest means national responsibility. In 2008, we bailed out the banks and we bailed out the auto industry for stability, security, and American independence. Where is the help for the steel industry and the steelworkers? I have fought for steel in the past. Now I am fighting for steel again. I fought so hard year after year to protect the lives and livelihoods in Baltimore, in Dundalk. I have fought for more than 25 years to reverse this tide against American manufacturing and against American steel. I am going to keep on fighting. I fought to keep Sparrows Point open. And when that wasn't possible, I fought for a safety net for workers Trade Adjustment Assistance, unemployment insurance and health care benefits. I think about Maryland steelworkers every day--what they are going through these past few years have been tough on workers, their families, and the community. I am supporting an amendment that protects American steel like steel has protected us. It is simple. Let us put American workers back to work in good, solid steel jobs, by requiring that the pipeline's construction, connection, operation, and maintenance all be done with made-in-America, U.S. steel. Let us get to work for American workers and let us put the jobs in this jobs bill. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska. Amendment No. 3, as Modified Ms. MURKOWSKI.

Amendment No. 13 Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, at this time I call for regular order with respect to Markey amendment No. 13. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment is now pending. Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I move to table the Markey amendment and ask for the yeas and nays. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There is a sufficient second. Mr. MARKEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to be recognized for 1 minute. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? There is a unanimous consent request. Is there objection? The Senator from Alaska. Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I have a parliamentary inquiry. Is there a request from the Senator from Massachusetts to speak to this amendment for 1 minute? What is the request? The PRESIDING OFFICER. He asked unanimous consent to speak for 1 minute. Mr. MARKEY. To this amendment. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The Senator from Massachusetts is recognized. Mr. MARKEY. Mr. President, this is a motion to table the Markey amendment, which is an amendment to have every Member of the Senate be put on record as to whether or not the oil coming through the Keystone Pipeline [[Page S266]] is then exported out of the United States. Each Member of the Senate should be recorded on that issue. We import 5 million barrels of oil per day into the United States. We should not allow the Canadians to use the United States as a straw to be able to then go down to the Gulf of Mexico and send that oil out of the country. We export young men and women over to the Middle East in order to protect oil coming in from Saudi Arabia and Kuwait. This is a chance to keep oil in America so we don't have to export it. I do not believe the appropriate vote for Members is to support a tabling of the Markey amendment so that we don't actually reach the heart of this substantive issue, which is that we should be working to have energy independence in America. When we are importing 5 million barrels of oil a day from Russia, Saudi Arabia, and Kuwait, we are in no way independent. I thank the Presiding Officer for the opportunity to speak. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the motion. The yeas and nays have previously been ordered. The clerk will call the roll. The assistant legislative clerk called the roll. Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the Senator from Nevada (Mr. Reid) is necessarily absent. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Lankford). Are there any other Senators in the Chamber desiring to vote?

I now move to table the Franken amendment, No. 17, and I ask for the yeas and nays. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There is a sufficient second. The question is on agreeing to the motion. The clerk will call the roll. The assistant legislative clerk called the roll. Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the Senator from Nevada (Mr. Reid) is necessarily absent. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Are there any other Senators in the Chamber desiring to vote?

Ms. MURKOWSKI. I move to reconsider the vote. Mr. BURR. I move to lay that motion on the table. The motion to lay on the table was agreed to. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska. Amendment No. 3, as Modified Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator Shaheen be recognized to speak for 1 minute and that Senator Portman be recognized to speak for 1 minute. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is so ordered. The Senator from New Hampshire. Mrs. SHAHEEN. Mr. President, I join my colleague Senator Portman from Ohio in a bipartisan amendment on energy efficiency. This is a very short version that passed overwhelmingly in the House last year. It doesn't pick favorites in terms of fuel sources, and it is good for every region of the country. This is something we all ought to be able to get behind. I am very pleased and hope we get a very strong vote in the Senate. I am pleased to support this amendment, and I thank my colleague from Ohio, Senator Portman, for his leadership. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio. Mr. PORTMAN. The Senator from New Hampshire said it well. This is a no-brainer. It is three relatively small provisions, one of which is very timely with regard to water heaters, about which we are very concerned. I ask that we move on this amendment in a bipartisan way. It has already passed the House, so it shouldn't be controversial over there either. We hope we will be able to bring the larger legislation to the floor in the future, but this is a good downpayment. Ms. MURKOWSKI. I know of no further debate on the amendment. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment, as modified. Mr. WICKER. I ask for the yeas and nays. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There appears to be a sufficient second. The clerk will call the roll. The legislative clerk called the roll. Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the Senator from Nevada (Mr. Reid) is necessarily absent. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Are there any other Senators in the Chamber desiring to vote?

Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote. Mrs. FISCHER. I move to lay that motion on the table. The motion to lay on the table was agreed to. Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, we have disposed of three pending amendments that were before us. As we mentioned earlier, we are looking forward to Members coming down to the floor to offer their amendments. We have agreed to a process here this afternoon. Today will be a somewhat truncated day on the Senate floor because of the State of the Union Address, but it is our hope that we will be able to get three amendments pending on our side and three amendments pending on the Democrats' side. The Senator from Nebraska, Mrs. Fischer, is prepared to speak to her amendment, and then we will move to the other side of the aisle. After that, I will be calling up an amendment from Senator Lee. We will then go to the Democratic side and come back here for a third round. Just to give Members an idea of what we will have in front of us, we will not be having votes on these amendments today, but I do think it should be clear to Members that we will be looking forward to doing a similar series of votes tomorrow. So I would encourage folks to come to the floor, talk to us, and let's get this process moving. With that, Mr. President, I yield to the Senator from Nebraska. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska. Amendment No. 18 to Amendment No. 2 Mrs. FISCHER. Mr. President, I call up my amendment No. 18. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report. The assistant legislative clerk read as follows: The Senator from Nebraska [Mrs. Fischer] proposes an amendment numbered 18 to amendment No. 2. Mrs. FISCHER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the amendment be dispensed with. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The amendment is as follows: (Purpose: To provide limits on the designation of new federally protected land) At the end of the bill, add the following: SEC. __. LIMITATION ON DESIGNATION OF NEW FEDERALLY PROTECTED LAND. (a) Definition of Federally Protected Land.--In this section, the term ``federally protected land'' means any area designated or acquired by the Federal Government for the purpose of conserving historic, cultural, environmental, scenic, recreational, developmental, or biological resources. (b) Findings Required.--New federally protected land shall not be designated unless the Secretary, prior to the designation, publishes in the Federal Register-- (1) a finding that the addition of the new federally protected land would not have a negative impact on the administration of existing federally protected land; and (2) a finding that, as of the date of the finding, sufficient resources are available to effectively implement management plans for existing units of federally protected land. Mrs. FISCHER. Mr. President, this amendment would create limitations for new Federal land designations to ensure responsible management of our natural resources. These limitations are modeled on those in the National Marine Sanctuaries Act, which authorizes the protection of national marine sanctuaries. Under the act, the Commerce Secretary cannot designate a new sanctuary unless the Secretary publishes a finding that, No. 1, the addition of a new sanctuary will not have a negative impact on the overall system, and No. 2, sufficient resources were available in the fiscal year in which the finding is made to effectively implement management plans for each sanctuary in the system. These are commonsense limitations that ensure the administration will not add more land to the Federal system without considering the impacts to the overall system and without sufficient funds to manage those resources effectively. At a time when the national park system has a $13 billion maintenance backlog, we need to consider the impacts to the overall system and whether there are sufficient resources to effectively manage additional land holdings. In the context of energy policy, we should also consider our stewardship choices. American energy production on private and State- owned lands has increased significantly in recent years while decreasing on Federal lands. Through leasing restrictions and permitting delays, the Obama administration has tied up energy production on Federal lands in redtape. Since 2009 oil production on Federal lands is down by 6 percent, and natural gas production on Federal lands is down 28 percent. Meanwhile, oil production on non- Federal land has risen by 61 percent, and natural gas production on non-Federal land is up by 33 percent. By limiting Federal land designations, more land should continue to be held privately or managed by States and local governments, increasing the opportunity for productive and beneficial use. Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington. Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, as we go back and forth on offering amendments, I wish to turn to the Senator from Hawaii for him to offer his amendment. Mr. SCHATZ. I thank the Senator from Washington. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Hawaii. Amendment No. 58 to Amendment No. 2 Mr. SCHATZ. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate set aside the pending amendment in order to call up amendment No. 58. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk will report. The assistant legislative clerk read as follows: The Senator from Hawaii [Mr. Schatz] proposes an amendment numbered 58 to amendment No. 2. Mr. SCHATZ. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the amendment be dispensed with. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The amendment is as follows: (Purpose: To express the sense of Congress regarding climate change) At the appropriate place, insert the following: SEC. __. SENSE OF CONGRESS. (a) Findings.--The environmental analysis contained in the Final Supplemental Environmental Impact Statement referred to in section 2(a) and deemed to satisfy the requirements of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (42 U.S.C. 4321 et seq.) as described in section 2(a), states that-- (1) ``[W]arming of the climate system is unequivocal and each of the last [3] decades has been successively warmer at the Earth's surface than any preceding decade since 1850.''; (2) ``The [Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change], in addition to other institutions, such as the National Research Council and the United States (U.S.) Global Change Research Program (USGCRP), have concluded that it is extremely likely that global increases in atmospheric [greenhouse gas] concentrations and global temperatures are caused by human activities.''; and (3) ``A warmer planet causes large-scale changes that reverberate throughout the climate system of the Earth, including higher sea levels, changes in precipitation, and altered weather patterns (e.g. an increase in more extreme weather events).''. (b) Sense of Congress.--Consistent with the findings under subsection (a), it is the sense of Congress that-- (1) climate change is real; and (2) human activity significantly contributes to climate change. Mr. SCHATZ. This amendment affirms something very simple; that is, climate change is real and human activities significantly contribute to climate change. It also states that a warmer planet causes large-scale changes, including higher sea levels, changes in precipitation, and altered weather patterns, such as increases in more extreme weather events. This amendment cites for its evidence the findings of national and international scientific institutions, including the IPCC, the National Research Council, and the U.S. Global Change Research Program. All of these organizations are cited and quoted in the State Department's final supplemental environmental impact statement on Keystone XL Pipeline. This is the same environmental review document that plays a prominent role in the text of the underlying bill, S. 1, and the substitute amendment. [[Page S268]] The purpose of this amendment is simply to acknowledge and restate a set of observable facts. It is not intended to place a value judgment on those facts or to suggest a specific course of action in response to those facts. It is just a set of facts derived from decades of careful study of our land, air, and water. I urge my colleagues to support this amendment. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska. Amendment No. 33 to Amendment No. 2 Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to set aside the pending amendment to call up Senator Lee's amendment No. 33. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk will report. The assistant legislative clerk read as follows: The Senator from Alaska [Ms. Murkowski], for Mr. Lee, proposes an amendment numbered 33 to amendment No. 2. Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the amendment be dispensed with. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The amendment is as follows: (Purpose: To conform citizen suits under the Endangered Species Act of 1973) At the appropriate place, insert the following: SEC. ___. AWARD OF LITIGATION COSTS TO PREVAILING PARTIES IN ACCORDANCE WITH EXISTING LAW. Section 11(g)(4) of the Endangered Species Act of 1973 (16 U.S.C. 1540(g)(4)) is amended by striking ``to any'' and all that follows through the end of the sentence and inserting ``to any prevailing party in accordance with section 2412 of title 28, United States Code.''. Ms. MURKOWSKI. Very briefly on Senator Lee's amendment--he will be here to speak to it--this is a measure which would ensure that the rate of legal fees that are paid in Endangered Species Act cases would be consistent with those in other cases that are eligible for lawyer's fee compensation. Right now there is no cap on the hourly rate lawyers can be paid in connection with lawsuits that are brought regarding violations under the ESA. So this amendment would standardize the award of attorney's fees to parties prevailing against the Federal Government by applying a $125-an-hour rate cap under the Equal Access to Justice Act requirement. This applies to small business-related claims, among other things, and this would apply the same standard to ESA cases. This is a measure Senator Lee will come to the floor to speak to further, but I would just give a little preview of that. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington. Ms. CANTWELL. I would like to call on the Senator from Illinois to offer his amendment. Amendment No. 69 to Amendment No. 2 Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to set aside the pending amendment to call up amendment No. 69. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk will report. The assistant legislative clerk read as follows: The Senator from Illinois [Mr. Durbin] proposes an amendment numbered 69 to amendment No. 2. Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the amendment be dispensed with. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The amendment is as follows: (Purpose: To ensure that the storage and transportation of petroleum coke is regulated in a manner that ensures the protection of public and ecological health) At the appropriate place, insert the following: SEC. ___. REGULATION OF TRANSPORTATION AND STORAGE OF PETROLEUM COKE. This Act shall not take effect prior to the date that-- (1) the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, in consultation with the Secretary of Transportation, promulgates rules concerning the storage and transportation of petroleum coke that ensure the protection of public and ecological health; and (2) petroleum coke is no longer exempt from regulation under section 101(14) of the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980 (42 U.S.C. 9601(14)), which may be established either by an Act of Congress or any regulations, rules, or guidance issued by the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency. Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, about 1 year ago I was invited to go to the southeast part of the city of Chicago. It is an area that used to be populated by steel mills and now there are a lot of struggling families. The manufacturing jobs were not replaced. These are hard-working people--many are Mexican-American people. They sustain what you might expect--great parishes and churches and a great spirit among them, but now they are in a constant struggle. They live in a part of Chicago that has seen better days. They are doing their darndest for their families. They invited me to see something. They wanted me to see what they were living next door to. I went down to that part of the city of Chicago--within the boundaries of the city of Chicago--and I could not believe what I saw. They live in little houses such as these, and across from them is a mountainous gathering of something called petcoke. What is petcoke? If you take the Canadian tar sands that will move through the Keystone XL Pipeline to a refinery and put them through a process where you can end up with a viable product, such as gasoline, jet fuel, diesel fuel or whatever it might be, you have to clean out all of this petcoke that creates the tar sands composition that they are dealing with. When it is all over with--and if the process has been successful-- there is a lot of waste. In fact, there are 61 pounds of petcoke for every barrel of oil. Keep in mind that the Senator who is sponsoring the underlying legislation--we are dealing with moving hundreds of thousands of barrels a day through this pipeline. Now take every one of those barrels and have 61 pounds of petcoke left over as a result of the refining process. What happens to it? This is what happened to it in Chicago. It was dumped in the neighborhood. The people invited me to come to their homes, and I did. I walked into this woman's home, and she said: I have sealed the windows. I taped them shut because this black, sooty petcoke blows through my windows night and day. I cannot stop it. Is it something to worry about? It turns out that the petcoke is not a benign material. We are not talking about dust in the air. We are talking about a composition that includes--according to those who have taken a close look at it--heavy metals. Would you want your baby in your home--or my home or my grandchildren--breathing in this filthy, petcoke-infested dust night and day? They are not making it up. They showed me the window sills, and you could see the black, sooty petcoke. I will tell you the details of the story. The environmental review for the project of Keystone XL notes that communities throughout the Midwest have noticed large piles of petroleum coke--or petcoke-- building up as more and more tar sands are processed. This picture tells a story. This is near a body of water which is carrying this petcoke on the water. These poor folks deal with it as it blows through the air. This type of crude oil is carried by the Keystone XL Pipeline, a pipeline which the Republican majority has decided is their No. 1 priority in the Senate. Under the new Republican majority it is S. 1. This pipeline, on behalf of a Canadian company, TransCanada, is the topic we are facing. We just had a vote and unfortunately could not prevail with the notion that at least the oil that comes out of the pipeline ought to be for the benefit of American consumers. We lost that vote. I think the vote was 57 to 42. It was tabled. Let's talk about the actual process itself. According to the EPA--as I mentioned, the environmental impact statement--every barrel of tar sands contains 61 pounds of petcoke. That means the Keystone XL Pipeline alone will produce 15,400 metric tons of petcoke every day-- 15,400 metric tons of petcoke every day. Would you like to live next door to that? That is what is happening in the city of Chicago, but it not the only one. This petcoke comes from the BP, British Petroleum, refinery in Whiting, IN. It is on the very southern tip of Lake Michigan. We can see it from the city of Chicago. They went through a [[Page S269]] $4 billion upgrade and put in new equipment so they could start processing the Canadian tar sands which will come down through the Keystone XL Pipeline. Soon after they started this processing with $4 billion of new equipment, the people living in this part of Chicago looked out their windows to see the massive piles of petcoke building up, and as a consequence they got worried. They are worried for their children. On windy days--it is, in fact, the ``Windy City''--black clouds of this dust blow from piles into this working-class neighborhood. It always seems to be the case, doesn't it? If somebody tried to put this on the North Shore of Chicago, they would scream bloody murder. But the company that owns this petcoke put it outside a poor neighborhood--a working-class neighborhood in Chicago. The petcoke dust settles on window sills and porches. I met the kids running outside. They are producing 6,000 tons of petcoke every single day at the British Petroleum refinery in Whiting, IN--6,000 tons a day. At that rate the plant only has room to store a few days' worth of production onsite. So they ended up selling the petcoke to a company called KCBX. It is a subsidiary company owned by the Koch brothers--yes, those Koch brothers. Connect the dots. The highest priority of the Republican majority in the Senate was to call up a bill for a Canadian company to transport tar sands across the United States with no promise that the American consumers would ever be able to access it, and the process of refining the Canadian tar sands ends up inuring to the benefit of many companies, such as British Petroleum and KCBX, which again is owned by the Koch brothers. These are the same Koch brothers who are viable political players in our political campaigns. This means the people in southeast Chicago are forced to breathe this dirty air that members of National Nurses United say causes severe health threats. Petcoke contains high levels of heavy metals, such as vanadium and nickel, and dust particles get trapped in residents' lungs, triggering asthma and exacerbating heart and lung conditions. When I go to a school--whether it is rural or urban--I make a point to ask a very basic question: Does any student here know anyone with asthma? Half of the hands are up in every classroom. Our pages are starting to raise their hands, of course. So here we have a national problem, a respiratory problem, which has been made dramatically worse by the byproduct, petcoke, of the Keystone XL Pipeline. That is a fact. What I have argued to you now so far is indisputable. The community and members of the Southeast Environmental Task Force that I visited with in Chicago are fighting back with the help of the National Resources Defense Council. They worked with Mayor Emanuel and Chicago officials to put standards in place for petcoke storage sites that protect public and environmental health. They have come up with a radical notion--if you want to store this dangerous petcoke, then for goodness' sake put it inside a building so it doesn't blow all over the neighborhood. They are suing KCBX and Koch Industries for the damages caused by petcoke piles after the Environmental Protection Agency issued a notice to the company of Clean Air Act violations. The people who hate the EPA like the devil hates holy water do not want them to come in and look at something as outrageous as this and tell you the obvious. This is a public health danger. Petcoke from Canadian tar sands, and part of the Keystone XL Pipeline, is a public health hazard. Unfortunately, petcoke just isn't an issue in Chicago or Illinois. My colleague from Michigan, Senator Gary Peters, told me a story earlier. He can tell you what happened in Detroit when another Koch brothers- owned company decided to store large piles of petcoke on the Detroit River. If you look online, you can still find the YouTube video of black clouds blowing off the piles of the Koch brothers' petcoke into the river. In fact, Senator Peters said that at one point this black cloud was so dense it obscured the Ambassador Bridge between the United States and Canada. You could not see it. It took years of complaints and lawsuits from local communities to get shipping ports in California to require piles of petcoke that was being stored there to be kept in enclosed facilities and covered at all times. Other communities continue to fight, including my city of Chicago, which I am proud to represent. As the U.S. refines more and more tar sands--that is what this bill is all about, refining more and more Canadian tar sands. Every single day tons of this petcoke is produced with no end in sight and no way of protecting the people who live around that area from the damage it will cause to the lungs of children and other vulnerable people, such as elderly people with respiratory challenges. Residents in Houston, TX, and the State of Ohio have complained about how these petcoke piles stored in their neighborhoods are damaging their homes and health, but many Americans affected by petcoke don't have the money or power to take on big companies, so it is up to Congress. It is up to us to ensure that every person in America--rich or poor, whether they live in a good neighborhood or a struggling neighborhood--has the protection against public health hazards. There is a current exemption of petcoke from environmental laws. When you think of all of the things blowing in the air, how in the world did petcoke end up being treated like fairy dust? It is exempt from laws relating to basic things, such as the Superfund. It is exempt from laws relating to hazardous waste and materials. They must have had friends in high places to make sure this miserable source of respiratory problems would be exempt from Federal law. My amendment would change that. It would end this exemption so they would be held to environmental and public health standards when it comes to this miserable byproduct of Canadian tar sands and the Keystone XL Pipeline. My amendment goes on to require the EPA and the Department of Transportation to implement rules for petcoke storage and transportation to protect the public health and environment. Is there anyone here who will tell you that the folks, TransCanada or those refining this, should not have that responsibility? I would not want to see this anywhere. I would not want to see it in Alaska, and I would not want to see it in Oklahoma. I sure don't want to even see it in the city of Chicago. But to think it goes unregulated--absolutely unregulated--is amazing, and that is what my amendment addresses. The United States already produces millions of tons of petcoke each year. Building this pipeline is just going to add dramatically to that amount. By fixing the legal status of petcoke and making it subject to the same laws as all other dangerous materials, we can help ensure that clean air and clean water is something everyone enjoys, whether they are rich or poor and no matter what State they happen to live in. I hope the Senate will have a chance to vote on my amendment to close this loophole for petcoke and establish reasonable guidelines for handling the material. It is time we put the health and well-being of Americans ahead of the profits of any industry involved in the processing of Canadian tar sands because no community--especially the southeast side of Chicago-- should be considered a dumping ground for companies to make money off the lungs and health of vulnerable children, elderly, and poor people. No family should be forced to live next door to a three-story-high pile of petcoke, and that is what is going on. No kid should have to move from a ball field to play inside so they are not exposed to hazardous chemicals. I know what will happen. Somebody is going to make a motion to table this amendment. We can run, but we can't hide, just as we can run, but we can't hide from blowing petcoke. If my colleagues won't allow a vote on this amendment to classify this as a material that should be regulated for the safety of the environment and public health, they will be on record if they vote to table this amendment. I urge my colleagues--even if they dearly love the Keystone XL Pipeline [[Page S270]] and even if they can't wait to bring in the Canadian tar sands--think about this as if this were your hometown, your neighborhood, and you lived in a house such as this and you looked across the road at that miserable pile, three stories high, of petcoke blowing in for your children and your grandchildren to breathe every day. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska. Amendment No. 41 to Amendment No. 2 Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, at this time I ask unanimous consent to set aside the pending amendment to call up the Toomey amendment No. 41. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk will report. The assistant legislative clerk read as follows: The Senator from Alaska, [Ms. Murkowski], for Mr. Toomey, for himself, Mr. Casey, and Mr. Hatch, proposes an amendment numbered 41 to amendment No. 2. Ms. MURKOWSKI. I ask unanimous consent that reading of the amendment be dispensed with. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The amendment is as follows: (Purpose: To continue cleaning up fields and streams while protecting neighborhoods, generating affordable energy, and creating jobs) At the appropriate place, insert the following: SEC. __. STANDARDS FOR COAL REFUSE POWER PLANTS. (a) Findings.--Congress finds that-- (1) 19th-century mining operations left behind more than 2,000,000,000 tons of coal refuse on surface land in various coal mining regions of the United States; (2) coal refuse piles-- (A) pose significant environmental risks; (B) have contaminated more than 180,000 acres of land and streams; and (C) are susceptible to fires that endanger public health and emit an estimated 9,000,000 tons of carbon dioxide each year, in addition to other uncontrolled pollutants; (3) the Environmental Protection Agency, the Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement, and the Department of Environmental Protection of the State of Pennsylvania recognize the significant public health benefits of power plants that use coal refuse as fuel; (4) since the inception of coal refuse power plants, the plants have removed 210,000,000 tons of coal refuse and restored 8,200 acres of contaminated land; and (5) due to the unique nature of coal refuse and the power plants that use coal refuse as a fuel, those plants face distinct economic and technical obstacles to achieving compliance with regulatory standards established for traditional coal-fired power plants. (b) Definition of Coal Refuse.--In this section, the term ``coal refuse'' means any byproduct of coal mining, physical coal cleaning, or coal preparation operations that contains coal, matrix material, clay, and other organic and inorganic material. (c) Emission Limitations for Certain Electric Utility Steam Generating Units.-- (1) In general.--The general emission limitations established by the Environmental Protection Agency in the final rule entitled ``Federal Implementation Plans: Interstate Transport of Fine Particulate Matter and Ozone and Correction of SIP Approvals'' (76 Fed. Reg. 48208 (August 8, 2011)) (or a successor regulation) shall not apply to an electric utility steam generating unit described in paragraph (3). (2) Hydrogen chloride and sulfur dioxide.--The emission limitations for hydrogen chloride and sulfur dioxide contained in table 2 of subpart UUUUU of part 63 of title 40, Code of Federal Regulations (or successor regulations), entitled ``Emission Limits for Existing EGUs'' shall not apply to an electric utility steam generating unit described in paragraph (3). (3) Description of electric utility steam generating units.--An electric utility steam generating unit referred to in paragraphs (1) and (2) is an electric utility steam generating unit that-- (A) is in operation as of the date of enactment of this Act; (B) uses fluidized bed combustion technology to convert coal refuse into energy; and (C) uses coal refuse as at least 50 percent of the annual fuel consumed, by weight, of the unit. (d) Effective Date.--Notwithstanding any other provision of this Act, this section takes effect on the date of enactment of this Act. Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, obviously, Senator Toomey will come to the floor to speak to his amendment. I wish to follow up on the comments of the Senator from Illinois, who was referring to petcoke. Senator Toomey in his amendment is attempting to deal with a situation in specific parts of the country that are impacted by coal refuse. Coal refuse, as it is defined in his amendment, effectively comes about from some centuries-old, 19th century mining operations that left behind this coal refuse in certain parts of the coal mining regions around the country. They remain a legacy problem that is acknowledged, a legacy problem that creates environmental issues, including contamination of local streams with heavy metals, acid, and mine drainage, that, again, I think we all recognize there is a responsibility to address. The good news is there is a solution to cleaning up this problem. Coal refuse powerplants take this coal and these waste piles and turn them into energy and heat for consumers, for businesses. They follow EPA regulations. This is not a situation where we are bypassing EPA regulations when it comes to the emissions issues. But remediating these mine sites, removing these waste piles, and at the same time generating electricity with the coal and applying the basic ash from the process reclaims the land at a lower cost. So we are able to do several things at the same time. We are dealing with an environmental issue that has been in place for far too long. We are generating electricity that can be used to the benefit of consumers and businesses, and we are also able to reclaim the land. So it is viewed, clearly, as a win here. It also creates some jobs. It improves the environment and it boosts economic growth. Burning these coal waste piles is basically a carbon-neutral process because the carbon in these piles is currently being emitted into the atmosphere through the slow chemical process that is at play there, and we also have fires that burn within these piles. So just sitting there is not an answer to a better environment and reduced emissions. The plants that burn this waste coal cannot economically be as clean as plants using higher quality coal. But the side benefits of removing these waste piles, again, from the perspective of dealing with emissions, generating electricity, and reclaiming the land--the benefits do compensate for the differences that are out there. Historically, environmental regulators have recognized these benefits. They have carved out the plants from regulatory standards that would cause them to shut down. There have been EPA regulations recently that have failed to sustain this approach and, thus there is the amendment of the Senator from Pennsylvania that would allow these coal waste plants to run. I encourage my colleagues to look at this amendment in front of us and consider the merits as Senator Toomey has laid out. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington. Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I know we are running against a time clock here in getting ready for the State of the Union Address tonight. I appreciate my colleague from Alaska going back and forth on these amendments and allowing both sides of the aisle to set up some pending amendments. I will just say the Toomey amendment asks for an exemption of the Clean Air Act which I wouldn't support. I know we will have a chance later on to have that discussion. Our colleague from Nebraska came to the floor and offered an amendment that would make it incredibly difficult without first proving there was negative management of Federal land to get any more national monuments. National monuments have been big economic drivers in a lot of communities and have preserved some very unique parts of our country. We will have a chance to talk about that a little bit later. But I wish to make sure we get our colleague recognized so he can offer his amendment. Then, I think we will probably, as my colleague from Alaska said, be finished for this afternoon as it relates to offering amendments back and forth. I wish to recognize the Senator from Rhode Island for his amendment. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island. Amendment No. 29 to Amendment No. 2 (Purpose: to express the sense of the Senate that climate change is real and not a hoax) Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to lay aside the pending amendment so that I may call up my amendment No. 29. [[Page S271]] The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk will report. The assistant legislative clerk read as follows: The Senator from Rhode Island [Mr. Whitehouse] proposes an amendment numbered 29 to amendment No. 2. On page 3, between lines 19 and 20, insert the following: SEC. __. SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING CLIMATE CHANGE. It is the sense of the Senate that climate change is real and not a hoax. Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I first wish to thank the distinguished chairman of the energy committee and her ranking member for allowing this process to go forward to the point where I am able to call up this amendment. It is a convention here when amendments are called up to ask unanimous consent that the reading be dispensed with, but in this amendment, the effective language is only eight words: ``Climate change is real and not a hoax.'' So I went ahead and allowed the clerical staff to read the whole operative text of this amendment. This is an extremely simple amendment. We are here in this remarkable body in which so much history has taken place and in which so many great achievements have been fought through, many of them with powerful interests and strong arguments on opposite sides. And through that conflict, here in this body, we have been able to generate some of the great compromises and some of the great resolutions that have defined the course of the history of this country. So what a wonderful place this is to have the opportunity to serve. Now, in this great deliberative body, called by many the greatest deliberative body, we have a great issue before us--perhaps as many say, the issue of our time--and that is what our carbon pollution--the excess carbon that we burn when we burn fossil fuels--is doing to our atmosphere and what it is doing to our oceans. There is no factual debate about what it is doing to our atmosphere and our oceans. It is crystal clear, and the consequences are crystal clear as well. If my colleagues don't believe me, fine, go ask the U.S. military. Ask Admiral Locklear. Ask the Secretary of the Navy. Ask the Joint Chiefs of Staff. If my colleagues don't want to believe in the military, ask our religious leaders. Ask the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops. If my colleagues only believe what corporations tell us, ask some of our biggest and most successful American corporations. Ask Walmart. Ask Coca-Cola. Ask Nike, ask Apple, ask Google. Go on through the corporate heraldry, and virtually every American corporation that is not actively involved in the fossil fuel industry will tell us this is a real and serious problem. And many of them are dedicating an enormous amount of internal effort to try to solve it within their corporate boundaries. Again, Walmart and Coca-Cola come right to the head of the list. Of course, we don't have to ask our scientists any longer. They are pretty clear. They use words such as ``unequivocal'' and ``undeniable'' at every single scientific society that represents the major elements of the profession in this country. Every single one has made this a priority. If people just want to go out to farmers, foresters, and fishermen, they are already seeing the changes around them. So here we are in this great deliberative body with this extraordinarily important issue that we have to face, and what do we see? Silence, virtually dead silence, because one side of this body won't even discuss the question. Many refuse to believe that climate change even exists, and for those who do, the political perils of using that phrase have now become so great that there is no serious conversation back and forth about climate change. In the first week we debated the Keystone Pipeline, which the environmental impact statement said will have a dramatic effect on climate change--the equivalent of 6 million added cars on our highways for 50 years, not to mention the petcoke and the byproducts, and just the carbon effect of it--no mention. The only time it was mentioned was when our distinguished energy committee chairman mentioned the testimony of a witness in her committee. She was good enough to make sure that climate change was raised in her committee, and she mentioned that there had been a witness who in turn mentioned climate change. But there was no direct mention in all of the debate that we heard in that week about climate change. It is the word that cannot be said. That is wrong. We cannot ignore this problem. It is too real for my fishermen in Rhode Island. It is to real for the people who are living near coasts and are seeing beaches they used to be able to play on eaten away. It is too real for the people whose homes have fallen into the sea. It is too real for us not to discuss it. Now, it is not going to be easy, and we have to start somewhere. So this is a start. I am going to ask my colleagues to vote on such a simple question: Is climate change real or is it a hoax? Both points of view have been expressed in this body. Where do we come down? Let's actually find out if there are people on the Republican side of the aisle who are willing to say climate change is real. My moose up in New Hampshire, one could say, are suffering unprecedented infestations of ticks because there is no snow for them to fall off and die, and the moose are getting overwhelmed. We could say that in the University of Oklahoma, the leading dean is an IPCC member and led the establishment of Climate Central. One could go to the Carolina coasts and hear from the coastal agencies about sea level rise. One could go to Arizona and hear about the desertification and the drought. We can go all over the place and find these things, and they are real. We have to have this conversation. It has to begin with as simple a proposition as this. Then, I hope if we can build off this if we can find a few Republican Senators who will say publicly that climate change is real. We can then go on to if it is real, let's have a conversation about what we do about it, because recklessly continuing to dump megatons of carbon into the atmosphere every year is not a solution. And I don't want to be a part of a generation of which our kids and our grandchildren look back and ask: Where were they? Why could they not address this question? There they were in this great deliberative body. There they were with this great issue of our time. Why would they not even discuss it? So I hope this amendment gets the conversation under way. It is one I look forward to. I think there are very sensible ways to solve this problem, including ways that have been supported by everyone from Republican Secretaries of the Treasury to the lead economist for Ronald Reagan, the famous Mr. Laffer. There are ways we can make these adjustments. But we have to have the conversation, and I hope this begins it. With that, I yield the floor. Again, I thank the distinguished chairman of the energy committee for her courtesy in allowing us to proceed. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska. Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I thank my colleague. I think discussions we have had just in the past hour here since we have had the vote and the various amendments we now have pending before us--this is a good conversation. This is a good discussion and debate for us to be having as a body. We haven't had energy-related issues brought before this floor in some years now. We had a very limited debate on Keystone back in December, but I am hopeful that with the opportunity for amendments--and again, not just some amendments we on our side have handpicked and then decided what the Democrats might be able to move on their side--an opportunity for some real issues to be brought forward and to be debated on this floor. The Senator from Rhode Island is very passionate on the issue of climate change. I think it is fair to say that he has singlehandedly raised the awareness not only in this body but for those loyal followers on C-SPAN. When it comes to the issue of climate change, I think the Senator comes up once a week with his charts and a series of speeches that I think is meant to educate colleagues. I don't agree with all of it. I think that is a fair statement to say. But what is equally fair is that there is a care and concern for not only our country and our country's environment--truly the public [[Page S272]] safety of our people, a care for our land, the stewardship we have as Americans--but it goes well beyond our borders to that of our entire globe, our entire planet, and how we care for planet Earth and how we move forward responsibly. One aspect of the energy debate that I continue to advance is that we must ensure that if we are to make advances when it comes to caring for our environment and truly the whole issue of global climate, we have to be a nation that is economically secure in the sense that the technologies we will have to help us be cleaner in all that we do, do not come without cost. Here in this country, we have been the leaders, we have been the innovators when it comes to clean-energy technologies, and we should challenge ourselves every day to do more in that regard, to build out, to push out that R&D so that we are making--whether it is making clean coal truly clean, whether it is advancing those clean energy technologies. I, for one, coming from a fossil fuel-producing State, am a huge proponent of nuclear-powered generation in this country because I believe very strongly that it is the cleanest energy source we have at this point in time. So what are we doing in this country to make sure our energy is abundant, affordable, clean, diverse, and secure? These are the challenges I put out to my colleagues. I clearly appreciate the need that we have in this body and in this country to be moving forward with technologies that allow us to have reduced emissions, to have a cleaner environment, but I also want to make sure we do so in a way that doesn't cripple our economy. So how we lead in this way, which I believe we must, while keeping our economy where it must be--in the front and moving forward all the time--is our great challenge. Again, I look forward to the debate we will have. I am pleased we were able to process the amendments we had before us today. I look forward to advancing those that we have pending in front of us now and to good, continued, and robust discussion on this floor. I note the majority leader is here, and I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader. ____________________",package_114_126.csv,103393,103393,103462,"[congressional record volume 161, number 9 (tuesday, january 20, 2015)] [senate] [pages s260-s272] from the congressional record online through the government publishing office [ www.gpo.gov ] keystone xl pipeline act--continued the presiding officer. the senator from new jersey. mr. menendez. mr. president, parliamentary inquiry: i understand we are on the bill. the presiding officer. we are on the bill. mr. menendez. i thank the presiding officer. mr. president, let me say that i rise in general opposition to the keystone pipeline, and i rise in favor of senator markey's amendment. after long and careful deliberation--and after having had the benefit of a hearing on the pipeline in the senate foreign relations committee--i have decided to oppose this bill for four basic reasons. first, on the bill, i am deeply concerned that if approved this pipeline will be the first of many pipelines opening one of the largest sources of carbon on earth to exploitation. second, contrary to what many believe, i am convinced this pipeline will simply not enhance, help or--in any positive way--improve our energy profile. third, in my view, it is completely absurd for congress to take the role of permitting pipelines. it is a role we have never assumed and should not assume now. fourth, i believe it is ridiculous that our republican colleagues insist on language banning eminent domain for national parks legislation but oppose it when it comes to foreign or private projects such as keystone. furthermore, we cannot underestimate the environmental impacts of this pipeline. the facts are clear. the resource in alberta is enormous; the tar sands formation is the size of iowa; tar sands oil is 17 percent more greenhouse gas intensive than other forms of oil because it takes an enormous industrial process to extract it. it has been estimated that if this resource were fully exploited, it would release more carbon dioxide in the air than the united states has emitted in its entire history. as james hansen, one of the foremost climate scientists in the world, has said, building the keystone pipeline would be ``game over for the planet.'' there are also more local risks. over the weekend, landowners are seeing the pipeline spill in the yellowstone river in montana. it is happening right now, and landowners are wondering if their family farm will be the victim of a similar spill, wondering if property that has been in their family for generations can still be farmed and passed on to the next generation. while some jobs will be created by the pipeline, the fact is--after 2 years of construction--it will create only 35 permanent jobs--35. that is not a lot of jobs. if we want to create millions of permanent infrastructure jobs, i urge the supporters of the pipeline to support our efforts to increase transportation funding. i urge them to continue incentives for clean energy. i ask them to do all they can to help local governments rebuild local infrastructure systems. that is how we create permanent jobs that build our economy and help us keep our competitive advantage. by comparison, the number of jobs created by keystone is hardly an argument for passage of this legislation. as you all know, we also have the issue of eminent domain--the power of any governmental entity to take private property and convert it to public use subject to reasonable compensation. many, including some of my most conservative friends on the other side, were outraged by the idea that eminent domain proceedings could be used to seize private property for private gain. i have been working very closely with senator cantwell on an amendment, and we agree with our conservative colleagues that using eminent domain proceedings for private gain is pretty outrageous. here, on the issue of keystone, a foreign-owned company is using eminent domain to seize private property so it can better export canadian oil--a foreign-owned company using eminent domain to seize private property so it can better export canadian oil. the project is not in the public interest but clearly in the private interest. senator cantwell and i feel this amendment should be a no-brainer--an easy amendment every senator can support. in recent years republicans have insisted on similar language prohibiting the use of eminent domain when we establish national parks. if eminent domain cannot be used to establish a national park in the public interest to conserve our national treasures and preserve america's beauty for future generations, then surely--surely--it should not be used to benefit private interests; in this case, in the interest of a foreign-owned oil company seeking to ship its product around the world, which brings me to the amendment of the senator from massachusetts. amendment no. 13 we know the oil that will flow through this pipeline will flow directly to foreign markets. that is why i support the amendment from the senator from massachusetts. foreign oil is not subject to america's crude oil export ban, but whether it is shipped as crude or refined here and then exported, we all know this oil is not going to help the american consumers. the intent of the markey amendment can be summed up very simply, using an old adage that president reagan was fond of: ``trust but verify.'' for months now supporters of the keystone xl pipeline have been telling us the tar sands that will travel through the united states will help advance our energy security. they have been telling us the pipeline will bring a reliable source of fuel from a close ally and that it will reduce prices at the pump, helping u.s. consumers and businesses. the markey amendment does nothing more than confirm the promises made--time and time again--by supporters of the pipeline. it would require the tar sands that travel through the united states stay in the united states. it says that if americans are to accept all of the downsides of the pipeline, if u.s. property owners are to have their lands taken away for transcanada's benefit, if americans are forced to live with the risk of an oilspill of dirty tar sands that we do not even know how to clean up properly, then the very least we can do is get a guarantee in law that the united states will reap the benefits that come with all of these risks. so all this amendment does is put into writing the promises we have heard over and over again from supporters of the pipeline. it codifies in law what we previously had to take on faith. i thank my colleague from massachusetts for offering the amendment, and i would note he has a long history of working to improve america's energy security. he and i have worked closely since he came to the senate to protect the longstanding requirement that u.s.-produced crude oil stay here at home to benefit the u.s. consumer rather than being shipped across the globe. this amendment is another commonsense protection to make sure our nation's energy policy is aimed at helping consumers rather than helping oil companies' bottom line, and i encourage my colleagues to support it. for the last several congresses i have introduced the american oil for american families act, a bill to ensure that oil or petroleum products that originate within america's public lands or waters are not exported as crude or in refined form. that bill would increase our energy supply at home, lowering prices for consumers and businesses, and i intend to reintroduce that legislation in this congress. for these reasons, i urge my colleagues to support the markey amendment. i intend to vote against the bill, which in my view is nothing more than an earmark for big oil. the pipeline will have enormous environmental impacts, it will not significantly help the american economy, it will not benefit american consumers, and it will needlessly harm landowners for generations. with that, i yield the floor. the presiding officer. the senator from texas. state of the union address mr. cornyn. mr. president, tonight the president of the united states will address the nation on the state of our union and talk a little bit about his priorities for the coming year. [[page s261]] i am not sure how much more there is for the president to say than has already been leaked in the press in the drip, drip, drip of social media and other stories, but i am concerned he simply did not get the message that was delivered loud and clear on november 4 by the american voters. just a couple of months ago they sent a message that was loud and it was clear. they are fed up with the way things operate in washington, dc. they are fed up with the dysfunction, and they are fed up with the lack of real leadership that focuses on their concerns, not washington's concerns--concerns such as more money in their pocket. i was amused to listen to our good friend, our colleague from new jersey, complaining about additional exports of oil or actually gasoline and other fuel. it is actually the supply, the glut of gasoline onto the global markets that has caused a pay raise for most hard-working, middle-class families. the price of gasoline has plummeted because of the glut of supply. but we ought to be focused like a laser on how we put more money into the pocketbook of hard-working american taxpayers--after years of stagnant jobs and stagnant wages, the stagnant number of jobs for the record number of americans who have been looking for them. so after sending a message loud and clear on november 4, what is the president's response? he says more of the same. he is set to announce a $320 billion tax hike and hundreds of billions of dollars in more spending--yes, hundreds of billions of dollars more in taxes and hundreds of billions of dollars in more federal spending. sadly, the president has doubled down on the same agenda which, in his own words, was on the ballot this last fall and was soundly rejected. but this agenda and these policies are not only wrong for america today, they are certainly wrong for the america of our future. future generations deserve a country that provides them more opportunity than our parents had or than we have. that is called the american dream. but hundreds of billions of dollars in new spending and new taxes--when we already face an $18 trillion debt--well, that makes the american promise one unlikely to be fulfilled. the cause of this problem is pretty clear: the president remains focused on the priorities in washington, dc, and not on the priorities of hard-working american taxpayers working from paycheck to paycheck, dealing with rising costs of living when it comes to food and other commodities and who are sorely in need of additional money in their pocket. things clearly need to change. that to me was what the voters said on november 4. i think i speak for many americans and many texans when i say: mr. president, enough is enough. the american people expect better, and, more importantly, they deserve better. sure, we know there are always going to be big challenges, and they are not easy to deal with by any stretch of the imagination. but surely--surely--we can come up with better solutions than more taxes and more spending. this is really doubling down over the last 6 years. one would think that the president, giving the state of the union now in his seventh year in office, could come up with something a little bit different, particularly after his own party lost nine senate seats after this referendum on his failed policies that took place on november 4. the great news--and there is good news--is we do not have to start from scratch. we need to look no further than some of the laboratories of democracy--that is what louis brandeis called the state: the laboratories of democracy--to see what actually works. we know what does not work. so let's look and see what does work. we could learn a lot from states such as arizona, where the presiding officer is from, and my home state of texas. we are not perfect, but i think we have learned a few important lessons we could teach to the policymakers in the white house. many policymakers in washington seem to have forgotten the secret sauce, the formula, the recipe by which strong, sustainable economic growth that lifts the middle class in texas and in so many other states across the country--why that is alive and well and why those policies actually work. just last friday i had the opportunity to visit southeast texas. i was in beaumont, tx, actually, where the existing gulf coast leg of the keystone pipeline is already operating. i bet many of my colleagues would be amazed to know that we are already transporting canadian crude from canada all the way across the country, by and large on railcars, to refineries on the gulf coast. the keystone xl pipeline--the legislation that we will be voting on today-- will increase the supply, which means more product, and hopefully, that will result in downward pressure on prices for hard-working american taxpayers. while the president stood in the way of the building of this completed pipeline and the tens of thousands of jobs it would support, the gulf coast leg of the keystone pipeline in texas is already booming. but they are hungry for more crude feedstock so they can produce more and thereby create more jobs. it has been good for communities. i talked to the mayor of beaumont and other communities. i talked to a county judge. these taxes, which are provided by investment from the keystone xl pipeline, not only create good jobs, but the tax base is necessary to educate our kids in k-12 education. they provide the products and services from local businesses that sell goods. in other words, projects such as the keystone xl pipeline is a force multiplier when it comes to our economy and economic growth and opportunity, and of course, it has been good for thousands of construction workers who built the pipeline. i heard our colleagues on the other side of the aisle try to denigrate these construction jobs. they say that they are just temporary jobs. mr. president, you and i have a temporary job. we are elected for a term of office, and if we are not reelected, it is a temporary job. in effect, every job is a temporary job. but to denigrate these good, high-paying construction jobs, including those performed by welders--in texas, properly trained welders can make $140,000 to $150,000 a year. those are good, high-paying jobs, and we ought to respect and encourage them. that is just one example of how some of the folks at the white house look down their nose at these construction jobs and try to denigrate the economic contribution of projects such as the keystone xl pipeline and what they could learn from this project. in my state we reduced taxes, cut red tape in favor of sensible regulations, and encouraged businesses to come to texas to grow and create jobs. if i heard the story one time, i heard it 100 times. in my state, governor perry has contacted people in california and said: come to texas, where you are welcome and the cost of doing business is lower and the cost of living is cheaper. you can actually buy an affordable home for your family. people have voted with their feet and have come where the opportunity is. if we add it all up, over the last 6 years two-thirds of all new net jobs created in the united states of america came from just one state, and that is my home state. another thing washington could learn from texas is how to balance a budget. we actually balance our budget every year. earlier i mentioned that the president seems to be proud of the fact that the deficit is actually going down. as the presiding officer knows, that is the annual difference between what we take in and what we spend. what he doesn't tell you is that we are actually adding to the debt every year because we are still spending more money than we are bringing in, and it has now gone up about $8 trillion during his administration to an unprecedented $18 trillion national debt. we need to roll up our sleeves, and we invite the president to join us and take on the priorities of hard-working american taxpayers in every state across the country. we know this is not going to be easy, but that is what we volunteered for. i know there are colleagues here in the senate--republicans and democrats alike--who are eager to address the challenges that confront our country--whether it is economic, national security, or you name it. these are things that need to get done. at the end of the day, it doesn't really matter what i think the state of our [[page s262]] union is or, for that matter, it doesn't really matter what the president thinks the state of our union is. what matters is whether the teacher in katy, tx, believes his students will have the opportunities he did growing up or whether the single mom waiting tables in fort worth can find enough work to feed her family. our nation is truly strong when its people believe it to be, and i hope the president understands that and tries something new rather than the same old failed policies of the past. i yield the floor. the presiding officer (mr. portman). the senator from minnesota. mr. franken. i thank the presiding officer. amendment no. 17 i wish to urge my colleagues to oppose any motion to table my amendment. my amendment is about making sure that, if we do build the keystone xl pipeline, it is built with american iron and steel. those are jobs. i don't wish to short-circuit the process here, but if the pipeline is built, it should be built with american steel. the presiding officer's state produces a lot of american steel and very often with iron ore from my state. these are american jobs. transcanada has said that 50 percent of the iron and steel will be outsourced from other countries, and the iron and steel for some of the other pipes could come from other countries. they also said they can use those pipes in other projects, including other projects in canada. i agree with senator cornyn when he said these construction jobs that will help build the pipeline are real jobs. just because they are not permanent jobs does not mean they are not real jobs. providing the iron and steel and other manufactured products for this project will also provide real jobs. our amendment will do this entirely and consistently within the language of the bill and within our trade obligations. i ask that my colleagues not vote to table this amendment because a vote to table this is a vote against american jobs. it is a vote against jobs in ohio and minnesota. it is a vote against the shippers who ship our iron ore over the great lakes or by rail or over the mississippi so it can be used to make steel. we have done ``buy america'' legislation before. we just did it in 2013 on the wrda bill. i ask that my colleagues please not vote against american jobs. i thank the presiding officer. the presiding officer. the senator from alaska. ms. murkowski. mr. president, i will take a couple of minutes before we vote to speak to the franken amendment. i think all of us want to buy american and buy local whenever and wherever we can. we strongly support that since it does mean jobs--whether we are talking about a pipeline or otherwise. but i think the bigger question here--and what we have in front of us with the keystone xl pipeline--is what this amendment would do. this amendment would mandate specific materials for the keystone xl pipeline, and i think we need to put this into context. this pipeline is a private project. this is not a federally funded infrastructure project. this would be the first time that congress has directed or forced private parties to purchase domestic goods and materials. we actually asked the congressional research service to look into this to see if there was any other instance at the federal level where private parties were told that they must purchase 100-percent domestic goods and materials, and so far the answer to that inquiry has been that they can find no instance of that. i think we need to be careful about this as a precedent because if we are going to direct this particular project--the keystone xl--to have this requirement on it, where do we go next? what will happen to the next project that we have? will it be the next pipeline or the next renewable energy project? where does this slippery slope go? i think it is fair to note that transcanada has made a commitment to have 75 percent of the pipes for this project come from north america, and fully half of that--more than 332,000 tons of steel will come from the state of arkansas. i am with the senator from minnesota. we want to make sure we get as many jobs as we absolutely can and make sure they are good-paying jobs--whether it is in steel making or widget making or welders. this is about jobs. this is what we want to do to encourage jobs. i think we need to be very cognizant of what this particular amendment would do. this amendment--for the first time ever--would direct a private entity to utilize all american-made products throughout the process of the construction. it is important to note that the american iron and steel institute has been a strong supporter of the keystone xl pipeline. we have all received a letter--they called it a steelgram--from the american iron and steel institute. they let us know very clearly and in no uncertain terms that they support keystone xl. they said it is essential that congress act to ensure the approval of the keystone xl pipeline without further delay. again, i agree. we need to get moving on it. we need to do it without delay. i do think it is interesting to note that the amendment does allow for the president to waive the requirements for american materials based on certain findings he can make. i appreciate that is in there, and i think that is good. but think about where we are. it has been 3,200- and-some-odd days now where we have been waiting for the president to act to make a decision on the keystone xl pipeline. so i don't have any real confidence that he will move to act quickly on any kind of a waiver requirement. i just wanted to put that out there before we moved to take up the amendments that we have pending before us this afternoon and note that we will be doing that in a few short minutes. i yield the floor. the presiding officer. the senator from minnesota. mr. franken. mr. president, i have the greatest respect for the senator from alaska. i wish to say a few things about this private company. this company is asking us to do an extraordinary thing. we are debating this on the floor because they are asking us to circumvent the environmental and safety process here and possibly expose the united states--and the path of this pipeline--to tremendous environmental damage. this is very different. the senator asked: why won't this extend to every private enterprise? this is something we are here debating and voting on, and that should say something about the nature of this issue. the united steelworkers have endorsed my amendment. this is about american jobs. the question is: if we do build this pipeline, should it be built with american steel or should it be built with steel from other countries? again, in the bill, we make sure this is compliant with our trade obligations. there is nothing to stop us from doing this. this is a private foreign company that is asking us to circumvent our normal processes, and because of that, i feel we have the right to say this should be made with american steel and with jobs in the state of ohio and in the state of minnesota--american jobs. if this is about american jobs, let's make it about american jobs. again, this is a company that is asking us to circumvent our normal processes. so all i will say is that transcanada has said the pipes that have been made for this can be used in other projects in canada. if we are going to build this project, let's make it about american jobs. i thank the presiding officer. ms. mikulski. mr. president, i rise today to talk about jobs-- especially jobs in the u.s. steel industry. this november i went to a ceremony at sparrows point a former steel plant in maryland. it was a bittersweet day. i was there to honor the legacy of bethlehem steel and all of the steelworkers in baltimore. the site is being demolished but sparrows point has over 3,000 acres of land, access to ports, rails, and roads to attract companies to create jobs today and tomorrow. we don't have steel in maryland anymore. many of us still mourn its loss. but we still have steel in america and i am still for steel. if this keystone bill is really a jobs bill, then let us put some made-in-america jobs in it and show our support for american steel. [[page s263]] for over a hundred years, workers at sparrows point produced the steel that built america. members of my own family worked at this steel mill. my father would open the doors to his grocery store early so that bethlehem steel workers could pick up their lunch on their way to work. america's steel and steelworkers protect the united states and our freedom. at sparrows point, they rolled gun barrels, made steel for grenades, shells and landing craft during world war ii. god help us all if america stops making steel. during times of war-- will we depend on foreign steel to build our ships, aircraft carriers and weapons? american steelworkers work hard, play by the rules and serve their country. in war: building ships, tanks and weapons. in peace: making steel for our buildings and cars. yet for over 50 years, the steel industry withered--not because steel was unproductive or overpriced. the steel industry withered in america because congress didn't do everything possible to protect american steel from factors in the international steel market, raw material costs, slumping demand, low steels prices, and a global recession. the government looked the other way when foreign imports began to drive down our prices and drive down our steel mills. our government singles out specific industries all the time when it is in our national interest. we single out specific industries and then talk about their value to america. i agree with that. we single out industries when it is in our national interest because we need them as part of our economy or as part of our national production. helping the farmers or the airlines because of the national interest means national responsibility. in 2008, we bailed out the banks and we bailed out the auto industry for stability, security, and american independence. where is the help for the steel industry and the steelworkers? i have fought for steel in the past. now i am fighting for steel again. i fought so hard year after year to protect the lives and livelihoods in baltimore, in dundalk. i have fought for more than 25 years to reverse this tide against american manufacturing and against american steel. i am going to keep on fighting. i fought to keep sparrows point open. and when that wasn't possible, i fought for a safety net for workers trade adjustment assistance, unemployment insurance and health care benefits. i think about maryland steelworkers every day--what they are going through these past few years have been tough on workers, their families, and the community. i am supporting an amendment that protects american steel like steel has protected us. it is simple. let us put american workers back to work in good, solid steel jobs, by requiring that the pipeline's construction, connection, operation, and maintenance all be done with made-in-america, u.s. steel. let us get to work for american workers and let us put the jobs in this jobs bill. the presiding officer. the senator from alaska. amendment no. 3, as modified ms. murkowski. mr. president, i ask unanimous consent that portman amendment no. 3 be modified with the changes that are at the desk. the presiding officer. is there objection? without objection, it is so ordered. the amendment, as modified, is as follows: at the end, add the following: division b--energy efficiency improvement section 1. short title. this division may be cited as the ``energy efficiency improvement act of 2015''. title i--better buildings sec. 101. short title. this title may be cited as the ``better buildings act of 2015''. sec. 102. energy efficiency in federal and other buildings.

the senator from alaska. ms. murkowski. mr. president, i have a parliamentary inquiry. is there a request from the senator from massachusetts to speak to this amendment for 1 minute? what is the request? the presiding officer. he asked unanimous consent to speak for 1 minute. mr. markey. to this amendment. the presiding officer. without objection, it is so ordered. the senator from massachusetts is recognized. mr. markey. mr. president, this is a motion to table the markey amendment, which is an amendment to have every member of the senate be put on record as to whether or not the oil coming through the keystone pipeline [[page s266]] is then exported out of the united states. each member of the senate should be recorded on that issue. we import 5 million barrels of oil per day into the united states. we should not allow the canadians to use the united states as a straw to be able to then go down to the gulf of mexico and send that oil out of the country. we export young men and women over to the middle east in order to protect oil coming in from saudi arabia and kuwait. this is a chance to keep oil in america so we don't have to export it. i do not believe the appropriate vote for members is to support a tabling of the markey amendment so that we don't actually reach the heart of this substantive issue, which is that we should be working to have energy independence in america. when we are importing 5 million barrels of oil a day from russia, saudi arabia, and kuwait, we are in no way independent. i thank the presiding officer for the opportunity to speak. the presiding officer. the question is on agreeing to the motion. the yeas and nays have previously been ordered. the clerk will call the roll. the assistant legislative clerk called the roll. mr. durbin. i announce that the senator from nevada (mr. reid) is necessarily absent. the presiding officer (mr. lankford). are there any other senators in the chamber desiring to vote?

(a) definition of federally protected land.--in this section, the term ``federally protected land'' means any area designated or acquired by the federal government for the purpose of conserving historic, cultural, environmental, scenic, recreational, developmental, or biological resources. (b) findings required.--new federally protected land shall not be designated unless the secretary, prior to the designation, publishes in the federal register-- (1) a finding that the addition of the new federally protected land would not have a negative impact on the administration of existing federally protected land; and (2) a finding that, as of the date of the finding, sufficient resources are available to effectively implement management plans for existing units of federally protected land. mrs. fischer. mr. president, this amendment would create limitations for new federal land designations to ensure responsible management of our natural resources. these limitations are modeled on those in the national marine sanctuaries act, which authorizes the protection of national marine sanctuaries. under the act, the commerce secretary cannot designate a new sanctuary unless the secretary publishes a finding that, no. 1, the addition of a new sanctuary will not have a negative impact on the overall system, and no. 2, sufficient resources were available in the fiscal year in which the finding is made to effectively implement management plans for each sanctuary in the system. these are commonsense limitations that ensure the administration will not add more land to the federal system without considering the impacts to the overall system and without sufficient funds to manage those resources effectively. at a time when the national park system has a $13 billion maintenance backlog, we need to consider the impacts to the overall system and whether there are sufficient resources to effectively manage additional land holdings. in the context of energy policy, we should also consider our stewardship choices. american energy production on private and state- owned lands has increased significantly in recent years while decreasing on federal lands. through leasing restrictions and permitting delays, the obama administration has tied up energy production on federal lands in redtape. since 2009 oil production on federal lands is down by 6 percent, and natural gas production on federal lands is down 28 percent. meanwhile, oil production on non- federal land has risen by 61 percent, and natural gas production on non-federal land is up by 33 percent. by limiting federal land designations, more land should continue to be held privately or managed by states and local governments, increasing the opportunity for productive and beneficial use. thank you, mr. president. i yield the floor. the presiding officer. the senator from washington. ms. cantwell. mr. president, as we go back and forth on offering amendments, i wish to turn to the senator from hawaii for him to offer his amendment. mr. schatz. i thank the senator from washington. the presiding officer. the senator from hawaii. amendment no. 58 to amendment no. 2 mr. schatz. mr. president, i ask unanimous consent that the senate set aside the pending amendment in order to call up amendment no. 58. the presiding officer. without objection, it is so ordered. the clerk will report. the assistant legislative clerk read as follows: the senator from hawaii [mr. schatz] proposes an amendment numbered 58 to amendment no. 2. mr. schatz. mr. president, i ask unanimous consent that reading of the amendment be dispensed with. the presiding officer. without objection, it is so ordered. the amendment is as follows: (purpose: to express the sense of congress regarding climate change) at the appropriate place, insert the following: sec. __. sense of congress. (a) findings.--the environmental analysis contained in the final supplemental environmental impact statement referred to in section 2(a) and deemed to satisfy the requirements of the national environmental policy act of 1969 (42 u.s.c. 4321 et seq.) as described in section 2(a), states that-- (1) ``[w]arming of the climate system is unequivocal and each of the last [3] decades has been successively warmer at the earth's surface than any preceding decade since 1850.''; (2) ``the [intergovernmental panel on climate change], in addition to other institutions, such as the national research council and the united states (u.s.) global change research program (usgcrp), have concluded that it is extremely likely that global increases in atmospheric [greenhouse gas] concentrations and global temperatures are caused by human activities.''; and (3) ``a warmer planet causes large-scale changes that reverberate throughout the climate system of the earth, including higher sea levels, changes in precipitation, and altered weather patterns (e.g. an increase in more extreme weather events).''. (b) sense of congress.--consistent with the findings under subsection (a), it is the sense of congress that-- (1) climate change is real; and (2) human activity significantly contributes to climate change. mr. schatz. this amendment affirms something very simple; that is, climate change is real and human activities significantly contribute to climate change. it also states that a warmer planet causes large-scale changes, including higher sea levels, changes in precipitation, and altered weather patterns, such as increases in more extreme weather events. this amendment cites for its evidence the findings of national and international scientific institutions, including the ipcc, the national research council, and the u.s. global change research program. all of these organizations are cited and quoted in the state department's final supplemental environmental impact statement on keystone xl pipeline. this is the same environmental review document that plays a prominent role in the text of the underlying bill, s. 1, and the substitute amendment. [[page s268]] the purpose of this amendment is simply to acknowledge and restate a set of observable facts. it is not intended to place a value judgment on those facts or to suggest a specific course of action in response to those facts. it is just a set of facts derived from decades of careful study of our land, air, and water. i urge my colleagues to support this amendment. i yield the floor. the presiding officer. the senator from alaska. amendment no. 33 to amendment no. 2 ms. murkowski. mr. president, i ask unanimous consent to set aside the pending amendment to call up senator lee's amendment no. 33. the presiding officer. without objection, it is so ordered. the clerk will report. the assistant legislative clerk read as follows: the senator from alaska [ms. murkowski], for mr. lee, proposes an amendment numbered 33 to amendment no. 2. ms. murkowski. mr. president, i ask unanimous consent that reading of the amendment be dispensed with. the presiding officer. without objection, it is so ordered. the amendment is as follows: (purpose: to conform citizen suits under the endangered species act of 1973) at the appropriate place, insert the following: sec. ___. award of litigation costs to prevailing parties in accordance with existing law. section 11(g)(4) of the endangered species act of 1973 (16 u.s.c. 1540(g)(4)) is amended by striking ``to any'' and all that follows through the end of the sentence and inserting ``to any prevailing party in accordance with section 2412 of title 28, united states code.''. ms. murkowski. very briefly on senator lee's amendment--he will be here to speak to it--this is a measure which would ensure that the rate of legal fees that are paid in endangered species act cases would be consistent with those in other cases that are eligible for lawyer's fee compensation. right now there is no cap on the hourly rate lawyers can be paid in connection with lawsuits that are brought regarding violations under the esa. so this amendment would standardize the award of attorney's fees to parties prevailing against the federal government by applying a $125-an-hour rate cap under the equal access to justice act requirement. this applies to small business-related claims, among other things, and this would apply the same standard to esa cases. this is a measure senator lee will come to the floor to speak to further, but i would just give a little preview of that. the presiding officer. the senator from washington. ms. cantwell. i would like to call on the senator from illinois to offer his amendment. amendment no. 69 to amendment no. 2 mr. durbin. mr. president, i ask unanimous consent to set aside the pending amendment to call up amendment no. 69. the presiding officer. without objection, it is so ordered. the clerk will report. the assistant legislative clerk read as follows: the senator from illinois [mr. durbin] proposes an amendment numbered 69 to amendment no. 2. mr. durbin. mr. president, i ask unanimous consent that reading of the amendment be dispensed with. the presiding officer. without objection, it is so ordered. the amendment is as follows: (purpose: to ensure that the storage and transportation of petroleum coke is regulated in a manner that ensures the protection of public and ecological health) at the appropriate place, insert the following: sec. ___. regulation of transportation and storage of petroleum coke. this act shall not take effect prior to the date that-- (1) the administrator of the environmental protection agency, in consultation with the secretary of transportation, promulgates rules concerning the storage and transportation of petroleum coke that ensure the protection of public and ecological health; and (2) petroleum coke is no longer exempt from regulation under section 101(14) of the comprehensive environmental response, compensation, and liability act of 1980 (42 u.s.c. 9601(14)), which may be established either by an act of congress or any regulations, rules, or guidance issued by the administrator of the environmental protection agency. mr. durbin. mr. president, about 1 year ago i was invited to go to the southeast part of the city of chicago. it is an area that used to be populated by steel mills and now there are a lot of struggling families. the manufacturing jobs were not replaced. these are hard-working people--many are mexican-american people. they sustain what you might expect--great parishes and churches and a great spirit among them, but now they are in a constant struggle. they live in a part of chicago that has seen better days. they are doing their darndest for their families. they invited me to see something. they wanted me to see what they were living next door to. i went down to that part of the city of chicago--within the boundaries of the city of chicago--and i could not believe what i saw. they live in little houses such as these, and across from them is a mountainous gathering of something called petcoke. what is petcoke? if you take the canadian tar sands that will move through the keystone xl pipeline to a refinery and put them through a process where you can end up with a viable product, such as gasoline, jet fuel, diesel fuel or whatever it might be, you have to clean out all of this petcoke that creates the tar sands composition that they are dealing with. when it is all over with--and if the process has been successful-- there is a lot of waste. in fact, there are 61 pounds of petcoke for every barrel of oil. keep in mind that the senator who is sponsoring the underlying legislation--we are dealing with moving hundreds of thousands of barrels a day through this pipeline. now take every one of those barrels and have 61 pounds of petcoke left over as a result of the refining process. what happens to it? this is what happened to it in chicago. it was dumped in the neighborhood. the people invited me to come to their homes, and i did. i walked into this woman's home, and she said: i have sealed the windows. i taped them shut because this black, sooty petcoke blows through my windows night and day. i cannot stop it. is it something to worry about? it turns out that the petcoke is not a benign material. we are not talking about dust in the air. we are talking about a composition that includes--according to those who have taken a close look at it--heavy metals. would you want your baby in your home--or my home or my grandchildren--breathing in this filthy, petcoke-infested dust night and day? they are not making it up. they showed me the window sills, and you could see the black, sooty petcoke. i will tell you the details of the story. the environmental review for the project of keystone xl notes that communities throughout the midwest have noticed large piles of petroleum coke--or petcoke-- building up as more and more tar sands are processed. this picture tells a story. this is near a body of water which is carrying this petcoke on the water. these poor folks deal with it as it blows through the air. this type of crude oil is carried by the keystone xl pipeline, a pipeline which the republican majority has decided is their no. 1 priority in the senate. under the new republican majority it is s. 1. this pipeline, on behalf of a canadian company, transcanada, is the topic we are facing. we just had a vote and unfortunately could not prevail with the notion that at least the oil that comes out of the pipeline ought to be for the benefit of american consumers. we lost that vote. i think the vote was 57 to 42. it was tabled. let's talk about the actual process itself. according to the epa--as i mentioned, the environmental impact statement--every barrel of tar sands contains 61 pounds of petcoke. that means the keystone xl pipeline alone will produce 15,400 metric tons of petcoke every day-- 15,400 metric tons of petcoke every day. would you like to live next door to that? that is what is happening in the city of chicago, but it not the only one. this petcoke comes from the bp, british petroleum, refinery in whiting, in. it is on the very southern tip of lake michigan. we can see it from the city of chicago. they went through a [[page s269]] $4 billion upgrade and put in new equipment so they could start processing the canadian tar sands which will come down through the keystone xl pipeline. soon after they started this processing with $4 billion of new equipment, the people living in this part of chicago looked out their windows to see the massive piles of petcoke building up, and as a consequence they got worried. they are worried for their children. on windy days--it is, in fact, the ``windy city''--black clouds of this dust blow from piles into this working-class neighborhood. it always seems to be the case, doesn't it? if somebody tried to put this on the north shore of chicago, they would scream bloody murder. but the company that owns this petcoke put it outside a poor neighborhood--a working-class neighborhood in chicago. the petcoke dust settles on window sills and porches. i met the kids running outside. they are producing 6,000 tons of petcoke every single day at the british petroleum refinery in whiting, in--6,000 tons a day. at that rate the plant only has room to store a few days' worth of production onsite. so they ended up selling the petcoke to a company called kcbx. it is a subsidiary company owned by the koch brothers--yes, those koch brothers. connect the dots. the highest priority of the republican majority in the senate was to call up a bill for a canadian company to transport tar sands across the united states with no promise that the american consumers would ever be able to access it, and the process of refining the canadian tar sands ends up inuring to the benefit of many companies, such as british petroleum and kcbx, which again is owned by the koch brothers. these are the same koch brothers who are viable political players in our political campaigns. this means the people in southeast chicago are forced to breathe this dirty air that members of national nurses united say causes severe health threats. petcoke contains high levels of heavy metals, such as vanadium and nickel, and dust particles get trapped in residents' lungs, triggering asthma and exacerbating heart and lung conditions. when i go to a school--whether it is rural or urban--i make a point to ask a very basic question: does any student here know anyone with asthma? half of the hands are up in every classroom. our pages are starting to raise their hands, of course. so here we have a national problem, a respiratory problem, which has been made dramatically worse by the byproduct, petcoke, of the keystone xl pipeline. that is a fact. what i have argued to you now so far is indisputable. the community and members of the southeast environmental task force that i visited with in chicago are fighting back with the help of the national resources defense council. they worked with mayor emanuel and chicago officials to put standards in place for petcoke storage sites that protect public and environmental health. they have come up with a radical notion--if you want to store this dangerous petcoke, then for goodness' sake put it inside a building so it doesn't blow all over the neighborhood. they are suing kcbx and koch industries for the damages caused by petcoke piles after the environmental protection agency issued a notice to the company of clean air act violations. the people who hate the epa like the devil hates holy water do not want them to come in and look at something as outrageous as this and tell you the obvious. this is a public health danger. petcoke from canadian tar sands, and part of the keystone xl pipeline, is a public health hazard. unfortunately, petcoke just isn't an issue in chicago or illinois. my colleague from michigan, senator gary peters, told me a story earlier. he can tell you what happened in detroit when another koch brothers- owned company decided to store large piles of petcoke on the detroit river. if you look online, you can still find the youtube video of black clouds blowing off the piles of the koch brothers' petcoke into the river. in fact, senator peters said that at one point this black cloud was so dense it obscured the ambassador bridge between the united states and canada. you could not see it. it took years of complaints and lawsuits from local communities to get shipping ports in california to require piles of petcoke that was being stored there to be kept in enclosed facilities and covered at all times. other communities continue to fight, including my city of chicago, which i am proud to represent. as the u.s. refines more and more tar sands--that is what this bill is all about, refining more and more canadian tar sands. every single day tons of this petcoke is produced with no end in sight and no way of protecting the people who live around that area from the damage it will cause to the lungs of children and other vulnerable people, such as elderly people with respiratory challenges. residents in houston, tx, and the state of ohio have complained about how these petcoke piles stored in their neighborhoods are damaging their homes and health, but many americans affected by petcoke don't have the money or power to take on big companies, so it is up to congress. it is up to us to ensure that every person in america--rich or poor, whether they live in a good neighborhood or a struggling neighborhood--has the protection against public health hazards. there is a current exemption of petcoke from environmental laws. when you think of all of the things blowing in the air, how in the world did petcoke end up being treated like fairy dust? it is exempt from laws relating to basic things, such as the superfund. it is exempt from laws relating to hazardous waste and materials. they must have had friends in high places to make sure this miserable source of respiratory problems would be exempt from federal law. my amendment would change that. it would end this exemption so they would be held to environmental and public health standards when it comes to this miserable byproduct of canadian tar sands and the keystone xl pipeline. my amendment goes on to require the epa and the department of transportation to implement rules for petcoke storage and transportation to protect the public health and environment. is there anyone here who will tell you that the folks, transcanada or those refining this, should not have that responsibility? i would not want to see this anywhere. i would not want to see it in alaska, and i would not want to see it in oklahoma. i sure don't want to even see it in the city of chicago. but to think it goes unregulated--absolutely unregulated--is amazing, and that is what my amendment addresses. the united states already produces millions of tons of petcoke each year. building this pipeline is just going to add dramatically to that amount. by fixing the legal status of petcoke and making it subject to the same laws as all other dangerous materials, we can help ensure that clean air and clean water is something everyone enjoys, whether they are rich or poor and no matter what state they happen to live in. i hope the senate will have a chance to vote on my amendment to close this loophole for petcoke and establish reasonable guidelines for handling the material. it is time we put the health and well-being of americans ahead of the profits of any industry involved in the processing of canadian tar sands because no community--especially the southeast side of chicago-- should be considered a dumping ground for companies to make money off the lungs and health of vulnerable children, elderly, and poor people. no family should be forced to live next door to a three-story-high pile of petcoke, and that is what is going on. no kid should have to move from a ball field to play inside so they are not exposed to hazardous chemicals. i know what will happen. somebody is going to make a motion to table this amendment. we can run, but we can't hide, just as we can run, but we can't hide from blowing petcoke. if my colleagues won't allow a vote on this amendment to classify this as a material that should be regulated for the safety of the environment and public health, they will be on record if they vote to table this amendment. i urge my colleagues--even if they dearly love the keystone xl pipeline [[page s270]] and even if they can't wait to bring in the canadian tar sands--think about this as if this were your hometown, your neighborhood, and you lived in a house such as this and you looked across the road at that miserable pile, three stories high, of petcoke blowing in for your children and your grandchildren to breathe every day. i yield the floor. the presiding officer. the senator from alaska. amendment no. 41 to amendment no. 2 ms. murkowski. mr. president, at this time i ask unanimous consent to set aside the pending amendment to call up the toomey amendment no. 41. the presiding officer. is there objection? without objection, it is so ordered. the clerk will report. the assistant legislative clerk read as follows: the senator from alaska, [ms. murkowski], for mr. toomey, for himself, mr. casey, and mr. hatch, proposes an amendment numbered 41 to amendment no. 2. ms. murkowski. i ask unanimous consent that reading of the amendment be dispensed with. the presiding officer. without objection, it is so ordered. the amendment is as follows: (purpose: to continue cleaning up fields and streams while protecting neighborhoods, generating affordable energy, and creating jobs) at the appropriate place, insert the following: sec. __. standards for coal refuse power plants. (a) findings.--congress finds that-- (1) 19th-century mining operations left behind more than 2,000,000,000 tons of coal refuse on surface land in various coal mining regions of the united states; (2) coal refuse piles-- (a) pose significant environmental risks; (b) have contaminated more than 180,000 acres of land and streams; and (c) are susceptible to fires that endanger public health and emit an estimated 9,000,000 tons of carbon dioxide each year, in addition to other uncontrolled pollutants; (3) the environmental protection agency, the office of surface mining reclamation and enforcement, and the department of environmental protection of the state of pennsylvania recognize the significant public health benefits of power plants that use coal refuse as fuel; (4) since the inception of coal refuse power plants, the plants have removed 210,000,000 tons of coal refuse and restored 8,200 acres of contaminated land; and (5) due to the unique nature of coal refuse and the power plants that use coal refuse as a fuel, those plants face distinct economic and technical obstacles to achieving compliance with regulatory standards established for traditional coal-fired power plants. (b) definition of coal refuse.--in this section, the term ``coal refuse'' means any byproduct of coal mining, physical coal cleaning, or coal preparation operations that contains coal, matrix material, clay, and other organic and inorganic material. (c) emission limitations for certain electric utility steam generating units.-- (1) in general.--the general emission limitations established by the environmental protection agency in the final rule entitled ``federal implementation plans: interstate transport of fine particulate matter and ozone and correction of sip approvals'' (76 fed. reg. 48208 (august 8, 2011)) (or a successor regulation) shall not apply to an electric utility steam generating unit described in paragraph (3). (2) hydrogen chloride and sulfur dioxide.--the emission limitations for hydrogen chloride and sulfur dioxide contained in table 2 of subpart uuuuu of part 63 of title 40, code of federal regulations (or successor regulations), entitled ``emission limits for existing egus'' shall not apply to an electric utility steam generating unit described in paragraph (3). (3) description of electric utility steam generating units.--an electric utility steam generating unit referred to in paragraphs (1) and (2) is an electric utility steam generating unit that-- (a) is in operation as of the date of enactment of this act; (b) uses fluidized bed combustion technology to convert coal refuse into energy; and (c) uses coal refuse as at least 50 percent of the annual fuel consumed, by weight, of the unit. (d) effective date.--notwithstanding any other provision of this act, this section takes effect on the date of enactment of this act. ms. murkowski. mr. president, obviously, senator toomey will come to the floor to speak to his amendment. i wish to follow up on the comments of the senator from illinois, who was referring to petcoke. senator toomey in his amendment is attempting to deal with a situation in specific parts of the country that are impacted by coal refuse. coal refuse, as it is defined in his amendment, effectively comes about from some centuries-old, 19th century mining operations that left behind this coal refuse in certain parts of the coal mining regions around the country. they remain a legacy problem that is acknowledged, a legacy problem that creates environmental issues, including contamination of local streams with heavy metals, acid, and mine drainage, that, again, i think we all recognize there is a responsibility to address. the good news is there is a solution to cleaning up this problem. coal refuse powerplants take this coal and these waste piles and turn them into energy and heat for consumers, for businesses. they follow epa regulations. this is not a situation where we are bypassing epa regulations when it comes to the emissions issues. but remediating these mine sites, removing these waste piles, and at the same time generating electricity with the coal and applying the basic ash from the process reclaims the land at a lower cost. so we are able to do several things at the same time. we are dealing with an environmental issue that has been in place for far too long. we are generating electricity that can be used to the benefit of consumers and businesses, and we are also able to reclaim the land. so it is viewed, clearly, as a win here. it also creates some jobs. it improves the environment and it boosts economic growth. burning these coal waste piles is basically a carbon-neutral process because the carbon in these piles is currently being emitted into the atmosphere through the slow chemical process that is at play there, and we also have fires that burn within these piles. so just sitting there is not an answer to a better environment and reduced emissions. the plants that burn this waste coal cannot economically be as clean as plants using higher quality coal. but the side benefits of removing these waste piles, again, from the perspective of dealing with emissions, generating electricity, and reclaiming the land--the benefits do compensate for the differences that are out there. historically, environmental regulators have recognized these benefits. they have carved out the plants from regulatory standards that would cause them to shut down. there have been epa regulations recently that have failed to sustain this approach and, thus there is the amendment of the senator from pennsylvania that would allow these coal waste plants to run. i encourage my colleagues to look at this amendment in front of us and consider the merits as senator toomey has laid out. the presiding officer. the senator from washington. ms. cantwell. mr. president, i know we are running against a time clock here in getting ready for the state of the union address tonight. i appreciate my colleague from alaska going back and forth on these amendments and allowing both sides of the aisle to set up some pending amendments. i will just say the toomey amendment asks for an exemption of the clean air act which i wouldn't support. i know we will have a chance later on to have that discussion. our colleague from nebraska came to the floor and offered an amendment that would make it incredibly difficult without first proving there was negative management of federal land to get any more national monuments. national monuments have been big economic drivers in a lot of communities and have preserved some very unique parts of our country. we will have a chance to talk about that a little bit later. but i wish to make sure we get our colleague recognized so he can offer his amendment. then, i think we will probably, as my colleague from alaska said, be finished for this afternoon as it relates to offering amendments back and forth. i wish to recognize the senator from rhode island for his amendment. the presiding officer. the senator from rhode island. amendment no. 29 to amendment no. 2 (purpose: to express the sense of the senate that climate change is real and not a hoax) mr. whitehouse. mr. president, i ask unanimous consent to lay aside the pending amendment so that i may call up my amendment no. 29. [[page s271]] the presiding officer. is there objection? without objection, it is so ordered. the clerk will report. the assistant legislative clerk read as follows: the senator from rhode island [mr. whitehouse] proposes an amendment numbered 29 to amendment no. 2. on page 3, between lines 19 and 20, insert the following: sec. __. sense of the senate regarding climate change. it is the sense of the senate that climate change is real and not a hoax. mr. whitehouse. mr. president, i first wish to thank the distinguished chairman of the energy committee and her ranking member for allowing this process to go forward to the point where i am able to call up this amendment. it is a convention here when amendments are called up to ask unanimous consent that the reading be dispensed with, but in this amendment, the effective language is only eight words: ``climate change is real and not a hoax.'' so i went ahead and allowed the clerical staff to read the whole operative text of this amendment. this is an extremely simple amendment. we are here in this remarkable body in which so much history has taken place and in which so many great achievements have been fought through, many of them with powerful interests and strong arguments on opposite sides. and through that conflict, here in this body, we have been able to generate some of the great compromises and some of the great resolutions that have defined the course of the history of this country. so what a wonderful place this is to have the opportunity to serve. now, in this great deliberative body, called by many the greatest deliberative body, we have a great issue before us--perhaps as many say, the issue of our time--and that is what our carbon pollution--the excess carbon that we burn when we burn fossil fuels--is doing to our atmosphere and what it is doing to our oceans. there is no factual debate about what it is doing to our atmosphere and our oceans. it is crystal clear, and the consequences are crystal clear as well. if my colleagues don't believe me, fine, go ask the u.s. military. ask admiral locklear. ask the secretary of the navy. ask the joint chiefs of staff. if my colleagues don't want to believe in the military, ask our religious leaders. ask the u.s. conference of catholic bishops. if my colleagues only believe what corporations tell us, ask some of our biggest and most successful american corporations. ask walmart. ask coca-cola. ask nike, ask apple, ask google. go on through the corporate heraldry, and virtually every american corporation that is not actively involved in the fossil fuel industry will tell us this is a real and serious problem. and many of them are dedicating an enormous amount of internal effort to try to solve it within their corporate boundaries. again, walmart and coca-cola come right to the head of the list. of course, we don't have to ask our scientists any longer. they are pretty clear. they use words such as ``unequivocal'' and ``undeniable'' at every single scientific society that represents the major elements of the profession in this country. every single one has made this a priority. if people just want to go out to farmers, foresters, and fishermen, they are already seeing the changes around them. so here we are in this great deliberative body with this extraordinarily important issue that we have to face, and what do we see? silence, virtually dead silence, because one side of this body won't even discuss the question. many refuse to believe that climate change even exists, and for those who do, the political perils of using that phrase have now become so great that there is no serious conversation back and forth about climate change. in the first week we debated the keystone pipeline, which the environmental impact statement said will have a dramatic effect on climate change--the equivalent of 6 million added cars on our highways for 50 years, not to mention the petcoke and the byproducts, and just the carbon effect of it--no mention. the only time it was mentioned was when our distinguished energy committee chairman mentioned the testimony of a witness in her committee. she was good enough to make sure that climate change was raised in her committee, and she mentioned that there had been a witness who in turn mentioned climate change. but there was no direct mention in all of the debate that we heard in that week about climate change. it is the word that cannot be said. that is wrong. we cannot ignore this problem. it is too real for my fishermen in rhode island. it is to real for the people who are living near coasts and are seeing beaches they used to be able to play on eaten away. it is too real for the people whose homes have fallen into the sea. it is too real for us not to discuss it. now, it is not going to be easy, and we have to start somewhere. so this is a start. i am going to ask my colleagues to vote on such a simple question: is climate change real or is it a hoax? both points of view have been expressed in this body. where do we come down? let's actually find out if there are people on the republican side of the aisle who are willing to say climate change is real. my moose up in new hampshire, one could say, are suffering unprecedented infestations of ticks because there is no snow for them to fall off and die, and the moose are getting overwhelmed. we could say that in the university of oklahoma, the leading dean is an ipcc member and led the establishment of climate central. one could go to the carolina coasts and hear from the coastal agencies about sea level rise. one could go to arizona and hear about the desertification and the drought. we can go all over the place and find these things, and they are real. we have to have this conversation. it has to begin with as simple a proposition as this. then, i hope if we can build off this if we can find a few republican senators who will say publicly that climate change is real. we can then go on to if it is real, let's have a conversation about what we do about it, because recklessly continuing to dump megatons of carbon into the atmosphere every year is not a solution. and i don't want to be a part of a generation of which our kids and our grandchildren look back and ask: where were they? why could they not address this question? there they were in this great deliberative body. there they were with this great issue of our time. why would they not even discuss it? so i hope this amendment gets the conversation under way. it is one i look forward to. i think there are very sensible ways to solve this problem, including ways that have been supported by everyone from republican secretaries of the treasury to the lead economist for ronald reagan, the famous mr. laffer. there are ways we can make these adjustments. but we have to have the conversation, and i hope this begins it. with that, i yield the floor. again, i thank the distinguished chairman of the energy committee for her courtesy in allowing us to proceed. the presiding officer. the senator from alaska. ms. murkowski. mr. president, i thank my colleague. i think discussions we have had just in the past hour here since we have had the vote and the various amendments we now have pending before us--this is a good conversation. this is a good discussion and debate for us to be having as a body. we haven't had energy-related issues brought before this floor in some years now. we had a very limited debate on keystone back in december, but i am hopeful that with the opportunity for amendments--and again, not just some amendments we on our side have handpicked and then decided what the democrats might be able to move on their side--an opportunity for some real issues to be brought forward and to be debated on this floor. the senator from rhode island is very passionate on the issue of climate change. i think it is fair to say that he has singlehandedly raised the awareness not only in this body but for those loyal followers on c-span. when it comes to the issue of climate change, i think the senator comes up once a week with his charts and a series of speeches that i think is meant to educate colleagues. i don't agree with all of it. i think that is a fair statement to say. but what is equally fair is that there is a care and concern for not only our country and our country's environment--truly the public [[page s272]] safety of our people, a care for our land, the stewardship we have as americans--but it goes well beyond our borders to that of our entire globe, our entire planet, and how we care for planet earth and how we move forward responsibly. one aspect of the energy debate that i continue to advance is that we must ensure that if we are to make advances when it comes to caring for our environment and truly the whole issue of global climate, we have to be a nation that is economically secure in the sense that the technologies we will have to help us be cleaner in all that we do, do not come without cost. here in this country, we have been the leaders, we have been the innovators when it comes to clean-energy technologies, and we should challenge ourselves every day to do more in that regard, to build out, to push out that r&d so that we are making--whether it is making clean coal truly clean, whether it is advancing those clean energy technologies. i, for one, coming from a fossil fuel-producing state, am a huge proponent of nuclear-powered generation in this country because i believe very strongly that it is the cleanest energy source we have at this point in time. so what are we doing in this country to make sure our energy is abundant, affordable, clean, diverse, and secure? these are the challenges i put out to my colleagues. i clearly appreciate the need that we have in this body and in this country to be moving forward with technologies that allow us to have reduced emissions, to have a cleaner environment, but i also want to make sure we do so in a way that doesn't cripple our economy. so how we lead in this way, which i believe we must, while keeping our economy where it must be--in the front and moving forward all the time--is our great challenge. again, i look forward to the debate we will have. i am pleased we were able to process the amendments we had before us today. i look forward to advancing those that we have pending in front of us now and to good, continued, and robust discussion on this floor. i note the majority leader is here, and i yield the floor. the presiding officer. the majority leader. ____________________",103393

For more than 25 years, Judge Pro has sat on the district court. He was nominated by President Ronald Reagan, and he took office on July 23, 1987. From 2002 to 2007, he served as chief judge for the district court. Since being appointed to this distinguished position by President Reagan, his consistent leadership and responsiveness to the public and the court have not gone unnoticed. In October 1993, then U.S. Supreme Court Chief Justice William Rehnquist appointed Judge Pro as chair of the Committee on the Administration of the Magistrate Judges System of the Judicial Conference of the United States. In 2007, U.S. Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts appointed Judge Pro to the board of the Federal Judicial Center. Beyond his remarkable career at the district court, Judge Pro has had a tremendous impact on the entire legal community. He served for several years on the Study Committee to Review the Nevada Rules of Civil Procedure. He was actively involved in numerous international rule-of-law programs in countries such as Hungary, Spain, Norway, Malawi, and South Africa. Judge Pro was integral in the establishment of the William S. Boyd School of Law at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas. He served on the Law Advisory Committee for the law school and the advisory board of the school's Saltman Center for Conflict Resolution. In addition to his impressive work in the legal community, he has worked since 1987 to educate Nevada's youth about civic duties through his role with the We, the People . . . the Citizen and the Constitution Program. On a personal basis, I was chairman of the Nevada Gaming Commission during tumultuous times, when it was discovered mob influences infiltrated Nevada's gaming establishments; Phil was one of my attorneys. We have joked, since then, that he was able to beat, on behalf of the State of Nevada and its gaming authorities, the best lawyers that the adverse interest could buy. He was then an advocate of the law. Phil understood the law, for which I will always be grateful. I would also be negligent if I did not announce to everyone within the sound of my voice my envy for his great voice. He has a deep baritone speaking ability, which sets him apart from almost everyone else. I thank Phil Pro for his friendship. Through his years of professional and voluntary service, Judge Pro has become a fixture in the Nevada legal community. I congratulate him on his many successes and decades of dedicated public service. I wish him the best in all his future endeavors. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 9 (Tuesday, January 20, 2015)] [Senate] [Page S272] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] TRIBUTE TO PHILIP M.

Madam President, I wish today to honor Ryan Ringel, a member of my Senate staff who recently went to work for a fellow Member of the Senate. Ryan, who is from Rexburg, ID, has been an invaluable member of my Senate staff for the past 16 years. After attending Ricks College, now Brigham Young University-Idaho, Ryan graduated from Boise State University in 1998 with a bachelor of science degree in political science, international relations, and Spanish. With his strong support for BSU sports, particularly football, he will likely continue to cheer for his team from his new position, even though he is working for another State. Also in 1998 he joined my campaign as a staff assistant and then interned in my Boise office before moving to Washington, DC to become systems administrator in the Senate office as it opened in 1999. During his Senate tenure, Ryan met his wife, Noelle, and they have built a beautiful family that includes three sons, Zachary, Andrew and Michael. In addition to being an effective member of my staff, Ryan is a trusted friend. Ryan's high regard for the privilege of serving fellow Idahoans is evident. His know-how and sensible guidance have been instrumental and will be greatly missed. Countless times he has taken my calls at any hour and fixed whatever it was that was broken or in need of replacement. All the while, he brings a good humor to challenges and figures out ways to get things done right. It is no surprise that Ryan's knowledge and skill have been recognized by others, and I wish Ryan all the best in his future career path. Thankfully, he is not going far, and I will still get to see Ryan and Noelle in the halls of the Senate. Congratulations, Ryan, Noelle, Zachary, Andrew and Michael, on the start of a new chapter. Thank you, Ryan, for your outstanding service. I wish you all the very best life has to offer.

Madam President, I would like to take this opportunity to recognize my great friend and former colleague Sam Chapman, who is retiring on February 1, 2015, after a long and distinguished career in public service. I first had the opportunity to work with Sam when we were both county supervisors in northern California. When I was elected to the Marin County Board of Supervisors in 1976, Sam had already served 2 years on the neighboring Napa County Board of Supervisors after successfully defeating an incumbent. He was only 26 at the time, but he had been motivated to launch his underdog run after watching the incumbent fall asleep at a public meeting. Although he called his 1974 win ``the beginning of my career in politics,'' Sam had already shown a deep dedication to the ideals of public service. After receiving his law degree from the University of California at Berkeley's Boalt Hall School of Law, Sam joined Volunteers in Service to America, VISTA, a national public service program envisioned by President John F. Kennedy and implemented by President Lyndon Johnson to fight poverty in America. He worked with VISTA as a volunteer attorney in the field of poverty law and later became a staff attorney for the Napa County Legal Assistance Agency. He then opened his own general practice law office in Napa prior to running for supervisor. Sam and I have always shared so many values--he has always been a strong advocate for the environment and other progressive causes--and during the 6 years we served together, we worked to improve the lives of people throughout our North Bay communities. When I was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives in 1982, I knew right away that I wanted Sam on my team. For more than 20 years--as press secretary, legislative director, and finally as my chief of staff--Sam worked tirelessly every day to serve the people of the State of California. In 2004, seeking a new way to serve his community, Sam left the U.S. Senate to become the publisher of the Pacific Sun, a weekly newspaper focused on Marin County. He always had an interest in the news media, having worked as a reporter and editor for the Napa Valley Register prior to receiving his law degree. In 2010, following his lifelong interest in the environment and renewable energy issues, he became the State and Community Affairs Manager at Lawrence Berkeley National Lab, where he has worked to strengthen the lab's ties with the local and regional community. Throughout his career in public service, Sam also found the time to serve on a number of environmental commissions, lending his expertise to the Bay Conservation and Development Commission, Bay Area Air Quality Management District, and California Air Resources Board. For more than three decades, Sam has been a trusted ally, advisor, and friend. As he begins his retirement and embarks on the next exciting phase of his life, I send him and his family, especially his two beautiful daughters Allegra and Sabrina, my best wishes, deep affection, and abiding gratitude. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 9 (Tuesday, January 20, 2015)] [Senate] [Page S274] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS ______ TRIBUTE TO SAM CHAPMAN Mrs. BOXER.

Madam President, on July 6, 2015, the Johnson City Chamber of Commerce will celebrate its centennial. For 100 years the chamber has promoted business, enhanced economic and community development, and served as a catalyst for improving the overall quality of life for people in the Tri-Cities. In many cities across Tennessee, chamber of commerce members are the lifeblood of the community. They are our educators, our bankers, our doctors, our pharmacists, and more, and they share a common dedication to improving the quality of lives of their fellow citizens. As a former businessman, chamber member and mayor, I know firsthand that what we do here in Washington, including Federal regulations and tax policies, has a direct impact on businesses and communities across Tennessee. For far too long, Washington has put off addressing these issues as well as what I believe should be our top priority: getting our fiscal house in order. As I speak with Tennessee chamber of commerce groups, one thing is obvious. They are ready for Washington to govern responsibly and finally focus on growing our economy, repairing our fiscal house and strengthening our Nation's role in the world. Some of America's greatest achievements and longest-lasting solutions have occurred when one party controls Congress and another the White House. It will take hard work, but I am optimistic. If the President rolls up his sleeves and provides leadership and if Congress acts responsibly, I truly believe we can begin to solve some of the big issues members of the chamber care most about. I congratulate the Johnson City Chamber of Commerce on their centennial celebration. I appreciate their input on how we can strengthen our communities and unleash the entrepreneurial spirit of our local businesses. I thank them for making the Tri-Cities a great place to live and do business, and I look forward to working with them for years to come. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 9 (Tuesday, January 20, 2015)] [Senate] [Page S274] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] JOHNSON CITY CHAMBER OF COMMERCE CENTENNIAL Mr. CORKER.

CREC-2015-01-20-pt1-PgS274-3,CREC-2015-01-20,114,VERMONT ESSAY FINALISTS,"[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 9 (Tuesday, January 20, 2015)] [Senate] [Pages S274-S276] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] VERMONT ESSAY FINALISTS Mr. SANDERS. Madam President, I ask to have printed in the Record finalist essays written by Vermont High School students as part of the Fifth Annual ``What is the State of the Union'' Essay contest conducted by my office. These 20 finalists were selected from over 400 entries. The essays follow: Sam Anglum, Burr And Burton Academy (Finalist) We marched along for roughly 5 miles, part of which was right through Times Square. While holding up our signs and chanting what we wanted to see change in our government's priorities, I looked to my left and gazed at the skyline full of skyscrapers atop the canopy of Central Park. My class and I were marching alongside 400,000 New Yorkers, Americans, and globally aware citizens at the 2014 NYC Climate March. Climate change is a very serious issue that not many people are sensitive enough about. My hopes going into the march were to be a part of bringing global awareness to the massive shift in attitude I feel is going to save the Earth from its imminent doom. After participating in such a momentous event, I want my voice to echo further than the streets of Manhattan. I want the United States government to consider helping by promoting climate education in schools across the nation so that this kind of action becomes a part of the everyday agenda. As a high school student in Vermont, I urge my very own state senators including Governor Shumlin to consider spreading this type of education across the State of Vermont. I imagine the future generations as the key components to setting goals and battling for solutions to the problems that people are fighting against today. Not everyone will be an activist, or even care nearly as much as they should, but as long as more of the youth is aware of these pressing global issues, the amount of people that will create change will no doubt be multiplied. Our world's economic foundation is based on the over-extraction of fossil fuels, and because of this one in four carbon emissions comes from humans. I am aware that Vermont has a goal of making restrictions on fossil fuels and ultimately becoming 90 percent renewable by 2050. Every student in Vermont should be aware of this goal. I strongly urge the United States government to contribute to that further by promoting this kind of discussion within classrooms. New York City Councilman Donovan Richards, a man on the panel for 350.org, spoke to us the night before the march, and his words stuck with me. ``Rulership does not coincide with leadership.'' The streets of Manhattan were full of leaders on Sunday, September 21, and our desire was to influence our rulers. However, if our voice is transmitted to our ``rulers'' such as yourself, our governments can ``lead'' us into a more sustainable and renewable world. Caroline Arthaud, Champlain Valley Union High School (Finalist) Mr. Speaker, Mr. Vice President, members of Congress, and fellow Americans: Theodore Roosevelt once said, ``This country will not be a good place for any of us to live in unless we make it a good place for all of us to live in.'' At this time, it is my duty to lead this country towards such a place. I stand here today to address our successes, but also our deficits. Although Americans have many reasons to be proud of our accomplishments, it is unrealistic and inaccurate to declare ourselves flawless. We must muster the courage to confront the issues that hold us back. Although the unemployment rate has decreased from 9.7 percent in 2010 to 5.8 percent in November of 2014, there are still 9 million [[Page S275]] Americans without jobs. This is not acceptable. Beyond this, our precious environment is deteriorating. What many seem to struggle to understand is that the gradual warming of the earth is not an issue affecting only polar bears and penguins, but a growing danger to humans, as well. To begin to address issues of unemployment and environment, it is important that we, the American people, do our part to raise awareness and call for action. America needs to initiate large-scale production of renewable energy sources. This will help us in two ways: it will expand employment and create new jobs, and it will also transition this country from dependence on pollution-causing energy sources to cleaner solutions. We can sleep easier knowing that we have stopped engaging in a process sure to leave our children and grandchildren with a world too far gone to rehabilitate. Yet, another issue has escalated severely in recent years. It is one that has resulted in the violent deaths of 20 innocent six-year-olds in 2012, and that continues to take the lives of an average of 289 Americans daily. Many of us don't want to look at the problem of gun violence, but it has become something we can no longer ignore. We must formulate legislation that demands the renewal of gun permits on a regular basis, and work to improve the quality of mental health treatment. We must insist upon implementing stricter background checks on anyone wishing to bear weapons. Change is difficult. It's difficult on an individual basis, and vastly more difficult on a national one. However, I believe that the ability to change is a big part of what has made this nation so great. Americans are resilient and creative, and I believe that if we set our minds to it, we can improve the state of our union. I call upon you, all of you, to help continue the legacy of this remarkable country by working with me to better the lives of all Americans. Unemployment, environmental degradation, and gun violence are a lot to take on; however, we live in a country capable of anything. Thank you. God bless you, and God bless the United States of America. HAR WA BI, Winooski High School (Finalist) ``There is a lot that happens around the world we cannot control. We cannot stop earthquakes, we cannot prevent droughts, and we cannot prevent all conflict, but when we know where the hungry, the homeless and the sick exist, then we can help,'' says Jan Schakowsky, the U.S. Representative from Illinois. We can't help what nature creates, but being homeless is not nature. It is produced by humans and only humans can erase it. It is our nation's fault for letting people become homeless and live in poverty. We need to help the homeless and not let the poor become homeless. According to studentsagainsthunger.org in United States, each year more than 3.5 million people become homeless. They are forced to sleep in parks, under bridges, in shelters or cars. In fact, 35 percent of the homeless population are families with children, which is the fastest growing segment of the homeless population. And, 25 percent of the homeless population suffer from some form of mental illness. According to the feedingamerica.org, 45.3 percent of the people lived in poverty in 2013. This included 26.4 million people ages 18 to 64, 4.7 million children under the age of 18, and 4.2 million seniors 65 and older. I believe poverty happens in the United States because housing and hospital bills are too expensive. Lower-income workers cannot afford food and shelter. After we pay for housing, nothing is left for us. We don't have a higher income, we have food stamps which are low because the government cut it off, including for my family. And, my mom is the only one who works. According to homeaid.org, some part of the homelessness is caused by the loss of loved ones, job loss, domestic violence, divorce and family disputes. Other impairments such as depression, untreated mental illness, post-traumatic stress disorder, and physical disabilities are also responsible for a large portion of the homeless. I want government to help those people who need and try to stop it from happening, and to make our nation become better. I believe only government can decrease homelessness and help to increase the income, which all poor people need. We need to decrease the cost of hospitals or anything that costs a lot. Please help us poor and homeless because the government is our only hope. We will be waiting for the results of our government's actions. Peter Camardo, South Burlington High School (Finalist) A democracy is a government ruled by the people. In a democracy, the citizens hold the responsibility of making decisions. This is why United States of America has been successful throughout history. A democracy is the most productive way to run society when its citizens are engaged, but it loses its superiority when the population is plagued by ignorance. In my lifetime, Americans have been fortunate to live on our homeland without major threat to our national security. We have grown accustomed to lives of guaranteed safety. Unfortunately with this privilege, we have begun to feel entitled and to neglect our responsibility as American citizens. Issues of great concern are being ignored by the American population as if they mean nothing. Americans are sitting back and waiting for others to take action while grave matters are left undebated by the American public. I think back to President Kennedy's inaugural speech, and when he said the famous words, ``Ask not what your country can do for you--ask what you can do for your country.'' It is important that we American citizens remind ourselves of these words in everything we do, and to remember that our government is built upon the strong, independent voices that make up a democracy. I don't believe there is one significant issue concerning the United States that is more urgent than the rest. Each issue we face is vital for our nation to address appropriately. Regardless of which issue we undertake at which time, the first step to solving it is to become educated, and to stop ignoring problems just because they are not affecting us directly. All the members of a democracy must understand a conflict before it can be solved. In an age where people have infinite information at their fingertips, it can be easy to lose sight of important information. We must be educated before we can solve our issues of today. The responsibility to educate the public lies with the elected members of our government. It is important for our government to be straightforward and honest. It is important that when there are protests and movements the voices of the American people are heard and represented. Most importantly, the United States Congress should set an example for leadership and communication, and should inspire the people of the United States through proactive legislation and positive inter-party communication. We are the greatest nation on earth. We are far too experienced and wise to get caught up in a bipartisan conflict. When we get caught up in a battle with ourselves, it dejects us. The reason why the citizens of America have lost a sense of American pride is because our leaders seem to have lost a sense of purpose. The objective of our government is to, ``Establish justice, insure domestic tranquility, provide for the common defense, promote the general welfare, and secure the blessings of liberty to ourselves and our posterity,'' and the government should put aside their personal beliefs in an effort to make that happen. Taylor Devaney, Missisquoi Valley Union High School (Finalist) President Obama once said that, ``The nation cannot prosper long when it favors only the prosperous'', and as a young Vermonter, I agree with this statement. I am concerned with the state of our union due to the ever-growing, unequal wealth distribution. As the rich get richer, the poor get poorer, and in many situations wealth distribution gets ignored. The middle class population used to be the backbone of the nation, but every year it gets harder to make ends meet, as they slide lower down the economic class scale. America leads the world in the widest gap between the have and have nots, making the idea of America being the land of opportunity seem more of an unlikely dream. The most recent studies from the Federal Reserve show that a mere 3 percent of American families own 54 percent of the wealth in the United States. The unbalanced wealth distribution is dangerous for the nation as a whole. Economists Emmanuel Saez and Gabriel Zucman state that in their research that the wealth distribution has grown to the same levels as in the 1920's. The top 1 percent owns upwards of 40 percent of the wealth in the United States. As a nation, we have experienced the disastrous effects of an economic crash during the Great Depression, due to unbalanced wealth. We as a nation have failed to learn from our mistakes and are continuing down a dangerous path. The middle class is still at risk for being hurt the most, as they are left to clean up the mess of the high rollers. An unfair task when their wages remain stagnant, as the profits and wages soar for those at the top of the corrupted corporate ladder. The hard working American people do not deserve to struggle and something must be done. The mega-rich are not paying appropriate amount of taxes for their wealth, making the middle and lower class make up for the difference. Many of the people who control the tax rates are also the ones who make the most. Members of Congress are creating laws to benefit themselves. Big money and government fit together well, for politicians look for the wealthy to support them financially. We can no longer only provide for wealthy men and women who indirectly control our government. Creating a scaled taxation system will help balance the wealth in the nation. Making sure the wealthy are paying their fair share is key to balancing out our nation's prosperity. The U.S. can take note from the most famous, and down to Earth business from Vermont, Ben & Jerry's. This company had a system of a pay ratio between the highest paid employee and the lowest paid employee of 5 to 1 in its early years. These numbers are relatively small, but scaling them could make an impact on businesses today. Unequal wealth distribution benefits only a small portion of the country and will be the cause of a failed economy. Connor Drown, Winooski High School (Finalist) America. Home of the brave and land of the free. It is at its heart known as a free country, with opportunity just waiting for someone to snatch it up for themselves. It is a land where one desires the ``American [[Page S276]] Dream.'' Unfortunately, this is not remotely possible, and many citizens of the United States have difficulties living in this country. The United States of America is a great country to live in, if not the best, but is also far from perfect. Everything in America could be improved in one way or the other. Education and health care are huge government issues that need improvement in order to make the United States of America a more suitable place to live. Firstly, education in America is one of if not the most important factors to a successful career and life for US citizens. Getting a high school diploma is still very important, but it is now becoming more and more of a necessity to attend college and get a degree. According to usnews.com, the value of a college degree is greater than it has been in nearly half a century, at least when compared to the prospect of not getting a degree. Among millennials ages 25 to 32, median annual earnings for fulltime working college degree holders are $17,500 greater than for those with high school diplomas only. The only problem is that college has increasingly become less and less affordable. According to the College Board, the average cost of tuition and fees for the 2013-2014 academic year was $30,094 at private colleges, $8,893 for state residents at public colleges, and $22,203 for out-of-state residents attending public universities. Most Americans don't even consider public schools, which are most often referred to as the least expensive, affordable. According to the Huffington Post, 62 percent said they believe most people are not able to afford the cost of a public college education. If the majority of America could afford college to achieve their career goals, America will be a better and more successful country. If something such as raising taxes benefits colleges in that it will be more affordable, America will have more opportunity to strive for success. Health care is another issue that I feel should be mentioned. It is said that President Obama and the United States in general wants to make healthcare more affordable to everyone. Government run health care systems, such as Obamacare, are free and low-cost government run programs that result in higher costs and everyone receiving the same poor quality health care. Health care should remain privatized so that the people who may need better health care and can also afford it without a huge deductible may receive it. In conclusion, ensuring that health care remains the same and reducing the cost of education will undeniably improve America. Spencer Eckert, Woodstock Union High School (Finalist) Remember when you got your first job? I'm sure it was an exciting and proud moment. It could be that you weren't even concerned about your hourly pay, but as time went by, I'm certain that changed and you realized that you work hard and want to be compensated for that. In today's society, it can be hard to earn a good living wage from a ``decent'' job. But for many people, they don't get good pay even when they should. The low minimum wage today makes it difficult for people to survive and make a living. There are a number of compelling reasons to increase the minimum wage. Let's begin with the economy. It's simple; raising the minimum wage would have a positive effect on the economy by giving workers more money to spend. It would be good to raise the minimum wage to $15 because there would be more money being pumped into the economy. If workers get paid more, then they are happier and with a better mood they will want to spend more. It gives people the confidence to spend more and when they spend more they are fueling the economy. ``A raise for minimum wage earners will put more money in more families' pockets, which will be spent on goods and services, stimulating economic growth locally and nationally,'' according to the ``Minimum Wage Mythbusters.'' Increasing minimum wage has a positive impact on the working family. It helps them to make ends meet, and at the same time enables them to spend some money. When they spend money, they are fueling the economy. Raising the minimum wage would not cause any job loss or unemployment, and most work places would not go out of business if they were to raise the minimum wage. In fact there would probably be less turnover. Therefore, companies would reduce the amount of money they spend on training. If companies compensate their employees with better wages than those employees are happier and more committed to that company. So raising the minimum wage can have a positive effect on companies. ``Raising the minimum wage would be good for our economy. A higher minimum wage not only increases workers' incomes--which is sorely needed to boost demand and get the economy going--but it also reduces turnover, cuts the costs that low-paid employers impose on taxpayers, and pushes businesses toward a high-road, high-human-capital model.'' (Said T. William Lester, David Madland, and Jackie Odum, in their article Raising the Minimum Wage Would Help, Not Hurt, Our Economy) One reason why the minimum wage should be increased to $15 is because it would help a lot of people get out of the poverty level. Too many people in the country who work at minimum wage jobs currently depend on the government for other help. People subscribe to government programs such as food stamps and school breakfast and lunch programs, just to name a few. ``According to a Michigan survey shows that families who work at fast food businesses are much more likely to enroll in safety net programs than the workforce as a whole, such as food stamps.'' Another reason why the minimum wage should be increased to $15 is because of the positive psychological benefits. It would raise people's self-esteem and self-worth and would also allow children in these poverty-level homes to have better opportunities in the future. If these children are able to improve their performance in school, then they are likely to continue education which would allow them to pursue better paying jobs in the future. If they have better paying jobs, they are no longer on government programs and they have the opportunity and confidence to spend money which fuel the economy. It is a positive cycle. ``A raise in the minimum wage would not only help many families escape or avoid poverty, but could also significantly boost their children's academic performance and future adult earnings,'' said Yannet M. Lathrop, a Policy Analyst who has conducted studies on raising the minimum wage. There really is no downside to raising the minimum wage. Raising the minimum wage to $15 would be good for employers, workers, families, and the economy. Raising the minimum wage would lead to these dramatic outcomes: getting families out of poverty, giving children a better education and future, giving employers committed workers, putting more money into the economy, giving people the confidence to spend more and making people happy. Jacob Gallow, Missisquoi Valley Union High School (Finalist) Jean-Jacques Rousseau stated, ``A man is born free, but everywhere we are in chains.'' Freedom is something everyone seeks, but most will never experience it. Given more power, the government becomes a wolf among sheep. People flock to the sight of freedom, only to see that even something so great has its limits. Governments tend to give more things to the people, things to give them a sense of security, a place to sleep, somewhere to work, to do as they wish. Those things come at a price, the price of freedom. The more the people receive, especially on the topic of security, the more liberties are contracted. Are we truly free? America sits in the shadow of threats every day, for there will always be some person who despises the place we call home. Security is something we, as Americans, take for granted. While we sit in the shadows, not even aware of it, brave men and women risk their lives and die every day for the security of their homeland, wishing for a safe place for their friends and family to live. Yet, here we sit in the symbolic country of freedom, with someone always looking over our shoulder. That security we take for granted tends to take away the liberties and freedoms we were given many years ago. The more of a grip the government has on its people, the more the people are caged. Our troops are out fighting for our government, and our government's wishes, but have we ever stopped to think of what our own troops went through? According to Veteran's Inc., around 529,000 and 840,000 veterans are homeless each year, one in ten veterans are disabled related to war injuries. According to CNN, 22 veterans take their own lives each and every day, some resulting from PTSD, a disorder soldiers get after experiencing the horrors of war. Veteran unemployment rate is another issue among all of these. What can we, as Americans, do to help our Veterans. We surely are not doing enough, and those numbers keep climbing. What about those families of soldiers, what do they have to go through each and every day with a spouse, parent, or sibling off at war, fighting people because our governments wants to be ``involved.'' We don't need to be caught in everyone else's business, unless it becomes our business, and if we do get involved, we need to back up our soldiers first. Our country had to solve our own problems in 1861-1865, let others do the same. Freedom isn't really free. Here in America, we are promised freedom, but the securities we receive and the democracy we spread binds us in chains, not allowing us to roam free. Sure there needs to be laws enforced, yes there needs to be security, but we need freedom too. Our government needs to focus on our country. Will we as Americans allow the anaconda, known as the government, to strangle us, the people, as mice? ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 9 (Tuesday, January 20, 2015)] [Senate] [Pages S274-S276] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] VERMONT ESSAY FINALISTS Mr. SANDERS.

All the members of a democracy must understand a conflict before it can be solved. In an age where people have infinite information at their fingertips, it can be easy to lose sight of important information. We must be educated before we can solve our issues of today. The responsibility to educate the public lies with the elected members of our government. It is important for our government to be straightforward and honest. It is important that when there are protests and movements the voices of the American people are heard and represented. Most importantly, the United States Congress should set an example for leadership and communication, and should inspire the people of the United States through proactive legislation and positive inter-party communication. We are the greatest nation on earth. We are far too experienced and wise to get caught up in a bipartisan conflict. When we get caught up in a battle with ourselves, it dejects us. The reason why the citizens of America have lost a sense of American pride is because our leaders seem to have lost a sense of purpose. The objective of our government is to, ``Establish justice, insure domestic tranquility, provide for the common defense, promote the general welfare, and secure the blessings of liberty to ourselves and our posterity,'' and the government should put aside their personal beliefs in an effort to make that happen. Taylor Devaney, Missisquoi Valley Union High School (Finalist) President Obama once said that, ``The nation cannot prosper long when it favors only the prosperous'', and as a young Vermonter, I agree with this statement. I am concerned with the state of our union due to the ever-growing, unequal wealth distribution. As the rich get richer, the poor get poorer, and in many situations wealth distribution gets ignored. The middle class population used to be the backbone of the nation, but every year it gets harder to make ends meet, as they slide lower down the economic class scale. America leads the world in the widest gap between the have and have nots, making the idea of America being the land of opportunity seem more of an unlikely dream. The most recent studies from the Federal Reserve show that a mere 3 percent of American families own 54 percent of the wealth in the United States. The unbalanced wealth distribution is dangerous for the nation as a whole. Economists Emmanuel Saez and Gabriel Zucman state that in their research that the wealth distribution has grown to the same levels as in the 1920's. The top 1 percent owns upwards of 40 percent of the wealth in the United States. As a nation, we have experienced the disastrous effects of an economic crash during the Great Depression, due to unbalanced wealth. We as a nation have failed to learn from our mistakes and are continuing down a dangerous path. The middle class is still at risk for being hurt the most, as they are left to clean up the mess of the high rollers. An unfair task when their wages remain stagnant, as the profits and wages soar for those at the top of the corrupted corporate ladder. The hard working American people do not deserve to struggle and something must be done. The mega-rich are not paying appropriate amount of taxes for their wealth, making the middle and lower class make up for the difference. Many of the people who control the tax rates are also the ones who make the most. Members of Congress are creating laws to benefit themselves. Big money and government fit together well, for politicians look for the wealthy to support them financially. We can no longer only provide for wealthy men and women who indirectly control our government. Creating a scaled taxation system will help balance the wealth in the nation. Making sure the wealthy are paying their fair share is key to balancing out our nation's prosperity. The U.S. can take note from the most famous, and down to Earth business from Vermont, Ben & Jerry's. This company had a system of a pay ratio between the highest paid employee and the lowest paid employee of 5 to 1 in its early years. These numbers are relatively small, but scaling them could make an impact on businesses today. Unequal wealth distribution benefits only a small portion of the country and will be the cause of a failed economy. Connor Drown, Winooski High School (Finalist) America. Home of the brave and land of the free. It is at its heart known as a free country, with opportunity just waiting for someone to snatch it up for themselves. It is a land where one desires the ``American [[Page S276]] Dream.'' Unfortunately, this is not remotely possible, and many citizens of the United States have difficulties living in this country. The United States of America is a great country to live in, if not the best, but is also far from perfect. Everything in America could be improved in one way or the other. Education and health care are huge government issues that need improvement in order to make the United States of America a more suitable place to live. Firstly, education in America is one of if not the most important factors to a successful career and life for US citizens. Getting a high school diploma is still very important, but it is now becoming more and more of a necessity to attend college and get a degree. According to usnews.com, the value of a college degree is greater than it has been in nearly half a century, at least when compared to the prospect of not getting a degree. Among millennials ages 25 to 32, median annual earnings for fulltime working college degree holders are $17,500 greater than for those with high school diplomas only. The only problem is that college has increasingly become less and less affordable. According to the College Board, the average cost of tuition and fees for the 2013-2014 academic year was $30,094 at private colleges, $8,893 for state residents at public colleges, and $22,203 for out-of-state residents attending public universities. Most Americans don't even consider public schools, which are most often referred to as the least expensive, affordable. According to the Huffington Post, 62 percent said they believe most people are not able to afford the cost of a public college education. If the majority of America could afford college to achieve their career goals, America will be a better and more successful country. If something such as raising taxes benefits colleges in that it will be more affordable, America will have more opportunity to strive for success. Health care is another issue that I feel should be mentioned. It is said that President Obama and the United States in general wants to make healthcare more affordable to everyone. Government run health care systems, such as Obamacare, are free and low-cost government run programs that result in higher costs and everyone receiving the same poor quality health care. Health care should remain privatized so that the people who may need better health care and can also afford it without a huge deductible may receive it. In conclusion, ensuring that health care remains the same and reducing the cost of education will undeniably improve America. Spencer Eckert, Woodstock Union High School (Finalist) Remember when you got your first job? I'm sure it was an exciting and proud moment. It could be that you weren't even concerned about your hourly pay, but as time went by, I'm certain that changed and you realized that you work hard and want to be compensated for that. In today's society, it can be hard to earn a good living wage from a ``decent'' job. But for many people, they don't get good pay even when they should. The low minimum wage today makes it difficult for people to survive and make a living. There are a number of compelling reasons to increase the minimum wage. Let's begin with the economy. It's simple; raising the minimum wage would have a positive effect on the economy by giving workers more money to spend. It would be good to raise the minimum wage to $15 because there would be more money being pumped into the economy. If workers get paid more, then they are happier and with a better mood they will want to spend more. It gives people the confidence to spend more and when they spend more they are fueling the economy. ``A raise for minimum wage earners will put more money in more families' pockets, which will be spent on goods and services, stimulating economic growth locally and nationally,'' according to the ``Minimum Wage Mythbusters.'' Increasing minimum wage has a positive impact on the working family. It helps them to make ends meet, and at the same time enables them to spend some money. When they spend money, they are fueling the economy. Raising the minimum wage would not cause any job loss or unemployment, and most work places would not go out of business if they were to raise the minimum wage. In fact there would probably be less turnover. Therefore, companies would reduce the amount of money they spend on training. If companies compensate their employees with better wages than those employees are happier and more committed to that company. So raising the minimum wage can have a positive effect on companies. ``Raising the minimum wage would be good for our economy. A higher minimum wage not only increases workers' incomes--which is sorely needed to boost demand and get the economy going--but it also reduces turnover, cuts the costs that low-paid employers impose on taxpayers, and pushes businesses toward a high-road, high-human-capital model.'' (Said T. William Lester, David Madland, and Jackie Odum, in their article Raising the Minimum Wage Would Help, Not Hurt, Our Economy) One reason why the minimum wage should be increased to $15 is because it would help a lot of people get out of the poverty level. Too many people in the country who work at minimum wage jobs currently depend on the government for other help. People subscribe to government programs such as food stamps and school breakfast and lunch programs, just to name a few. ``According to a Michigan survey shows that families who work at fast food businesses are much more likely to enroll in safety net programs than the workforce as a whole, such as food stamps.'' Another reason why the minimum wage should be increased to $15 is because of the positive psychological benefits. It would raise people's self-esteem and self-worth and would also allow children in these poverty-level homes to have better opportunities in the future. If these children are able to improve their performance in school, then they are likely to continue education which would allow them to pursue better paying jobs in the future. If they have better paying jobs, they are no longer on government programs and they have the opportunity and confidence to spend money which fuel the economy. It is a positive cycle. ``A raise in the minimum wage would not only help many families escape or avoid poverty, but could also significantly boost their children's academic performance and future adult earnings,'' said Yannet M. Lathrop, a Policy Analyst who has conducted studies on raising the minimum wage. There really is no downside to raising the minimum wage. Raising the minimum wage to $15 would be good for employers, workers, families, and the economy. Raising the minimum wage would lead to these dramatic outcomes: getting families out of poverty, giving children a better education and future, giving employers committed workers, putting more money into the economy, giving people the confidence to spend more and making people happy. Jacob Gallow, Missisquoi Valley Union High School (Finalist) Jean-Jacques Rousseau stated, ``A man is born free, but everywhere we are in chains.'' Freedom is something everyone seeks, but most will never experience it. Given more power, the government becomes a wolf among sheep. People flock to the sight of freedom, only to see that even something so great has its limits. Governments tend to give more things to the people, things to give them a sense of security, a place to sleep, somewhere to work, to do as they wish. Those things come at a price, the price of freedom. The more the people receive, especially on the topic of security, the more liberties are contracted. Are we truly free? America sits in the shadow of threats every day, for there will always be some person who despises the place we call home. Security is something we, as Americans, take for granted. While we sit in the shadows, not even aware of it, brave men and women risk their lives and die every day for the security of their homeland, wishing for a safe place for their friends and family to live. Yet, here we sit in the symbolic country of freedom, with someone always looking over our shoulder. That security we take for granted tends to take away the liberties and freedoms we were given many years ago. The more of a grip the government has on its people, the more the people are caged. Our troops are out fighting for our government, and our government's wishes, but have we ever stopped to think of what our own troops went through? According to Veteran's Inc., around 529,000 and 840,000 veterans are homeless each year, one in ten veterans are disabled related to war injuries. According to CNN, 22 veterans take their own lives each and every day, some resulting from PTSD, a disorder soldiers get after experiencing the horrors of war. Veteran unemployment rate is another issue among all of these. What can we, as Americans, do to help our Veterans. We surely are not doing enough, and those numbers keep climbing. What about those families of soldiers, what do they have to go through each and every day with a spouse, parent, or sibling off at war, fighting people because our governments wants to be ``involved.'' We don't need to be caught in everyone else's business, unless it becomes our business, and if we do get involved, we need to back up our soldiers first. Our country had to solve our own problems in 1861-1865, let others do the same. Freedom isn't really free. Here in America, we are promised freedom, but the securities we receive and the democracy we spread binds us in chains, not allowing us to roam free. Sure there needs to be laws enforced, yes there needs to be security, but we need freedom too. Our government needs to focus on our country. Will we as Americans allow the anaconda, known as the government, to strangle us, the people, as mice? ____________________","Congressional Record, Volume 161 Issue 9 (Tuesday, January 20, 2015) [Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 9 (Tuesday, January 20, 2015)] [Senate] [Pages S274-S276] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] VERMONT ESSAY FINALISTS Mr. SANDERS. Madam President, I ask to have printed in the Record finalist essays written by Vermont High School students as part of the Fifth Annual ``What is the State of the Union'' Essay contest conducted by my office. These 20 finalists were selected from over 400 entries. The essays follow: Sam Anglum, Burr And Burton Academy (Finalist) We marched along for roughly 5 miles, part of which was right through Times Square. While holding up our signs and chanting what we wanted to see change in our government's priorities, I looked to my left and gazed at the skyline full of skyscrapers atop the canopy of Central Park. My class and I were marching alongside 400,000 New Yorkers, Americans, and globally aware citizens at the 2014 NYC Climate March. Climate change is a very serious issue that not many people are sensitive enough about. My hopes going into the march were to be a part of bringing global awareness to the massive shift in attitude I feel is going to save the Earth from its imminent doom. After participating in such a momentous event, I want my voice to echo further than the streets of Manhattan. I want the United States government to consider helping by promoting climate education in schools across the nation so that this kind of action becomes a part of the everyday agenda. As a high school student in Vermont, I urge my very own state senators including Governor Shumlin to consider spreading this type of education across the State of Vermont. I imagine the future generations as the key components to setting goals and battling for solutions to the problems that people are fighting against today. Not everyone will be an activist, or even care nearly as much as they should, but as long as more of the youth is aware of these pressing global issues, the amount of people that will create change will no doubt be multiplied. Our world's economic foundation is based on the over-extraction of fossil fuels, and because of this one in four carbon emissions comes from humans. I am aware that Vermont has a goal of making restrictions on fossil fuels and ultimately becoming 90 percent renewable by 2050. Every student in Vermont should be aware of this goal. I strongly urge the United States government to contribute to that further by promoting this kind of discussion within classrooms. New York City Councilman Donovan Richards, a man on the panel for 350.org, spoke to us the night before the march, and his words stuck with me. ``Rulership does not coincide with leadership.'' The streets of Manhattan were full of leaders on Sunday, September 21, and our desire was to influence our rulers. However, if our voice is transmitted to our ``rulers'' such as yourself, our governments can ``lead'' us into a more sustainable and renewable world. Caroline Arthaud, Champlain Valley Union High School (Finalist) Mr. Speaker, Mr. Vice President, members of Congress, and fellow Americans: Theodore Roosevelt once said, ``This country will not be a good place for any of us to live in unless we make it a good place for all of us to live in.'' At this time, it is my duty to lead this country towards such a place. I stand here today to address our successes, but also our deficits. Although Americans have many reasons to be proud of our accomplishments, it is unrealistic and inaccurate to declare ourselves flawless. We must muster the courage to confront the issues that hold us back. Although the unemployment rate has decreased from 9.7 percent in 2010 to 5.8 percent in November of 2014, there are still 9 million [[Page S275]] Americans without jobs. This is not acceptable. Beyond this, our precious environment is deteriorating. What many seem to struggle to understand is that the gradual warming of the earth is not an issue affecting only polar bears and penguins, but a growing danger to humans, as well. To begin to address issues of unemployment and environment, it is important that we, the American people, do our part to raise awareness and call for action. America needs to initiate large-scale production of renewable energy sources. This will help us in two ways: it will expand employment and create new jobs, and it will also transition this country from dependence on pollution-causing energy sources to cleaner solutions. We can sleep easier knowing that we have stopped engaging in a process sure to leave our children and grandchildren with a world too far gone to rehabilitate. Yet, another issue has escalated severely in recent years. It is one that has resulted in the violent deaths of 20 innocent six-year-olds in 2012, and that continues to take the lives of an average of 289 Americans daily. Many of us don't want to look at the problem of gun violence, but it has become something we can no longer ignore. We must formulate legislation that demands the renewal of gun permits on a regular basis, and work to improve the quality of mental health treatment. We must insist upon implementing stricter background checks on anyone wishing to bear weapons. Change is difficult. It's difficult on an individual basis, and vastly more difficult on a national one. However, I believe that the ability to change is a big part of what has made this nation so great. Americans are resilient and creative, and I believe that if we set our minds to it, we can improve the state of our union. I call upon you, all of you, to help continue the legacy of this remarkable country by working with me to better the lives of all Americans. Unemployment, environmental degradation, and gun violence are a lot to take on; however, we live in a country capable of anything. Thank you. God bless you, and God bless the United States of America. HAR WA BI, Winooski High School (Finalist) ``There is a lot that happens around the world we cannot control. We cannot stop earthquakes, we cannot prevent droughts, and we cannot prevent all conflict, but when we know where the hungry, the homeless and the sick exist, then we can help,'' says Jan Schakowsky, the U.S. Representative from Illinois. We can't help what nature creates, but being homeless is not nature. It is produced by humans and only humans can erase it. It is our nation's fault for letting people become homeless and live in poverty. We need to help the homeless and not let the poor become homeless. According to studentsagainsthunger.org in United States, each year more than 3.5 million people become homeless. They are forced to sleep in parks, under bridges, in shelters or cars. In fact, 35 percent of the homeless population are families with children, which is the fastest growing segment of the homeless population. And, 25 percent of the homeless population suffer from some form of mental illness. According to the feedingamerica.org, 45.3 percent of the people lived in poverty in 2013. This included 26.4 million people ages 18 to 64, 4.7 million children under the age of 18, and 4.2 million seniors 65 and older. I believe poverty happens in the United States because housing and hospital bills are too expensive. Lower-income workers cannot afford food and shelter. After we pay for housing, nothing is left for us. We don't have a higher income, we have food stamps which are low because the government cut it off, including for my family. And, my mom is the only one who works. According to homeaid.org, some part of the homelessness is caused by the loss of loved ones, job loss, domestic violence, divorce and family disputes. Other impairments such as depression, untreated mental illness, post-traumatic stress disorder, and physical disabilities are also responsible for a large portion of the homeless. I want government to help those people who need and try to stop it from happening, and to make our nation become better. I believe only government can decrease homelessness and help to increase the income, which all poor people need. We need to decrease the cost of hospitals or anything that costs a lot. Please help us poor and homeless because the government is our only hope. We will be waiting for the results of our government's actions. Peter Camardo, South Burlington High School (Finalist) A democracy is a government ruled by the people. In a democracy, the citizens hold the responsibility of making decisions. This is why United States of America has been successful throughout history. A democracy is the most productive way to run society when its citizens are engaged, but it loses its superiority when the population is plagued by ignorance. In my lifetime, Americans have been fortunate to live on our homeland without major threat to our national security. We have grown accustomed to lives of guaranteed safety. Unfortunately with this privilege, we have begun to feel entitled and to neglect our responsibility as American citizens. Issues of great concern are being ignored by the American population as if they mean nothing. Americans are sitting back and waiting for others to take action while grave matters are left undebated by the American public. I think back to President Kennedy's inaugural speech, and when he said the famous words, ``Ask not what your country can do for you--ask what you can do for your country.'' It is important that we American citizens remind ourselves of these words in everything we do, and to remember that our government is built upon the strong, independent voices that make up a democracy. I don't believe there is one significant issue concerning the United States that is more urgent than the rest. Each issue we face is vital for our nation to address appropriately. Regardless of which issue we undertake at which time, the first step to solving it is to become educated, and to stop ignoring problems just because they are not affecting us directly.

Yet, here we sit in the symbolic country of freedom, with someone always looking over our shoulder. That security we take for granted tends to take away the liberties and freedoms we were given many years ago. The more of a grip the government has on its people, the more the people are caged. Our troops are out fighting for our government, and our government's wishes, but have we ever stopped to think of what our own troops went through? According to Veteran's Inc., around 529,000 and 840,000 veterans are homeless each year, one in ten veterans are disabled related to war injuries. According to CNN, 22 veterans take their own lives each and every day, some resulting from PTSD, a disorder soldiers get after experiencing the horrors of war. Veteran unemployment rate is another issue among all of these. What can we, as Americans, do to help our Veterans. We surely are not doing enough, and those numbers keep climbing. What about those families of soldiers, what do they have to go through each and every day with a spouse, parent, or sibling off at war, fighting people because our governments wants to be ``involved.'' We don't need to be caught in everyone else's business, unless it becomes our business, and if we do get involved, we need to back up our soldiers first. Our country had to solve our own problems in 1861-1865, let others do the same. Freedom isn't really free. Here in America, we are promised freedom, but the securities we receive and the democracy we spread binds us in chains, not allowing us to roam free. Sure there needs to be laws enforced, yes there needs to be security, but we need freedom too. Our government needs to focus on our country. Will we as Americans allow the anaconda, known as the government, to strangle us, the people, as mice? ____________________",package_114_126.csv,24408,24408,24477,"[congressional record volume 161, number 9 (tuesday, january 20, 2015)] [senate] [pages s274-s276] from the congressional record online through the government publishing office [ www.gpo.gov ] vermont essay finalists mr. sanders. madam president, i ask to have printed in the record finalist essays written by vermont high school students as part of the fifth annual ``what is the state of the union'' essay contest conducted by my office. these 20 finalists were selected from over 400 entries. the essays follow: sam anglum, burr and burton academy (finalist) we marched along for roughly 5 miles, part of which was right through times square. while holding up our signs and chanting what we wanted to see change in our government's priorities, i looked to my left and gazed at the skyline full of skyscrapers atop the canopy of central park. my class and i were marching alongside 400,000 new yorkers, americans, and globally aware citizens at the 2014 nyc climate march. climate change is a very serious issue that not many people are sensitive enough about. my hopes going into the march were to be a part of bringing global awareness to the massive shift in attitude i feel is going to save the earth from its imminent doom. after participating in such a momentous event, i want my voice to echo further than the streets of manhattan. i want the united states government to consider helping by promoting climate education in schools across the nation so that this kind of action becomes a part of the everyday agenda. as a high school student in vermont, i urge my very own state senators including governor shumlin to consider spreading this type of education across the state of vermont. i imagine the future generations as the key components to setting goals and battling for solutions to the problems that people are fighting against today. not everyone will be an activist, or even care nearly as much as they should, but as long as more of the youth is aware of these pressing global issues, the amount of people that will create change will no doubt be multiplied. our world's economic foundation is based on the over-extraction of fossil fuels, and because of this one in four carbon emissions comes from humans. i am aware that vermont has a goal of making restrictions on fossil fuels and ultimately becoming 90 percent renewable by 2050. every student in vermont should be aware of this goal. i strongly urge the united states government to contribute to that further by promoting this kind of discussion within classrooms. new york city councilman donovan richards, a man on the panel for 350.org, spoke to us the night before the march, and his words stuck with me. ``rulership does not coincide with leadership.'' the streets of manhattan were full of leaders on sunday, september 21, and our desire was to influence our rulers. however, if our voice is transmitted to our ``rulers'' such as yourself, our governments can ``lead'' us into a more sustainable and renewable world. caroline arthaud, champlain valley union high school (finalist) mr. speaker, mr. vice president, members of congress, and fellow americans: theodore roosevelt once said, ``this country will not be a good place for any of us to live in unless we make it a good place for all of us to live in.'' at this time, it is my duty to lead this country towards such a place. i stand here today to address our successes, but also our deficits. although americans have many reasons to be proud of our accomplishments, it is unrealistic and inaccurate to declare ourselves flawless. we must muster the courage to confront the issues that hold us back. although the unemployment rate has decreased from 9.7 percent in 2010 to 5.8 percent in november of 2014, there are still 9 million [[page s275]] americans without jobs. this is not acceptable. beyond this, our precious environment is deteriorating. what many seem to struggle to understand is that the gradual warming of the earth is not an issue affecting only polar bears and penguins, but a growing danger to humans, as well. to begin to address issues of unemployment and environment, it is important that we, the american people, do our part to raise awareness and call for action. america needs to initiate large-scale production of renewable energy sources. this will help us in two ways: it will expand employment and create new jobs, and it will also transition this country from dependence on pollution-causing energy sources to cleaner solutions. we can sleep easier knowing that we have stopped engaging in a process sure to leave our children and grandchildren with a world too far gone to rehabilitate. yet, another issue has escalated severely in recent years. it is one that has resulted in the violent deaths of 20 innocent six-year-olds in 2012, and that continues to take the lives of an average of 289 americans daily. many of us don't want to look at the problem of gun violence, but it has become something we can no longer ignore. we must formulate legislation that demands the renewal of gun permits on a regular basis, and work to improve the quality of mental health treatment. we must insist upon implementing stricter background checks on anyone wishing to bear weapons. change is difficult. it's difficult on an individual basis, and vastly more difficult on a national one. however, i believe that the ability to change is a big part of what has made this nation so great. americans are resilient and creative, and i believe that if we set our minds to it, we can improve the state of our union. i call upon you, all of you, to help continue the legacy of this remarkable country by working with me to better the lives of all americans. unemployment, environmental degradation, and gun violence are a lot to take on; however, we live in a country capable of anything. thank you. god bless you, and god bless the united states of america. har wa bi, winooski high school (finalist) ``there is a lot that happens around the world we cannot control. we cannot stop earthquakes, we cannot prevent droughts, and we cannot prevent all conflict, but when we know where the hungry, the homeless and the sick exist, then we can help,'' says jan schakowsky, the u.s. representative from illinois. we can't help what nature creates, but being homeless is not nature. it is produced by humans and only humans can erase it. it is our nation's fault for letting people become homeless and live in poverty. we need to help the homeless and not let the poor become homeless. according to studentsagainsthunger.org in united states, each year more than 3.5 million people become homeless. they are forced to sleep in parks, under bridges, in shelters or cars. in fact, 35 percent of the homeless population are families with children, which is the fastest growing segment of the homeless population. and, 25 percent of the homeless population suffer from some form of mental illness. according to the feedingamerica.org, 45.3 percent of the people lived in poverty in 2013. this included 26.4 million people ages 18 to 64, 4.7 million children under the age of 18, and 4.2 million seniors 65 and older. i believe poverty happens in the united states because housing and hospital bills are too expensive. lower-income workers cannot afford food and shelter. after we pay for housing, nothing is left for us. we don't have a higher income, we have food stamps which are low because the government cut it off, including for my family. and, my mom is the only one who works. according to homeaid.org, some part of the homelessness is caused by the loss of loved ones, job loss, domestic violence, divorce and family disputes. other impairments such as depression, untreated mental illness, post-traumatic stress disorder, and physical disabilities are also responsible for a large portion of the homeless. i want government to help those people who need and try to stop it from happening, and to make our nation become better. i believe only government can decrease homelessness and help to increase the income, which all poor people need. we need to decrease the cost of hospitals or anything that costs a lot. please help us poor and homeless because the government is our only hope. we will be waiting for the results of our government's actions. peter camardo, south burlington high school (finalist) a democracy is a government ruled by the people. in a democracy, the citizens hold the responsibility of making decisions. this is why united states of america has been successful throughout history. a democracy is the most productive way to run society when its citizens are engaged, but it loses its superiority when the population is plagued by ignorance. in my lifetime, americans have been fortunate to live on our homeland without major threat to our national security. we have grown accustomed to lives of guaranteed safety. unfortunately with this privilege, we have begun to feel entitled and to neglect our responsibility as american citizens. issues of great concern are being ignored by the american population as if they mean nothing. americans are sitting back and waiting for others to take action while grave matters are left undebated by the american public. i think back to president kennedy's inaugural speech, and when he said the famous words, ``ask not what your country can do for you--ask what you can do for your country.'' it is important that we american citizens remind ourselves of these words in everything we do, and to remember that our government is built upon the strong, independent voices that make up a democracy. i don't believe there is one significant issue concerning the united states that is more urgent than the rest. each issue we face is vital for our nation to address appropriately. regardless of which issue we undertake at which time, the first step to solving it is to become educated, and to stop ignoring problems just because they are not affecting us directly. all the members of a democracy must understand a conflict before it can be solved. in an age where people have infinite information at their fingertips, it can be easy to lose sight of important information. we must be educated before we can solve our issues of today. the responsibility to educate the public lies with the elected members of our government. it is important for our government to be straightforward and honest. it is important that when there are protests and movements the voices of the american people are heard and represented. most importantly, the united states congress should set an example for leadership and communication, and should inspire the people of the united states through proactive legislation and positive inter-party communication. we are the greatest nation on earth. we are far too experienced and wise to get caught up in a bipartisan conflict. when we get caught up in a battle with ourselves, it dejects us. the reason why the citizens of america have lost a sense of american pride is because our leaders seem to have lost a sense of purpose. the objective of our government is to, ``establish justice, insure domestic tranquility, provide for the common defense, promote the general welfare, and secure the blessings of liberty to ourselves and our posterity,'' and the government should put aside their personal beliefs in an effort to make that happen. taylor devaney, missisquoi valley union high school (finalist) president obama once said that, ``the nation cannot prosper long when it favors only the prosperous'', and as a young vermonter, i agree with this statement. i am concerned with the state of our union due to the ever-growing, unequal wealth distribution. as the rich get richer, the poor get poorer, and in many situations wealth distribution gets ignored. the middle class population used to be the backbone of the nation, but every year it gets harder to make ends meet, as they slide lower down the economic class scale. america leads the world in the widest gap between the have and have nots, making the idea of america being the land of opportunity seem more of an unlikely dream. the most recent studies from the federal reserve show that a mere 3 percent of american families own 54 percent of the wealth in the united states. the unbalanced wealth distribution is dangerous for the nation as a whole. economists emmanuel saez and gabriel zucman state that in their research that the wealth distribution has grown to the same levels as in the 1920's. the top 1 percent owns upwards of 40 percent of the wealth in the united states. as a nation, we have experienced the disastrous effects of an economic crash during the great depression, due to unbalanced wealth. we as a nation have failed to learn from our mistakes and are continuing down a dangerous path. the middle class is still at risk for being hurt the most, as they are left to clean up the mess of the high rollers. an unfair task when their wages remain stagnant, as the profits and wages soar for those at the top of the corrupted corporate ladder. the hard working american people do not deserve to struggle and something must be done. the mega-rich are not paying appropriate amount of taxes for their wealth, making the middle and lower class make up for the difference. many of the people who control the tax rates are also the ones who make the most. members of congress are creating laws to benefit themselves. big money and government fit together well, for politicians look for the wealthy to support them financially. we can no longer only provide for wealthy men and women who indirectly control our government. creating a scaled taxation system will help balance the wealth in the nation. making sure the wealthy are paying their fair share is key to balancing out our nation's prosperity. the u.s. can take note from the most famous, and down to earth business from vermont, ben & jerry's. this company had a system of a pay ratio between the highest paid employee and the lowest paid employee of 5 to 1 in its early years. these numbers are relatively small, but scaling them could make an impact on businesses today. unequal wealth distribution benefits only a small portion of the country and will be the cause of a failed economy. connor drown, winooski high school (finalist) america. home of the brave and land of the free. it is at its heart known as a free country, with opportunity just waiting for someone to snatch it up for themselves. it is a land where one desires the ``american [[page s276]] dream.'' unfortunately, this is not remotely possible, and many citizens of the united states have difficulties living in this country. the united states of america is a great country to live in, if not the best, but is also far from perfect. everything in america could be improved in one way or the other. education and health care are huge government issues that need improvement in order to make the united states of america a more suitable place to live. firstly, education in america is one of if not the most important factors to a successful career and life for us citizens. getting a high school diploma is still very important, but it is now becoming more and more of a necessity to attend college and get a degree. according to usnews.com, the value of a college degree is greater than it has been in nearly half a century, at least when compared to the prospect of not getting a degree. among millennials ages 25 to 32, median annual earnings for fulltime working college degree holders are $17,500 greater than for those with high school diplomas only. the only problem is that college has increasingly become less and less affordable. according to the college board, the average cost of tuition and fees for the 2013-2014 academic year was $30,094 at private colleges, $8,893 for state residents at public colleges, and $22,203 for out-of-state residents attending public universities. most americans don't even consider public schools, which are most often referred to as the least expensive, affordable. according to the huffington post, 62 percent said they believe most people are not able to afford the cost of a public college education. if the majority of america could afford college to achieve their career goals, america will be a better and more successful country. if something such as raising taxes benefits colleges in that it will be more affordable, america will have more opportunity to strive for success. health care is another issue that i feel should be mentioned. it is said that president obama and the united states in general wants to make healthcare more affordable to everyone. government run health care systems, such as obamacare, are free and low-cost government run programs that result in higher costs and everyone receiving the same poor quality health care. health care should remain privatized so that the people who may need better health care and can also afford it without a huge deductible may receive it. in conclusion, ensuring that health care remains the same and reducing the cost of education will undeniably improve america. spencer eckert, woodstock union high school (finalist) remember when you got your first job? i'm sure it was an exciting and proud moment. it could be that you weren't even concerned about your hourly pay, but as time went by, i'm certain that changed and you realized that you work hard and want to be compensated for that. in today's society, it can be hard to earn a good living wage from a ``decent'' job. but for many people, they don't get good pay even when they should. the low minimum wage today makes it difficult for people to survive and make a living. there are a number of compelling reasons to increase the minimum wage. let's begin with the economy. it's simple; raising the minimum wage would have a positive effect on the economy by giving workers more money to spend. it would be good to raise the minimum wage to $15 because there would be more money being pumped into the economy. if workers get paid more, then they are happier and with a better mood they will want to spend more. it gives people the confidence to spend more and when they spend more they are fueling the economy. ``a raise for minimum wage earners will put more money in more families' pockets, which will be spent on goods and services, stimulating economic growth locally and nationally,'' according to the ``minimum wage mythbusters.'' increasing minimum wage has a positive impact on the working family. it helps them to make ends meet, and at the same time enables them to spend some money. when they spend money, they are fueling the economy. raising the minimum wage would not cause any job loss or unemployment, and most work places would not go out of business if they were to raise the minimum wage. in fact there would probably be less turnover. therefore, companies would reduce the amount of money they spend on training. if companies compensate their employees with better wages than those employees are happier and more committed to that company. so raising the minimum wage can have a positive effect on companies. ``raising the minimum wage would be good for our economy. a higher minimum wage not only increases workers' incomes--which is sorely needed to boost demand and get the economy going--but it also reduces turnover, cuts the costs that low-paid employers impose on taxpayers, and pushes businesses toward a high-road, high-human-capital model.'' (said t. william lester, david madland, and jackie odum, in their article raising the minimum wage would help, not hurt, our economy) one reason why the minimum wage should be increased to $15 is because it would help a lot of people get out of the poverty level. too many people in the country who work at minimum wage jobs currently depend on the government for other help. people subscribe to government programs such as food stamps and school breakfast and lunch programs, just to name a few. ``according to a michigan survey shows that families who work at fast food businesses are much more likely to enroll in safety net programs than the workforce as a whole, such as food stamps.'' another reason why the minimum wage should be increased to $15 is because of the positive psychological benefits. it would raise people's self-esteem and self-worth and would also allow children in these poverty-level homes to have better opportunities in the future. if these children are able to improve their performance in school, then they are likely to continue education which would allow them to pursue better paying jobs in the future. if they have better paying jobs, they are no longer on government programs and they have the opportunity and confidence to spend money which fuel the economy. it is a positive cycle. ``a raise in the minimum wage would not only help many families escape or avoid poverty, but could also significantly boost their children's academic performance and future adult earnings,'' said yannet m. lathrop, a policy analyst who has conducted studies on raising the minimum wage. there really is no downside to raising the minimum wage. raising the minimum wage to $15 would be good for employers, workers, families, and the economy. raising the minimum wage would lead to these dramatic outcomes: getting families out of poverty, giving children a better education and future, giving employers committed workers, putting more money into the economy, giving people the confidence to spend more and making people happy. jacob gallow, missisquoi valley union high school (finalist) jean-jacques rousseau stated, ``a man is born free, but everywhere we are in chains.'' freedom is something everyone seeks, but most will never experience it. given more power, the government becomes a wolf among sheep. people flock to the sight of freedom, only to see that even something so great has its limits. governments tend to give more things to the people, things to give them a sense of security, a place to sleep, somewhere to work, to do as they wish. those things come at a price, the price of freedom. the more the people receive, especially on the topic of security, the more liberties are contracted. are we truly free? america sits in the shadow of threats every day, for there will always be some person who despises the place we call home. security is something we, as americans, take for granted. while we sit in the shadows, not even aware of it, brave men and women risk their lives and die every day for the security of their homeland, wishing for a safe place for their friends and family to live. yet, here we sit in the symbolic country of freedom, with someone always looking over our shoulder. that security we take for granted tends to take away the liberties and freedoms we were given many years ago. the more of a grip the government has on its people, the more the people are caged. our troops are out fighting for our government, and our government's wishes, but have we ever stopped to think of what our own troops went through? according to veteran's inc., around 529,000 and 840,000 veterans are homeless each year, one in ten veterans are disabled related to war injuries. according to cnn, 22 veterans take their own lives each and every day, some resulting from ptsd, a disorder soldiers get after experiencing the horrors of war. veteran unemployment rate is another issue among all of these. what can we, as americans, do to help our veterans. we surely are not doing enough, and those numbers keep climbing. what about those families of soldiers, what do they have to go through each and every day with a spouse, parent, or sibling off at war, fighting people because our governments wants to be ``involved.'' we don't need to be caught in everyone else's business, unless it becomes our business, and if we do get involved, we need to back up our soldiers first. our country had to solve our own problems in 1861-1865, let others do the same. freedom isn't really free. here in america, we are promised freedom, but the securities we receive and the democracy we spread binds us in chains, not allowing us to roam free. sure there needs to be laws enforced, yes there needs to be security, but we need freedom too. our government needs to focus on our country. will we as americans allow the anaconda, known as the government, to strangle us, the people, as mice? ____________________",24408

Mr. President, I wish to honor the University of Oregon's football team for its tremendous season. The Fighting Ducks of Oregon accumulated 13 wins with only 2 losses this year, which accounts for the most wins in team history. This season culminated with the Ducks winning their 11th Pac-12 Conference championship, playing in the first NCAA college football playoff, winning their third-ever Rose Bowl and reaching the National Championship game. It is truly a great year to be a Duck. Recognition should not only be given to this football team's success on the [[Page S277]] field but also to the hard work and effort demonstrated by players, coaches, and staff off the field. From volunteering at local afterschool programs to honoring our military, members of the Oregon Ducks football team have shown dedication and commitment to their school and their community. Special recognition should go to head coach Mark Helfrich--a native Oregonian--for leading this group of young men to success on and off the field. I am also proud to honor Oregon quarterback Marcus Mariota for winning the University of Oregon's first Heisman Trophy. Marcus is the first athlete of Polynesian descent to win this award, which makes him the pride of his home State of Hawaii. His acceptance speech during the Heisman Trophy presentation was truly moving. I am proud to watch him represent the University with such class. The Oregon Ducks have seen tremendous success throughout this 2014 season, scoring an average of 45.4 points per game, 90 total touchdowns, and amassing more than 3,000 total yards rushing. Marcus Mariota set a school record for single-season passing yards--more than 4,400 yards in 15 games--and, following completion of the regular season, two members of the Oregon football team were honored as first- team All-Americans by the Associated Press. It has been a remarkable season all around, and I look forward to more years watching Coach Helfrich encourage his players to win the day.

CREC-2015-01-20-pt1-PgS277,CREC-2015-01-20,114,"REPORT ON THE STATE OF THE UNION DELIVERED TO A JOINT SESSION OF CONGRESS ON JANUARY 20, 2015--PM 1","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 9 (Tuesday, January 20, 2015)] [Senate] [Pages S277-S281] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] REPORT ON THE STATE OF THE UNION DELIVERED TO A JOINT SESSION OF CONGRESS ON JANUARY 20, 2015--PM 1 The PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate the following message from the President of the United States which was ordered to lie on the table: To the Congress of the United States: Mr. Speaker, Mr. Vice President, Members of Congress, my fellow Americans: We are 15 years into this new century. Fifteen years that dawned with terror touching our shores; that unfolded with a new generation fighting two long and costly wars; that saw a vicious recession spread across our Nation and the world. It has been, and still is, a hard time for many. But tonight, we turn the page. Tonight, after a breakthrough year for America, our economy is growing and creating jobs at the fastest pace since 1999. Our unemployment rate is now lower than it was before the financial crisis. More of our kids are graduating than ever before; more of our people are insured than ever before; we are as free from the grip of foreign oil as we've been in almost 30 years. Tonight, for the first time since 9/11, our combat mission in Afghanistan is over. Six years ago, nearly 180,000 American troops served in Iraq and Afghanistan. Today, fewer than 15,000 remain. And we salute the courage and sacrifice of every man and woman in this 9/11 Generation who has served to keep us safe. We are humbled and grateful for your service. America, for all that we've endured; for all the grit and hard work required to come back; for all the tasks that lie ahead, know this: The shadow of crisis has passed, and the state of the Union is strong. At this moment--with a growing economy, shrinking deficits, bustling industry, and booming energy production--we have risen from recession freer to write our own future than any other nation on Earth. It's now up to us to choose who we want to be over the next 15 years, and for decades to come. Will we accept an economy where only a few of us do spectacularly well? Or will we commit ourselves to an economy that generates rising incomes and chances for everyone who makes the effort? Will we approach the world fearful and reactive, dragged into costly conflicts that strain our military and set back our standing? Or will we lead wisely, using all elements of our power to defeat new threats and protect our planet? Will we allow ourselves to be sorted into factions and turned against one another--or will we recapture the sense of common purpose that has always propelled America forward? In two weeks, I will send this Congress a budget filled with ideas that are practical, not partisan. And in the months ahead, I'll crisscross the country making a case for those ideas. So tonight, I want to focus less on a checklist of proposals, and focus more on the values at stake in the choices before us. It begins with our economy. Seven years ago, Rebekah and Ben Erler of Minneapolis were newlyweds. She waited tables. He worked construction. Their first child, Jack, was on the way. They were young and in love in America, and it doesn't get much better than that. ``If only we had known,'' Rebekah wrote to me last spring, ``what was about to happen to the housing and construction market.'' As the crisis worsened, Ben's business dried up, so he took what jobs he could find, even if they kept him on the road for long stretches of time. Rebekah took out student loans, enrolled in community college, and retrained for a new career. They sacrificed for each other. And slowly, it paid off. They bought their first home. They had a second son, Henry. Rebekah got a better job, and then a raise. Ben is back in construction--and home for dinner every night. ``It is amazing,'' Rebekah wrote, ``what you can bounce back from when you have to . . . we are a strong, tight-knit family who has made it through some very, very hard times.'' We are a strong, tight-knit family who has made it through some very, very hard times. America, Rebekah and Ben's story is our story. They represent the millions who have worked hard, and scrimped, and sacrificed, and retooled. You are the reason I ran for this office. You're the people I was thinking of 6 years ago today, in the darkest months of the crisis, when I stood on the steps of this Capitol and promised we would rebuild our economy on a new foundation. And it's been your effort and resilience that has made it possible for our country to emerge stronger. We believed we could reverse the tide of outsourcing, and draw new jobs to our shores. And over the past 5 years, our businesses have created more than 11 million new jobs. We believed we could reduce our dependence on foreign oil and protect our planet. And today, America is number one in oil and gas. America is number one in wind power. Every three weeks, we bring online as much solar power as we did in all of 2008. And thanks to lower gas prices and higher fuel standards, the typical family this year should save $750 at the pump. We believed we could prepare our kids for a more competitive world. And today, our younger students have earned the highest math and reading scores on record. Our high school graduation rate has hit an all-time high. And more Americans finish college than ever before. We believed that sensible regulations could prevent another crisis, shield families from ruin, and encourage fair competition. Today, we have new tools to stop taxpayer-funded bailouts, and a new consumer watchdog to protect us from predatory lending and abusive credit card practices. And in the past year alone, about ten million uninsured Americans finally gained the security of health coverage. At every step, we were told our goals were misguided or too ambitious; that we would crush jobs and explode deficits. Instead, we've seen the fastest economic growth in over a decade, our deficits cut by two-thirds, a stock market that has doubled, and health care inflation at its lowest rate in 50 years. So the verdict is clear. Middle-class economics works. Expanding opportunity works. And these policies will continue to work, as long as politics don't get in the way. We can't slow down businesses or put our economy at risk with Government shutdowns or fiscal showdowns. We can't put the security of families at risk by taking away their health insurance, or unraveling the new rules on Wall Street, or refighting past battles on immigration when we've got a system to fix. And if a bill comes to my desk that tries to do any of these things, it will earn my veto. Today, thanks to a growing economy, the recovery is touching more and [[Page S278]] more lives. Wages are finally starting to rise again. We know that more small business owners plan to raise their employees' pay than at any time since 2007. But here's the thing--those of us here tonight, we need to set our sights higher than just making sure Government doesn't halt the progress we're making. We need to do more than just do no harm. Tonight, together, let's do more to restore the link between hard work and growing opportunity for every American. Because families like Rebekah's still need our help. She and Ben are working as hard as ever, but have to forego vacations and a new car so they can pay off student loans and save for retirement. Basic childcare for Jack and Henry costs more than their mortgage, and almost as much as a year at the University of Minnesota. Like millions of hardworking Americans, Rebekah isn't asking for a handout, but she is asking that we look for more ways to help families get ahead. In fact, at every moment of economic change throughout our history, this country has taken bold action to adapt to new circumstances, and to make sure everyone gets a fair shot. We set up worker protections, Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid to protect ourselves from the harshest adversity. We gave our citizens schools and colleges, infrastructure and the internet--tools they needed to go as far as their effort will take them. That's what middle-class economics is--the idea that this country does best when everyone gets their fair shot, everyone does their fair share, and everyone plays by the same set of rules. We don't just want everyone to share in America's success--we want everyone to contribute to our success. So what does middle-class economics require in our time? First--middle-class economics means helping working families feel more secure in a world of constant change. That means helping folks afford childcare, college, health care, a home, retirement--and my budget will address each of these issues, lowering the taxes of working families and putting thousands of dollars back into their pockets each year. Here's one example. During World War II, when men like my grandfather went off to war, having women like my grandmother in the workforce was a national security priority--so this country provided universal childcare. In today's economy, when having both parents in the workforce is an economic necessity for many families, we need affordable, high-quality childcare more than ever. It's not a nice-to- have--it's a must-have. It's time we stop treating childcare as a side issue, or a women's issue, and treat it like the national economic priority that it is for all of us. And that's why my plan will make quality childcare more available, and more affordable, for every middle-class and low-income family with young children in America--by creating more slots and a new tax cut of up to $3,000 per child, per year. Here's another example. Today, we're the only advanced country on Earth that doesn't guarantee paid sick leave or paid maternity leave to our workers. Forty-three million workers have no paid sick leave. Forty-three million. Think about that. And that forces too many parents to make the gut-wrenching choice between a paycheck and a sick kid at home. So I'll be taking new action to help States adopt paid leave laws of their own. And since paid sick leave won where it was on the ballot last November, let's put it to a vote right here in Washington. Send me a bill that gives every worker in America the opportunity to earn seven days of paid sick leave. It's the right thing to do. Of course, nothing helps families make ends meet like higher wages. That's why this Congress still needs to pass a law that makes sure a woman is paid the same as a man for doing the same work. Really. It's 2015. It's time. We still need to make sure employees get the overtime they've earned. And to everyone in this Congress who still refuses to raise the minimum wage, I say this: If you truly believe you could work full-time and support a family on less than $15,000 a year, go try it. If not, vote to give millions of the hardest-working people in America a raise. These ideas won't make everybody rich, or relieve every hardship. That's not the job of Government. To give working families a fair shot, we'll still need more employers to see beyond next quarter's earnings and recognize that investing in their workforce is in their company's long-term interest. We still need laws that strengthen rather than weaken unions, and give American workers a voice. But things like child care and sick leave and equal pay; things like lower mortgage premiums and a higher minimum wage--these ideas will make a meaningful difference in the lives of millions of families. That is a fact. And that's what all of us--Republicans and Democrats alike--were sent here to do. Second, to make sure folks keep earning higher wages down the road, we have to do more to help Americans upgrade their skills. America thrived in the 20th century because we made high school free, sent a generation of GIs to college, and trained the best workforce in the world. But in a 21st century economy that rewards knowledge like never before, we need to do more. By the end of this decade, two in three job openings will require some higher education. Two in three. And yet, we still live in a country where too many bright, striving Americans are priced out of the education they need. It's not fair to them, and it's not smart for our future. That's why I am sending this Congress a bold new plan to lower the cost of community college--to zero. Forty percent of our college students choose community college. Some are young and starting out. Some are older and looking for a better job. Some are veterans and single parents trying to transition back into the job market. Whoever you are, this plan is your chance to graduate ready for the new economy, without a load of debt. Understand, you've got to earn it--you've got to keep your grades up and graduate on time. Tennessee, a state with Republican leadership, and Chicago, a city with Democratic leadership, are showing that free community college is possible. I want to spread that idea all across America, so that 2 years of college becomes as free and universal in America as high school is today. And I want to work with this Congress, to make sure Americans already burdened with student loans can reduce their monthly payments, so that student debt doesn't derail anyone's dreams. Thanks to Vice President Biden's great work to update our job training system, we're connecting community colleges with local employers to train workers to fill high-paying jobs like coding, and nursing, and robotics. Tonight, I'm also asking more businesses to follow the lead of companies like CVS and UPS, and offer more educational benefits and paid apprenticeships--opportunities that give workers the chance to earn higher-paying jobs even if they don't have a higher education. And as a new generation of veterans comes home, we owe them every opportunity to live the American Dream they helped defend. Already, we've made strides towards ensuring that every veteran has access to the highest quality care. We're slashing the backlog that had too many veterans waiting years to get the benefits they need, and we're making it easier for vets to translate their training and experience into civilian jobs. Joining Forces, the national campaign launched by Michelle and Jill Biden, has helped nearly 700,000 veterans and military spouses get new jobs. So to every CEO in America, let me repeat: If you want somebody who's going to get the job done, hire a veteran. Finally, as we better train our workers, we need the new economy to keep churning out high-wage jobs for our workers to fill. Since 2010, America has put more people back to work than Europe, Japan, and all advanced economies combined. Our manufacturers have added almost 800,000 new jobs. Some of our bedrock sectors, like our auto industry, are booming. But there are also millions of Americans who work in jobs that didn't even exist 10 or 20 years ago--jobs at companies like Google, and eBay, and Tesla. So no one knows for certain which industries will generate the jobs of the future. But we do know we want them here in America. That's why the third part of middle-class economics is about [[Page S279]] building the most competitive economy anywhere, the place where businesses want to locate and hire. Twenty-first century businesses need 21st century infrastructure-- modern ports, stronger bridges, faster trains and the fastest internet. Democrats and Republicans used to agree on this. So let's set our sights higher than a single oil pipeline. Let's pass a bipartisan infrastructure plan that could create more than thirty times as many jobs per year, and make this country stronger for decades to come. Twenty-first century businesses, including small businesses, need to sell more American products overseas. Today, our businesses export more than ever, and exporters tend to pay their workers higher wages. But as we speak, China wants to write the rules for the world's fastest- growing region. That would put our workers and businesses at a disadvantage. Why would we let that happen? We should write those rules. We should level the playing field. That's why I'm asking both parties to give me trade promotion authority to protect American workers, with strong new trade deals from Asia to Europe that aren't just free, but fair. Look, I'm the first one to admit that past trade deals haven't always lived up to the hype, and that's why we've gone after countries that break the rules at our expense. But 95 percent of the world's customers live outside our borders, and we can't close ourselves off from those opportunities. More than half of manufacturing executives have said they're actively looking at bringing jobs back from China. Let's give them one more reason to get it done. Twenty-first century businesses will rely on American science, technology, research and development. I want the country that eliminated polio and mapped the human genome to lead a new era of medicine--one that delivers the right treatment at the right time, in some patients with cystic fibrosis, this approach has reversed a disease once thought unstoppable. Tonight, I'm launching a new Precision Medicine Initiative to bring us closer to curing diseases like cancer and diabetes--and to give all of us access to the personalized information we need to keep ourselves and our families healthier. I intend to protect a free and open internet, extend its reach to every classroom, and every community, and help folks build the fastest networks, so that the next generation of digital innovators and entrepreneurs have the platform to keep reshaping our world. I want Americans to win the race for the kinds of discoveries that unleash new jobs--converting sunlight into liquid fuel; creating revolutionary prosthetics, so that a veteran who gave his arms for his country can play catch with his kid; pushing out into the Solar System not just to visit, but to stay. Last month, we launched a new spacecraft as part of a re-energized space program that will send American astronauts to Mars. In two months, to prepare us for those missions, Scott Kelly will begin a year-long stay in space. Good luck, Captain--and make sure to Instagram it. Now, the truth is, when it comes to issues like infrastructure and basic research, I know there's bipartisan support in this chamber. Members of both parties have told me so. Where we too often run onto the rocks is how to pay for these investments. As Americans, we don't mind paying our fair share of taxes, as long as everybody else does, too. But for far too long, lobbyists have rigged the tax code with loopholes that let some corporations pay nothing while others pay full freight. They've riddled it with giveaways the superrich don't need, denying a break to middle class families who do. This year, we have an opportunity to change that. Let's close loopholes so we stop rewarding companies that keep profits abroad, and reward those that invest in America. Let's use those savings to rebuild our infrastructure and make it more attractive for companies to bring jobs home. Let's simplify the system and let a small business owner file based on her actual bank statement, instead of the number of accountants she can afford. And let's close the loopholes that lead to inequality by allowing the top 1 percent to avoid paying taxes on their accumulated wealth. We can use that money to help more families pay for childcare and send their kids to college. We need a tax code that truly helps working Americans trying to get a leg up in the new economy, and we can achieve that together. Helping hardworking families make ends meet. Giving them the tools they need for good-paying jobs in this new economy. Maintaining the conditions for growth and competitiveness. This is where America needs to go. I believe it's where the American people want to go. It will make our economy stronger a year from now, 15 years from now, and deep into the century ahead. Of course, if there's one thing this new century has taught us, it's that we cannot separate our work at home from challenges beyond our shores. My first duty as Commander in Chief is to defend the United States of America. In doing so, the question is not whether America leads in the world, but how. When we make rash decisions, reacting to the headlines instead of using our heads; when the first response to a challenge is to send in our military--then we risk getting drawn into unnecessary conflicts, and neglect the broader strategy we need for a safer, more prosperous world. That's what our enemies want us to do. I believe in a smarter kind of American leadership. We lead best when we combine military power with strong diplomacy; when we leverage our power with coalition building; when we don't let our fears blind us to the opportunities that this new century presents. That's exactly what we're doing right now--and around the globe, it is making a difference. First, we stand united with people around the world who've been targeted by terrorists--from a school in Pakistan to the streets of Paris. We will continue to hunt down terrorists and dismantle their networks, and we reserve the right to act unilaterally, as we've done relentlessly since I took office to take out terrorists who pose a direct threat to us and our allies. At the same time, we've learned some costly lessons over the last 13 years. Instead of Americans patrolling the valleys of Afghanistan, we've trained their security forces, who've now taken the lead, and we've honored our troops' sacrifice by supporting that country's first democratic transition. Instead of sending large ground forces overseas, we're partnering with nations from South Asia to North Africa to deny safe haven to terrorists who threaten America. In Iraq and Syria, American leadership--including our military power--is stopping ISIL's advance. Instead of getting dragged into another ground war in the Middle East, we are leading a broad coalition, including Arab nations, to degrade and ultimately destroy this terrorist group. We're also supporting a moderate opposition in Syria that can help us in this effort, and assisting people everywhere who stand up to the bankrupt ideology of violent extremism. This effort will take time. It will require focus. But we will succeed. And tonight, I call on this Congress to show the world that we are united in this mission by passing a resolution to authorize the use of force against ISIL. Second, we are demonstrating the power of American strength and diplomacy. We're upholding the principle that bigger nations can't bully the small--by opposing Russian aggression, supporting Ukraine's democracy, and reassuring our NATO allies. Last year, as we were doing the hard work of imposing sanctions along with our allies, some suggested that Mr. Putin's aggression was a masterful display of strategy and strength. Well, today, it is America that stands strong and united with our allies, while Russia is isolated, with its economy in tatters. That's how America leads--not with bluster, but with persistent, steady resolve. In Cuba, we are ending a policy that was long past its expiration date. When what you're doing doesn't work for 50 years, it's time to try something new. Our shift in Cuba policy has the potential to end a legacy of mistrust in our hemisphere; removes a phony excuse for restrictions in Cuba; stands up for democratic values; and extends the hand of friendship to the Cuban people. And this year, Congress should begin the work of ending the embargo. As His Holiness, Pope Francis, has said, diplomacy is the work of ``small steps.'' [[Page S280]] These small steps have added up to new hope for the future in Cuba. And after years in prison, we're overjoyed that Alan Gross is back where he belongs. Welcome home, Alan. Our diplomacy is at work with respect to Iran, where, for the first time in a decade, we've halted the progress of its nuclear program and reduced its stockpile of nuclear material. Between now and this spring, we have a chance to negotiate a comprehensive agreement that prevents a nuclear-armed Iran; secures America and our allies--including Israel; while avoiding yet another Middle East conflict. There are no guarantees that negotiations will succeed, and I keep all options on the table to prevent a nuclear Iran. But new sanctions passed by this Congress, at this moment in time, will all but guarantee that diplomacy fails--alienating America from its allies; and ensuring that Iran starts up its nuclear program again. It doesn't make sense. That is why I will veto any new sanctions bill that threatens to undo this progress. The American people expect us to only go to war as a last resort, and I intend to stay true to that wisdom. Third, we're looking beyond the issues that have consumed us in the past to shape the coming century. No foreign nation, no hacker, should be able to shut down our networks, steal our trade secrets, or invade the privacy of American families, especially our kids. We are making sure our Government integrates intelligence to combat cyber threats, just as we have done to combat terrorism. And tonight, I urge this Congress to finally pass the legislation we need to better meet the evolving threat of cyber- attacks, combat identity theft, and protect our children's information. If we don't act, we'll leave our Nation and our economy vulnerable. If we do, we can continue to protect the technologies that have unleashed untold opportunities for people around the globe. In West Africa, our troops, our scientists, our doctors, our nurses and healthcare workers are rolling back Ebola--saving countless lives and stopping the spread of disease. I couldn't be prouder of them, and I thank this Congress for your bipartisan support of their efforts. But the job is not yet done--and the world needs to use this lesson to build a more effective global effort to prevent the spread of future pandemics, invest in smart development, and eradicate extreme poverty. In the Asia Pacific, we are modernizing alliances while making sure that other nations play by the rules--in how they trade, how they resolve maritime disputes, and how they participate in meeting common international challenges like nonproliferation and disaster relief. And no challenge--no challenge--poses a greater threat to future generations than climate change. 2014 was the planet's warmest year on record. Now, one year doesn't make a trend, but this does--14 of the 15 warmest years on record have all fallen in the first 15 years of this century. I've heard some folks try to dodge the evidence by saying they're not scientists; that we don't have enough information to act. Well, I'm not a scientist, either. But you know what--I know a lot of really good scientists at NASA, and NOAA, and at our major universities. The best scientists in the world are all telling us that our activities are changing the climate, and if we do not act forcefully, we'll continue to see rising oceans, longer, hotter heat waves, dangerous droughts and floods, and massive disruptions that can trigger greater migration, conflict, and hunger around the globe. The Pentagon says that climate change poses immediate risks to our national security. We should act like it. That's why, over the past 6 years, we've done more than ever before to combat climate change, from the way we produce energy, to the way we use it. That's why we've set aside more public lands and waters than any administration in history. And that's why I will not let this Congress endanger the health of our children by turning back the clock on our efforts. I am determined to make sure American leadership drives international action. In Beijing, we made an historic announcement--the United States will double the pace at which we cut carbon pollution, and China committed, for the first time, to limiting their emissions. And because the world's two largest economies came together, other nations are now stepping up, and offering hope that, this year, the world will finally reach an agreement to protect the one planet we've got. There's one last pillar to our leadership--and that's the example of our values. As Americans, we respect human dignity, even when we're threatened, which is why I've prohibited torture, and worked to make sure our use of new technology like drones is properly constrained. It's why we speak out against the deplorable anti-Semitism that has resurfaced in certain parts of the world. It's why we continue to reject offensive stereotypes of Muslims--the vast majority of whom share our commitment to peace. That's why we defend free speech, and advocate for political prisoners, and condemn the persecution of women, or religious minorities, or people who are lesbian, gay, bisexual, or transgender. We do these things not only because they're right, but because they make us safer. As Americans, we have a profound commitment to justice--so it makes no sense to spend three million dollars per prisoner to keep open a prison that the world condemns and terrorists use to recruit. Since I've been President, we've worked responsibly to cut the population of GTMO in half. Now it's time to finish the job. And I will not relent in my determination to shut it down. It's not who we are. As Americans, we cherish our civil liberties--and we need to uphold that commitment if we want maximum cooperation from other countries and industry in our fight against terrorist networks. So while some have moved on from the debates over our surveillance programs, I haven't. As promised, our intelligence agencies have worked hard, with the recommendations of privacy advocates, to increase transparency and build more safeguards against potential abuse. And next month, we'll issue a report on how we're keeping our promise to keep our country safe while strengthening privacy. Looking to the future instead of the past. Making sure we match our power with diplomacy, and use force wisely. Building coalitions to meet new challenges and opportunities. Leading--always--with the example of our values. That's what makes us exceptional. That's what keeps us strong. And that's why we must keep striving to hold ourselves to the highest of standards--our own. You know, just over a decade ago, I gave a speech in Boston where I said there wasn't a liberal America, or a conservative America; a black America or a white America--but a United States of America. I said this because I had seen it in my own life, in a nation that gave someone like me a chance; because I grew up in Hawaii, a melting pot of races and customs; because I made Illinois my home--a state of small towns, rich farmland, and one of the world's great cities; a microcosm of the country where Democrats and Republicans and Independents, good people of every ethnicity and every faith, share certain bedrock values. Over the past 6 years, the pundits have pointed out more than once that my presidency hasn't delivered on this vision. How ironic, they say, that our politics seems more divided than ever. It's held up as proof not just of my own flaws--of which there are many--but also as proof that the vision itself is misguided, and naive, and that there are too many people in this town who actually benefit from partisanship and gridlock for us to ever do anything about it. I know how tempting such cynicism may be. But I still think the cynics are wrong. I still believe that we are one people. I still believe that together, we can do great things, even when the odds are long. I believe this because over and over in my 6 years in office, I have seen America at its best. I've seen the hopeful faces of young graduates from New York to California; and our newest officers at West Point, Annapolis, Colorado Springs, and New London. I've mourned with grieving families in Tucson and Newtown; in Boston, West, Texas, and West Virginia. I've watched Americans beat back adversity from the Gulf Coast to the Great Plains; from Midwest assembly lines to the Mid- Atlantic seaboard. I've seen something like gay marriage go from a wedge issue used to drive us apart to a [[Page S281]] story of freedom across our country, a civil right now legal in States that seven in ten Americans call home. So I know the good, and optimistic, and big-hearted generosity of the American people who, every day, live the idea that we are our brother's keeper, and our sister's keeper. And I know they expect those of us who serve here to set a better example. So the question for those of us here tonight is how we, all of us, can better reflect America's hopes. I've served in Congress with many of you. I know many of you well. There are a lot of good people here, on both sides of the aisle. And many of you have told me that this isn't what you signed up for--arguing past each other on cable shows, the constant fundraising, always looking over your shoulder at how the base will react to every decision. Imagine if we broke out of these tired old patterns. Imagine if we did something different. Understand--a better politics isn't one where Democrats abandon their agenda or Republicans simply embrace mine. A better politics is one where we appeal to each other's basic decency instead of our basest fears. A better politics is one where we debate without demonizing each other; where we talk issues, and values, and principles, and facts, rather than ``gotcha'' moments, or trivial gaffes, or fake controversies that have nothing to do with people's daily lives. A better politics is one where we spend less time drowning in dark money for ads that pull us into the gutter, and spend more time lifting young people up, with a sense of purpose and possibility, and asking them to join in the great mission of building America. If we're going to have arguments, let's have arguments--but let's make them debates worthy of this body and worthy of this country. We still may not agree on a woman's right to choose, but surely we can agree it's a good thing that teen pregnancies and abortions are nearing all-time lows, and that every woman should have access to the health care she needs. Yes, passions still fly on immigration, but surely we can all see something of ourselves in the striving young student, and agree that no one benefits when a hardworking mom is taken from her child, and that it's possible to shape a law that upholds our tradition as a nation of laws and a nation of immigrants. We may go at it in campaign season, but surely we can agree that the right to vote is sacred; that it's being denied to too many; and that, on this 50th anniversary of the great march from Selma to Montgomery and the passage of the Voting Rights Act, we can come together, Democrats and Republicans, to make voting easier for every single American. We may have different takes on the events of Ferguson and New York. But surely we can understand a father who fears his son can't walk home without being harassed. Surely we can understand the wife who won't rest until the police officer she married walks through the front door at the end of his shift. Surely we can agree it's a good thing that for the first time in 40 years, the crime rate and the incarceration rate have come down together, and use that as a starting point for Democrats and Republicans, community leaders and law enforcement, to reform America's criminal justice system so that it protects and serves us all. That's a better politics. That's how we start rebuilding trust. That's how we move this country forward. That's what the American people want. That's what they deserve. I have no more campaigns to run. My only agenda for the next 2 years is the same as the one I've had since the day I swore an oath on the steps of this Capitol--to do what I believe is best for America. If you share the broad vision I outlined tonight, join me in the work at hand. If you disagree with parts of it, I hope you'll at least work with me where you do agree. And I commit to every Republican here tonight that I will not only seek out your ideas, I will seek to work with you to make this country stronger. Because I want this chamber, this city, to reflect the truth--that for all our blind spots and shortcomings, we are a people with the strength and generosity of spirit to bridge divides, to unite in common effort, and help our neighbors, whether down the street or on the other side of the world. I want our actions to tell every child, in every neighborhood: your life matters, and we are as committed to improving your life chances as we are for our own kids. I want future generations to know that we are a people who see our differences as a great gift, that we are a people who value the dignity and worth of every citizen--man and woman, young and old, black and white, Latino and Asian, immigrant and Native American, gay and straight, Americans with mental illness or physical disability. I want them to grow up in a country that shows the world what we still know to be true: that we are still more than a collection of red States and blue States; that we are the United States of America. I want them to grow up in a country where a young mom like Rebekah can sit down and write a letter to her President with a story to sum up these past 6 years: ``It is amazing what you can bounce back from when you have to . . . we are a strong, tight-knit family who has made it through some very, very hard times.'' My fellow Americans, we too are a strong, tight-knit family. We, too, have made it through some hard times. Fifteen years into this new century, we have picked ourselves up, dusted ourselves off, and begun again the work of remaking America. We've laid a new foundation. A brighter future is ours to write. Let's begin this new chapter-- together--and let's start the work right now. Thank you, God bless you, and God bless this country we love. Barack Obama. The White House, January 20, 2015. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 9 (Tuesday, January 20, 2015)] [Senate] [Pages S277-S281] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] REPORT ON THE STATE OF THE UNION DELIVERED TO A JOINT SESSION OF CONGRESS ON JANUARY 20, 2015--PM 1 The PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate the following message from the President of the United States which was ordered to lie on the table: To the Congress of the United States: Mr. Speaker, Mr. Vice President, Members of Congress, my fellow Americans: We are 15 years into this new century. Fifteen years that dawned with terror touching our shores; that unfolded with a new generation fighting two long and costly wars; that saw a vicious recession spread across our Nation and the world. It has been, and still is, a hard time for many. But tonight, we turn the page. Tonight, after a breakthrough year for America, our economy is growing and creating jobs at the fastest pace since 1999. Our unemployment rate is now lower than it was before the financial crisis. More of our kids are graduating than ever before; more of our people are insured than ever before; we are as free from the grip of foreign oil as we've been in almost 30 years. Tonight, for the first time since 9/11, our combat mission in Afghanistan is over. Six years ago, nearly 180,000 American troops served in Iraq and Afghanistan. Today, fewer than 15,000 remain. And we salute the courage and sacrifice of every man and woman in this 9/11 Generation who has served to keep us safe. We are humbled and grateful for your service. America, for all that we've endured; for all the grit and hard work required to come back; for all the tasks that lie ahead, know this: The shadow of crisis has passed, and the state of the Union is strong. At this moment--with a growing economy, shrinking deficits, bustling industry, and booming energy production--we have risen from recession freer to write our own future than any other nation on Earth. It's now up to us to choose who we want to be over the next 15 years, and for decades to come. Will we accept an economy where only a few of us do spectacularly well? Or will we commit ourselves to an economy that generates rising incomes and chances for everyone who makes the effort? Will we approach the world fearful and reactive, dragged into costly conflicts that strain our military and set back our standing? Or will we lead wisely, using all elements of our power to defeat new threats and protect our planet? Will we allow ourselves to be sorted into factions and turned against one another--or will we recapture the sense of common purpose that has always propelled America forward? In two weeks, I will send this Congress a budget filled with ideas that are practical, not partisan. And in the months ahead, I'll crisscross the country making a case for those ideas. So tonight, I want to focus less on a checklist of proposals, and focus more on the values at stake in the choices before us. It begins with our economy. Seven years ago, Rebekah and Ben Erler of Minneapolis were newlyweds. She waited tables. He worked construction. Their first child, Jack, was on the way. They were young and in love in America, and it doesn't get much better than that. ``If only we had known,'' Rebekah wrote to me last spring, ``what was about to happen to the housing and construction market.'' As the crisis worsened, Ben's business dried up, so he took what jobs he could find, even if they kept him on the road for long stretches of time. Rebekah took out student loans, enrolled in community college, and retrained for a new career. They sacrificed for each other. And slowly, it paid off. They bought their first home. They had a second son, Henry. Rebekah got a better job, and then a raise. Ben is back in construction--and home for dinner every night. ``It is amazing,'' Rebekah wrote, ``what you can bounce back from when you have to . . . we are a strong, tight-knit family who has made it through some very, very hard times.'' We are a strong, tight-knit family who has made it through some very, very hard times. America, Rebekah and Ben's story is our story. They represent the millions who have worked hard, and scrimped, and sacrificed, and retooled. You are the reason I ran for this office. You're the people I was thinking of 6 years ago today, in the darkest months of the crisis, when I stood on the steps of this Capitol and promised we would rebuild our economy on a new foundation. And it's been your effort and resilience that has made it possible for our country to emerge stronger. We believed we could reverse the tide of outsourcing, and draw new jobs to our shores. And over the past 5 years, our businesses have created more than 11 million new jobs. We believed we could reduce our dependence on foreign oil and protect our planet. And today, America is number one in oil and gas. America is number one in wind power. Every three weeks, we bring online as much solar power as we did in all of 2008. And thanks to lower gas prices and higher fuel standards, the typical family this year should save $750 at the pump. We believed we could prepare our kids for a more competitive world. And today, our younger students have earned the highest math and reading scores on record. Our high school graduation rate has hit an all-time high. And more Americans finish college than ever before. We believed that sensible regulations could prevent another crisis, shield families from ruin, and encourage fair competition. Today, we have new tools to stop taxpayer-funded bailouts, and a new consumer watchdog to protect us from predatory lending and abusive credit card practices. And in the past year alone, about ten million uninsured Americans finally gained the security of health coverage. At every step, we were told our goals were misguided or too ambitious; that we would crush jobs and explode deficits. Instead, we've seen the fastest economic growth in over a decade, our deficits cut by two-thirds, a stock market that has doubled, and health care inflation at its lowest rate in 50 years. So the verdict is clear. Middle-class economics works. Expanding opportunity works. And these policies will continue to work, as long as politics don't get in the way. We can't slow down businesses or put our economy at risk with Government shutdowns or fiscal showdowns. We can't put the security of families at risk by taking away their health insurance, or unraveling the new rules on Wall Street, or refighting past battles on immigration when we've got a system to fix. And if a bill comes to my desk that tries to do any of these things, it will earn my veto. Today, thanks to a growing economy, the recovery is touching more and [[Page S278]] more lives. Wages are finally starting to rise again. We know that more small business owners plan to raise their employees' pay than at any time since 2007. But here's the thing--those of us here tonight, we need to set our sights higher than just making sure Government doesn't halt the progress we're making. We need to do more than just do no harm. Tonight, together, let's do more to restore the link between hard work and growing opportunity for every American. Because families like Rebekah's still need our help. She and Ben are working as hard as ever, but have to forego vacations and a new car so they can pay off student loans and save for retirement. Basic childcare for Jack and Henry costs more than their mortgage, and almost as much as a year at the University of Minnesota. Like millions of hardworking Americans, Rebekah isn't asking for a handout, but she is asking that we look for more ways to help families get ahead. In fact, at every moment of economic change throughout our history, this country has taken bold action to adapt to new circumstances, and to make sure everyone gets a fair shot. We set up worker protections, Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid to protect ourselves from the harshest adversity. We gave our citizens schools and colleges, infrastructure and the internet--tools they needed to go as far as their effort will take them. That's what middle-class economics is--the idea that this country does best when everyone gets their fair shot, everyone does their fair share, and everyone plays by the same set of rules. We don't just want everyone to share in America's success--we want everyone to contribute to our success. So what does middle-class economics require in our time? First--middle-class economics means helping working families feel more secure in a world of constant change. That means helping folks afford childcare, college, health care, a home, retirement--and my budget will address each of these issues, lowering the taxes of working families and putting thousands of dollars back into their pockets each year. Here's one example. During World War II, when men like my grandfather went off to war, having women like my grandmother in the workforce was a national security priority--so this country provided universal childcare. In today's economy, when having both parents in the workforce is an economic necessity for many families, we need affordable, high-quality childcare more than ever. It's not a nice-to- have--it's a must-have. It's time we stop treating childcare as a side issue, or a women's issue, and treat it like the national economic priority that it is for all of us. And that's why my plan will make quality childcare more available, and more affordable, for every middle-class and low-income family with young children in America--by creating more slots and a new tax cut of up to $3,000 per child, per year. Here's another example. Today, we're the only advanced country on Earth that doesn't guarantee paid sick leave or paid maternity leave to our workers. Forty-three million workers have no paid sick leave. Forty-three million. Think about that. And that forces too many parents to make the gut-wrenching choice between a paycheck and a sick kid at home. So I'll be taking new action to help States adopt paid leave laws of their own. And since paid sick leave won where it was on the ballot last November, let's put it to a vote right here in Washington. Send me a bill that gives every worker in America the opportunity to earn seven days of paid sick leave. It's the right thing to do. Of course, nothing helps families make ends meet like higher wages. That's why this Congress still needs to pass a law that makes sure a woman is paid the same as a man for doing the same work. Really. It's 2015. It's time. We still need to make sure employees get the overtime they've earned. And to everyone in this Congress who still refuses to raise the minimum wage, I say this: If you truly believe you could work full-time and support a family on less than $15,000 a year, go try it. If not, vote to give millions of the hardest-working people in America a raise. These ideas won't make everybody rich, or relieve every hardship. That's not the job of Government. To give working families a fair shot, we'll still need more employers to see beyond next quarter's earnings and recognize that investing in their workforce is in their company's long-term interest. We still need laws that strengthen rather than weaken unions, and give American workers a voice. But things like child care and sick leave and equal pay; things like lower mortgage premiums and a higher minimum wage--these ideas will make a meaningful difference in the lives of millions of families. That is a fact. And that's what all of us--Republicans and Democrats alike--were sent here to do. Second, to make sure folks keep earning higher wages down the road, we have to do more to help Americans upgrade their skills. America thrived in the 20th century because we made high school free, sent a generation of GIs to college, and trained the best workforce in the world. But in a 21st century economy that rewards knowledge like never before, we need to do more. By the end of this decade, two in three job openings will require some higher education. Two in three. And yet, we still live in a country where too many bright, striving Americans are priced out of the education they need. It's not fair to them, and it's not smart for our future. That's why I am sending this Congress a bold new plan to lower the cost of community college--to zero. Forty percent of our college students choose community college. Some are young and starting out. Some are older and looking for a better job. Some are veterans and single parents trying to transition back into the job market. Whoever you are, this plan is your chance to graduate ready for the new economy, without a load of debt. Understand, you've got to earn it--you've got to keep your grades up and graduate on time. Tennessee, a state with Republican leadership, and Chicago, a city with Democratic leadership, are showing that free community college is possible. I want to spread that idea all across America, so that 2 years of college becomes as free and universal in America as high school is today. And I want to work with this Congress, to make sure Americans already burdened with student loans can reduce their monthly payments, so that student debt doesn't derail anyone's dreams. Thanks to Vice President Biden's great work to update our job training system, we're connecting community colleges with local employers to train workers to fill high-paying jobs like coding, and nursing, and robotics. Tonight, I'm also asking more businesses to follow the lead of companies like CVS and UPS, and offer more educational benefits and paid apprenticeships--opportunities that give workers the chance to earn higher-paying jobs even if they don't have a higher education. And as a new generation of veterans comes home, we owe them every opportunity to live the American Dream they helped defend. Already, we've made strides towards ensuring that every veteran has access to the highest quality care. We're slashing the backlog that had too many veterans waiting years to get the benefits they need, and we're making it easier for vets to translate their training and experience into civilian jobs. Joining Forces, the national campaign launched by Michelle and Jill Biden, has helped nearly 700,000 veterans and military spouses get new jobs. So to every CEO in America, let me repeat: If you want somebody who's going to get the job done, hire a veteran. Finally, as we better train our workers, we need the new economy to keep churning out high-wage jobs for our workers to fill. Since 2010, America has put more people back to work than Europe, Japan, and all advanced economies combined. Our manufacturers have added almost 800,000 new jobs. Some of our bedrock sectors, like our auto industry, are booming. But there are also millions of Americans who work in jobs that didn't even exist 10 or 20 years ago--jobs at companies like Google, and eBay, and Tesla. So no one knows for certain which industries will generate the jobs of the future. But we do know we want them here in America. That's why the third part of middle-class economics is about [[Page S279]] building the most competitive economy anywhere, the place where businesses want to locate and hire. Twenty-first century businesses need 21st century infrastructure-- modern ports, stronger bridges, faster trains and the fastest internet. Democrats and Republicans used to agree on this. So let's set our sights higher than a single oil pipeline. Let's pass a bipartisan infrastructure plan that could create more than thirty times as many jobs per year, and make this country stronger for decades to come. Twenty-first century businesses, including small businesses, need to sell more American products overseas. Today, our businesses export more than ever, and exporters tend to pay their workers higher wages. But as we speak, China wants to write the rules for the world's fastest- growing region. That would put our workers and businesses at a disadvantage. Why would we let that happen? We should write those rules. We should level the playing field. That's why I'm asking both parties to give me trade promotion authority to protect American workers, with strong new trade deals from Asia to Europe that aren't just free, but fair. Look, I'm the first one to admit that past trade deals haven't always lived up to the hype, and that's why we've gone after countries that break the rules at our expense. But 95 percent of the world's customers live outside our borders, and we can't close ourselves off from those opportunities. More than half of manufacturing executives have said they're actively looking at bringing jobs back from China. Let's give them one more reason to get it done. Twenty-first century businesses will rely on American science, technology, research and development. I want the country that eliminated polio and mapped the human genome to lead a new era of medicine--one that delivers the right treatment at the right time, in some patients with cystic fibrosis, this approach has reversed a disease once thought unstoppable. Tonight, I'm launching a new Precision Medicine Initiative to bring us closer to curing diseases like cancer and diabetes--and to give all of us access to the personalized information we need to keep ourselves and our families healthier. I intend to protect a free and open internet, extend its reach to every classroom, and every community, and help folks build the fastest networks, so that the next generation of digital innovators and entrepreneurs have the platform to keep reshaping our world. I want Americans to win the race for the kinds of discoveries that unleash new jobs--converting sunlight into liquid fuel; creating revolutionary prosthetics, so that a veteran who gave his arms for his country can play catch with his kid; pushing out into the Solar System not just to visit, but to stay. Last month, we launched a new spacecraft as part of a re-energized space program that will send American astronauts to Mars. In two months, to prepare us for those missions, Scott Kelly will begin a year-long stay in space. Good luck, Captain--and make sure to Instagram it. Now, the truth is, when it comes to issues like infrastructure and basic research, I know there's bipartisan support in this chamber. Members of both parties have told me so. Where we too often run onto the rocks is how to pay for these investments. As Americans, we don't mind paying our fair share of taxes, as long as everybody else does, too. But for far too long, lobbyists have rigged the tax code with loopholes that let some corporations pay nothing while others pay full freight. They've riddled it with giveaways the superrich don't need, denying a break to middle class families who do. This year, we have an opportunity to change that. Let's close loopholes so we stop rewarding companies that keep profits abroad, and reward those that invest in America. Let's use those savings to rebuild our infrastructure and make it more attractive for companies to bring jobs home. Let's simplify the system and let a small business owner file based on her actual bank statement, instead of the number of accountants she can afford. And let's close the loopholes that lead to inequality by allowing the top 1 percent to avoid paying taxes on their accumulated wealth. We can use that money to help more families pay for childcare and send their kids to college. We need a tax code that truly helps working Americans trying to get a leg up in the new economy, and we can achieve that together. Helping hardworking families make ends meet. Giving them the tools they need for good-paying jobs in this new economy. Maintaining the conditions for growth and competitiveness. This is where America needs to go. I believe it's where the American people want to go. It will make our economy stronger a year from now, 15 years from now, and deep into the century ahead. Of course, if there's one thing this new century has taught us, it's that we cannot separate our work at home from challenges beyond our shores. My first duty as Commander in Chief is to defend the United States of America. In doing so, the question is not whether America leads in the world, but how. When we make rash decisions, reacting to the headlines instead of using our heads; when the first response to a challenge is to send in our military--then we risk getting drawn into unnecessary conflicts, and neglect the broader strategy we need for a safer, more prosperous world. That's what our enemies want us to do. I believe in a smarter kind of American leadership. We lead best when we combine military power with strong diplomacy; when we leverage our power with coalition building; when we don't let our fears blind us to the opportunities that this new century presents. That's exactly what we're doing right now--and around the globe, it is making a difference. First, we stand united with people around the world who've been targeted by terrorists--from a school in Pakistan to the streets of Paris. We will continue to hunt down terrorists and dismantle their networks, and we reserve the right to act unilaterally, as we've done relentlessly since I took office to take out terrorists who pose a direct threat to us and our allies. At the same time, we've learned some costly lessons over the last 13 years. Instead of Americans patrolling the valleys of Afghanistan, we've trained their security forces, who've now taken the lead, and we've honored our troops' sacrifice by supporting that country's first democratic transition. Instead of sending large ground forces overseas, we're partnering with nations from South Asia to North Africa to deny safe haven to terrorists who threaten America. In Iraq and Syria, American leadership--including our military power--is stopping ISIL's advance. Instead of getting dragged into another ground war in the Middle East, we are leading a broad coalition, including Arab nations, to degrade and ultimately destroy this terrorist group. We're also supporting a moderate opposition in Syria that can help us in this effort, and assisting people everywhere who stand up to the bankrupt ideology of violent extremism. This effort will take time. It will require focus. But we will succeed. And tonight, I call on this Congress to show the world that we are united in this mission by passing a resolution to authorize the use of force against ISIL. Second, we are demonstrating the power of American strength and diplomacy. We're upholding the principle that bigger nations can't bully the small--by opposing Russian aggression, supporting Ukraine's democracy, and reassuring our NATO allies. Last year, as we were doing the hard work of imposing sanctions along with our allies, some suggested that Mr. Putin's aggression was a masterful display of strategy and strength. Well, today, it is America that stands strong and united with our allies, while Russia is isolated, with its economy in tatters. That's how America leads--not with bluster, but with persistent, steady resolve. In Cuba, we are ending a policy that was long past its expiration date. When what you're doing doesn't work for 50 years, it's time to try something new. Our shift in Cuba policy has the potential to end a legacy of mistrust in our hemisphere; removes a phony excuse for restrictions in Cuba; stands up for democratic values; and extends the hand of friendship to the Cuban people. And this year, Congress should begin the work of ending the embargo. As His Holiness, Pope Francis, has said, diplomacy is the work of ``small steps.'' [[Page S280]] These small steps have added up to new hope for the future in Cuba. And after years in prison, we're overjoyed that Alan Gross is back where he belongs. Welcome home, Alan. Our diplomacy is at work with respect to Iran, where, for the first time in a decade, we've halted the progress of its nuclear program and reduced its stockpile of nuclear material. Between now and this spring, we have a chance to negotiate a comprehensive agreement that prevents a nuclear-armed Iran; secures America and our allies--including Israel; while avoiding yet another Middle East conflict. There are no guarantees that negotiations will succeed, and I keep all options on the table to prevent a nuclear Iran. But new sanctions passed by this Congress, at this moment in time, will all but guarantee that diplomacy fails--alienating America from its allies; and ensuring that Iran starts up its nuclear program again. It doesn't make sense. That is why I will veto any new sanctions bill that threatens to undo this progress. The American people expect us to only go to war as a last resort, and I intend to stay true to that wisdom. Third, we're looking beyond the issues that have consumed us in the past to shape the coming century. No foreign nation, no hacker, should be able to shut down our networks, steal our trade secrets, or invade the privacy of American families, especially our kids. We are making sure our Government integrates intelligence to combat cyber threats, just as we have done to combat terrorism. And tonight, I urge this Congress to finally pass the legislation we need to better meet the evolving threat of cyber- attacks, combat identity theft, and protect our children's information. If we don't act, we'll leave our Nation and our economy vulnerable. If we do, we can continue to protect the technologies that have unleashed untold opportunities for people around the globe. In West Africa, our troops, our scientists, our doctors, our nurses and healthcare workers are rolling back Ebola--saving countless lives and stopping the spread of disease. I couldn't be prouder of them, and I thank this Congress for your bipartisan support of their efforts. But the job is not yet done--and the world needs to use this lesson to build a more effective global effort to prevent the spread of future pandemics, invest in smart development, and eradicate extreme poverty. In the Asia Pacific, we are modernizing alliances while making sure that other nations play by the rules--in how they trade, how they resolve maritime disputes, and how they participate in meeting common international challenges like nonproliferation and disaster relief. And no challenge--no challenge--poses a greater threat to future generations than climate change. 2014 was the planet's warmest year on record. Now, one year doesn't make a trend, but this does--14 of the 15 warmest years on record have all fallen in the first 15 years of this century. I've heard some folks try to dodge the evidence by saying they're not scientists; that we don't have enough information to act. Well, I'm not a scientist, either. But you know what--I know a lot of really good scientists at NASA, and NOAA, and at our major universities. The best scientists in the world are all telling us that our activities are changing the climate, and if we do not act forcefully, we'll continue to see rising oceans, longer, hotter heat waves, dangerous droughts and floods, and massive disruptions that can trigger greater migration, conflict, and hunger around the globe. The Pentagon says that climate change poses immediate risks to our national security. We should act like it. That's why, over the past 6 years, we've done more than ever before to combat climate change, from the way we produce energy, to the way we use it. That's why we've set aside more public lands and waters than any administration in history. And that's why I will not let this Congress endanger the health of our children by turning back the clock on our efforts. I am determined to make sure American leadership drives international action. In Beijing, we made an historic announcement--the United States will double the pace at which we cut carbon pollution, and China committed, for the first time, to limiting their emissions. And because the world's two largest economies came together, other nations are now stepping up, and offering hope that, this year, the world will finally reach an agreement to protect the one planet we've got. There's one last pillar to our leadership--and that's the example of our values. As Americans, we respect human dignity, even when we're threatened, which is why I've prohibited torture, and worked to make sure our use of new technology like drones is properly constrained. It's why we speak out against the deplorable anti-Semitism that has resurfaced in certain parts of the world. It's why we continue to reject offensive stereotypes of Muslims--the vast majority of whom share our commitment to peace. That's why we defend free speech, and advocate for political prisoners, and condemn the persecution of women, or religious minorities, or people who are lesbian, gay, bisexual, or transgender. We do these things not only because they're right, but because they make us safer. As Americans, we have a profound commitment to justice--so it makes no sense to spend three million dollars per prisoner to keep open a prison that the world condemns and terrorists use to recruit. Since I've been President, we've worked responsibly to cut the population of GTMO in half. Now it's time to finish the job. And I will not relent in my determination to shut it down. It's not who we are. As Americans, we cherish our civil liberties--and we need to uphold that commitment if we want maximum cooperation from other countries and industry in our fight against terrorist networks. So while some have moved on from the debates over our surveillance programs, I haven't. As promised, our intelligence agencies have worked hard, with the recommendations of privacy advocates, to increase transparency and build more safeguards against potential abuse. And next month, we'll issue a report on how we're keeping our promise to keep our country safe while strengthening privacy. Looking to the future instead of the past. Making sure we match our power with diplomacy, and use force wisely. Building coalitions to meet new challenges and opportunities. Leading--always--with the example of our values. That's what makes us exceptional. That's what keeps us strong. And that's why we must keep striving to hold ourselves to the highest of standards--our own. You know, just over a decade ago, I gave a speech in Boston where I said there wasn't a liberal America, or a conservative America; a black America or a white America--but a United States of America. I said this because I had seen it in my own life, in a nation that gave someone like me a chance; because I grew up in Hawaii, a melting pot of races and customs; because I made Illinois my home--a state of small towns, rich farmland, and one of the world's great cities; a microcosm of the country where Democrats and Republicans and Independents, good people of every ethnicity and every faith, share certain bedrock values. Over the past 6 years, the pundits have pointed out more than once that my presidency hasn't delivered on this vision. How ironic, they say, that our politics seems more divided than ever. It's held up as proof not just of my own flaws--of which there are many--but also as proof that the vision itself is misguided, and naive, and that there are too many people in this town who actually benefit from partisanship and gridlock for us to ever do anything about it. I know how tempting such cynicism may be. But I still think the cynics are wrong. I still believe that we are one people. I still believe that together, we can do great things, even when the odds are long. I believe this because over and over in my 6 years in office, I have seen America at its best. I've seen the hopeful faces of young graduates from New York to California; and our newest officers at West Point, Annapolis, Colorado Springs, and New London. I've mourned with grieving families in Tucson and Newtown; in Boston, West, Texas, and West Virginia. I've watched Americans beat back adversity from the Gulf Coast to the Great Plains; from Midwest assembly lines to the Mid- Atlantic seaboard. I've seen something like gay marriage go from a wedge issue used to drive us apart to a [[Page S281]] story of freedom across our country, a civil right now legal in States that seven in ten Americans call home. So I know the good, and optimistic, and big-hearted generosity of the American people who, every day, live the idea that we are our brother's keeper, and our sister's keeper. And I know they expect those of us who serve here to set a better example. So the question for those of us here tonight is how we, all of us, can better reflect America's hopes. I've served in Congress with many of you. I know many of you well. There are a lot of good people here, on both sides of the aisle. And many of you have told me that this isn't what you signed up for--arguing past each other on cable shows, the constant fundraising, always looking over your shoulder at how the base will react to every decision. Imagine if we broke out of these tired old patterns. Imagine if we did something different. Understand--a better politics isn't one where Democrats abandon their agenda or Republicans simply embrace mine. A better politics is one where we appeal to each other's basic decency instead of our basest fears. A better politics is one where we debate without demonizing each other; where we talk issues, and values, and principles, and facts, rather than ``gotcha'' moments, or trivial gaffes, or fake controversies that have nothing to do with people's daily lives. A better politics is one where we spend less time drowning in dark money for ads that pull us into the gutter, and spend more time lifting young people up, with a sense of purpose and possibility, and asking them to join in the great mission of building America. If we're going to have arguments, let's have arguments--but let's make them debates worthy of this body and worthy of this country. We still may not agree on a woman's right to choose, but surely we can agree it's a good thing that teen pregnancies and abortions are nearing all-time lows, and that every woman should have access to the health care she needs. Yes, passions still fly on immigration, but surely we can all see something of ourselves in the striving young student, and agree that no one benefits when a hardworking mom is taken from her child, and that it's possible to shape a law that upholds our tradition as a nation of laws and a nation of immigrants. We may go at it in campaign season, but surely we can agree that the right to vote is sacred; that it's being denied to too many; and that, on this 50th anniversary of the great march from Selma to Montgomery and the passage of the Voting Rights Act, we can come together, Democrats and Republicans, to make voting easier for every single American. We may have different takes on the events of Ferguson and New York. But surely we can understand a father who fears his son can't walk home without being harassed. Surely we can understand the wife who won't rest until the police officer she married walks through the front door at the end of his shift. Surely we can agree it's a good thing that for the first time in 40 years, the crime rate and the incarceration rate have come down together, and use that as a starting point for Democrats and Republicans, community leaders and law enforcement, to reform America's criminal justice system so that it protects and serves us all. That's a better politics. That's how we start rebuilding trust. That's how we move this country forward. That's what the American people want. That's what they deserve. I have no more campaigns to run. My only agenda for the next 2 years is the same as the one I've had since the day I swore an oath on the steps of this Capitol--to do what I believe is best for America. If you share the broad vision I outlined tonight, join me in the work at hand. If you disagree with parts of it, I hope you'll at least work with me where you do agree. And I commit to every Republican here tonight that I will not only seek out your ideas, I will seek to work with you to make this country stronger. Because I want this chamber, this city, to reflect the truth--that for all our blind spots and shortcomings, we are a people with the strength and generosity of spirit to bridge divides, to unite in common effort, and help our neighbors, whether down the street or on the other side of the world. I want our actions to tell every child, in every neighborhood: your life matters, and we are as committed to improving your life chances as we are for our own kids. I want future generations to know that we are a people who see our differences as a great gift, that we are a people who value the dignity and worth of every citizen--man and woman, young and old, black and white, Latino and Asian, immigrant and Native American, gay and straight, Americans with mental illness or physical disability. I want them to grow up in a country that shows the world what we still know to be true: that we are still more than a collection of red States and blue States; that we are the United States of America. I want them to grow up in a country where a young mom like Rebekah can sit down and write a letter to her President with a story to sum up these past 6 years: ``It is amazing what you can bounce back from when you have to . . . we are a strong, tight-knit family who has made it through some very, very hard times.'' My fellow Americans, we too are a strong, tight-knit family. We, too, have made it through some hard times. Fifteen years into this new century, we have picked ourselves up, dusted ourselves off, and begun again the work of remaking America. We've laid a new foundation. A brighter future is ours to write. Let's begin this new chapter-- together--and let's start the work right now. Thank you, God bless you, and God bless this country we love. Barack Obama. The White House, January 20, 2015. ____________________","Congressional Record, Volume 161 Issue 9 (Tuesday, January 20, 2015) [Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 9 (Tuesday, January 20, 2015)] [Senate] [Pages S277-S281] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] REPORT ON THE STATE OF THE UNION DELIVERED TO A JOINT SESSION OF CONGRESS ON JANUARY 20, 2015--PM 1 The PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate the following message from the President of the United States which was ordered to lie on the table: To the Congress of the United States: Mr. Speaker, Mr. Vice President, Members of Congress, my fellow Americans: We are 15 years into this new century. Fifteen years that dawned with terror touching our shores; that unfolded with a new generation fighting two long and costly wars; that saw a vicious recession spread across our Nation and the world. It has been, and still is, a hard time for many. But tonight, we turn the page. Tonight, after a breakthrough year for America, our economy is growing and creating jobs at the fastest pace since 1999. Our unemployment rate is now lower than it was before the financial crisis. More of our kids are graduating than ever before; more of our people are insured than ever before; we are as free from the grip of foreign oil as we've been in almost 30 years. Tonight, for the first time since 9/11, our combat mission in Afghanistan is over. Six years ago, nearly 180,000 American troops served in Iraq and Afghanistan. Today, fewer than 15,000 remain. And we salute the courage and sacrifice of every man and woman in this 9/11 Generation who has served to keep us safe. We are humbled and grateful for your service. America, for all that we've endured; for all the grit and hard work required to come back; for all the tasks that lie ahead, know this: The shadow of crisis has passed, and the state of the Union is strong. At this moment--with a growing economy, shrinking deficits, bustling industry, and booming energy production--we have risen from recession freer to write our own future than any other nation on Earth. It's now up to us to choose who we want to be over the next 15 years, and for decades to come. Will we accept an economy where only a few of us do spectacularly well? Or will we commit ourselves to an economy that generates rising incomes and chances for everyone who makes the effort? Will we approach the world fearful and reactive, dragged into costly conflicts that strain our military and set back our standing? Or will we lead wisely, using all elements of our power to defeat new threats and protect our planet? Will we allow ourselves to be sorted into factions and turned against one another--or will we recapture the sense of common purpose that has always propelled America forward? In two weeks, I will send this Congress a budget filled with ideas that are practical, not partisan. And in the months ahead, I'll crisscross the country making a case for those ideas. So tonight, I want to focus less on a checklist of proposals, and focus more on the values at stake in the choices before us. It begins with our economy. Seven years ago, Rebekah and Ben Erler of Minneapolis were newlyweds. She waited tables. He worked construction. Their first child, Jack, was on the way. They were young and in love in America, and it doesn't get much better than that. ``If only we had known,'' Rebekah wrote to me last spring, ``what was about to happen to the housing and construction market.'' As the crisis worsened, Ben's business dried up, so he took what jobs he could find, even if they kept him on the road for long stretches of time. Rebekah took out student loans, enrolled in community college, and retrained for a new career. They sacrificed for each other. And slowly, it paid off. They bought their first home. They had a second son, Henry. Rebekah got a better job, and then a raise. Ben is back in construction--and home for dinner every night. ``It is amazing,'' Rebekah wrote, ``what you can bounce back from when you have to . . . we are a strong, tight-knit family who has made it through some very, very hard times.'' We are a strong, tight-knit family who has made it through some very, very hard times. America, Rebekah and Ben's story is our story. They represent the millions who have worked hard, and scrimped, and sacrificed, and retooled. You are the reason I ran for this office. You're the people I was thinking of 6 years ago today, in the darkest months of the crisis, when I stood on the steps of this Capitol and promised we would rebuild our economy on a new foundation. And it's been your effort and resilience that has made it possible for our country to emerge stronger. We believed we could reverse the tide of outsourcing, and draw new jobs to our shores. And over the past 5 years, our businesses have created more than 11 million new jobs. We believed we could reduce our dependence on foreign oil and protect our planet. And today, America is number one in oil and gas. America is number one in wind power. Every three weeks, we bring online as much solar power as we did in all of 2008. And thanks to lower gas prices and higher fuel standards, the typical family this year should save $750 at the pump. We believed we could prepare our kids for a more competitive world. And today, our younger students have earned the highest math and reading scores on record. Our high school graduation rate has hit an all-time high. And more Americans finish college than ever before. We believed that sensible regulations could prevent another crisis, shield families from ruin, and encourage fair competition. Today, we have new tools to stop taxpayer-funded bailouts, and a new consumer watchdog to protect us from predatory lending and abusive credit card practices. And in the past year alone, about ten million uninsured Americans finally gained the security of health coverage. At every step, we were told our goals were misguided or too ambitious; that we would crush jobs and explode deficits. Instead, we've seen the fastest economic growth in over a decade, our deficits cut by two-thirds, a stock market that has doubled, and health care inflation at its lowest rate in 50 years. So the verdict is clear. Middle-class economics works. Expanding opportunity works. And these policies will continue to work, as long as politics don't get in the way. We can't slow down businesses or put our economy at risk with Government shutdowns or fiscal showdowns. We can't put the security of families at risk by taking away their health insurance, or unraveling the new rules on Wall Street, or refighting past battles on immigration when we've got a system to fix. And if a bill comes to my desk that tries to do any of these things, it will earn my veto. Today, thanks to a growing economy, the recovery is touching more and [[Page S278]] more lives. Wages are finally starting to rise again. We know that more small business owners plan to raise their employees' pay than at any time since 2007. But here's the thing--those of us here tonight, we need to set our sights higher than just making sure Government doesn't halt the progress we're making. We need to do more than just do no harm. Tonight, together, let's do more to restore the link between hard work and growing opportunity for every American. Because families like Rebekah's still need our help. She and Ben are working as hard as ever, but have to forego vacations and a new car so they can pay off student loans and save for retirement. Basic childcare for Jack and Henry costs more than their mortgage, and almost as much as a year at the University of Minnesota. Like millions of hardworking Americans, Rebekah isn't asking for a handout, but she is asking that we look for more ways to help families get ahead. In fact, at every moment of economic change throughout our history, this country has taken bold action to adapt to new circumstances, and to make sure everyone gets a fair shot. We set up worker protections, Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid to protect ourselves from the harshest adversity. We gave our citizens schools and colleges, infrastructure and the internet--tools they needed to go as far as their effort will take them. That's what middle-class economics is--the idea that this country does best when everyone gets their fair shot, everyone does their fair share, and everyone plays by the same set of rules. We don't just want everyone to share in America's success--we want everyone to contribute to our success. So what does middle-class economics require in our time? First--middle-class economics means helping working families feel more secure in a world of constant change. That means helping folks afford childcare, college, health care, a home, retirement--and my budget will address each of these issues, lowering the taxes of working families and putting thousands of dollars back into their pockets each year. Here's one example. During World War II, when men like my grandfather went off to war, having women like my grandmother in the workforce was a national security priority--so this country provided universal childcare. In today's economy, when having both parents in the workforce is an economic necessity for many families, we need affordable, high-quality childcare more than ever. It's not a nice-to- have--it's a must-have. It's time we stop treating childcare as a side issue, or a women's issue, and treat it like the national economic priority that it is for all of us. And that's why my plan will make quality childcare more available, and more affordable, for every middle-class and low-income family with young children in America--by creating more slots and a new tax cut of up to $3,000 per child, per year. Here's another example. Today, we're the only advanced country on Earth that doesn't guarantee paid sick leave or paid maternity leave to our workers. Forty-three million workers have no paid sick leave. Forty-three million. Think about that. And that forces too many parents to make the gut-wrenching choice between a paycheck and a sick kid at home. So I'll be taking new action to help States adopt paid leave laws of their own. And since paid sick leave won where it was on the ballot last November, let's put it to a vote right here in Washington. Send me a bill that gives every worker in America the opportunity to earn seven days of paid sick leave. It's the right thing to do. Of course, nothing helps families make ends meet like higher wages. That's why this Congress still needs to pass a law that makes sure a woman is paid the same as a man for doing the same work. Really. It's 2015. It's time. We still need to make sure employees get the overtime they've earned. And to everyone in this Congress who still refuses to raise the minimum wage, I say this: If you truly believe you could work full-time and support a family on less than $15,000 a year, go try it. If not, vote to give millions of the hardest-working people in America a raise. These ideas won't make everybody rich, or relieve every hardship. That's not the job of Government. To give working families a fair shot, we'll still need more employers to see beyond next quarter's earnings and recognize that investing in their workforce is in their company's long-term interest. We still need laws that strengthen rather than weaken unions, and give American workers a voice. But things like child care and sick leave and equal pay; things like lower mortgage premiums and a higher minimum wage--these ideas will make a meaningful difference in the lives of millions of families. That is a fact. And that's what all of us--Republicans and Democrats alike--were sent here to do. Second, to make sure folks keep earning higher wages down the road, we have to do more to help Americans upgrade their skills. America thrived in the 20th century because we made high school free, sent a generation of GIs to college, and trained the best workforce in the world. But in a 21st century economy that rewards knowledge like never before, we need to do more. By the end of this decade, two in three job openings will require some higher education. Two in three. And yet, we still live in a country where too many bright, striving Americans are priced out of the education they need. It's not fair to them, and it's not smart for our future. That's why I am sending this Congress a bold new plan to lower the cost of community college--to zero. Forty percent of our college students choose community college. Some are young and starting out. Some are older and looking for a better job. Some are veterans and single parents trying to transition back into the job market. Whoever you are, this plan is your chance to graduate ready for the new economy, without a load of debt. Understand, you've got to earn it--you've got to keep your grades up and graduate on time. Tennessee, a state with Republican leadership, and Chicago, a city with Democratic leadership, are showing that free community college is possible. I want to spread that idea all across America, so that 2 years of college becomes as free and universal in America as high school is today. And I want to work with this Congress, to make sure Americans already burdened with student loans can reduce their monthly payments, so that student debt doesn't derail anyone's dreams. Thanks to Vice President Biden's great work to update our job training system, we're connecting community colleges with local employers to train workers to fill high-paying jobs like coding, and nursing, and robotics. Tonight, I'm also asking more businesses to follow the lead of companies like CVS and UPS, and offer more educational benefits and paid apprenticeships--opportunities that give workers the chance to earn higher-paying jobs even if they don't have a higher education. And as a new generation of veterans comes home, we owe them every opportunity to live the American Dream they helped defend. Already, we've made strides towards ensuring that every veteran has access to the highest quality care. We're slashing the backlog that had too many veterans waiting years to get the benefits they need, and we're making it easier for vets to translate their training and experience into civilian jobs. Joining Forces, the national campaign launched by Michelle and Jill Biden, has helped nearly 700,000 veterans and military spouses get new jobs. So to every CEO in America, let me repeat: If you want somebody who's going to get the job done, hire a veteran. Finally, as we better train our workers, we need the new economy to keep churning out high-wage jobs for our workers to fill. Since 2010, America has put more people back to work than Europe, Japan, and all advanced economies combined. Our manufacturers have added almost 800,000 new jobs. Some of our bedrock sectors, like our auto industry, are booming. But there are also millions of Americans who work in jobs that didn't even exist 10 or 20 years ago--jobs at companies like Google, and eBay, and Tesla. So no one knows for certain which industries will generate the jobs of the future. But we do know we want them here in America. That's why the third part of middle-class economics is about [[Page S279]] building the most competitive economy anywhere, the place where businesses want to locate and hire. Twenty-first century businesses need 21st century infrastructure-- modern ports, stronger bridges, faster trains and the fastest internet. Democrats and Republicans used to agree on this. So let's set our sights higher than a single oil pipeline. Let's pass a bipartisan infrastructure plan that could create more than thirty times as many jobs per year, and make this country stronger for decades to come. Twenty-first century businesses, including small businesses, need to sell more American products overseas. Today, our businesses export more than ever, and exporters tend to pay their workers higher wages. But as we speak, China wants to write the rules for the world's fastest- growing region. That would put our workers and businesses at a disadvantage. Why would we let that happen? We should write those rules. We should level the playing field. That's why I'm asking both parties to give me trade promotion authority to protect American workers, with strong new trade deals from Asia to Europe that aren't just free, but fair. Look, I'm the first one to admit that past trade deals haven't always lived up to the hype, and that's why we've gone after countries that break the rules at our expense. But 95 percent of the world's customers live outside our borders, and we can't close ourselves off from those opportunities. More than half of manufacturing executives have said they're actively looking at bringing jobs back from China. Let's give them one more reason to get it done. Twenty-first century businesses will rely on American science, technology, research and development. I want the country that eliminated polio and mapped the human genome to lead a new era of medicine--one that delivers the right treatment at the right time, in some patients with cystic fibrosis, this approach has reversed a disease once thought unstoppable. Tonight, I'm launching a new Precision Medicine Initiative to bring us closer to curing diseases like cancer and diabetes--and to give all of us access to the personalized information we need to keep ourselves and our families healthier. I intend to protect a free and open internet, extend its reach to every classroom, and every community, and help folks build the fastest networks, so that the next generation of digital innovators and entrepreneurs have the platform to keep reshaping our world. I want Americans to win the race for the kinds of discoveries that unleash new jobs--converting sunlight into liquid fuel; creating revolutionary prosthetics, so that a veteran who gave his arms for his country can play catch with his kid; pushing out into the Solar System not just to visit, but to stay. Last month, we launched a new spacecraft as part of a re-energized space program that will send American astronauts to Mars. In two months, to prepare us for those missions, Scott Kelly will begin a year-long stay in space. Good luck, Captain--and make sure to Instagram it. Now, the truth is, when it comes to issues like infrastructure and basic research, I know there's bipartisan support in this chamber. Members of both parties have told me so. Where we too often run onto the rocks is how to pay for these investments. As Americans, we don't mind paying our fair share of taxes, as long as everybody else does, too. But for far too long, lobbyists have rigged the tax code with loopholes that let some corporations pay nothing while others pay full freight. They've riddled it with giveaways the superrich don't need, denying a break to middle class families who do. This year, we have an opportunity to change that. Let's close loopholes so we stop rewarding companies that keep profits abroad, and reward those that invest in America. Let's use those savings to rebuild our infrastructure and make it more attractive for companies to bring jobs home. Let's simplify the system and let a small business owner file based on her actual bank statement, instead of the number of accountants she can afford. And let's close the loopholes that lead to inequality by allowing the top 1 percent to avoid paying taxes on their accumulated wealth. We can use that money to help more families pay for childcare and send their kids to college. We need a tax code that truly helps working Americans trying to get a leg up in the new economy, and we can achieve that together. Helping hardworking families make ends meet. Giving them the tools they need for good-paying jobs in this new economy. Maintaining the conditions for growth and competitiveness. This is where America needs to go. I believe it's where the American people want to go. It will make our economy stronger a year from now, 15 years from now, and deep into the century ahead. Of course, if there's one thing this new century has taught us, it's that we cannot separate our work at home from challenges beyond our shores. My first duty as Commander in Chief is to defend the United States of America. In doing so, the question is not whether America leads in the world, but how. When we make rash decisions, reacting to the headlines instead of using our heads; when the first response to a challenge is to send in our military--then we risk getting drawn into unnecessary conflicts, and neglect the broader strategy we need for a safer, more prosperous world. That's what our enemies want us to do. I believe in a smarter kind of American leadership. We lead best when we combine military power with strong diplomacy; when we leverage our power with coalition building; when we don't let our fears blind us to the opportunities that this new century presents. That's exactly what we're doing right now--and around the globe, it is making a difference. First, we stand united with people around the world who've been targeted by terrorists--from a school in Pakistan to the streets of Paris. We will continue to hunt down terrorists and dismantle their networks, and we reserve the right to act unilaterally, as we've done relentlessly since I took office to take out terrorists who pose a direct threat to us and our allies. At the same time, we've learned some costly lessons over the last 13 years. Instead of Americans patrolling the valleys of Afghanistan, we've trained their security forces, who've now taken the lead, and we've honored our troops' sacrifice by supporting that country's first democratic transition. Instead of sending large ground forces overseas, we're partnering with nations from South Asia to North Africa to deny safe haven to terrorists who threaten America. In Iraq and Syria, American leadership--including our military power--is stopping ISIL's advance. Instead of getting dragged into another ground war in the Middle East, we are leading a broad coalition, including Arab nations, to degrade and ultimately destroy this terrorist group. We're also supporting a moderate opposition in Syria that can help us in this effort, and assisting people everywhere who stand up to the bankrupt ideology of violent extremism. This effort will take time. It will require focus. But we will succeed. And tonight, I call on this Congress to show the world that we are united in this mission by passing a resolution to authorize the use of force against ISIL. Second, we are demonstrating the power of American strength and diplomacy. We're upholding the principle that bigger nations can't bully the small--by opposing Russian aggression, supporting Ukraine's democracy, and reassuring our NATO allies. Last year, as we were doing the hard work of imposing sanctions along with our allies, some suggested that Mr. Putin's aggression was a masterful display of strategy and strength. Well, today, it is America that stands strong and united with our allies, while Russia is isolated, with its economy in tatters. That's how America leads--not with bluster, but with persistent, steady resolve. In Cuba, we are ending a policy that was long past its expiration date. When what you're doing doesn't work for 50 years, it's time to try something new. Our shift in Cuba policy has the potential to end a legacy of mistrust in our hemisphere; removes a phony excuse for restrictions in Cuba; stands up for democratic values; and extends the hand of friendship to the Cuban people. And this year, Congress should begin the work of ending the embargo. As His Holiness, Pope Francis, has said, diplomacy is the work of ``small steps.'' [[Page S280]] These small steps have added up to new hope for the future in Cuba. And after years in prison, we're overjoyed that Alan Gross is back where he belongs. Welcome home, Alan. Our diplomacy is at work with respect to Iran, where, for the first time in a decade, we've halted the progress of its nuclear program and reduced its stockpile of nuclear material. Between now and this spring, we have a chance to negotiate a comprehensive agreement that prevents a nuclear-armed Iran; secures America and our allies--including Israel; while avoiding yet another Middle East conflict. There are no guarantees that negotiations will succeed, and I keep all options on the table to prevent a nuclear Iran. But new sanctions passed by this Congress, at this moment in time, will all but guarantee that diplomacy fails--alienating America from its allies; and ensuring that Iran starts up its nuclear program again. It doesn't make sense. That is why I will veto any new sanctions bill that threatens to undo this progress. The American people expect us to only go to war as a last resort, and I intend to stay true to that wisdom. Third, we're looking beyond the issues that have consumed us in the past to shape the coming century. No foreign nation, no hacker, should be able to shut down our networks, steal our trade secrets, or invade the privacy of American families, especially our kids. We are making sure our Government integrates intelligence to combat cyber threats, just as we have done to combat terrorism. And tonight, I urge this Congress to finally pass the legislation we need to better meet the evolving threat of cyber- attacks, combat identity theft, and protect our children's information. If we don't act, we'll leave our Nation and our economy vulnerable. If we do, we can continue to protect the technologies that have unleashed untold opportunities for people around the globe. In West Africa, our troops, our scientists, our doctors, our nurses and healthcare workers are rolling back Ebola--saving countless lives and stopping the spread of disease. I couldn't be prouder of them, and I thank this Congress for your bipartisan support of their efforts. But the job is not yet done--and the world needs to use this lesson to build a more effective global effort to prevent the spread of future pandemics, invest in smart development, and eradicate extreme poverty. In the Asia Pacific, we are modernizing alliances while making sure that other nations play by the rules--in how they trade, how they resolve maritime disputes, and how they participate in meeting common international challenges like nonproliferation and disaster relief. And no challenge--no challenge--poses a greater threat to future generations than climate change. 2014 was the planet's warmest year on record. Now, one year doesn't make a trend, but this does--14 of the 15 warmest years on record have all fallen in the first 15 years of this century. I've heard some folks try to dodge the evidence by saying they're not scientists; that we don't have enough information to act. Well, I'm not a scientist, either. But you know what--I know a lot of really good scientists at NASA, and NOAA, and at our major universities. The best scientists in the world are all telling us that our activities are changing the climate, and if we do not act forcefully, we'll continue to see rising oceans, longer, hotter heat waves, dangerous droughts and floods, and massive disruptions that can trigger greater migration, conflict, and hunger around the globe. The Pentagon says that climate change poses immediate risks to our national security. We should act like it. That's why, over the past 6 years, we've done more than ever before to combat climate change, from the way we produce energy, to the way we use it. That's why we've set aside more public lands and waters than any administration in history. And that's why I will not let this Congress endanger the health of our children by turning back the clock on our efforts. I am determined to make sure American leadership drives international action. In Beijing, we made an historic announcement--the United States will double the pace at which we cut carbon pollution, and China committed, for the first time, to limiting their emissions. And because the world's two largest economies came together, other nations are now stepping up, and offering hope that, this year, the world will finally reach an agreement to protect the one planet we've got. There's one last pillar to our leadership--and that's the example of our values. As Americans, we respect human dignity, even when we're threatened, which is why I've prohibited torture, and worked to make sure our use of new technology like drones is properly constrained. It's why we speak out against the deplorable anti-Semitism that has resurfaced in certain parts of the world. It's why we continue to reject offensive stereotypes of Muslims--the vast majority of whom share our commitment to peace. That's why we defend free speech, and advocate for political prisoners, and condemn the persecution of women, or religious minorities, or people who are lesbian, gay, bisexual, or transgender. We do these things not only because they're right, but because they make us safer. As Americans, we have a profound commitment to justice--so it makes no sense to spend three million dollars per prisoner to keep open a prison that the world condemns and terrorists use to recruit. Since I've been President, we've worked responsibly to cut the population of GTMO in half. Now it's time to finish the job. And I will not relent in my determination to shut it down. It's not who we are. As Americans, we cherish our civil liberties--and we need to uphold that commitment if we want maximum cooperation from other countries and industry in our fight against terrorist networks. So while some have moved on from the debates over our surveillance programs, I haven't. As promised, our intelligence agencies have worked hard, with the recommendations of privacy advocates, to increase transparency and build more safeguards against potential abuse. And next month, we'll issue a report on how we're keeping our promise to keep our country safe while strengthening privacy. Looking to the future instead of the past. Making sure we match our power with diplomacy, and use force wisely. Building coalitions to meet new challenges and opportunities. Leading--always--with the example of our values. That's what makes us exceptional. That's what keeps us strong. And that's why we must keep striving to hold ourselves to the highest of standards--our own. You know, just over a decade ago, I gave a speech in Boston where I said there wasn't a liberal America, or a conservative America; a black America or a white America--but a United States of America. I said this because I had seen it in my own life, in a nation that gave someone like me a chance; because I grew up in Hawaii, a melting pot of races and customs; because I made Illinois my home--a state of small towns, rich farmland, and one of the world's great cities; a microcosm of the country where Democrats and Republicans and Independents, good people of every ethnicity and every faith, share certain bedrock values. Over the past 6 years, the pundits have pointed out more than once that my presidency hasn't delivered on this vision. How ironic, they say, that our politics seems more divided than ever. It's held up as proof not just of my own flaws--of which there are many--but also as proof that the vision itself is misguided, and naive, and that there are too many people in this town who actually benefit from partisanship and gridlock for us to ever do anything about it. I know how tempting such cynicism may be. But I still think the cynics are wrong. I still believe that we are one people. I still believe that together, we can do great things, even when the odds are long. I believe this because over and over in my 6 years in office, I have seen America at its best. I've seen the hopeful faces of young graduates from New York to California; and our newest officers at West Point, Annapolis, Colorado Springs, and New London. I've mourned with grieving families in Tucson and Newtown; in Boston, West, Texas, and West Virginia. I've watched Americans beat back adversity from the Gulf Coast to the Great Plains; from Midwest assembly lines to the Mid- Atlantic seaboard. I've seen something like gay marriage go from a wedge issue used to drive us apart to a [[Page S281]] story of freedom across our country, a civil right now legal in States that seven in ten Americans call home. So I know the good, and optimistic, and big-hearted generosity of the American people who, every day, live the idea that we are our brother's keeper, and our sister's keeper. And I know they expect those of us who serve here to set a better example. So the question for those of us here tonight is how we, all of us, can better reflect America's hopes. I've served in Congress with many of you. I know many of you well. There are a lot of good people here, on both sides of the aisle. And many of you have told me that this isn't what you signed up for--arguing past each other on cable shows, the constant fundraising, always looking over your shoulder at how the base will react to every decision. Imagine if we broke out of these tired old patterns. Imagine if we did something different. Understand--a better politics isn't one where Democrats abandon their agenda or Republicans simply embrace mine. A better politics is one where we appeal to each other's basic decency instead of our basest fears. A better politics is one where we debate without demonizing each other; where we talk issues, and values, and principles, and facts, rather than ``gotcha'' moments, or trivial gaffes, or fake controversies that have nothing to do with people's daily lives. A better politics is one where we spend less time drowning in dark money for ads that pull us into the gutter, and spend more time lifting young people up, with a sense of purpose and possibility, and asking them to join in the great mission of building America. If we're going to have arguments, let's have arguments--but let's make them debates worthy of this body and worthy of this country. We still may not agree on a woman's right to choose, but surely we can agree it's a good thing that teen pregnancies and abortions are nearing all-time lows, and that every woman should have access to the health care she needs. Yes, passions still fly on immigration, but surely we can all see something of ourselves in the striving young student, and agree that no one benefits when a hardworking mom is taken from her child, and that it's possible to shape a law that upholds our tradition as a nation of laws and a nation of immigrants. We may go at it in campaign season, but surely we can agree that the right to vote is sacred; that it's being denied to too many; and that, on this 50th anniversary of the great march from Selma to Montgomery and the passage of the Voting Rights Act, we can come together, Democrats and Republicans, to make voting easier for every single American. We may have different takes on the events of Ferguson and New York. But surely we can understand a father who fears his son can't walk home without being harassed. Surely we can understand the wife who won't rest until the police officer she married walks through the front door at the end of his shift. Surely we can agree it's a good thing that for the first time in 40 years, the crime rate and the incarceration rate have come down together, and use that as a starting point for Democrats and Republicans, community leaders and law enforcement, to reform America's criminal justice system so that it protects and serves us all. That's a better politics. That's how we start rebuilding trust. That's how we move this country forward. That's what the American people want. That's what they deserve. I have no more campaigns to run. My only agenda for the next 2 years is the same as the one I've had since the day I swore an oath on the steps of this Capitol--to do what I believe is best for America. If you share the broad vision I outlined tonight, join me in the work at hand. If you disagree with parts of it, I hope you'll at least work with me where you do agree. And I commit to every Republican here tonight that I will not only seek out your ideas, I will seek to work with you to make this country stronger. Because I want this chamber, this city, to reflect the truth--that for all our blind spots and shortcomings, we are a people with the strength and generosity of spirit to bridge divides, to unite in common effort, and help our neighbors, whether down the street or on the other side of the world. I want our actions to tell every child, in every neighborhood: your life matters, and we are as committed to improving your life chances as we are for our own kids. I want future generations to know that we are a people who see our differences as a great gift, that we are a people who value the dignity and worth of every citizen--man and woman, young and old, black and white, Latino and Asian, immigrant and Native American, gay and straight, Americans with mental illness or physical disability. I want them to grow up in a country that shows the world what we still know to be true: that we are still more than a collection of red States and blue States; that we are the United States of America. I want them to grow up in a country where a young mom like Rebekah can sit down and write a letter to her President with a story to sum up these past 6 years: ``It is amazing what you can bounce back from when you have to . . . we are a strong, tight-knit family who has made it through some very, very hard times.'' My fellow Americans, we too are a strong, tight-knit family. We, too, have made it through some hard times. Fifteen years into this new century, we have picked ourselves up, dusted ourselves off, and begun again the work of remaking America. We've laid a new foundation. A brighter future is ours to write. Let's begin this new chapter-- together--and let's start the work right now. Thank you, God bless you, and God bless this country we love. Barack Obama. The White House, January 20, 2015. ____________________",package_114_126.csv,37992,37992,38061,"[congressional record volume 161, number 9 (tuesday, january 20, 2015)] [senate] [pages s277-s281] from the congressional record online through the government publishing office [ www.gpo.gov ] report on the state of the union delivered to a joint session of congress on january 20, 2015--pm 1 the presiding officer laid before the senate the following message from the president of the united states which was ordered to lie on the table: to the congress of the united states: mr. speaker, mr. vice president, members of congress, my fellow americans: we are 15 years into this new century. fifteen years that dawned with terror touching our shores; that unfolded with a new generation fighting two long and costly wars; that saw a vicious recession spread across our nation and the world. it has been, and still is, a hard time for many. but tonight, we turn the page. tonight, after a breakthrough year for america, our economy is growing and creating jobs at the fastest pace since 1999. our unemployment rate is now lower than it was before the financial crisis. more of our kids are graduating than ever before; more of our people are insured than ever before; we are as free from the grip of foreign oil as we've been in almost 30 years. tonight, for the first time since 9/11, our combat mission in afghanistan is over. six years ago, nearly 180,000 american troops served in iraq and afghanistan. today, fewer than 15,000 remain. and we salute the courage and sacrifice of every man and woman in this 9/11 generation who has served to keep us safe. we are humbled and grateful for your service. america, for all that we've endured; for all the grit and hard work required to come back; for all the tasks that lie ahead, know this: the shadow of crisis has passed, and the state of the union is strong. at this moment--with a growing economy, shrinking deficits, bustling industry, and booming energy production--we have risen from recession freer to write our own future than any other nation on earth. it's now up to us to choose who we want to be over the next 15 years, and for decades to come. will we accept an economy where only a few of us do spectacularly well? or will we commit ourselves to an economy that generates rising incomes and chances for everyone who makes the effort? will we approach the world fearful and reactive, dragged into costly conflicts that strain our military and set back our standing? or will we lead wisely, using all elements of our power to defeat new threats and protect our planet? will we allow ourselves to be sorted into factions and turned against one another--or will we recapture the sense of common purpose that has always propelled america forward? in two weeks, i will send this congress a budget filled with ideas that are practical, not partisan. and in the months ahead, i'll crisscross the country making a case for those ideas. so tonight, i want to focus less on a checklist of proposals, and focus more on the values at stake in the choices before us. it begins with our economy. seven years ago, rebekah and ben erler of minneapolis were newlyweds. she waited tables. he worked construction. their first child, jack, was on the way. they were young and in love in america, and it doesn't get much better than that. ``if only we had known,'' rebekah wrote to me last spring, ``what was about to happen to the housing and construction market.'' as the crisis worsened, ben's business dried up, so he took what jobs he could find, even if they kept him on the road for long stretches of time. rebekah took out student loans, enrolled in community college, and retrained for a new career. they sacrificed for each other. and slowly, it paid off. they bought their first home. they had a second son, henry. rebekah got a better job, and then a raise. ben is back in construction--and home for dinner every night. ``it is amazing,'' rebekah wrote, ``what you can bounce back from when you have to . . . we are a strong, tight-knit family who has made it through some very, very hard times.'' we are a strong, tight-knit family who has made it through some very, very hard times. america, rebekah and ben's story is our story. they represent the millions who have worked hard, and scrimped, and sacrificed, and retooled. you are the reason i ran for this office. you're the people i was thinking of 6 years ago today, in the darkest months of the crisis, when i stood on the steps of this capitol and promised we would rebuild our economy on a new foundation. and it's been your effort and resilience that has made it possible for our country to emerge stronger. we believed we could reverse the tide of outsourcing, and draw new jobs to our shores. and over the past 5 years, our businesses have created more than 11 million new jobs. we believed we could reduce our dependence on foreign oil and protect our planet. and today, america is number one in oil and gas. america is number one in wind power. every three weeks, we bring online as much solar power as we did in all of 2008. and thanks to lower gas prices and higher fuel standards, the typical family this year should save $750 at the pump. we believed we could prepare our kids for a more competitive world. and today, our younger students have earned the highest math and reading scores on record. our high school graduation rate has hit an all-time high. and more americans finish college than ever before. we believed that sensible regulations could prevent another crisis, shield families from ruin, and encourage fair competition. today, we have new tools to stop taxpayer-funded bailouts, and a new consumer watchdog to protect us from predatory lending and abusive credit card practices. and in the past year alone, about ten million uninsured americans finally gained the security of health coverage. at every step, we were told our goals were misguided or too ambitious; that we would crush jobs and explode deficits. instead, we've seen the fastest economic growth in over a decade, our deficits cut by two-thirds, a stock market that has doubled, and health care inflation at its lowest rate in 50 years. so the verdict is clear. middle-class economics works. expanding opportunity works. and these policies will continue to work, as long as politics don't get in the way. we can't slow down businesses or put our economy at risk with government shutdowns or fiscal showdowns. we can't put the security of families at risk by taking away their health insurance, or unraveling the new rules on wall street, or refighting past battles on immigration when we've got a system to fix. and if a bill comes to my desk that tries to do any of these things, it will earn my veto. today, thanks to a growing economy, the recovery is touching more and [[page s278]] more lives. wages are finally starting to rise again. we know that more small business owners plan to raise their employees' pay than at any time since 2007. but here's the thing--those of us here tonight, we need to set our sights higher than just making sure government doesn't halt the progress we're making. we need to do more than just do no harm. tonight, together, let's do more to restore the link between hard work and growing opportunity for every american. because families like rebekah's still need our help. she and ben are working as hard as ever, but have to forego vacations and a new car so they can pay off student loans and save for retirement. basic childcare for jack and henry costs more than their mortgage, and almost as much as a year at the university of minnesota. like millions of hardworking americans, rebekah isn't asking for a handout, but she is asking that we look for more ways to help families get ahead. in fact, at every moment of economic change throughout our history, this country has taken bold action to adapt to new circumstances, and to make sure everyone gets a fair shot. we set up worker protections, social security, medicare, and medicaid to protect ourselves from the harshest adversity. we gave our citizens schools and colleges, infrastructure and the internet--tools they needed to go as far as their effort will take them. that's what middle-class economics is--the idea that this country does best when everyone gets their fair shot, everyone does their fair share, and everyone plays by the same set of rules. we don't just want everyone to share in america's success--we want everyone to contribute to our success. so what does middle-class economics require in our time? first--middle-class economics means helping working families feel more secure in a world of constant change. that means helping folks afford childcare, college, health care, a home, retirement--and my budget will address each of these issues, lowering the taxes of working families and putting thousands of dollars back into their pockets each year. here's one example. during world war ii, when men like my grandfather went off to war, having women like my grandmother in the workforce was a national security priority--so this country provided universal childcare. in today's economy, when having both parents in the workforce is an economic necessity for many families, we need affordable, high-quality childcare more than ever. it's not a nice-to- have--it's a must-have. it's time we stop treating childcare as a side issue, or a women's issue, and treat it like the national economic priority that it is for all of us. and that's why my plan will make quality childcare more available, and more affordable, for every middle-class and low-income family with young children in america--by creating more slots and a new tax cut of up to $3,000 per child, per year. here's another example. today, we're the only advanced country on earth that doesn't guarantee paid sick leave or paid maternity leave to our workers. forty-three million workers have no paid sick leave. forty-three million. think about that. and that forces too many parents to make the gut-wrenching choice between a paycheck and a sick kid at home. so i'll be taking new action to help states adopt paid leave laws of their own. and since paid sick leave won where it was on the ballot last november, let's put it to a vote right here in washington. send me a bill that gives every worker in america the opportunity to earn seven days of paid sick leave. it's the right thing to do. of course, nothing helps families make ends meet like higher wages. that's why this congress still needs to pass a law that makes sure a woman is paid the same as a man for doing the same work. really. it's 2015. it's time. we still need to make sure employees get the overtime they've earned. and to everyone in this congress who still refuses to raise the minimum wage, i say this: if you truly believe you could work full-time and support a family on less than $15,000 a year, go try it. if not, vote to give millions of the hardest-working people in america a raise. these ideas won't make everybody rich, or relieve every hardship. that's not the job of government. to give working families a fair shot, we'll still need more employers to see beyond next quarter's earnings and recognize that investing in their workforce is in their company's long-term interest. we still need laws that strengthen rather than weaken unions, and give american workers a voice. but things like child care and sick leave and equal pay; things like lower mortgage premiums and a higher minimum wage--these ideas will make a meaningful difference in the lives of millions of families. that is a fact. and that's what all of us--republicans and democrats alike--were sent here to do. second, to make sure folks keep earning higher wages down the road, we have to do more to help americans upgrade their skills. america thrived in the 20th century because we made high school free, sent a generation of gis to college, and trained the best workforce in the world. but in a 21st century economy that rewards knowledge like never before, we need to do more. by the end of this decade, two in three job openings will require some higher education. two in three. and yet, we still live in a country where too many bright, striving americans are priced out of the education they need. it's not fair to them, and it's not smart for our future. that's why i am sending this congress a bold new plan to lower the cost of community college--to zero. forty percent of our college students choose community college. some are young and starting out. some are older and looking for a better job. some are veterans and single parents trying to transition back into the job market. whoever you are, this plan is your chance to graduate ready for the new economy, without a load of debt. understand, you've got to earn it--you've got to keep your grades up and graduate on time. tennessee, a state with republican leadership, and chicago, a city with democratic leadership, are showing that free community college is possible. i want to spread that idea all across america, so that 2 years of college becomes as free and universal in america as high school is today. and i want to work with this congress, to make sure americans already burdened with student loans can reduce their monthly payments, so that student debt doesn't derail anyone's dreams. thanks to vice president biden's great work to update our job training system, we're connecting community colleges with local employers to train workers to fill high-paying jobs like coding, and nursing, and robotics. tonight, i'm also asking more businesses to follow the lead of companies like cvs and ups, and offer more educational benefits and paid apprenticeships--opportunities that give workers the chance to earn higher-paying jobs even if they don't have a higher education. and as a new generation of veterans comes home, we owe them every opportunity to live the american dream they helped defend. already, we've made strides towards ensuring that every veteran has access to the highest quality care. we're slashing the backlog that had too many veterans waiting years to get the benefits they need, and we're making it easier for vets to translate their training and experience into civilian jobs. joining forces, the national campaign launched by michelle and jill biden, has helped nearly 700,000 veterans and military spouses get new jobs. so to every ceo in america, let me repeat: if you want somebody who's going to get the job done, hire a veteran. finally, as we better train our workers, we need the new economy to keep churning out high-wage jobs for our workers to fill. since 2010, america has put more people back to work than europe, japan, and all advanced economies combined. our manufacturers have added almost 800,000 new jobs. some of our bedrock sectors, like our auto industry, are booming. but there are also millions of americans who work in jobs that didn't even exist 10 or 20 years ago--jobs at companies like google, and ebay, and tesla. so no one knows for certain which industries will generate the jobs of the future. but we do know we want them here in america. that's why the third part of middle-class economics is about [[page s279]] building the most competitive economy anywhere, the place where businesses want to locate and hire. twenty-first century businesses need 21st century infrastructure-- modern ports, stronger bridges, faster trains and the fastest internet. democrats and republicans used to agree on this. so let's set our sights higher than a single oil pipeline. let's pass a bipartisan infrastructure plan that could create more than thirty times as many jobs per year, and make this country stronger for decades to come. twenty-first century businesses, including small businesses, need to sell more american products overseas. today, our businesses export more than ever, and exporters tend to pay their workers higher wages. but as we speak, china wants to write the rules for the world's fastest- growing region. that would put our workers and businesses at a disadvantage. why would we let that happen? we should write those rules. we should level the playing field. that's why i'm asking both parties to give me trade promotion authority to protect american workers, with strong new trade deals from asia to europe that aren't just free, but fair. look, i'm the first one to admit that past trade deals haven't always lived up to the hype, and that's why we've gone after countries that break the rules at our expense. but 95 percent of the world's customers live outside our borders, and we can't close ourselves off from those opportunities. more than half of manufacturing executives have said they're actively looking at bringing jobs back from china. let's give them one more reason to get it done. twenty-first century businesses will rely on american science, technology, research and development. i want the country that eliminated polio and mapped the human genome to lead a new era of medicine--one that delivers the right treatment at the right time, in some patients with cystic fibrosis, this approach has reversed a disease once thought unstoppable. tonight, i'm launching a new precision medicine initiative to bring us closer to curing diseases like cancer and diabetes--and to give all of us access to the personalized information we need to keep ourselves and our families healthier. i intend to protect a free and open internet, extend its reach to every classroom, and every community, and help folks build the fastest networks, so that the next generation of digital innovators and entrepreneurs have the platform to keep reshaping our world. i want americans to win the race for the kinds of discoveries that unleash new jobs--converting sunlight into liquid fuel; creating revolutionary prosthetics, so that a veteran who gave his arms for his country can play catch with his kid; pushing out into the solar system not just to visit, but to stay. last month, we launched a new spacecraft as part of a re-energized space program that will send american astronauts to mars. in two months, to prepare us for those missions, scott kelly will begin a year-long stay in space. good luck, captain--and make sure to instagram it. now, the truth is, when it comes to issues like infrastructure and basic research, i know there's bipartisan support in this chamber. members of both parties have told me so. where we too often run onto the rocks is how to pay for these investments. as americans, we don't mind paying our fair share of taxes, as long as everybody else does, too. but for far too long, lobbyists have rigged the tax code with loopholes that let some corporations pay nothing while others pay full freight. they've riddled it with giveaways the superrich don't need, denying a break to middle class families who do. this year, we have an opportunity to change that. let's close loopholes so we stop rewarding companies that keep profits abroad, and reward those that invest in america. let's use those savings to rebuild our infrastructure and make it more attractive for companies to bring jobs home. let's simplify the system and let a small business owner file based on her actual bank statement, instead of the number of accountants she can afford. and let's close the loopholes that lead to inequality by allowing the top 1 percent to avoid paying taxes on their accumulated wealth. we can use that money to help more families pay for childcare and send their kids to college. we need a tax code that truly helps working americans trying to get a leg up in the new economy, and we can achieve that together. helping hardworking families make ends meet. giving them the tools they need for good-paying jobs in this new economy. maintaining the conditions for growth and competitiveness. this is where america needs to go. i believe it's where the american people want to go. it will make our economy stronger a year from now, 15 years from now, and deep into the century ahead. of course, if there's one thing this new century has taught us, it's that we cannot separate our work at home from challenges beyond our shores. my first duty as commander in chief is to defend the united states of america. in doing so, the question is not whether america leads in the world, but how. when we make rash decisions, reacting to the headlines instead of using our heads; when the first response to a challenge is to send in our military--then we risk getting drawn into unnecessary conflicts, and neglect the broader strategy we need for a safer, more prosperous world. that's what our enemies want us to do. i believe in a smarter kind of american leadership. we lead best when we combine military power with strong diplomacy; when we leverage our power with coalition building; when we don't let our fears blind us to the opportunities that this new century presents. that's exactly what we're doing right now--and around the globe, it is making a difference. first, we stand united with people around the world who've been targeted by terrorists--from a school in pakistan to the streets of paris. we will continue to hunt down terrorists and dismantle their networks, and we reserve the right to act unilaterally, as we've done relentlessly since i took office to take out terrorists who pose a direct threat to us and our allies. at the same time, we've learned some costly lessons over the last 13 years. instead of americans patrolling the valleys of afghanistan, we've trained their security forces, who've now taken the lead, and we've honored our troops' sacrifice by supporting that country's first democratic transition. instead of sending large ground forces overseas, we're partnering with nations from south asia to north africa to deny safe haven to terrorists who threaten america. in iraq and syria, american leadership--including our military power--is stopping isil's advance. instead of getting dragged into another ground war in the middle east, we are leading a broad coalition, including arab nations, to degrade and ultimately destroy this terrorist group. we're also supporting a moderate opposition in syria that can help us in this effort, and assisting people everywhere who stand up to the bankrupt ideology of violent extremism. this effort will take time. it will require focus. but we will succeed. and tonight, i call on this congress to show the world that we are united in this mission by passing a resolution to authorize the use of force against isil. second, we are demonstrating the power of american strength and diplomacy. we're upholding the principle that bigger nations can't bully the small--by opposing russian aggression, supporting ukraine's democracy, and reassuring our nato allies. last year, as we were doing the hard work of imposing sanctions along with our allies, some suggested that mr. putin's aggression was a masterful display of strategy and strength. well, today, it is america that stands strong and united with our allies, while russia is isolated, with its economy in tatters. that's how america leads--not with bluster, but with persistent, steady resolve. in cuba, we are ending a policy that was long past its expiration date. when what you're doing doesn't work for 50 years, it's time to try something new. our shift in cuba policy has the potential to end a legacy of mistrust in our hemisphere; removes a phony excuse for restrictions in cuba; stands up for democratic values; and extends the hand of friendship to the cuban people. and this year, congress should begin the work of ending the embargo. as his holiness, pope francis, has said, diplomacy is the work of ``small steps.'' [[page s280]] these small steps have added up to new hope for the future in cuba. and after years in prison, we're overjoyed that alan gross is back where he belongs. welcome home, alan. our diplomacy is at work with respect to iran, where, for the first time in a decade, we've halted the progress of its nuclear program and reduced its stockpile of nuclear material. between now and this spring, we have a chance to negotiate a comprehensive agreement that prevents a nuclear-armed iran; secures america and our allies--including israel; while avoiding yet another middle east conflict. there are no guarantees that negotiations will succeed, and i keep all options on the table to prevent a nuclear iran. but new sanctions passed by this congress, at this moment in time, will all but guarantee that diplomacy fails--alienating america from its allies; and ensuring that iran starts up its nuclear program again. it doesn't make sense. that is why i will veto any new sanctions bill that threatens to undo this progress. the american people expect us to only go to war as a last resort, and i intend to stay true to that wisdom. third, we're looking beyond the issues that have consumed us in the past to shape the coming century. no foreign nation, no hacker, should be able to shut down our networks, steal our trade secrets, or invade the privacy of american families, especially our kids. we are making sure our government integrates intelligence to combat cyber threats, just as we have done to combat terrorism. and tonight, i urge this congress to finally pass the legislation we need to better meet the evolving threat of cyber- attacks, combat identity theft, and protect our children's information. if we don't act, we'll leave our nation and our economy vulnerable. if we do, we can continue to protect the technologies that have unleashed untold opportunities for people around the globe. in west africa, our troops, our scientists, our doctors, our nurses and healthcare workers are rolling back ebola--saving countless lives and stopping the spread of disease. i couldn't be prouder of them, and i thank this congress for your bipartisan support of their efforts. but the job is not yet done--and the world needs to use this lesson to build a more effective global effort to prevent the spread of future pandemics, invest in smart development, and eradicate extreme poverty. in the asia pacific, we are modernizing alliances while making sure that other nations play by the rules--in how they trade, how they resolve maritime disputes, and how they participate in meeting common international challenges like nonproliferation and disaster relief. and no challenge--no challenge--poses a greater threat to future generations than climate change. 2014 was the planet's warmest year on record. now, one year doesn't make a trend, but this does--14 of the 15 warmest years on record have all fallen in the first 15 years of this century. i've heard some folks try to dodge the evidence by saying they're not scientists; that we don't have enough information to act. well, i'm not a scientist, either. but you know what--i know a lot of really good scientists at nasa, and noaa, and at our major universities. the best scientists in the world are all telling us that our activities are changing the climate, and if we do not act forcefully, we'll continue to see rising oceans, longer, hotter heat waves, dangerous droughts and floods, and massive disruptions that can trigger greater migration, conflict, and hunger around the globe. the pentagon says that climate change poses immediate risks to our national security. we should act like it. that's why, over the past 6 years, we've done more than ever before to combat climate change, from the way we produce energy, to the way we use it. that's why we've set aside more public lands and waters than any administration in history. and that's why i will not let this congress endanger the health of our children by turning back the clock on our efforts. i am determined to make sure american leadership drives international action. in beijing, we made an historic announcement--the united states will double the pace at which we cut carbon pollution, and china committed, for the first time, to limiting their emissions. and because the world's two largest economies came together, other nations are now stepping up, and offering hope that, this year, the world will finally reach an agreement to protect the one planet we've got. there's one last pillar to our leadership--and that's the example of our values. as americans, we respect human dignity, even when we're threatened, which is why i've prohibited torture, and worked to make sure our use of new technology like drones is properly constrained. it's why we speak out against the deplorable anti-semitism that has resurfaced in certain parts of the world. it's why we continue to reject offensive stereotypes of muslims--the vast majority of whom share our commitment to peace. that's why we defend free speech, and advocate for political prisoners, and condemn the persecution of women, or religious minorities, or people who are lesbian, gay, bisexual, or transgender. we do these things not only because they're right, but because they make us safer. as americans, we have a profound commitment to justice--so it makes no sense to spend three million dollars per prisoner to keep open a prison that the world condemns and terrorists use to recruit. since i've been president, we've worked responsibly to cut the population of gtmo in half. now it's time to finish the job. and i will not relent in my determination to shut it down. it's not who we are. as americans, we cherish our civil liberties--and we need to uphold that commitment if we want maximum cooperation from other countries and industry in our fight against terrorist networks. so while some have moved on from the debates over our surveillance programs, i haven't. as promised, our intelligence agencies have worked hard, with the recommendations of privacy advocates, to increase transparency and build more safeguards against potential abuse. and next month, we'll issue a report on how we're keeping our promise to keep our country safe while strengthening privacy. looking to the future instead of the past. making sure we match our power with diplomacy, and use force wisely. building coalitions to meet new challenges and opportunities. leading--always--with the example of our values. that's what makes us exceptional. that's what keeps us strong. and that's why we must keep striving to hold ourselves to the highest of standards--our own. you know, just over a decade ago, i gave a speech in boston where i said there wasn't a liberal america, or a conservative america; a black america or a white america--but a united states of america. i said this because i had seen it in my own life, in a nation that gave someone like me a chance; because i grew up in hawaii, a melting pot of races and customs; because i made illinois my home--a state of small towns, rich farmland, and one of the world's great cities; a microcosm of the country where democrats and republicans and independents, good people of every ethnicity and every faith, share certain bedrock values. over the past 6 years, the pundits have pointed out more than once that my presidency hasn't delivered on this vision. how ironic, they say, that our politics seems more divided than ever. it's held up as proof not just of my own flaws--of which there are many--but also as proof that the vision itself is misguided, and naive, and that there are too many people in this town who actually benefit from partisanship and gridlock for us to ever do anything about it. i know how tempting such cynicism may be. but i still think the cynics are wrong. i still believe that we are one people. i still believe that together, we can do great things, even when the odds are long. i believe this because over and over in my 6 years in office, i have seen america at its best. i've seen the hopeful faces of young graduates from new york to california; and our newest officers at west point, annapolis, colorado springs, and new london. i've mourned with grieving families in tucson and newtown; in boston, west, texas, and west virginia. i've watched americans beat back adversity from the gulf coast to the great plains; from midwest assembly lines to the mid- atlantic seaboard. i've seen something like gay marriage go from a wedge issue used to drive us apart to a [[page s281]] story of freedom across our country, a civil right now legal in states that seven in ten americans call home. so i know the good, and optimistic, and big-hearted generosity of the american people who, every day, live the idea that we are our brother's keeper, and our sister's keeper. and i know they expect those of us who serve here to set a better example. so the question for those of us here tonight is how we, all of us, can better reflect america's hopes. i've served in congress with many of you. i know many of you well. there are a lot of good people here, on both sides of the aisle. and many of you have told me that this isn't what you signed up for--arguing past each other on cable shows, the constant fundraising, always looking over your shoulder at how the base will react to every decision. imagine if we broke out of these tired old patterns. imagine if we did something different. understand--a better politics isn't one where democrats abandon their agenda or republicans simply embrace mine. a better politics is one where we appeal to each other's basic decency instead of our basest fears. a better politics is one where we debate without demonizing each other; where we talk issues, and values, and principles, and facts, rather than ``gotcha'' moments, or trivial gaffes, or fake controversies that have nothing to do with people's daily lives. a better politics is one where we spend less time drowning in dark money for ads that pull us into the gutter, and spend more time lifting young people up, with a sense of purpose and possibility, and asking them to join in the great mission of building america. if we're going to have arguments, let's have arguments--but let's make them debates worthy of this body and worthy of this country. we still may not agree on a woman's right to choose, but surely we can agree it's a good thing that teen pregnancies and abortions are nearing all-time lows, and that every woman should have access to the health care she needs. yes, passions still fly on immigration, but surely we can all see something of ourselves in the striving young student, and agree that no one benefits when a hardworking mom is taken from her child, and that it's possible to shape a law that upholds our tradition as a nation of laws and a nation of immigrants. we may go at it in campaign season, but surely we can agree that the right to vote is sacred; that it's being denied to too many; and that, on this 50th anniversary of the great march from selma to montgomery and the passage of the voting rights act, we can come together, democrats and republicans, to make voting easier for every single american. we may have different takes on the events of ferguson and new york. but surely we can understand a father who fears his son can't walk home without being harassed. surely we can understand the wife who won't rest until the police officer she married walks through the front door at the end of his shift. surely we can agree it's a good thing that for the first time in 40 years, the crime rate and the incarceration rate have come down together, and use that as a starting point for democrats and republicans, community leaders and law enforcement, to reform america's criminal justice system so that it protects and serves us all. that's a better politics. that's how we start rebuilding trust. that's how we move this country forward. that's what the american people want. that's what they deserve. i have no more campaigns to run. my only agenda for the next 2 years is the same as the one i've had since the day i swore an oath on the steps of this capitol--to do what i believe is best for america. if you share the broad vision i outlined tonight, join me in the work at hand. if you disagree with parts of it, i hope you'll at least work with me where you do agree. and i commit to every republican here tonight that i will not only seek out your ideas, i will seek to work with you to make this country stronger. because i want this chamber, this city, to reflect the truth--that for all our blind spots and shortcomings, we are a people with the strength and generosity of spirit to bridge divides, to unite in common effort, and help our neighbors, whether down the street or on the other side of the world. i want our actions to tell every child, in every neighborhood: your life matters, and we are as committed to improving your life chances as we are for our own kids. i want future generations to know that we are a people who see our differences as a great gift, that we are a people who value the dignity and worth of every citizen--man and woman, young and old, black and white, latino and asian, immigrant and native american, gay and straight, americans with mental illness or physical disability. i want them to grow up in a country that shows the world what we still know to be true: that we are still more than a collection of red states and blue states; that we are the united states of america. i want them to grow up in a country where a young mom like rebekah can sit down and write a letter to her president with a story to sum up these past 6 years: ``it is amazing what you can bounce back from when you have to . . . we are a strong, tight-knit family who has made it through some very, very hard times.'' my fellow americans, we too are a strong, tight-knit family. we, too, have made it through some hard times. fifteen years into this new century, we have picked ourselves up, dusted ourselves off, and begun again the work of remaking america. we've laid a new foundation. a brighter future is ours to write. let's begin this new chapter-- together--and let's start the work right now. thank you, god bless you, and god bless this country we love. barack obama. the white house, january 20, 2015. ____________________",37992

CREC-2015-01-20-pt1-PgS284-2,CREC-2015-01-20,114,Introductory Statement on S. 194,"[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 9 (Tuesday, January 20, 2015)] [Senate] [Pages S284-S285] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] By Mr. GRASSLEY (for himself and Mr. Franken): S. 194. A bill to amend title 11 of the United States Code to clarify the rule allowing discharge as a nonpriority claim of governmental claims arising from the disposition of farm assets under chapter 12 bankruptcies; to the Committee on the Judiciary. Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce, along with Senator Franken, the Family Farmer Bankruptcy Clarification Act of 2015. I thank Senator Franken for his work on this bill and for his support. We introduced identical legislation in the 113th Congress and similar legislation in the 112 Congress. Unfortunately, the Senate has never had the opportunity to consider these bills and the problem we seek to correct. This bipartisan bill addresses the 2012 United States Supreme Court case Hall v. United States. In a 5-4 decision, the Supreme Court ruled that a provision I inserted into the 2005 Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act didn't accomplish what we in Congress intended. The Family Farmer Bankruptcy Clarification Act of 2015 corrects this and clarifies that bankrupt family farmers reorganizing their debts are able to treat capital gains taxes owed to a governmental unit, arising from the sale of farm assets during a bankruptcy, as general unsecured claims. This bill will remove the Internal Revenue Service's veto power over a bankruptcy reorganization plan's confirmation, giving the family farmer a chance to reorganize successfully. In 1986 Congress enacted Chapter 12 of the Bankruptcy Code to provide a specialized bankruptcy process for family farmers. In 2005 Chapter 12 was made permanent. Between 1986 and 2005 we learned what aspects worked and didn't work for family farmers reorganizing in bankruptcy. One problematic area was where a family farmer needed to sell assets in order to generate cash for the reorganization. Specifically, a family farmer would have to sell portions of the farm to generate cash to fund a reorganization plan so that the creditors could receive payment. Unfortunately, in situations like this, the family farmer is selling land that has been owned for a very long time, with a very low cost basis. Thus, when the land is sold, the family farmer is hit with a substantial capital gains tax, which is owed to the Internal Revenue Service. Under the Bankruptcy Code, taxes owed to the Internal Revenue Service receive priority treatment. Holders of priority claims must receive payment in full, unless the claim holder agrees to be treated differently. This creates problems for the family farmer who needs the cash to pay creditors to reorganize. However, since the Internal Revenue Service has the ability to require full payment, they hold veto power over a plan's confirmation, which means in many instances the plan will not be confirmed. This does not make sense if the goal is to give the family farmer a fresh start. Thus, in 2005 Congress said that in these limited situations, the taxes owed to the Internal Revenue Service would be [[Page S285]] stripped of their priority and treated as general unsecured debt. This removed the government's veto power over plan confirmation and paved the way for family farmers to reorganize. Unfortunately, in Hall v. United States, the Supreme Court ruled that despite Congress's express goal of helping family farmers, the language inserted into the Bankruptcy Code in 2005 conflicted with the Tax Code. The Hall case was one of statutory interpretation. There is no question what Congress was trying to do; rather, did Congress use the correct language? My goal, along with others at the time, was to relieve family farmers from having their reorganization plans fail because of huge tax liabilities to the Federal Government. Justice Breyer noted this in the dissent: ``Congress was concerned about the effect on the farmer of collecting capital gains tax debts that arose during (and were connected with) the Chapter 12 proceedings themselves. . . . The majority does not deny the importance of Congress' objective. Rather, it feels compelled to hold that Congress put the Amendment in the wrong place.'' Hall v. United States, 132 S.Ct. 1882, 1897, 2012. As a result of the Hall case, family farmers facing bankruptcy now find themselves caught in a tough spot. The rules have now been changed and must be corrected in order to provide certainty and clarity in the law. The Family Farmer Bankruptcy Clarification Act of 2015 will provide the clarity needed to help family farmers. This bill adds a new section 1232 to title 11 of the United States Code. This new section, along with other conforming changes to the Bankruptcy Code, gives guidance and certainty to debtors, practitioners, and courts as to how these claims are to be treated during bankruptcy. I am pleased that the bill we are introducing today will help family farmers who are facing hard times. The Family Farmer Bankruptcy Clarification Act of 2015 ensures that what Congress sought to do in 2005 actually occurs. In the wake of the Hall decision, this bill is needed in order to help family farmers reorganize successfully. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record. There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows: S. 194 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, SECTION 1.

A bill to amend title 11 of the United States Code to clarify the rule allowing discharge as a nonpriority claim of governmental claims arising from the disposition of farm assets under chapter 12 bankruptcies; to the Committee on the Judiciary. Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce, along with Senator Franken, the Family Farmer Bankruptcy Clarification Act of 2015. I thank Senator Franken for his work on this bill and for his support. We introduced identical legislation in the 113th Congress and similar legislation in the 112 Congress. Unfortunately, the Senate has never had the opportunity to consider these bills and the problem we seek to correct. This bipartisan bill addresses the 2012 United States Supreme Court case Hall v. United States. In a 5-4 decision, the Supreme Court ruled that a provision I inserted into the 2005 Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act didn't accomplish what we in Congress intended. The Family Farmer Bankruptcy Clarification Act of 2015 corrects this and clarifies that bankrupt family farmers reorganizing their debts are able to treat capital gains taxes owed to a governmental unit, arising from the sale of farm assets during a bankruptcy, as general unsecured claims. This bill will remove the Internal Revenue Service's veto power over a bankruptcy reorganization plan's confirmation, giving the family farmer a chance to reorganize successfully. In 1986 Congress enacted Chapter 12 of the Bankruptcy Code to provide a specialized bankruptcy process for family farmers. In 2005 Chapter 12 was made permanent. Between 1986 and 2005 we learned what aspects worked and didn't work for family farmers reorganizing in bankruptcy. One problematic area was where a family farmer needed to sell assets in order to generate cash for the reorganization. Specifically, a family farmer would have to sell portions of the farm to generate cash to fund a reorganization plan so that the creditors could receive payment. Unfortunately, in situations like this, the family farmer is selling land that has been owned for a very long time, with a very low cost basis. Thus, when the land is sold, the family farmer is hit with a substantial capital gains tax, which is owed to the Internal Revenue Service. Under the Bankruptcy Code, taxes owed to the Internal Revenue Service receive priority treatment. Holders of priority claims must receive payment in full, unless the claim holder agrees to be treated differently. This creates problems for the family farmer who needs the cash to pay creditors to reorganize. However, since the Internal Revenue Service has the ability to require full payment, they hold veto power over a plan's confirmation, which means in many instances the plan will not be confirmed.

my goal, along with others at the time, was to relieve family farmers from having their reorganization plans fail because of huge tax liabilities to the federal government. justice breyer noted this in the dissent: ``congress was concerned about the effect on the farmer of collecting capital gains tax debts that arose during (and were connected with) the chapter 12 proceedings themselves. . . . the majority does not deny the importance of congress' objective. rather, it feels compelled to hold that congress put the amendment in the wrong place.'' hall v. united states, 132 s.ct. 1882, 1897, 2012. as a result of the hall case, family farmers facing bankruptcy now find themselves caught in a tough spot. the rules have now been changed and must be corrected in order to provide certainty and clarity in the law. the family farmer bankruptcy clarification act of 2015 will provide the clarity needed to help family farmers. this bill adds a new section 1232 to title 11 of the united states code. this new section, along with other conforming changes to the bankruptcy code, gives guidance and certainty to debtors, practitioners, and courts as to how these claims are to be treated during bankruptcy. i am pleased that the bill we are introducing today will help family farmers who are facing hard times. the family farmer bankruptcy clarification act of 2015 ensures that what congress sought to do in 2005 actually occurs. in the wake of the hall decision, this bill is needed in order to help family farmers reorganize successfully. mr. president, i ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the record. there being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be printed in the record, as follows: s. 194 be it enacted by the senate and house of representatives of the united states of america in congress assembled, section 1. short title. this act may be cited as the ``family farmer bankruptcy clarification act of 2015''. sec. 2. clarification of rule allowing discharge to governmental claims arising from the disposition of farm assets under chapter 12 bankruptcies.

A bill to amend title 11 of the United States Code to clarify the rule allowing discharge as a nonpriority claim of governmental claims arising from the disposition of farm assets under chapter 12 bankruptcies; to the Committee on the Judiciary. Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce, along with Senator Franken, the Family Farmer Bankruptcy Clarification Act of 2015. I thank Senator Franken for his work on this bill and for his support. We introduced identical legislation in the 113th Congress and similar legislation in the 112 Congress. Unfortunately, the Senate has never had the opportunity to consider these bills and the problem we seek to correct. This bipartisan bill addresses the 2012 United States Supreme Court case Hall v. United States. In a 5-4 decision, the Supreme Court ruled that a provision I inserted into the 2005 Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act didn't accomplish what we in Congress intended. The Family Farmer Bankruptcy Clarification Act of 2015 corrects this and clarifies that bankrupt family farmers reorganizing their debts are able to treat capital gains taxes owed to a governmental unit, arising from the sale of farm assets during a bankruptcy, as general unsecured claims. This bill will remove the Internal Revenue Service's veto power over a bankruptcy reorganization plan's confirmation, giving the family farmer a chance to reorganize successfully. In 1986 Congress enacted Chapter 12 of the Bankruptcy Code to provide a specialized bankruptcy process for family farmers. In 2005 Chapter 12 was made permanent. Between 1986 and 2005 we learned what aspects worked and didn't work for family farmers reorganizing in bankruptcy. One problematic area was where a family farmer needed to sell assets in order to generate cash for the reorganization. Specifically, a family farmer would have to sell portions of the farm to generate cash to fund a reorganization plan so that the creditors could receive payment. Unfortunately, in situations like this, the family farmer is selling land that has been owned for a very long time, with a very low cost basis. Thus, when the land is sold, the family farmer is hit with a substantial capital gains tax, which is owed to the Internal Revenue Service. Under the Bankruptcy Code, taxes owed to the Internal Revenue Service receive priority treatment. Holders of priority claims must receive payment in full, unless the claim holder agrees to be treated differently. This creates problems for the family farmer who needs the cash to pay creditors to reorganize. However, since the Internal Revenue Service has the ability to require full payment, they hold veto power over a plan's confirmation, which means in many instances the plan will not be confirmed. This does not make sense if the goal is to give the family farmer a fresh start. Thus, in 2005 Congress said that in these limited situations, the taxes owed to the Internal Revenue Service would be [[Page S285]] stripped of their priority and treated as general unsecured debt. This removed the government's veto power over plan confirmation and paved the way for family farmers to reorganize. Unfortunately, in Hall v. United States, the Supreme Court ruled that despite Congress's express goal of helping family farmers, the language inserted into the Bankruptcy Code in 2005 conflicted with the Tax Code. The Hall case was one of statutory interpretation. There is no question what Congress was trying to do; rather, did Congress use the correct language? My goal, along with others at the time, was to relieve family farmers from having their reorganization plans fail because of huge tax liabilities to the Federal Government. Justice Breyer noted this in the dissent: ``Congress was concerned about the effect on the farmer of collecting capital gains tax debts that arose during (and were connected with) the Chapter 12 proceedings themselves. . . . The majority does not deny the importance of Congress' objective. Rather, it feels compelled to hold that Congress put the Amendment in the wrong place.'' Hall v. United States, 132 S.Ct. 1882, 1897, 2012. As a result of the Hall case, family farmers facing bankruptcy now find themselves caught in a tough spot. The rules have now been changed and must be corrected in order to provide certainty and clarity in the law. The Family Farmer Bankruptcy Clarification Act of 2015 will provide the clarity needed to help family farmers. This bill adds a new section 1232 to title 11 of the United States Code. This new section, along with other conforming changes to the Bankruptcy Code, gives guidance and certainty to debtors, practitioners, and courts as to how these claims are to be treated during bankruptcy. I am pleased that the bill we are introducing today will help family farmers who are facing hard times. The Family Farmer Bankruptcy Clarification Act of 2015 ensures that what Congress sought to do in 2005 actually occurs. In the wake of the Hall decision, this bill is needed in order to help family farmers reorganize successfully. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record. There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows: S. 194 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, SECTION 1.

A bill to amend title 11 of the United States Code to clarify the rule allowing discharge as a nonpriority claim of governmental claims arising from the disposition of farm assets under chapter 12 bankruptcies; to the Committee on the Judiciary. Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce, along with Senator Franken, the Family Farmer Bankruptcy Clarification Act of 2015. I thank Senator Franken for his work on this bill and for his support. We introduced identical legislation in the 113th Congress and similar legislation in the 112 Congress. Unfortunately, the Senate has never had the opportunity to consider these bills and the problem we seek to correct. This bipartisan bill addresses the 2012 United States Supreme Court case Hall v. United States. In a 5-4 decision, the Supreme Court ruled that a provision I inserted into the 2005 Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act didn't accomplish what we in Congress intended. The Family Farmer Bankruptcy Clarification Act of 2015 corrects this and clarifies that bankrupt family farmers reorganizing their debts are able to treat capital gains taxes owed to a governmental unit, arising from the sale of farm assets during a bankruptcy, as general unsecured claims. This bill will remove the Internal Revenue Service's veto power over a bankruptcy reorganization plan's confirmation, giving the family farmer a chance to reorganize successfully. In 1986 Congress enacted Chapter 12 of the Bankruptcy Code to provide a specialized bankruptcy process for family farmers. In 2005 Chapter 12 was made permanent. Between 1986 and 2005 we learned what aspects worked and didn't work for family farmers reorganizing in bankruptcy. One problematic area was where a family farmer needed to sell assets in order to generate cash for the reorganization. Specifically, a family farmer would have to sell portions of the farm to generate cash to fund a reorganization plan so that the creditors could receive payment. Unfortunately, in situations like this, the family farmer is selling land that has been owned for a very long time, with a very low cost basis. Thus, when the land is sold, the family farmer is hit with a substantial capital gains tax, which is owed to the Internal Revenue Service. Under the Bankruptcy Code, taxes owed to the Internal Revenue Service receive priority treatment. Holders of priority claims must receive payment in full, unless the claim holder agrees to be treated differently. This creates problems for the family farmer who needs the cash to pay creditors to reorganize. However, since the Internal Revenue Service has the ability to require full payment, they hold veto power over a plan's confirmation, which means in many instances the plan will not be confirmed. This does not make sense if the goal is to give the family farmer a fresh start. Thus, in 2005 Congress said that in these limited situations, the taxes owed to the Internal Revenue Service would be [[Page S285]] stripped of their priority and treated as general unsecured debt. This removed the government's veto power over plan confirmation and paved the way for family farmers to reorganize. Unfortunately, in Hall v. United States, the Supreme Court ruled that despite Congress's express goal of helping family farmers, the language inserted into the Bankruptcy Code in 2005 conflicted with the Tax Code. The Hall case was one of statutory interpretation. There is no question what Congress was trying to do; rather, did Congress use the correct language? My goal, along with others at the time, was to relieve family farmers from having their reorganization plans fail because of huge tax liabilities to the Federal Government. Justice Breyer noted this in the dissent: ``Congress was concerned about the effect on the farmer of collecting capital gains tax debts that arose during (and were connected with) the Chapter 12 proceedings themselves. . . . The majority does not deny the importance of Congress' objective. Rather, it feels compelled to hold that Congress put the Amendment in the wrong place.'' Hall v. United States, 132 S.Ct. 1882, 1897, 2012. As a result of the Hall case, family farmers facing bankruptcy now find themselves caught in a tough spot. The rules have now been changed and must be corrected in order to provide certainty and clarity in the law. The Family Farmer Bankruptcy Clarification Act of 2015 will provide the clarity needed to help family farmers. This bill adds a new section 1232 to title 11 of the United States Code. This new section, along with other conforming changes to the Bankruptcy Code, gives guidance and certainty to debtors, practitioners, and courts as to how these claims are to be treated during bankruptcy. I am pleased that the bill we are introducing today will help family farmers who are facing hard times. The Family Farmer Bankruptcy Clarification Act of 2015 ensures that what Congress sought to do in 2005 actually occurs. In the wake of the Hall decision, this bill is needed in order to help family farmers reorganize successfully. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record. There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows: S. 194 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, SECTION 1.

A bill to amend title 11 of the United States Code to clarify the rule allowing discharge as a nonpriority claim of governmental claims arising from the disposition of farm assets under chapter 12 bankruptcies; to the Committee on the Judiciary. Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce, along with Senator Franken, the Family Farmer Bankruptcy Clarification Act of 2015. I thank Senator Franken for his work on this bill and for his support. We introduced identical legislation in the 113th Congress and similar legislation in the 112 Congress. Unfortunately, the Senate has never had the opportunity to consider these bills and the problem we seek to correct. This bipartisan bill addresses the 2012 United States Supreme Court case Hall v. United States. In a 5-4 decision, the Supreme Court ruled that a provision I inserted into the 2005 Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act didn't accomplish what we in Congress intended. The Family Farmer Bankruptcy Clarification Act of 2015 corrects this and clarifies that bankrupt family farmers reorganizing their debts are able to treat capital gains taxes owed to a governmental unit, arising from the sale of farm assets during a bankruptcy, as general unsecured claims. This bill will remove the Internal Revenue Service's veto power over a bankruptcy reorganization plan's confirmation, giving the family farmer a chance to reorganize successfully. In 1986 Congress enacted Chapter 12 of the Bankruptcy Code to provide a specialized bankruptcy process for family farmers. In 2005 Chapter 12 was made permanent. Between 1986 and 2005 we learned what aspects worked and didn't work for family farmers reorganizing in bankruptcy. One problematic area was where a family farmer needed to sell assets in order to generate cash for the reorganization. Specifically, a family farmer would have to sell portions of the farm to generate cash to fund a reorganization plan so that the creditors could receive payment. Unfortunately, in situations like this, the family farmer is selling land that has been owned for a very long time, with a very low cost basis. Thus, when the land is sold, the family farmer is hit with a substantial capital gains tax, which is owed to the Internal Revenue Service. Under the Bankruptcy Code, taxes owed to the Internal Revenue Service receive priority treatment. Holders of priority claims must receive payment in full, unless the claim holder agrees to be treated differently. This creates problems for the family farmer who needs the cash to pay creditors to reorganize. However, since the Internal Revenue Service has the ability to require full payment, they hold veto power over a plan's confirmation, which means in many instances the plan will not be confirmed. This does not make sense if the goal is to give the family farmer a fresh start. Thus, in 2005 Congress said that in these limited situations, the taxes owed to the Internal Revenue Service would be [[Page S285]] stripped of their priority and treated as general unsecured debt. This removed the government's veto power over plan confirmation and paved the way for family farmers to reorganize. Unfortunately, in Hall v. United States, the Supreme Court ruled that despite Congress's express goal of helping family farmers, the language inserted into the Bankruptcy Code in 2005 conflicted with the Tax Code. The Hall case was one of statutory interpretation. There is no question what Congress was trying to do; rather, did Congress use the correct language? My goal, along with others at the time, was to relieve family farmers from having their reorganization plans fail because of huge tax liabilities to the Federal Government. Justice Breyer noted this in the dissent: ``Congress was concerned about the effect on the farmer of collecting capital gains tax debts that arose during (and were connected with) the Chapter 12 proceedings themselves. . . . The majority does not deny the importance of Congress' objective. Rather, it feels compelled to hold that Congress put the Amendment in the wrong place.'' Hall v. United States, 132 S.Ct. 1882, 1897, 2012. As a result of the Hall case, family farmers facing bankruptcy now find themselves caught in a tough spot. The rules have now been changed and must be corrected in order to provide certainty and clarity in the law. The Family Farmer Bankruptcy Clarification Act of 2015 will provide the clarity needed to help family farmers. This bill adds a new section 1232 to title 11 of the United States Code. This new section, along with other conforming changes to the Bankruptcy Code, gives guidance and certainty to debtors, practitioners, and courts as to how these claims are to be treated during bankruptcy. I am pleased that the bill we are introducing today will help family farmers who are facing hard times. The Family Farmer Bankruptcy Clarification Act of 2015 ensures that what Congress sought to do in 2005 actually occurs. In the wake of the Hall decision, this bill is needed in order to help family farmers reorganize successfully. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record. There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows: S. 194 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, SECTION 1.

If the governmental unit has not filed a timely proof of the claim, the debtor or trustee may file proof of the claim that is consistent with the notice served under paragraph (2). If a proof of claim is filed by the debtor or trustee under this paragraph, the governmental unit may not amend the proof of claim. ``(4) A claim filed under this subsection shall be determined and shall be allowed under subsection (a), (b), or (c) of section 502, or disallowed under subsection (d) or (e) of section 502, in the same manner as if the claim had arisen immediately before the date of the filing of the petition.''.

my goal, along with others at the time, was to relieve family farmers from having their reorganization plans fail because of huge tax liabilities to the federal government. justice breyer noted this in the dissent: ``congress was concerned about the effect on the farmer of collecting capital gains tax debts that arose during (and were connected with) the chapter 12 proceedings themselves. . . . the majority does not deny the importance of congress' objective. rather, it feels compelled to hold that congress put the amendment in the wrong place.'' hall v. united states, 132 s.ct. 1882, 1897, 2012. as a result of the hall case, family farmers facing bankruptcy now find themselves caught in a tough spot. the rules have now been changed and must be corrected in order to provide certainty and clarity in the law. the family farmer bankruptcy clarification act of 2015 will provide the clarity needed to help family farmers. this bill adds a new section 1232 to title 11 of the united states code. this new section, along with other conforming changes to the bankruptcy code, gives guidance and certainty to debtors, practitioners, and courts as to how these claims are to be treated during bankruptcy. i am pleased that the bill we are introducing today will help family farmers who are facing hard times. the family farmer bankruptcy clarification act of 2015 ensures that what congress sought to do in 2005 actually occurs. in the wake of the hall decision, this bill is needed in order to help family farmers reorganize successfully. mr. president, i ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the record. there being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be printed in the record, as follows: s. 194 be it enacted by the senate and house of representatives of the united states of america in congress assembled, section 1. short title. this act may be cited as the ``family farmer bankruptcy clarification act of 2015''. sec. 2. clarification of rule allowing discharge to governmental claims arising from the disposition of farm assets under chapter 12 bankruptcies.

(2) Recipients of LIHEAP assistance are among the most vulnerable individuals in the country, with more than 90 percent of LIHEAP households having at least one member who is a child, a senior citizen, or disabled, and 20 percent of LIHEAP households including at least one veteran. (3) The number of households eligible for LIHEAP assistance continues to exceed available funding, with current funding reaching just 20 percent of the eligible population. (4) The average LIHEAP grant covers just a fraction of home energy costs, leaving many low-income families and senior citizens struggling to pay their energy bills and with fewer resources available to meet other essential needs. (5) Access to affordable home energy is a matter of health and safety for many low-income households, children, senior citizens, and veterans. (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate that LIHEAP should be funded at not less than $4,700,000,000 annually, to ensure that more low-income households and children, senior citizens, individuals with disabilities, and veterans can meet basic home energy needs. ______ SA 75.

FINDINGS AND SENSE OF THE SENATE. (a) Findings.--The Senate finds the following: (1) The Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program (referred to in this section as [[Page S297]] ``LIHEAP'') is the main Federal program that helps low-income households and senior citizens with their energy bills, providing vital assistance during both the cold winter and hot summer months. (2) Recipients of LIHEAP assistance are among the most vulnerable individuals in the country, with more than 90 percent of LIHEAP households having at least one member who is a child, a senior citizen, or disabled, and 20 percent of LIHEAP households including at least one veteran. (3) The number of households eligible for LIHEAP assistance continues to exceed available funding, with current funding reaching just 20 percent of the eligible population. (4) The average LIHEAP grant covers just a fraction of home energy costs, leaving many low-income families and senior citizens struggling to pay their energy bills and with fewer resources available to meet other essential needs. (5) Access to affordable home energy is a matter of health and safety for many low-income households, children, senior citizens, and veterans. (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate that LIHEAP should be funded at not less than $4,700,000,000 annually, to ensure that more low-income households and children, senior citizens, individuals with disabilities, and veterans can meet basic home energy needs. ______ SA 75.

Mr. Speaker, as the Co-Chairman of the Congressional Azerbaijan Caucus, I want to honor the people of Azerbaijan by recognizing the tragic events of 1990 commonly referred to as ``Black January.'' Twenty-four years ago yesterday, approximately 26,000 heavily armored Soviet soldiers poured into Azerbaijan's capital city of Baku and, with total indifference to human life, launched an assault on a crowd of peaceful demonstrators. Ultimately 131 civilians were killed by the aggressing Soviets. In addition, over 600 were injured, 841 arrested, and 5 went missing. The Human Rights Watch report ``Black January in Azerbaijan'' described the Soviet's approach as though they were attacking ``an enemy position intended for military destruction.'' It states Soviet soldiers fired on clearly marked ambulances, crushed civilians with armored tanks, and used both automatic weapons and bayonets on the civilian population. Many believe that the destruction inflicted on Baku was a warning to other Republics of the Soviet Union in an attempt to stop the dissolution of Communist rule. Ultimately, the atrocities of Black January united Azerbaijan like never before. The brutal show of force erased any residual hope for a reformed Soviet Union, such that Azerbaijan declared its independence twenty months later. I thank the Azerbaijan people for their continued friendship with the United States and extend my deepest sympathies to the family and friends of those who lost their lives for the independence of Azerbaijan. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 9 (Tuesday, January 20, 2015)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E79] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] [[Page E79]] REMEMBERING BLACK JANUARY ______ HON.

Simmons upon the occasion of her retirement from the Florida Institute of Food and Agricultural Sciences (IFAS), Santa Rosa County Extension Office, after more than thirty-two years of dedicated service. [[Page E80]] A lifelong resident of Florida's First Congressional District, Mrs. Simmons was born to Easter and Bennie Harris and was raised in Chumuckla, Florida. After graduating from Chumuckla High School, she attended Pensacola Junior College and began working for her father's business, Harris Masonry. After gaining valuable experience at Harris Masonry, Mrs. Simmons and her husband, Bobby, established Simmons Masonry, which they successfully operated for ten years. In 1982, the IFAS Santa Rosa County Extension Office welcomed Mrs. Simmons to its team. Mrs. Simmons served as the Jay Office Secretary for nearly thirty-three years and assisted the office in a myriad of ways. Throughout her career, whether it was through her work with the Santa Rosa Pest Management Association, her assistance with local farmers in processing their applications, bookkeeping, providing financial management, or maintaining permit files and regulations, her diligence never wavered, and she proved to be an invaluable asset to the Santa Rosa County Extension Service. IFAS employees will forever remember Mrs. Simmons for her willingness to help others and her famous spaghetti meals. As she leaves behind a career that has touched the lives of thousands in Northwest Florida, Mrs. Simmons looks forward to continuing to serve her church, Ebenezer Church, in a greater capacity, gardening, and most of all, spending time with her grandchildren. Mr. Speaker, on behalf of the United States Congress, I am privileged to congratulate Janis K. Simmons on her retirement and thank her for her service to Northwest Florida.

HAROLD ROGERS of kentucky in the house of representatives Tuesday, January 20, 2015 Mr. ROGERS of Kentucky. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in recognition of Jennifer Miller, who has worked tirelessly both in my personal office and for the Appropriations Committee for the last twenty-five years. Jennifer returned to her Kentucky roots when she began her career in the U.S. House of Representatives in 1989 by joining my personal office staff. In 1996, she was asked to join the staff of the Appropriations Committee and since then she has worked diligently for various subcommittees, as well as in the front office. Most recently she has been responsible for the oversight of the intelligence community's budget for the Defense Appropriations Subcommittee. Jennifer is a dedicated and passionate professional. She knows the Congressional rules and the legislative process better than anyone. She has always been willing to put the Committee first and has sacrificed countless hours, weeks, and years to further enhance the work of the Committee. Nothing better exemplifies her dedication than when in March 2007, Jennifer remained at my side in the Committee hearing room during a mark-up of a supplemental bill for two hours longer than planned, leaving her short on time to catch a flight to Italy--for her wedding! Thankfully she made it to the airport in time, and now has a supportive husband, Pete, as well as a cherished daughter, Emma. More recently, Jennifer again displayed her true dedication to the Committee during the first several months that I was Chairman, by not only working for the Defense Subcommittee but also in the front office, aiding with the transition process and assembling the current fiscal year's consolidated appropriations bill. To this day she continues to use her indispensable knowledge by assisting other subcommittees through the legislative process and particularly when Committee bills are being debated on the House floor. I have said before, and I will say again, the Appropriations Committee has the best staff on Capitol Hill. However, hopefully just this once, the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence is gaining traction by hiring Jennifer away from us. I will miss Jennifer's contributions and leadership; but we thank her for her dedication and wish her well in her future endeavors. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 9 (Tuesday, January 20, 2015)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E80] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] TRIBUTE TO JENNIFER MILLER ______ HON.

TODD ROKITA of indiana in the house of representatives Tuesday, January 20, 2015 Mr. ROKITA. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and salute an extraordinary Hoosier, Richard O. ``Dick'' Deignan, who passed away on January 13, 2015. I wish to express my heartfelt gratitude and appreciation for his and his late wife Joan's leadership and service in my hometown of Munster, Indiana, in the Indianapolis, Indiana community and in other parts of our state. First, Mr. Deignan was willing to put the welfare of his fellow Americans above his own self interests. His service aboard the USS Hugh Purvis as a sailor in the United States Navy remained one of his proudest achievements and an obligation he was happy to undertake to ensure that our nation remained free and his children and grandchildren were afforded the same liberty promised by our Founding Fathers. Mr. Deignan was an astute businessman and well known in our community, not only as a Burger King franchise owner, but for the way he trained his employees, many of whom were seeking their first job. He sought to hire high-quality employees, train them well and empower them. In doing so, what he really did was help grow responsible members of the community. Dick built his business from nothing. Starting out, he had very little wealth or other resources. But what he, and so many others who have helped build and maintain this great country had, was a dream and the tireless work ethic to make it reality. He also recognized that what he and Joan built couldn't be done just anywhere in the world. Dick understood, and always promoted, our exceptionalism as the reason the United States had the ability to be the freest, most prosperous nation world history had ever seen, and the greatest force for good on earth. In his free time, he was a staunch advocate and supporter of the Munster Booster Club, aiding the purchase of athletic and scholastic equipment and supplies for the Munster School System. As a close friend of the Deignan children, Kerry and Owen, I quickly came to know the entire family, who lived on Chestnut Lane in Munster for years. They were typical of the best of American families, having and practicing the values we often talk about on this very floor. Joan Deignan was one of the best teachers I had in grade school. And Dick was the very first community leader to support my successful bid for Indiana Secretary of State. They believed in me as a product of a community in which they believed even more. [[Page E81]] Mr. Deignan leaves two children and three grandchildren to carry on his legacy of community service and joins Joan, in eternity. On behalf of Hoosiers, I am humbled to honor Dick here today. He will be missed for his friendship, leadership, work ethic and his character. His legacy is evidence that hard work combined with the opportunities of American exceptionalism can lead to the realization of the American Dream, however an individual wants to define it. Rest in peace my friend, and thank you for your example and leadership. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 9 (Tuesday, January 20, 2015)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Pages E80-E81] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] TRIBUTE TO RICHARD O. ``DICK'' DEIGNAN ______ HON.

Nonetheless, a powerful drive to succeed, personal discipline, strong faith, and a talent for entrepreneurship built a real estate business that allowed Mrs. McClaney and her family not only to thrive but also to lift others as they climbed. La-Doris McClaney and her late sister Burnie McClaney worked with their mother to expand both their business and their philanthropy across six states, donating buildings and money to improve the lives of others. Dr. La-Doris McClaney shares both her mother's aptitude for business and her deep commitment to charitable works. Over her 40-year career in real estate and philanthropy, Dr. McClaney has contributed 10% of her gross income to charities large and small, amounting to many millions of dollars. She gives of herself as well, writing, and lecturing, assisting families in need, and mentoring African American college students and sponsoring their tuition. Dr. McClaney holds a masters degree from Pepperdine University and a doctorate degree from Bethune Cookman College, and the themes of education and health research emerge from a brief review of those receiving her charitable contributions: American Diabetes Association, American Heart Association, American Lung Association, Bethune Cookman College, The Christian Broadcasting Network, City of Hope, King Drew School of Medicine, Save African's Children, and the United Negro College Fund, among many others. Dr. McClaney has been recognized over 500 times with commendations, awards, resolutions and honors for her many good works.

CREC-2015-01-20-pt1-PgE81-4,CREC-2015-01-20,114,VICTOR LOVELADY--THE AMERICAN BREED,"[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 9 (Tuesday, January 20, 2015)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Pages E81-E82] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] VICTOR LOVELADY--THE AMERICAN BREED ______ HON. TED POE of texas in the house of representatives Tuesday, January 20, 2015 Mr. POE of Texas. Mr. Speaker, two years ago, one of my constituents--Mr. Victor Lovelady--was killed in Algeria after being taken captive by terrorists. Before his death, Victor displayed some of the very best qualities of the American spirit: courage, compassion, and selflessness. I would like to take a moment to tell you his story. Like many Americans, Victor Lovelady was a hard worker who put in long hours to provide for his family of four. For most of his life, Victor worked as an industrial engineer and master electrician in his hometown of Nederland, Texas. However, when work in his area slowed, he spent nearly three years traveling back and forth daily to work in Houston from Nederland. He did this so that his children would not have to change schools. The 150 mile round trip was an hour and a half each way. After his kids finished high school, Victor moved to Atascocita, Texas (25 miles north of Houston) where I live Congressional District 2. Victor never had a pension plan and always had to pay his family's insurance by himself. He never had more than two weeks off in a year. He longed to be able to retire and spend more time with his wife and children. When Victor was given the opportunity to work overseas for British Petroleum he weighed the pros and cons. He knew a few years at this new job would provide him with enough money to retire and be with his family. He also believed that working in Africa would be safe. On January 9, 2013, Victor arrived in the remote area of In Amenas, Algeria to begin his new job at the BP Gas facility. In the early hours of January 16th, an army of gun wielding terrorists crashed their trucks through the gates of the gas plant. Within minutes they had seized control of the facility and held hundreds of its employees hostage. Victor Lovelady and several other workers were having tea when suddenly a colleague entered the cantina with a gunshot wound to his stomach. The man had been shot when Mokhtar Belmokhtar's al-Qaeda linked terrorists stormed the facility and opened fire on the innocent workers. Putting thoughts of himself aside and disregarding the sound of gunfire, Victor began cleaning and dressing the man's wound. Victor then hid him in a food container for his safety. Even as the sound of gunshots grew louder and louder, Victor immediately lifted other men into the cantina's false ceiling to hide them from the attackers. In total, Victor secretly secured three men into the ceiling hiding spot. Heavily armed jihadists were going room to room at the plant to capture victims. Only when it sounded like the militants had finally entered the cantina did Victor quickly try to hide and save himself. Unfortunately, he fell and injured his ankle attempting to climb into the ceiling. Moments later, the terrorists captured him and held him hostage. The facility was under the control of the terrorists for three grueling days. Hostages were rounded up one by one, handcuffed and strapped with explosive devices. The terrorists were threatening to blow them up if the U.S. and Algeria did not release jihadi prisoners. Sadly, Victor was killed when Algerian military forces moved in to rescue the victims and attack the terrorists. In total 40 civilians from 10 countries were killed by the terrorists and in the rescue attempt. 29 terrorists were also killed. Victor's selfless and heroic actions saved four lives that day. A once ordinary man became extraordinary in the face of danger and violence. Courage like this should be applauded and remembered. This is why I nominated Mr. Lovelady for the Presidential Medal of Freedom. The Presidential Medal of Freedom is our nation's highest civilian honor and recognizes individuals who have made ``an especially meritorious contribution'' to our society. It is clear that Victor Lovelady not only meets, but exceeds this standard. The events in Algeria last year have disappeared from public view in the sands of time. The media has moved on to other tragic events. There have been more terrorist attacks throughout the world. Americans and non-Americans have been murdered. But it is the Americans such as Victor that we should [[Page E82]] always remember and honor. While we continue to mourn their loss we should, to paraphrase General George Patton: ``Thank God that such people ever lived.'' Two years after his death, Victor Lovelady may not be a household name, but there is no doubt that he is an American hero. He worked hard to provide an honest living and when in danger, thought first to protect others instead of himself. When people hear Victor's story today, they are inspired because of his acts of bravery, conviction, and compassion--in other words, to act as a true American. Four people live today, because Victor died hiding them. Mr. Speaker, I ask that you and all of our colleagues take a moment today to remember the heroism of Victor Lovelady. Our prayers are also with his wife, Maureen, and his two children, Erin and Grant, who carry on his legacy. I am honored to call this Texan my constituent and we will continue to honor the sacrifice he made as a courageous husband, father, and American. Victor Lovelady was from an amazing breed--the American breed. And that's just the way it is. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 9 (Tuesday, January 20, 2015)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Pages E81-E82] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] VICTOR LOVELADY--THE AMERICAN BREED ______ HON.

Mr. Speaker, it is with a heavy heart and solemn remembrance that I rise today to pay tribute to a respected public servant, outstanding citizen, and dear friend, Captain Terry Timley. Sadly, Captain Timley passed away on Saturday, January 10, 2015. Funeral services were held on Friday, January 16, 2015 at 1:00 p.m., at the Macon Centreplex in Macon, Georgia. Captain Timley worked for almost 38 years in the Macon Police Department, which consolidated with the sheriff's office in January 2014 to become the Bibb County Sheriff's Office. He was the head of Criminal Investigations of Property Crimes within the Criminal Investigations Division. Captain Timley devoted nearly four decades of dedicated service to the people of Macon through his meaningful contribution of energy, skill, and genuine passion. In 2013, the Macon Police Department presented Captain Timley with a Distinguished Service Award along with a Merit Award in recognition of his noble commitment to the safety of his community as well as the lasting impact he made within the workplace. Beyond these achievements and the respect held for him by his peers in law enforcement, he was an honorable human being who loved deeply and, in return, was deeply loved. Maya Angelou once said, ``A great soul serves everyone all the time. A great soul never dies.'' Captain Timley is one such great soul, who served humanity in a special way. Each day he graced the people around him with an enthusiastic sincerity of presence. His impression on this earth extends beyond himself to the very wellbeing of the Macon community, and for it he will be remembered by the community for time to come. On a personal note, my staff and I will always remember and cherish the times Captain Timley would poke his head into our Macon District Office to check on us just to see how we were doing and offer his help. Captain Timley is survived by his wife, Gwendolyn; children, Terry, Jr. and Tyler; siblings, Walter, William, Thelma, Jerry, and Raymond; and a host of other family members and friends. Mr. Speaker, my wife Vivian and I, along with the more than 700,000 people of the Second Congressional District salute Captain Terry Timley for his dedicated service and exceptional impact on Macon, Georgia. I ask my colleagues in the House of Representatives to join us in extending our deepest sympathies to Captain Timley's family, friends and loved ones during this difficult time.

DORIS O. MATSUI of california in the house of representatives Tuesday, January 20, 2015 Ms. MATSUI. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in recognition of former Yolo County Supervisor Mike McGowan, to celebrate his career and many accomplishments. Mr. McGowan served the people of West Sacramento and Yolo County for nearly three decades and now is a leader with the State of California's Department of Motor Vehicles. I ask all my colleagues to join me in honoring him and celebrating his incredible contributions to our community. A lifetime Yolo County resident, Mr. McGowan served his nation in the United States Marine Corps during the Vietnam War. After the war, he returned to Sacramento and graduated from California State University, Sacramento and the University of Pacific's McGeorge School of Law. He and his wife, Sue, have a daughter, Becky, and two grandchildren, Phoebe and Franklin. In 1987 Mr. McGowan began his illustrious career in public service. He was instrumental in the formation of the City of West Sacramento, serving as the city's first Mayor and continuing to serve on the City Council for six years. After his time on the City Council, Mr. McGowan was elected to the Yolo County Board of Supervisors, where he represented the people of West Sacramento and Clarksburg for over two decades. He would serve as chairman of the Port of West Sacramento Commission, and as a board member of a number of organizations including Yolo County Transportation District, Delta Protection Commission, the Veterans of Foreign Wars, Yolo County Housing Commission, Sacramento Regional Counties Sanitation District, Sacramento Area Council of Governments, Local Mental Health Board, Sacramento Area Trade & Commerce Advisory Board, Yolo-Solano Air Quality Management Board and as an officer on the California State Association of Counties' executive committee. Mr. McGowan worked tirelessly to protect our region's natural resources, promote agricultural growth, and improve Yolo County's economy. As a Supervisor, he worked with Governor Jerry Brown on the implementation of the Affordable Care Act. I have always enjoyed working closely with Mr. McGowan, as he has been a true partner on a number of critical issues; including complex water, flood protection and transportation projects. In 2013, Mr. McGowan was appointed by Governor Brown as Deputy Director of Strategic Planning and Policy for the Department of Motor Vehicles. In recognition of his steadfast commitment to the City of West Sacramento, the city named a bridge over the Barge Canal, the Mike McGowan Bridge and the West Sacramento Chamber of Commerce has renamed their annual leadership award the Mike McGowan West Sacramentan of the Year Award. With these honors, future generations will know what Mike McGowan has meant to West Sacramento and Yolo County. Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in thanking and recognizing former Supervisor Mike McGowan for his many years of exemplary public service and to wish him continued personal and professional success. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 9 (Tuesday, January 20, 2015)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E83] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] IN RECOGNITION OF MIKE McGOWAN ______ HON.

He and his wife, Sue, have a daughter, Becky, and two grandchildren, Phoebe and Franklin. In 1987 Mr. McGowan began his illustrious career in public service. He was instrumental in the formation of the City of West Sacramento, serving as the city's first Mayor and continuing to serve on the City Council for six years. After his time on the City Council, Mr. McGowan was elected to the Yolo County Board of Supervisors, where he represented the people of West Sacramento and Clarksburg for over two decades. He would serve as chairman of the Port of West Sacramento Commission, and as a board member of a number of organizations including Yolo County Transportation District, Delta Protection Commission, the Veterans of Foreign Wars, Yolo County Housing Commission, Sacramento Regional Counties Sanitation District, Sacramento Area Council of Governments, Local Mental Health Board, Sacramento Area Trade & Commerce Advisory Board, Yolo-Solano Air Quality Management Board and as an officer on the California State Association of Counties' executive committee. Mr. McGowan worked tirelessly to protect our region's natural resources, promote agricultural growth, and improve Yolo County's economy. As a Supervisor, he worked with Governor Jerry Brown on the implementation of the Affordable Care Act. I have always enjoyed working closely with Mr. McGowan, as he has been a true partner on a number of critical issues; including complex water, flood protection and transportation projects. In 2013, Mr. McGowan was appointed by Governor Brown as Deputy Director of Strategic Planning and Policy for the Department of Motor Vehicles. In recognition of his steadfast commitment to the City of West Sacramento, the city named a bridge over the Barge Canal, the Mike McGowan Bridge and the West Sacramento Chamber of Commerce has renamed their annual leadership award the Mike McGowan West Sacramentan of the Year Award. With these honors, future generations will know what Mike McGowan has meant to West Sacramento and Yolo County. Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in thanking and recognizing former Supervisor Mike McGowan for his many years of exemplary public service and to wish him continued personal and professional success. ____________________","Congressional Record, Volume 161 Issue 9 (Tuesday, January 20, 2015) [Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 9 (Tuesday, January 20, 2015)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E83] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] IN RECOGNITION OF MIKE McGOWAN ______ HON.

CREC-2015-01-20-pt1-PgE83-2,CREC-2015-01-20,114,PROMOTING JOB CREATION AND REDUCING SMALL BUSINESS BURDENS ACT,"[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 9 (Tuesday, January 20, 2015)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E83] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] PROMOTING JOB CREATION AND REDUCING SMALL BUSINESS BURDENS ACT ______ speech of HON. KEITH ELLISON of minnesota in the house of representatives Wednesday, January 14, 2015 Mr. ELLISON. Mr. Speaker, I am disappointed that the Republican majority did not allow a single amendment on this bill that benefits powerful financial interests. Members obviously have concerns about elements of this bill--146 members opposed this identical bill last week. A previous version of this bill also earned more than 100 no votes last Congress. The 52 new members who began service last week were not able to offer an amendment either. These eleven bills make complex legal changes to our financial markets but no member of this Congress was afforded the opportunity to make a change. I offered three different amendments. All were rejected. My first amendment had the support of Chairman Issa and Representative Polis. If we had more time, Ranking Member Cummings would have added his name. This amendment strikes Section 7. Section 7 moves us backwards in efforts to increase transparency in our financial markets. Section 7 would exempt more than 70 percent of public companies from complying with the eXtensible Business Reporting Language (XBRL) requirement. This exemption would completely undermine progress already made by the Securities and Exchange Commission. Going back to the 19th century approach, requiring investors, academics, regulators and the public to read reams of filing papers is definitely not what we should be doing. Instead, we should provide the data in structured data sets available for bulk downloads for comparison and analysis by investors, academics, the regulators and the public. The SEC has made incredible progress in catching up with more than two dozen other nations that collect information this way. It has also made it easier for firms. A recent study by XBRL.US found that the average cost of submission was only $10,000. In fact, seventy percent of firms in the study reported a cost of less than $10,000. The costs to individual firms is offset by the benefits those firms will receive because investors have easier access to data to make investment decisions. Society will also benefit by having financial data more readily available. My second amendment required the Securities and Exchange Commission to finalize its CEO pay ratio rule within 60 days of the bill's enactment. CEO pay rose an average of 4% last year. The average CEO earns more than 330 times his or her average employee. My third amendment highlights what we really need to do to create jobs--end the mindless sequestration cuts which prevent us from making needed investments in infrastructure, housing, basic research, etc. It also strikes the language that further delays the transition to a safer financial system. It is wrong that bills that help Wall Street and multi-national corporations get fast-tracked while bills that help working families have been slow-walked for years. (From XBRL.US) Consequences of XBRL Exemption in H.R. 37--Minimal Savings, Reduced Transparency and Access to Capital for Small Companies New York, NY--The goal of Title VII in H.R. 37 is to reduce the burden on small public companies by delaying the XBRL (eXtensible Business Reporting Language) formatting requirement for companies with revenue under $250 million for a minimum of three years. The XBRL exemption in the bill will not reduce the burden on small companies. The savings from an XBRL exemption is only $10,000 per year for most small companies. A December 2014 study conducted by XBRL US found that the average annual cost of XBRL filing for companies defined as ``small companies'' per the U.S. Securities and Exchange (SEC) definition is $10,406; and 70% pay $10,000 or less. These figures demonstrate that the annual cost of XBRL creation is low relative to the benefits that XBRL formatting can provide. Financial data in XBRL format is significantly more functional and timely, and therefore less costly for investors and analysts, than traditional HTML data, which must be rekeyed and vetted before use. The study was based on aggregating annual costs for 1,299 companies, working with 14 separate service providers, geographically dispersed around the country. The dataset captures 32% of all companies with the small company designation. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 9 (Tuesday, January 20, 2015)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E83] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] PROMOTING JOB CREATION AND REDUCING SMALL BUSINESS BURDENS ACT ______ speech of HON.

CREC-2015-01-20-pt1-PgE83-4,CREC-2015-01-20,114,HONORING DAVID R. SHEDD,"[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 9 (Tuesday, January 20, 2015)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Pages E83-E84] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] HONORING DAVID R. SHEDD ______ HON. DEVIN NUNES of california in the house of representatives Tuesday, January 20, 2015 Mr. NUNES. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate and pay tribute to David R. Shedd, one of the premier leaders of our nation's intelligence community. Mr. Shedd was named Acting Director of the Defense Intelligence Agency in August 2014, following four [[Page E84]] years of service as the Deputy Director. He leads the Defense Intelligence Enterprise workforce, which comprises more than 16,500 military and civilian employees worldwide. Mr. Shedd retires on January 23, 2015, with 32 years of honorable service. Throughout his distinguished career, Mr. Shedd has displayed remarkable vision, leadership, and an unwavering commitment to our nation's security that are worthy of our recognition. A driving force in the intelligence community, Mr. Shedd initiated necessary improvements to information sharing and intelligence integration, better preparing the IC as a whole to confront national security threats. From May 2007 to August 2010, Mr. Shedd served as the Director of National Intelligence Deputy for Policy, Plans, and Requirements, where he was responsible for overseeing the formulation and implementation of major IC policies across the full spectrum of issues, from information sharing and IC authorities to analytic standards, among others. In particular, he led the review of Executive Order 12333, the foundational U.S. intelligence policy, which was revised by President George W. Bush in July 2008. Additionally, Mr. Shedd developed and implemented a National Intelligence Strategy for the IC that was published in August 2009, and led all strategic planning efforts to determine future intelligence priorities for the Community and the nation. In all these positions, Mr. Shedd was at the forefront of our nation's most critical intelligence reforms during a crucial point in our history. From May 2005 to April 2007, Mr. Shedd served as Chief of Staff and later as Acting Director of the Intelligence Staff to the Director of National Intelligence. Prior to the creation of the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, Mr. Shedd held intelligence policy positions at the National Security Council from February 2001 to May 2005. He served as the NSC's Special Assistant to the President and Senior Director for Intelligence Programs and Reform. Mr. Shedd has been directly involved in the implementation of intelligence reform stemming from the 9/11 Commission report in July 2004, the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004, and the Weapons of Mass Destruction Commission's report to the President in March 2005. From 1984 to 1993, Mr. Shedd was posted overseas in U.S. Embassies in Costa Rica and Mexico. Mr. Shedd has also held various senior management assignments at the Central Intelligence Agency, including Chief of Congressional Liaison. Mr. Speaker, as the Acting Director of the Defense Intelligence Agency, Mr. Shedd provided vision and continuity at an important and transformational time in the Agency's history. He worked to strengthen integration and collaboration with the Combatant Commands, and to make DIA more flexible and responsive to intelligence requirements. DIA is more ready today than at any other time in its history to support our warfighters though expeditionary operations and robust reach-back support. Through his exceptional knowledge and superb communication skills, Mr. Shedd served as a critical bridge between the military intelligence community and its civilian overseers on time-sensitive intelligence issues. During this period of fiscal austerity, Mr. Shedd also addressed several significant issues concerning workforce shaping in order to better position DIA to be more relevant and mission capable. Of note, Mr. Shedd acted as an effective mentor for DIA's workforce, generously making himself available to the most junior employees and providing expert guidance, judgment, and counsel at every opportunity. Without question, the bedrock principles of placing people first and selfless service defined all of David Shedd's leadership decisions. He leaves behind a more innovative and collaborative DIA, one that will be ready to face our national security challenges and support its most important customers: the soldiers, sailors, airmen, Marines, and civilians who stand in harm's way around the world. Mr. Speaker, while the Intelligence Community will be losing a leader who has answered the call time and again at critical points in our nation's history, I know David will be happy to spend more time with his wife Lisa and their sons Jeremy and DJ, as well as DJ's wife Megan. Despite giving so much to the nation during his remarkable career, David always ensured that he was an exemplary husband and father as well as a devoted son. On behalf of a grateful nation and my colleagues in the U.S. Congress, I thank David and his family for his many years of faithful service and a job well done, and I wish him the very best of luck in his future endeavors as a teacher and speaker, and in his charitable endeavors that are so close to his heart. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 9 (Tuesday, January 20, 2015)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Pages E83-E84] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] HONORING DAVID R.

During this period of fiscal austerity, Mr. Shedd also addressed several significant issues concerning workforce shaping in order to better position DIA to be more relevant and mission capable. Of note, Mr. Shedd acted as an effective mentor for DIA's workforce, generously making himself available to the most junior employees and providing expert guidance, judgment, and counsel at every opportunity. Without question, the bedrock principles of placing people first and selfless service defined all of David Shedd's leadership decisions. He leaves behind a more innovative and collaborative DIA, one that will be ready to face our national security challenges and support its most important customers: the soldiers, sailors, airmen, Marines, and civilians who stand in harm's way around the world. Mr. Speaker, while the Intelligence Community will be losing a leader who has answered the call time and again at critical points in our nation's history, I know David will be happy to spend more time with his wife Lisa and their sons Jeremy and DJ, as well as DJ's wife Megan. Despite giving so much to the nation during his remarkable career, David always ensured that he was an exemplary husband and father as well as a devoted son. On behalf of a grateful nation and my colleagues in the U.S. Congress, I thank David and his family for his many years of faithful service and a job well done, and I wish him the very best of luck in his future endeavors as a teacher and speaker, and in his charitable endeavors that are so close to his heart. ____________________","Congressional Record, Volume 161 Issue 9 (Tuesday, January 20, 2015) [Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 9 (Tuesday, January 20, 2015)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Pages E83-E84] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] HONORING DAVID R. SHEDD ______ HON. DEVIN NUNES of california in the house of representatives Tuesday, January 20, 2015 Mr. NUNES. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate and pay tribute to David R. Shedd, one of the premier leaders of our nation's intelligence community. Mr. Shedd was named Acting Director of the Defense Intelligence Agency in August 2014, following four [[Page E84]] years of service as the Deputy Director. He leads the Defense Intelligence Enterprise workforce, which comprises more than 16,500 military and civilian employees worldwide. Mr. Shedd retires on January 23, 2015, with 32 years of honorable service. Throughout his distinguished career, Mr. Shedd has displayed remarkable vision, leadership, and an unwavering commitment to our nation's security that are worthy of our recognition. A driving force in the intelligence community, Mr. Shedd initiated necessary improvements to information sharing and intelligence integration, better preparing the IC as a whole to confront national security threats. From May 2007 to August 2010, Mr. Shedd served as the Director of National Intelligence Deputy for Policy, Plans, and Requirements, where he was responsible for overseeing the formulation and implementation of major IC policies across the full spectrum of issues, from information sharing and IC authorities to analytic standards, among others. In particular, he led the review of Executive Order 12333, the foundational U.S. intelligence policy, which was revised by President George W. Bush in July 2008. Additionally, Mr. Shedd developed and implemented a National Intelligence Strategy for the IC that was published in August 2009, and led all strategic planning efforts to determine future intelligence priorities for the Community and the nation. In all these positions, Mr. Shedd was at the forefront of our nation's most critical intelligence reforms during a crucial point in our history. From May 2005 to April 2007, Mr. Shedd served as Chief of Staff and later as Acting Director of the Intelligence Staff to the Director of National Intelligence. Prior to the creation of the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, Mr. Shedd held intelligence policy positions at the National Security Council from February 2001 to May 2005. He served as the NSC's Special Assistant to the President and Senior Director for Intelligence Programs and Reform. Mr. Shedd has been directly involved in the implementation of intelligence reform stemming from the 9/11 Commission report in July 2004, the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004, and the Weapons of Mass Destruction Commission's report to the President in March 2005. From 1984 to 1993, Mr. Shedd was posted overseas in U.S. Embassies in Costa Rica and Mexico. Mr. Shedd has also held various senior management assignments at the Central Intelligence Agency, including Chief of Congressional Liaison. Mr. Speaker, as the Acting Director of the Defense Intelligence Agency, Mr. Shedd provided vision and continuity at an important and transformational time in the Agency's history. He worked to strengthen integration and collaboration with the Combatant Commands, and to make DIA more flexible and responsive to intelligence requirements.
