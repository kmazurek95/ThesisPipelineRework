Mr. DOLD. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to highlight the importance of the legislation that we passed this week on human trafficking. Sadly, my district is no stranger to this despicable crime. In both Lake and Cook Counties, we seem to have too many cases of human trafficking. In the Chicagoland area, up to 25,000 women and girls are victims of commercial sexual exploitation. According to the Justice Department, as many as 300,000 American youths are at risk of becoming victims of sexual trafficking. The average age for girls that first become victims is between 12 and 14 years of age. This legislation will protect our youth by establishing programs to help runaways and homeless children who are at the highest risk for becoming victims. The bills will also help address the issue by giving tools to health care professionals and law enforcement to identify and help victims of human trafficking, and to create programs to deter and prevent human trafficking in the first place. Human trafficking for sexual exploitation is an epidemic that needs to be stopped. This is a first step, and we must remain focused to end human trafficking altogether. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 14 (Wednesday, January 28, 2015)] [House] [Page H644] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] COMBATING HUMAN TRAFFICKING (Mr. DOLD asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)

Mr. AUSTIN SCOTT of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to call on my colleagues to join me in stopping the sequester's impact on our military. I want Members to hear what General Martin Dempsey, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs, had to say. He directly advises the President and Congress, and these are his words: The combination of the Budget Control Act and the sequestration mechanism will make it impossible for us to meet our global responsibilities. Again from the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs: The readiness hole is still the readiness hole. The global security environment is more dangerous and sequestration is still on the books as the law. It's absolutely crazy for this country. Since the President promised the sequestration would not happen but then he said he would veto changes to it, some Members of this House seem to have accepted that the sequestration must go into effect. National security is an essential part of our job, and with growing threats both domestic and abroad, Members of this House must come together to end the sequester cuts that reduce the capabilities of our armed services.

Madison is the daughter of attorneys Christine and Rick Keys of Rock Island, Illinois, and at the close of this tournament, Madison will be the world's highest ranking teenage tennis player. The 19-year-old defeated the reigning Wimbledon champion, Petra Kvitova, in the third round of the tournament. And yesterday, she played in the quarterfinals against the woman who inspired her to play tennis, Venus Williams--and Madison won. Madison remembers watching Wimbledon when she was just 4 years old and being inspired to play tennis when she saw Venus' fancy tennis dress. Last night's match in a way represents the passing of the torch between generations on the U.S. women's tennis team as Madison now advances to the next round. Tomorrow she plays Serena Williams. I am confident Madison has a long tennis career in front of her, and I look forward to seeing where she goes.

Mr. Speaker, pursuant to House Resolution 48, I call up the bill (H.R. 351) to provide for expedited approval of exportation of natural gas, and for other purposes, and ask for its immediate consideration in the House. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The text of the bill is as follows: H.R. 351 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. This Act may be cited as the ``LNG Permitting Certainty and Transparency Act''. SEC. 2. ACTION ON APPLICATIONS. (a) Decision Deadline.--For proposals that must also obtain authorization from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission or the United States Maritime Administration to site, construct, expand, or operate LNG export facilities, the Department of Energy shall issue a final decision on any application for the authorization to export natural gas under section 3 of the Natural Gas Act (15 U.S.C. 717b) not later than 30 days after the later of-- (1) the conclusion of the review to site, construct, expand, or operate the LNG facilities required by the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (42 U.S. C. 4321 et seq.); or (2) the date of enactment of this Act. (b) Conclusion of Review.--For purposes of subsection (a), review required by the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 shall be considered concluded-- (1) for a project requiring an Environmental Impact Statement, 30 days after publication of a Final Environmental Impact Statement; (2) for a project for which an Environmental Assessment has been prepared, 30 days after publication by the Department of Energy of a Finding of No Significant Impact; and (3) upon a determination by the lead agency that an application is eligible for a categorical exclusion pursuant National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 implementing regulations. (c) Judicial Action.--(1) The United States Court of Appeals for the circuit in which the export facility will be located pursuant to an application described in subsection (a) shall have original and exclusive jurisdiction over any civil action for the review of-- (A) an order issued by the Department of Energy with respect to such application; or (B) the Department of Energy's failure to issue a final decision on such application. (2) If the Court in a civil action described in paragraph (1) finds that the Department of Energy has failed to issue a final decision on the application as required under subsection (a), the Court shall order the Department of Energy to issue such final decision not later than 30 days after the Court's order. (3) The Court shall set any civil action brought under this subsection for expedited consideration and shall set the matter on the docket as soon as practical after the filing date of the initial pleading. SEC. 3. PUBLIC DISCLOSURE OF EXPORT DESTINATIONS. Section 3 of the Natural Gas Act (15 U.S.C. 717b) is amended by adding at the end the following: ``(g) Public Disclosure of LNG Export Destinations.--As a condition for approval of any authorization to export LNG, the Secretary of Energy shall require the applicant to publicly disclose the specific destination or destinations of any such authorized LNG exports.''. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to House Resolution 48, the gentleman from Kentucky (Mr. Whitfield) and the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Pallone) each will control 30 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Kentucky. General Leave Mr. WHITFIELD. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and to include extraneous material on H.R. 351. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Kentucky? There was no objection. Mr. WHITFIELD. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 351, the LNG Permitting Certainty and Transparency Act sponsored by Congressman Bill Johnson of Ohio. All of us recognize that the economy in the U.S. has been sputtering. We have had great advancements in technology, however, and innovation in hydraulic fracturing and horizontal drilling have led America to become the number one natural gas producing nation in the world. Our natural gas output has rapidly increased since 2005 and is expected to continue rising in the decades ahead in response to growing demand. Plentiful natural gas is helping many domestic energy producers and manufacturers and is spurring new investment and job growth here in America. The Committee on Energy and Commerce has held multiple hearings and forums to discuss the domestic growth in natural gas production and its potential impact on trade, geopolitics, and energy production and consumption in America. We now have the opportunity to bring more of this critical energy resource to other parts of the world while stimulating our energy security, economic growth, and foreign policy. I might add that over the last year, many of us have been really surprised by the number of representatives from other countries in Europe and around the world who are pleading with America to export their natural gas so that those countries are not as dependent upon countries like Russia and others. I might also add that, in 2012, the Department of Energy commissioned a report by NERA Economic Consulting to assess the economic impacts of LNG exports. NERA recently updated this study to include the most current projections from the Energy Information Administration. Like the 2012 study, the update found that U.S. LNG exports will bring widespread economic benefits, touching many parts of our economy, and that those benefits would consistently increase as exports increase. The NERA study also found that the construction of new LNG export projects is estimated to put up to 45,000 unemployed Americans back to work. I might also add that this legislation does not in any way change anything that FERC has responsibility for in approving siting of these natural gas pipelines and facilities for export, so we are not affecting in any way any environmental aspects of it. I might also say that the reason this bill is being introduced is because we think that the Department of Energy has been dragging its feet a little bit. They have responsibility over the commodity of the natural gas, and they have to go through a process. This legislation also applies only to non-free trade agreements that the U.S. deals with. Since 2010, the Department of Energy has issued a final decision on five of the 37 applications to export LNG to countries where the U.S. does not have a free trade agreement. [[Page H646]] Now, DOE's authority to regulate the export of natural gas arises under section 3 of the Natural Gas Act. This provision creates a rebuttable presumption that a proposed export of natural gas is in the public interest. DOE must grant the application unless opponents of the application overcome the presumption, and there are 18 countries where we have these free trade agreements. DOE's process to review applications to export LNG to non-free trade agreement countries is much more complex and unpredictable, and this legislation would help clarify that and create some certainty. It amends section 3 of the Natural Gas Act to give DOE 30 days to issue a final decision on an LNG export application after a complete NEPA environmental review on the facility. Additionally, H.R. 351 provides for expedited judicial reviews by the United States court of appeals for the circuit in which the export facility will be located, and this is important as well. It requires public disclosure of export destinations, so we know where it is going as a condition of approval of authorization to export LNG. This is a very important piece of legislation. I want to commend Mr. Johnson of Ohio for introducing this legislation, and I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to this legislation which is simply unnecessary. The Department of Energy currently conducts a public interest review of all applications to export liquefied natural gas to a country without a free trade agreement with the United States. To date, DOE has approved four such applications to export LNG and has issued conditional approvals to four additional applications. DOE has approved all applications that have completed their required NEPA review, and so there is no backlog or delay at the DOE to speak of. With these permits alone, we have the ability to become one of the largest exporters of natural gas in the world, and so legislation to impose an arbitrary 30-day deadline on DOE, as suggested by the underlying bill, is simply unnecessary. With regard to exporting natural gas, we should keep in mind that low domestic natural gas prices can provide an important competitive advantage to U.S. manufacturing, and simple economics tells us that additional demand due to unrestricted exports can raise domestic natural gas prices, so we should think twice about giving away this advantage for short-term export profits when we are trying hard to rebuild our long-term manufacturing base. We should also remember that the bill will not result in LNG exports to Europe for some time, if at all. Although one LNG export terminal is set to begin full operation later this year, all other terminals remain under construction or are in the planning process. DOE's conditional approval for those facilities allows them to continue moving forward, but this legislation won't help speed up their construction or affect how quickly they can actually operate, so passing this bill today will not magically send LNG from the proposed terminals tomorrow. When the United States actually begins to export significant quantities of LNG, it will most likely go to Asia, not Europe. The export terminals most likely to get constructed have already signed long-term contracts to supply LNG to various customers, and those destinations are primarily in Asia. Mr. Speaker, I oppose this bill because I don't believe the phantom LNG export backlog is one of the pressing issues facing ordinary Americans, and I don't believe that expediting this type of infrastructure is what our country needs most. I believe our country should be encouraging the use of renewable energy resources like wind and solar power. We should be investing in increased energy efficiency and a smart grid. We should be trying to find ways to make our energy infrastructure more resilient and capable of withstanding extreme weather events, like Hurricane Sandy. These are the types of clean energy solutions that America should be investing in, the type that will enhance our energy security, reduce carbon emissions, and lower overall energy costs to customers. Unfortunately, this bill doesn't achieve any of these goals. In fact, the 30-day deadline in the bill could have counterproductive results. If DOE is forced to make a decision before they have determined if the project is in the public interest, it may have no choice but to deny the application, and that outcome certainly doesn't benefit anyone, especially the applicants. This is the third time this month that the Republican majority has brought secondhand energy legislation to the floor, legislation that passed the House last Congress. Like the two bills before it, H.R. 351 would also serve no real purpose. I just hope that we can begin soon to look at new energy legislation that will move America forward in developing a clean energy infrastructure. In the meantime, I would urge my colleagues to vote against this bill, and I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. WHITFIELD. Mr. Speaker, at this time, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Johnson), the author of this legislation. Mr. JOHNSON of Ohio. Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman for yielding. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 351, the LNG Permitting Certainty and Transparency Act. This important legislation will bring certainty to the Department of Energy's review process for LNG export applications, create American jobs, continue spurring America's manufacturing comeback, and provide a stable source of energy to our allies in Europe and around the world. Thanks to the energy renaissance occurring throughout eastern and southeastern Ohio and across the United States, America is able to produce large quantities of natural gas like never before, enough to meet our domestic natural gas demands and export excess LNG to the global marketplace. Through the abundance of natural gas, we have an opportunity to significantly affect geopolitics and to create American jobs, but only if we enact smart policies like H.R. 351. The window of opportunity for LNG exports will not remain open indefinitely, so it is important that Congress act immediately. If Congress fails to act, companies will continue to face regulatory uncertainty, which creates hesitancy in securing financing for constructing LNG terminals, plus nations with near-term energy needs will look elsewhere. Potential geopolitical benefits such as reducing the oppressive influence of other exporters like Russia and Iran, while simultaneously strengthening ties with our allies, could be ultimately jeopardized. Some of my colleagues are concerned that increased LNG exports will not really help our allies in Europe, but that is simply not true. Regardless of where U.S. natural gas is sent, increasing the supply and competition in the international market will provide global consumers with greater choice and, most importantly, increased leverage when negotiating LNG pricing contracts. In fact, by no longer importing such large amounts of LNG, the U.S. has already indirectly helped our European allies. With the passage of this legislation, even more LNG will be free to go to places that need it most. Equally important, if we delay, domestic economic benefits may also fail to materialize, specifically the opportunity to create some 45,000 jobs by 2018 and increase hardworking taxpayer salaries by $1 billion over 6 years. This is a win for manufacturing, especially those who make drilling equipment pipeline components, not to mention the refining, petrochemicals, and chemicals sectors. For these reasons, Congress must pass H.R. 351. To date, DOE has issued a final decision on only five of the 38 pending LNG export applications received since 2010. This is unacceptable. I urge my colleagues to help bring certainty to DOE's approval process, create jobs, help maximize American energy production, and help our allies abroad by voting for this important legislation. Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Rush), the ranking member of the Subcommittee on Energy and Power. [[Page H647]] Mr. RUSH. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the ranking member of the full committee, Mr. Pallone, for his leadership and for his positive contributions to this entire institution. Mr. Speaker, I am here to oppose H.R. 351 because, once again, it is a proposed solution to a problem that we can't find, a problem that we have searched high and low for. This problem, Mr. Speaker, simply doesn't exist. Here we are, here we go once again, coming up with solutions to a problem that doesn't even exist. When will my colleagues on the other side do something productively in this Congress and come up with real solutions to problems that do exist for the American people? Mr. Speaker, currently, the Department of Energy, as we speak today, has already approved not one, not two, not three, not even four, but five applications--five--for existing LNG, and there are four more conditional approvals pending. {time} 0930 Altogether, Mr. Speaker, the approved applications authorize the export of over 10 million cubic feet per day of LNG. The pending applications collectively seek an additional 27.5 billion cubic feet of LNG exported each and every day--27.5. Where is the problem? Show me the problem. Show me the way. Point out the problem. Mr. Speaker, this 30-day deadline that arbitrarily mandates the DOE application process would short-circuit the public interest review-- short circuit--cut it short. The public doesn't have any input. No review by the public. The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Collins of Georgia). The time of the gentleman has expired. Mr. PALLONE. I yield the gentleman an additional 2 minutes. Mr. RUSH. This arbitrary mandatory 30-day deadline would unnecessarily fast-track the DOE to hastily make a decision on export applications, regardless of how complex the application may be. The result of this ambiguous 30-day deadline may negatively affect DOE's ability to soberly and thoroughly assess the impact that cumulative exports may have on natural gas prices. What would be the effect of gas at the station, at the pump, on the American people, and we all of a sudden, without any study, without any conversation, without any consideration, just force the DOE to arbitrarily meet this 30-day deadline? What is going to be the effect on the consumer in terms of these gas prices at the pump? Are they going to skyrocket as a result of this hasty, irresponsible action? Tell me, do you have answers to that? It may even result in the unintended consequence of actually denying applications if the agency does not have the time to complete its due diligence. This is insane. This is the utmost of insanity. Mr. Speaker, I must oppose this bill because at the end of the day when you skim away all of the rhetoric and all the hyperbole around this bill, it will not speed up energy exports to Europe and it will not speed up exports to our other allies. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has again expired. Mr. PALLONE. I yield the gentleman an additional 1 minute. Mr. RUSH. Mr. Speaker, to paraphrase Elvis Presley: let this body return this bill to sender, return it to sender, address unknown, no such problem, no such home. Mr. Speaker, let's send this bill back to committee where it can go through regular order, and we can have a thorough discussion on these important issues before voting on such a consequential bill. Mr. WHITFIELD. Mr. Speaker, at this time, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Gibbs), who has been a real leader in helping America become energy independent. Mr. GIBBS. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of this bill because this is simply a commonsense bill. As you know, the U.S. is now the largest producer of natural gas in the world and has proven gas resources to supply our needs for decades to come. This is an achievement that we have reached despite roadblocks and delays from the executive branch. The latest delay is the Department of Energy's rule from last summer to hold up export terminal applications. This important bill streamlines the review process for LNG exports by requiring a timeline for making a decision and making agencies work together on the review. This is commonsense change, Mr. Speaker. Innovations in the harvesting and production of natural gas have cut energy bills for families across the country. Those are the same innovations that have also made it affordable to ship LNG around the globe. The responsible and safe development of our natural resources through new technologies, such as horizontal drilling, have begun an energy and manufacturing renaissance in America. And who is feeling the benefits? American families and businesses with an affordable and reliable energy supply. But that could all end unless we let the free market work. Let's end the administration's de facto ban on new exports and bring market stability to the global gas market. Let's get the government out of the way, and let's give our American innovators a chance to work. Mr. Speaker, my district, the State of Ohio, and the entire Nation will reap the benefits of more jobs, increased pay, and lower energy costs if we pass this bill. I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 351 and end the self-imposed restrictions on LNG exports. Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, may I ask how much time is remaining on both sides? The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from New Jersey has 21 minutes remaining. The gentleman from Kentucky has 20 minutes remaining. Mr. PALLONE. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. At this time, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Green), who is the ranking member of the Health Subcommittee. (Mr. GENE GREEN of Texas asked and was given permission to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. GENE GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, let me explain the problem we have and the need for this bill today. The bill is the exact same language that passed this House last Congress, and it came through our committee, the Energy and Commerce Committee. Now, what this bill does is give the Department of Energy some deadlines to make a decision on our national interests--that is what it does--so we can do it. They have held those permits sometimes up to 2 years to make that determination. If you have a free trade agreement with the United States, we can export natural gas to you. But they need to decide the national interests. I want the DOE to do that, but I also want to make a decision in very quick time. We know who our friends are, we know who our adversaries are. We don't really want to send it to our adversaries, we want to send it to our friends. So that is DOE's job. The reason we need this bill is that right now today, or yesterday, gas is $2.88 per million cubic feet. It was up about $4, which is still not great for a producer. But what we have been doing in south Texas is flaring natural gas. It is bad for the environment. It is bad for the people who produce it because they don't have a customer. And what we need to do is be able to export what we can't use. In Texas we are very proud of Blue Bell ice cream. In fact, their advertising slogan is: ``We eat all we can and we sell the rest.'' I have a chemical industry, I have a utility industry that uses natural gas. They are using it. But we still have a lot of production. So why would we not use all we can in our country and sell the rest and make somebody else pay for those jobs that we have in our community? And that is the problem. We know the price of oil is going down. But oil and natural gas sometimes come out of the same well. So that is why we need to make sure that we have the right, on a reasonable timeframe, to export natural gas to countries that we want to be friendly with. I would love to have a natural gas export right now to Ukraine. The infrastructure over there is not there. It could get there with some reversing pipelines. H.R. 351 represents a bipartisan effort to legislate and warrant its approval. [[Page H648]] We worked together on this bill, and it represents that hard work. The bill is good for the economy, the climate, and the U.S. security interests. The United States has natural resources to become the largest exporter of LNG in the world. Our natural gas reserves can meet all our domestic natural gas needs and still have an excess capacity of 3 trillion cubic feet. Before we discuss H.R. 351 it is important we clarify the LNG permitting process, just so there is no confusion. A project applicant must submit two separate applications: the first to the Department of Energy and the second to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, FERC. In the Department of Energy, there are two complete separate processes. First, the project must submit an application to export. If the project sends LNG to a country with which the U.S. has a free trade agreement, the application is automatically approved. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired. Mr. PALLONE. I yield the gentleman an additional 2 minutes. Mr. GENE GREEN of Texas. I thank the ranking member. I appreciate it. If the project sends the LNG to a country without a free trade agreement, then the DOE must issue a permit based on the public interest. These are very important determinations. However, LNG will not leave the United States with DOE approval only. For a project to actually export LNG, in either case, the applicant must receive a FERC permit. FERC reviews the environmental impacts of the actual LNG facility. FERC conducts and reviews all environmental impacts to satisfy the requirements of NEPA. No company will export a single cubic foot of LNG without FERC approval. FERC's process takes 12 to 18 months and costs approximately $100 million. We have worked extremely hard to protect the environment. It is the DOE non-FTA process that is the problem. The DOE currently has approximately 30 non-FTA permits awaiting decision. The DOE has held most of these permits almost 4 years. Even the DOE recognized this huge problem and tried to address the backlog last summer by changing the approval process. Unfortunately, the changes failed to expedite approval or provide any certainty to companies who are investing $100 million, and these are U.S. companies. H.R. 351 resolved this issue only after it receives all environmental permits. H.R. 351 would place a 30-day timeline for the DOE to issue a decision after the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission completes its environmental reviews. Once again, we have protected the environmental review process. We have protected the public interest. And DOE, which held some of these applications 4 years--we cannot allow DOE to sit on these permits any longer. They must do their job and do it in a timely fashion. Opponents of H.R. 351 say if all permits are approved, we will export more than 35 trillion cubic feet. Opponents say exports will double or triple domestic natural gas prices. Opponents say exports of that size will endanger our domestic industry, raise electricity prices, and have ruinous effects on our economy. Mr. Speaker, I urge passage of the bill. Mr. Speaker, I represent enormous petrochemical facilities, power generators, and workers. I remember when domestic natural gas prices caused companies in my district to move jobs overseas. If what opponents of H.R. 351 say were even remotely possible, I would be the first one to oppose this bill. My constituents work at those facilities. Those facilities pay taxes and fund the hospitals and schools in my district. There are dozens of applications pending at DOE. No more than a handful of projects will be constructed and ultimately export LNG. But each project deserves a fair opportunity at review. Each company deserves the opportunity to pursue financing in the capital markets. The government should not make those decisions. Each LNG facility costs billions, not to mention the jobs associated with pipeline construction, electric transmission, local services, etc. I ask my colleagues to support H.R. 351 and support this bipartisan effort. Mr. WHITFIELD. At this time, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Turner), who has been a real leader on helping America become energy independent. Mr. TURNER. Mr. Speaker, U.S. natural gas exports will create American jobs and will bolster our strategic partnerships. I serve as president of the NATO Parliamentary Assembly, and many foreign leaders and officials have expressed to me their need for energy diversification. As you know, Russia, the largest supplier of natural gas to Europe, has repeatedly used natural gas pricing to draw governments closer to its orbit and punished West-leaning governments with higher prices. U.S. natural gas exports will foster a more dynamic and competitive world energy market, helping to curb the use of energy as a political weapon. And regardless of where natural gas from the United States is shipped, increasing supply in the global market will help international customers with greater choice and leverage to negotiate prices. In fact, the Obama administration has made this exact same argument. The State Department's energy envoy recently stated: Now where the gas will go doesn't matter. The fact that we have approved exports of natural gas has already had an impact on Europe. And where the molecule actually ends up going also doesn't matter. Now, I understand there have been questions about whether or not European countries, such as Ukraine, are prepared to receive U.S. natural gas. Many of our European allies are implementing infrastructure projects to diversify their natural gas resources. For example, Poland and Lithuania are opening LNG import terminals to reduce their dependence on Russian gas. Just last week, Poland and Ukraine announced an agreement to construct a pipeline that will allow Ukraine to access natural gas from two LNG import terminals, potentially from the United States. England and Spain already have contracts in place to receive U.S. natural gas. These are just a few examples of how these infrastructure projects will help Europe diversify its natural gas resources. Mr. Speaker, last year, President Obama, in a joint statement with European leaders, welcomed U.S. natural gas exports to help our European allies and our strategic partners. I am encouraged by the President's statements. These words must be followed by action. The President must work with Congress to enact H.R. 351. I urge all of my colleagues to support it. {time} 0945 Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I have heard my colleagues suggest that there is a delay in the DOE's approval of LNG export applications. For instance, on Monday night at the Rules Committee, Mr. Johnson indicated that the DOE has approved only five out of 38 applications since 2010. Even if the gentleman from Ohio is correct in his assertion, the fact is that the five applications approved by the Obama administration since 2010 are five more than were approved by the Reagan administration or by either Bush administration. In fact, it is five more than were approved by the Clinton, Carter, Ford, or Nixon administration. In 2011, the DOE approved the first LNG export application for the Cheniere Sabine Pass facility. That facility is set to become operational at the end of this year. That was the DOE's first approval to export LNG since the 1960s. The dramatic growth of natural gas production and supply in the United States was considered impossible a decade ago, so the DOE commissioned a study to help it decide how to address additional applications. After establishing a transparent and systematic system for reviewing and authorizing LNG export applications, the DOE began to rapidly issue decisions. The record demonstrates that the DOE has moved aggressively to authorize LNG exports, granting three additional final authorizations and four conditional approvals since August of 2013. To date, the DOE has approved the export of enough LNG to make the United States the world leader in LNG exports. All other pending applications are still under review at FERC, not at the DOE, so it is important to understand that this bill does not change the [[Page H649]] FERC review process--the site approvals, the environmental approvals. I would also remind my colleagues that the DOE automatically deems LNG exports to free trade agreement countries to be in the public interest. Before the DOE can issue a decision on the pending applications, both FERC approval and construction will need to be completed. That could take months or, more likely, years, but this bill will not affect that timeline, which will be the critical factor in how much more gas can be exported. That is why I want to emphasize that this bill is unnecessary and will not materially change the LNG export situation anytime soon. I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. WHITFIELD. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Upton), the chairman of the Energy and Commerce Committee. Mr. UPTON. Mr. Speaker, they say that you can't have too much of a good thing, but with our impressive natural gas production, that is exactly what we have today. We now have so much natural gas that we cannot only meet our own energy needs and still have extra to sell, but our natural gas boom can be used as a force for good here at home as a source for jobs and across the globe as a source of stable energy. There is no question that the whole shale revolution helped break the fever of the Great Recession. Thanks to innovation and technological advancement, energy production remained a welcome bright spot in our national economy, but we aren't out of the woods yet. We all know that. Millions of folks, certainly in Michigan and across the country, still find themselves unemployed, underemployed, or facing stagnant paychecks. This bill, this legislation, will help accelerate their return to full employment. At the request of the Department of Energy, NERA Economic Consulting evaluated the economic impacts of U.S. LNG exports. The NERA study showed a net positive impact to the United States economy and estimated that LNG exports would actually reduce the average number of unemployed workers by as much as 45,000 people by 2018. We will also see tens of thousands of additional jobs created in the supply chain. I am talking about good-paying jobs that will help families achieve a better life. The bill will also advance our foreign policy goals. U.S. LNG exports can provide our allies with a secure and affordable supply of energy and can reduce the influence of hostile exporting nations like Russia, which continues to threaten Ukraine and, really, all of Europe's natural gas supply. Passing this bill will send the welcome signal to our allies in Eastern Europe that, yes, an alternative source of energy is on its way. The domestic and geopolitical benefits make increasing U.S. LNG exports a win-win, but the Department of Energy continues to hold up the process. Since 2010, the DOE has only issued a final decision on five applications to export LNG to countries with which we don't share a free trade agreement. This bill would help jump-start approvals so that we can start creating jobs and sending our surplus gas to those countries that need it the most. It would give the DOE 30 days to issue a decision following the completion of the environmental review. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired. Mr. WHITFIELD. I yield the gentleman an additional 30 seconds. Mr. UPTON. The U.S. is now a global energy superpower, and with that power, we have a chance to do some real good. Saying ``yes'' to energy is good for workers here at home and is good for global allies. I thank Representative Bill Johnson for his leadership on this issue, and I would hope that everybody would support this bipartisan piece of legislation. Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Under the current approval process for LNG exports, the Department of Energy has a tool to protect American consumers, and that tool is the public interest determination. The DOE has the ability to weigh the benefits and costs of additional LNG exports, including the impact of increased domestic natural gas prices on consumers, who use gas to heat and cool their homes and to turn on the lights. Rigid deadlines, as suggested in this legislation, could prevent the DOE from conducting a meaningful public interest review, and that means that the DOE might not be able to ensure that high levels of LNG exports do not harm American consumers by raising the costs of electricity or home heating or cooling. I think consumers, Mr. Speaker, have reason to be concerned. Experts at the nonpartisan U.S. Energy Information Administration examined this issue, and here is what they found: In the scenarios with additional gas exports, consumers will consume less and pay more on both their natural gas and electricity bills. Furthermore, the EIA calculated that high levels of LNG exports could mean increased residential, commercial, and industrial consumer energy costs of $7 billion to $14 billion per year between 2020 and 2040. Make no mistake. American consumers will foot that bill. Recent experience with gasoline and propane exports also offers cautionary tales. The Midwest and Northeast experienced sharp propane price spikes and shortages last winter. Significant increases in propane exports were a key factor in the skyrocketing prices that hurt consumers. Just yesterday, the Center for American Progress released an analysis on the potential impact of expanded LNG exports on consumers. They found that, in 2020, residential consumers would pay 4.3 percent more for natural gas per year, and those in the Midwest--in States like Arkansas, Louisiana, and Texas--would be the hardest hit by price increases. By 2040, consumers in the mid-Atlantic States would pay 10 percent more for natural gas per year. These figures are not insignificant. We need to make sure that LNG exports do not hurt consumers. Right now, the DOE has the ability to do that. So, before we disregard any meaningful public interest review and allow the unrestricted exporting of LNG, let's be sure that our constituents won't be left footing the bill. I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. WHITFIELD. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the distinguished gentleman from Texas (Mr. Babin). Mr. BABIN. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 351, the LNG Permitting Certainty and Transparency Act. America's energy producers and the tens of thousands of Americans they employ stand ready to meet the demand for a reliable and secure source of natural gas from America and the world. They have completed their reviews, have passed their tests, and are ready to get to work, but there is one big problem--the Obama administration is standing in the way. The President and his anti- American energy agenda have placed a de facto ban on LNG exports by logjamming their requests and using bureaucratic red tape to block America's progress. This bill breaks the bureaucratic gridlock and expedites the approval of LNG exports. I have seen firsthand the jobs and the opportunities that an LNG facility has created for the people of east Texas, in my district. Let's help the American worker by approving H.R. 351. Mr. PALLONE. Again, Mr. Speaker, may I ask the time that remains on both sides. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from New Jersey has 11 minutes remaining, and the gentleman from Kentucky has 13 minutes remaining. Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from New York (Mr. Tonko), who is the ranking member of our Environment Subcommittee. Mr. TONKO. I thank the gentleman from New Jersey. Mr. Speaker, it is unfortunate that we are beginning the 114th Congress the way we ended the previous one--with legislation that is more about message than about solving real problems. The message of H.R. 351 is that we are interested in elevating the interests of the oil and gas industry above any others. Consumers will not benefit from this policy, and manufacturers will not benefit from this policy. Eliminating the public interest determination sends that message clearly. [[Page H650]] In spite of the assertions by its supporters, H.R. 351 won't do much for our allies either, especially those in Europe or Ukraine. The bill fixes no problem. There is no backlog of applications at the Department of Energy. Japan, our ally and the world's largest purchaser of LNG, has three importers who signed contracts in 2013 with three approved LNG export facilities, those being Freeport, Cameron, and Cove Point. Because natural gas is such an important and strategic resource, we should, if anything, be questioning the administration about the wisdom of issuing so many approvals. Why? They are relying on assumptions, models, and estimates of recoverable domestic gas reserves that are very uncertain and that have been decreasing as new information becomes available. Exporters sign these contracts to guarantee deliveries for some 10 to 20 years. I am not willing to risk price spikes for consumers, families, and small businesses or to risk the benefits of lower gas prices for our manufacturing sector for a slightly improved trade balance. I am unwilling to repeal the requirement for a consideration of the public interest before more export facilities are approved, not for a resource that is so strategic and widely used. H.R. 351 does not fix any real problems, but it could, indeed, help to create some. Therefore, Mr. Speaker, I urge the defeat of this bill. Mr. WHITFIELD. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from California (Mr. McCarthy), the distinguished majority leader. Mr. McCARTHY. I thank the gentleman for yielding. Mr. Speaker, the President likes to talk about infrastructure. In his State of the Union Address, he said that there is bipartisan support for infrastructure legislation and that Republicans and Democrats need to ``set our sights higher than a single oil pipeline.'' We have listened, and we have done that. After passing a bill to approve Keystone, this House passed another bill last week to reform the natural gas permitting process. Now the House is on its third energy infrastructure bill with Representative Bill Johnson's LNG Permitting Certainty and Transparency Act. I know the President doesn't pay much attention to what goes on here on Capitol Hill, but three infrastructure bills in 3 weeks is hard to miss. Here are some other numbers, Mr. Speaker, that I think the President really should remember: though the Department of Energy has received 37 permits in the past 5 years, it has only approved five permits in that time. That is one a year. If the President cared about infrastructure as much as he says, I think he would get his administration to process the rest of them now. Passing this bill would also lead to the creation of an estimated 45,000 jobs. More permit approvals mean more opportunity. More opportunity requires more infrastructure. More infrastructure means more jobs. Delay has become a hallmark of this Presidency, but Americans are done delaying job creation by ignoring America's energy abundance. {time} 1000 American energy supports American jobs. It supports a strong economy. It also gives our friends--like Ukraine, our allies--an alternative source of energy, diluting the power countries like Russia and Iran who use their oil to coerce and even oppress. Mr. Speaker, the President should know that here in the House we have set our sights very high; but, Mr. Speaker, the question is: Will the President set his sights higher than his veto pen? Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Rush). Mr. RUSH. Mr. Speaker, again, I wanted to return to the floor because the thought occurs to me, as it should to all of the American people, that we should consider the impact of this bill, the impact of LNG exports, and the impact that it would have on U.S. manufacturing. Mr. Speaker, at the end of the day, let us protect, by all means, American jobs. Let us protect American manufacturing. Cheap domestic natural gas prices are providing a big boost and competitive advantage to U.S. manufacturing. We can all agree on that on both sides of the aisle. Mr. Speaker, the disagreement occurs when the other side, the Republicans, are asking us in this Congress to make a hasty decision that could undermine the advantage that we are now experiencing in the rapid increase in manufacturing. This bill runs the risk of reducing our competitive advantage that we have now in the manufacturing sector. It requires DOE to rush its process and make final decisions on pending applications to export a huge quantity of LNG. If all of the pending applications are granted, DOE will authorize the export of approximately 38 million cubic feet per day of LNG. That is more than half of the total U.S. natural gas consumption. It is more than the world's largest LNG exporter, Qatar, currently makes each and every day. There is no question, Mr. Speaker, in my mind or in the minds of the American people that exports of that magnitude will increase the domestic price of natural gas. It just makes common sense, and it is what the EIA found when it studied the economic impact of increased LNG imports. Where is your study? How do you answer the conclusions of the EIA when it found again that the economic impact of increased influence will increase the domestic price of natural gas? What amount of American manufacturing? What amount of American jobs? Let's protect American manufacturing. Let's protect American jobs. Because this bill truncates DOE's public interest review, the Department may not even be able to fully analyze the impacts of the very high level of LNG exports on American consumers, on American jobs, and on American manufacturing. My friends on the other side--and they are indeed my friends--always want to talk about American manufacturing, how we have to support American manufacturing, how we have to raise the level of American manufacturing, how we have to increase the American manufacturing sector, how we have to increase the American manufacturing jobs. This very bill could undermine all that sense of goodwill and all those pronouncements from the other side. What about American manufacturing and what about American manufacturing jobs? Don't abandon American manufacturing. Don't abandon American manufacturing jobs. Don't abandon the American people. Let's slow this process down. All we are doing, Mr. Speaker, is jeopardizing American manufacturing and American manufacturing jobs. Mr. WHITFIELD. Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my time. Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, in closing, as the ranking member of the Energy and Commerce Committee, I am committed to developing sound energy policy, and that policy surely includes consideration of the role that natural gas can play in our energy mix. Our energy picture is changing every year. The latest development is low oil prices, but we have other developments in recent years, including rapidly increasing domestic production of oil and natural gas and a welcomed increase in wind and solar electricity production. We are becoming more efficient, but our energy infrastructure is becoming outdated. We need to look at the ways we produce and use energy, but we also need to look at the ways that we move, transmit, and store energy. We need to innovate in the energy space, but we also need to maintain reliability and lower energy bills. We need to look at all our energy issues through the lens of climate change and public health. Mr. Speaker, I think there are legitimate questions about whether we want to send our natural gas to other countries. That might help our trade balance, but it would have negative impacts on our domestic manufacturing sector. I don't claim that I have all the answers. I know that we looked at some of these issues last Congress, but I don't agree that a clear consensus emerged. In any event, this is a new [[Page H651]] Congress with scores of new Members who have never looked at this issue before. I think we should take these issues back to the Energy and Commerce Committee and let the committee and its 12 new members do its job. Let us look at the facts again as they are today, not last year or last Congress. I think if we were to do that, we would see that even if this legislation was once necessary, it isn't anymore. DOE has modernized its process and any backlog that once existed isn't an issue at this point. DOE and the administration have opened the way for LNG exports, but I think it continues to be necessary for us to assess whether approving an application for additional export is in the public interest because becoming the world's largest exporter of natural gas is not something we should do lightly, unadvisedly, or without the latest facts. This January, we have spent much of our time bringing bills from last Congress to the floor and rushing them through to the Senate, which is still considering the Keystone legislation we passed the first week of this year. I think we might well have served ourselves and the American people better by sitting down together in the Energy and Commerce Committee and working carefully on an energy policy aimed at the future rather than at an energy policy aimed at the past. I am going to vote ``no'' on this legislation, and I encourage my colleagues to oppose it as well. I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. WHITFIELD. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. The former speaker, the distinguished gentleman from Illinois, talked a lot about the impact on the manufacturing base in America this legislation might have. I would like to point out that the National Association of Manufacturers, which is the largest manufacturing association in the United States, representing manufacturers in every industrial sector in all 50 States, in a letter dated yesterday, urges Members to support H.R. 351. They go on to say that it is important to ensure that ``market forces, rather than bureaucratic inertia, govern international trade.'' That is really what this legislation is all about; it is about market forces. Representatives from countries around the world are coming to us and asking for this product. We are fortunate in America that we have an abundance of natural gas. In fact, the Energy Information Agency reported today that it is so abundant that natural gas prices have dropped to their lowest level since September 2012. Earlier, there was an expression of concern about increased natural gas prices. We understand that prices go up and prices go down, but right now, they are at their lowest level since September 2012, and when natural gas prices go down too low, you see less production. That increases prices as well. We didn't just wake up one day and decide to introduce this legislation. Concerned groups involved in this business came to Congress and said: We need some help. When we started having hearings on this a year and 2 years ago, the Department of Energy started trying to speed up the process a little bit, but we are not dictating what their decision should be on allowing the export to non-free trade agreement countries. We are just saying: You need to make the decision sooner, and we want some transparency. That is all this legislation is about. Now, we understand that any time you talk in today's world about exporting a fossil fuel, one of the undercurrents is climate change, and I would remind everyone that CO 2 emissions in America are the lowest that they have been in 20 years. This country does not have to take a backseat to any country in the world, and so we want the market to play its role. This is a good, commonsense piece of legislation that will create jobs in America, will encourage the expansion of more natural gas production at a time when the world needs it and we need it. I would urge every Member of this House to vote in favor of H.R. 351, and I yield back the balance of my time. Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise to speak in opposition to H.R. 351, the ``LNG Permitting Certainty and Transparency Act.'' Mr. Speaker, I am not anti-energy exploration. I am not anti-trade. I am, however strongly ``pro-jobs,'' ``pro-economic growth,'' and ``pro- sustainable environment.'' As a Member of Congress from Houston I have always been mindful of the importance of, and have strongly advocated for, national energy policies that will make our nation energy independent, preserve and create jobs, and keep our nation's economy strong. That is why I carefully consider each energy legislative proposal brought to the floor on its individual merits and support them when they are sound, balanced, fair, and promote the national interest. Where they fall short, I believe in working across the aisle to improve them if possible by offering constructive amendments. Although I believe the nation would benefit by increased exports of natural gas, the legislation before contains several provisions that are of great concern to me. Pursuant to Section 2, subsection (a) of the bill, an application for authorization to export LNG is ``deemed'' approved if the Department of Energy (DOE) or other federal agencies do not approve or deny the application within 30 days of the conclusion of the site review. I have three concerns with this regulatory scheme. First, as a senior member of the Committee on the Judiciary, I have a problem with ``deeming'' something done that has not been done in fact. Thus, the provision is unwise. Second, this provision is a remedy in search of a problem. There is no lengthy or intolerable backlog of neglected natural gas export authority applications awaiting action by DOE. The provision is unnecessary because DOE has to date authorized the export of over 10 billion cubic feet per day of LNG to non-Free Trade Agreement countries. Together with exports to FTA countries, this level of LNG exports that would transform the United States into one of the world's largest exporters. Third, the provision is irresponsible because it would require DOE and other agencies to make decisions based on incomplete information or information that may not be available within the stringent deadlines, and to deny applications that otherwise would have been approved, but for lack of sufficient review time. Supporters of this bill argue that it is vital, in the face of Russian aggression and restrictions, to provide our allies in Europe with additional exports of LNG. However, because actual exports through approved terminals are not expected to begin until late 2015, this legislation will have no impact on current exports. And, limiting the time for review would prevent DOE from properly analyzing the domestic impact that of exporting large amounts of LNG. The Energy Information Administration (EIA) estimates that increased exports could result in an increase of as much as 8 percent in domestic LNG prices. Given the inherent delicacy involved in assessing the impact of trade authorizations, both domestically and abroad, this state of affairs is likely to lead to DOE erring on the side of caution and denying applications that may otherwise have been approved if it had more time and more resources to carry out its responsibilities. For these reasons, I urge all Members to oppose the bill before us and urge my colleagues to join me. The SPEAKER pro tempore. All time for debate has expired. Pursuant to House Resolution 48, the previous question is ordered on the bill. The question is on the engrossment and third reading of the bill. The bill was ordered to be engrossed and read a third time, and was read the third time. Motion to Recommit Mr. GARAMENDI. Mr. Speaker, I have a motion to recommit at the desk. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is the gentleman opposed to the bill? Mr. GARAMENDI. I am opposed. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Clerk will report the motion to recommit. The Clerk read as follows: Mr. Garamendi moves to recommit the bill, H.R. 351, to the Committee on Energy and Commerce with instructions to report the same back to the House forthwith with the following amendment: At the end of the bill, insert the following new section: SEC. 4. PROTECTING OUR NATIONAL SECURITY AND CREATING AMERICAN JOBS. In reviewing an application for authorization to export natural gas under section 3 of the Natural Gas Act (15 U.S.C. 717b), the Department of Energy-- (1) shall deny such application if the natural gas would be exported to any nation [[Page H652]] that is a state sponsor of terrorism or otherwise threatens America's national security, or to any nation or corporation that steals America's military technology or intellectual property through cyber-attacks; and (2) shall require, as a condition for approval of any such authorization, the applicant to ensure that United States- flagged and built ships and shipping containers are used to export the LNG as such vessels become available for charter. Mr. WHITFIELD (during the reading). Mr. Speaker, I reserve a point of order against the motion to recommit. The SPEAKER pro tempore. A point of order is reserved. The Clerk will continue to read. The Clerk continued to read. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from California is recognized for 5 minutes in support of his motion. Mr. GARAMENDI. Mr. Speaker, this final amendment to the bill will not kill the bill. Frankly, it will substantially improve it. It won't send it back to committee. If adopted, the bill will come to the floor for a vote later this morning. We have heard a lot of discussion here about jobs in the Rules Committee, and I thank the chair, Mr. Whitfield, for his interest in this particular proposal and for the Rules Committee listening to the debate very carefully about how we can significantly advance America's national interest. {time} 1015 Natural gas is a strategic asset. It has allowed us to substantially reduce our energy costs in the United States; replace, re-power many of our power plants; bring down the cost; and, frankly, lead to an increased manufacturing sector. Shipbuilding is also a strategic national asset. Our Navy depends upon it. However, 107,000 Americans work in the shipbuilding industry in our ports and ship yards. It is a strategic asset, as are the mariners. American mariners are also a strategic asset. What we are trying to do with this amendment is to bring together these three strategic assets of America and advance the American economy and our national security at the same time. This amendment would simply require that if we are going to export liquefied natural gas, a strategic asset, then we should do it in a way that advances our national security and our economy by requiring that those ships be manned and ``womanned'' by American mariners, the captains, the engineers, the sailors, that they be American. This is a safety issue. Natural gas is a very volatile issue, and, under current law, when it is imported, it has to have American mariners on board. Similarly, by requiring that the ships be American-built, we will be able to employ several hundred thousand new men and women in our shipyards. If it is about jobs--and we all claim this bill is about jobs--then let's take it another step. Let's take it another step, so that we really rebuild the American shipping industry, that we put American mariners to work, that we revitalize our shipyards, so that our U.S. Navy will be able to have a robust competition for their ships. There are 117 shipyards in the United States that build ships. None of them, yet, build these tankers. They could if we pass this amendment. Let's build it in America. Let's make it in America. This is a strategy that is employed by India, which has a tender out to buy gas from the United States. That tender requires that three of the ships used to transport that be built in India. I say let's build the other seven in the United States. They want American natural gas; build the ships in America. We know that this is a big industry. Cheniere needs 100 ships when they begin to ship natural gas, LNG, from their new terminal in Texas-- 100 ships. Are those American ships? No, not without this amendment. Those ships will be Chinese ships in Chinese shipyards built by Chinese. How about America? How about building it in America? That is what this amendment is about. We can all agree that we want American jobs. Is there one among the 435 of us who wants the jobs to be in China or Korea or Japan? I don't think so. Let's do it in America. This is an American-made amendment. This is an amendment for American workers, American shipyards. This is not going to kill the bill. This is going to make this bill into a real ``Make It In America,'' a real American jobs bill with hundreds of thousands of jobs spread throughout this Nation. Mr. Chairman, work with us. Make this into a real, robust American jobs bill. Adopt this amendment. Put aside the normal game we play with MTRs, which is just kind of a Kabuki dance here. Let's do it for the American workers, for the American shipyards all across this Nation. That is what this is about. This is an unexpected opportunity that has come about because of our great natural gas industry here. Take advantage of it. Think about the national security. Think about our shipyards, the U.S. Navy, the mariners. Make it in America. Adopt this amendment. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. WHITFIELD. Mr. Speaker, I withdraw my reservation of a point of order. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The reservation of the point of order is withdrawn. Mr. WHITFIELD. Mr. Speaker, I claim the time in opposition to the motion. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Kentucky is recognized for 5 minutes in opposition to the motion. Mr. WHITFIELD. Mr. Speaker, first of all, I want to thank the gentleman from California for offering this motion to recommit. It has two basic parts to it. The first part relates to denying applications of natural gas that would be exported to any nation that is a state- sponsored terrorist. We feel quite confident that, under the existing law and under H.R. 351, the Department of Energy is not going to approve the export of natural gas that is going to be in the public interest to any terrorist state. The second question, which is a very important question--and as I said in the Rules Committee and say on the floor, I am delighted that Mr. Garamendi has raised this issue about U.S.-flagged ships being involved in the export. As you know, his amendment goes to the Jones Act, and the Jones Act, as we all know, requires U.S.-flagged ships between ports here in the United States, but it does not expand to export and the use in other countries, and that raises a much broader issue than this very narrow- focused bill. I do think that that discussion needs to take place at some point in time, but, at this time, I am going to respectfully request the Members to reject the motion to recommit. I, and others, would look forward to talking to Mr. Garamendi in more detail about a broader debate on what impact expanding the Jones Act would have on our international trade. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Without objection, the previous question is ordered on the motion to recommit. There was no objection. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion to recommit. The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that the noes appeared to have it. Mr. GARAMENDI. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays. The yeas and nays were ordered. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 9 of rule XX, the Speaker will reduce to 5 minutes the minimum time for any electronic vote on the question of passage of the bill.

Mr. Speaker, pursuant to House Resolution 48, I call up the bill (H.R. 351) to provide for expedited approval of exportation of natural gas, and for other purposes, and ask for its immediate consideration in the House. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The text of the bill is as follows: H.R. 351 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. This Act may be cited as the ``LNG Permitting Certainty and Transparency Act''. SEC. 2. ACTION ON APPLICATIONS. (a) Decision Deadline.--For proposals that must also obtain authorization from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission or the United States Maritime Administration to site, construct, expand, or operate LNG export facilities, the Department of Energy shall issue a final decision on any application for the authorization to export natural gas under section 3 of the Natural Gas Act (15 U.S.C. 717b) not later than 30 days after the later of-- (1) the conclusion of the review to site, construct, expand, or operate the LNG facilities required by the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (42 U.S. C. 4321 et seq.); or (2) the date of enactment of this Act. (b) Conclusion of Review.--For purposes of subsection (a), review required by the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 shall be considered concluded-- (1) for a project requiring an Environmental Impact Statement, 30 days after publication of a Final Environmental Impact Statement; (2) for a project for which an Environmental Assessment has been prepared, 30 days after publication by the Department of Energy of a Finding of No Significant Impact; and (3) upon a determination by the lead agency that an application is eligible for a categorical exclusion pursuant National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 implementing regulations. (c) Judicial Action.--(1) The United States Court of Appeals for the circuit in which the export facility will be located pursuant to an application described in subsection (a) shall have original and exclusive jurisdiction over any civil action for the review of-- (A) an order issued by the Department of Energy with respect to such application; or (B) the Department of Energy's failure to issue a final decision on such application. (2) If the Court in a civil action described in paragraph (1) finds that the Department of Energy has failed to issue a final decision on the application as required under subsection (a), the Court shall order the Department of Energy to issue such final decision not later than 30 days after the Court's order. (3) The Court shall set any civil action brought under this subsection for expedited consideration and shall set the matter on the docket as soon as practical after the filing date of the initial pleading. SEC. 3. PUBLIC DISCLOSURE OF EXPORT DESTINATIONS. Section 3 of the Natural Gas Act (15 U.S.C. 717b) is amended by adding at the end the following: ``(g) Public Disclosure of LNG Export Destinations.--As a condition for approval of any authorization to export LNG, the Secretary of Energy shall require the applicant to publicly disclose the specific destination or destinations of any such authorized LNG exports.''. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to House Resolution 48, the gentleman from Kentucky (Mr. Whitfield) and the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Pallone) each will control 30 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Kentucky. General Leave Mr. WHITFIELD. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and to include extraneous material on H.R. 351. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Kentucky? There was no objection. Mr. WHITFIELD. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 351, the LNG Permitting Certainty and Transparency Act sponsored by Congressman Bill Johnson of Ohio. All of us recognize that the economy in the U.S. has been sputtering. We have had great advancements in technology, however, and innovation in hydraulic fracturing and horizontal drilling have led America to become the number one natural gas producing nation in the world. Our natural gas output has rapidly increased since 2005 and is expected to continue rising in the decades ahead in response to growing demand. Plentiful natural gas is helping many domestic energy producers and manufacturers and is spurring new investment and job growth here in America. The Committee on Energy and Commerce has held multiple hearings and forums to discuss the domestic growth in natural gas production and its potential impact on trade, geopolitics, and energy production and consumption in America. We now have the opportunity to bring more of this critical energy resource to other parts of the world while stimulating our energy security, economic growth, and foreign policy. I might add that over the last year, many of us have been really surprised by the number of representatives from other countries in Europe and around the world who are pleading with America to export their natural gas so that those countries are not as dependent upon countries like Russia and others. I might also add that, in 2012, the Department of Energy commissioned a report by NERA Economic Consulting to assess the economic impacts of LNG exports. NERA recently updated this study to include the most current projections from the Energy Information Administration. Like the 2012 study, the update found that U.S. LNG exports will bring widespread economic benefits, touching many parts of our economy, and that those benefits would consistently increase as exports increase. The NERA study also found that the construction of new LNG export projects is estimated to put up to 45,000 unemployed Americans back to work. I might also add that this legislation does not in any way change anything that FERC has responsibility for in approving siting of these natural gas pipelines and facilities for export, so we are not affecting in any way any environmental aspects of it. I might also say that the reason this bill is being introduced is because we think that the Department of Energy has been dragging its feet a little bit. They have responsibility over the commodity of the natural gas, and they have to go through a process. This legislation also applies only to non-free trade agreements that the U.S. deals with. Since 2010, the Department of Energy has issued a final decision on five of the 37 applications to export LNG to countries where the U.S. does not have a free trade agreement. [[Page H646]] Now, DOE's authority to regulate the export of natural gas arises under section 3 of the Natural Gas Act. This provision creates a rebuttable presumption that a proposed export of natural gas is in the public interest. DOE must grant the application unless opponents of the application overcome the presumption, and there are 18 countries where we have these free trade agreements. DOE's process to review applications to export LNG to non-free trade agreement countries is much more complex and unpredictable, and this legislation would help clarify that and create some certainty. It amends section 3 of the Natural Gas Act to give DOE 30 days to issue a final decision on an LNG export application after a complete NEPA environmental review on the facility. Additionally, H.R. 351 provides for expedited judicial reviews by the United States court of appeals for the circuit in which the export facility will be located, and this is important as well. It requires public disclosure of export destinations, so we know where it is going as a condition of approval of authorization to export LNG. This is a very important piece of legislation. I want to commend Mr. Johnson of Ohio for introducing this legislation, and I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to this legislation which is simply unnecessary. The Department of Energy currently conducts a public interest review of all applications to export liquefied natural gas to a country without a free trade agreement with the United States. To date, DOE has approved four such applications to export LNG and has issued conditional approvals to four additional applications. DOE has approved all applications that have completed their required NEPA review, and so there is no backlog or delay at the DOE to speak of. With these permits alone, we have the ability to become one of the largest exporters of natural gas in the world, and so legislation to impose an arbitrary 30-day deadline on DOE, as suggested by the underlying bill, is simply unnecessary. With regard to exporting natural gas, we should keep in mind that low domestic natural gas prices can provide an important competitive advantage to U.S. manufacturing, and simple economics tells us that additional demand due to unrestricted exports can raise domestic natural gas prices, so we should think twice about giving away this advantage for short-term export profits when we are trying hard to rebuild our long-term manufacturing base. We should also remember that the bill will not result in LNG exports to Europe for some time, if at all. Although one LNG export terminal is set to begin full operation later this year, all other terminals remain under construction or are in the planning process. DOE's conditional approval for those facilities allows them to continue moving forward, but this legislation won't help speed up their construction or affect how quickly they can actually operate, so passing this bill today will not magically send LNG from the proposed terminals tomorrow. When the United States actually begins to export significant quantities of LNG, it will most likely go to Asia, not Europe. The export terminals most likely to get constructed have already signed long-term contracts to supply LNG to various customers, and those destinations are primarily in Asia. Mr. Speaker, I oppose this bill because I don't believe the phantom LNG export backlog is one of the pressing issues facing ordinary Americans, and I don't believe that expediting this type of infrastructure is what our country needs most. I believe our country should be encouraging the use of renewable energy resources like wind and solar power. We should be investing in increased energy efficiency and a smart grid. We should be trying to find ways to make our energy infrastructure more resilient and capable of withstanding extreme weather events, like Hurricane Sandy. These are the types of clean energy solutions that America should be investing in, the type that will enhance our energy security, reduce carbon emissions, and lower overall energy costs to customers. Unfortunately, this bill doesn't achieve any of these goals. In fact, the 30-day deadline in the bill could have counterproductive results. If DOE is forced to make a decision before they have determined if the project is in the public interest, it may have no choice but to deny the application, and that outcome certainly doesn't benefit anyone, especially the applicants. This is the third time this month that the Republican majority has brought secondhand energy legislation to the floor, legislation that passed the House last Congress. Like the two bills before it, H.R. 351 would also serve no real purpose. I just hope that we can begin soon to look at new energy legislation that will move America forward in developing a clean energy infrastructure. In the meantime, I would urge my colleagues to vote against this bill, and I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. WHITFIELD. Mr. Speaker, at this time, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Johnson), the author of this legislation. Mr. JOHNSON of Ohio. Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman for yielding. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 351, the LNG Permitting Certainty and Transparency Act. This important legislation will bring certainty to the Department of Energy's review process for LNG export applications, create American jobs, continue spurring America's manufacturing comeback, and provide a stable source of energy to our allies in Europe and around the world. Thanks to the energy renaissance occurring throughout eastern and southeastern Ohio and across the United States, America is able to produce large quantities of natural gas like never before, enough to meet our domestic natural gas demands and export excess LNG to the global marketplace. Through the abundance of natural gas, we have an opportunity to significantly affect geopolitics and to create American jobs, but only if we enact smart policies like H.R. 351. The window of opportunity for LNG exports will not remain open indefinitely, so it is important that Congress act immediately. If Congress fails to act, companies will continue to face regulatory uncertainty, which creates hesitancy in securing financing for constructing LNG terminals, plus nations with near-term energy needs will look elsewhere. Potential geopolitical benefits such as reducing the oppressive influence of other exporters like Russia and Iran, while simultaneously strengthening ties with our allies, could be ultimately jeopardized. Some of my colleagues are concerned that increased LNG exports will not really help our allies in Europe, but that is simply not true. Regardless of where U.S. natural gas is sent, increasing the supply and competition in the international market will provide global consumers with greater choice and, most importantly, increased leverage when negotiating LNG pricing contracts. In fact, by no longer importing such large amounts of LNG, the U.S. has already indirectly helped our European allies. With the passage of this legislation, even more LNG will be free to go to places that need it most. Equally important, if we delay, domestic economic benefits may also fail to materialize, specifically the opportunity to create some 45,000 jobs by 2018 and increase hardworking taxpayer salaries by $1 billion over 6 years. This is a win for manufacturing, especially those who make drilling equipment pipeline components, not to mention the refining, petrochemicals, and chemicals sectors. For these reasons, Congress must pass H.R. 351. To date, DOE has issued a final decision on only five of the 38 pending LNG export applications received since 2010. This is unacceptable. I urge my colleagues to help bring certainty to DOE's approval process, create jobs, help maximize American energy production, and help our allies abroad by voting for this important legislation. Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Rush), the ranking member of the Subcommittee on Energy and Power. [[Page H647]] Mr. RUSH. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the ranking member of the full committee, Mr. Pallone, for his leadership and for his positive contributions to this entire institution. Mr. Speaker, I am here to oppose H.R. 351 because, once again, it is a proposed solution to a problem that we can't find, a problem that we have searched high and low for. This problem, Mr. Speaker, simply doesn't exist. Here we are, here we go once again, coming up with solutions to a problem that doesn't even exist. When will my colleagues on the other side do something productively in this Congress and come up with real solutions to problems that do exist for the American people? Mr. Speaker, currently, the Department of Energy, as we speak today, has already approved not one, not two, not three, not even four, but five applications--five--for existing LNG, and there are four more conditional approvals pending. {time} 0930 Altogether, Mr. Speaker, the approved applications authorize the export of over 10 million cubic feet per day of LNG. The pending applications collectively seek an additional 27.5 billion cubic feet of LNG exported each and every day--27.5. Where is the problem? Show me the problem. Show me the way. Point out the problem. Mr. Speaker, this 30-day deadline that arbitrarily mandates the DOE application process would short-circuit the public interest review-- short circuit--cut it short. The public doesn't have any input. No review by the public. The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Collins of Georgia). The time of the gentleman has expired. Mr. PALLONE. I yield the gentleman an additional 2 minutes. Mr. RUSH. This arbitrary mandatory 30-day deadline would unnecessarily fast-track the DOE to hastily make a decision on export applications, regardless of how complex the application may be. The result of this ambiguous 30-day deadline may negatively affect DOE's ability to soberly and thoroughly assess the impact that cumulative exports may have on natural gas prices. What would be the effect of gas at the station, at the pump, on the American people, and we all of a sudden, without any study, without any conversation, without any consideration, just force the DOE to arbitrarily meet this 30-day deadline? What is going to be the effect on the consumer in terms of these gas prices at the pump? Are they going to skyrocket as a result of this hasty, irresponsible action? Tell me, do you have answers to that? It may even result in the unintended consequence of actually denying applications if the agency does not have the time to complete its due diligence. This is insane. This is the utmost of insanity. Mr. Speaker, I must oppose this bill because at the end of the day when you skim away all of the rhetoric and all the hyperbole around this bill, it will not speed up energy exports to Europe and it will not speed up exports to our other allies. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has again expired. Mr. PALLONE. I yield the gentleman an additional 1 minute. Mr. RUSH. Mr. Speaker, to paraphrase Elvis Presley: let this body return this bill to sender, return it to sender, address unknown, no such problem, no such home. Mr. Speaker, let's send this bill back to committee where it can go through regular order, and we can have a thorough discussion on these important issues before voting on such a consequential bill. Mr. WHITFIELD. Mr. Speaker, at this time, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Gibbs), who has been a real leader in helping America become energy independent. Mr. GIBBS. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of this bill because this is simply a commonsense bill. As you know, the U.S. is now the largest producer of natural gas in the world and has proven gas resources to supply our needs for decades to come. This is an achievement that we have reached despite roadblocks and delays from the executive branch. The latest delay is the Department of Energy's rule from last summer to hold up export terminal applications. This important bill streamlines the review process for LNG exports by requiring a timeline for making a decision and making agencies work together on the review. This is commonsense change, Mr. Speaker. Innovations in the harvesting and production of natural gas have cut energy bills for families across the country. Those are the same innovations that have also made it affordable to ship LNG around the globe. The responsible and safe development of our natural resources through new technologies, such as horizontal drilling, have begun an energy and manufacturing renaissance in America. And who is feeling the benefits? American families and businesses with an affordable and reliable energy supply. But that could all end unless we let the free market work. Let's end the administration's de facto ban on new exports and bring market stability to the global gas market. Let's get the government out of the way, and let's give our American innovators a chance to work. Mr. Speaker, my district, the State of Ohio, and the entire Nation will reap the benefits of more jobs, increased pay, and lower energy costs if we pass this bill. I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 351 and end the self-imposed restrictions on LNG exports. Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, may I ask how much time is remaining on both sides? The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from New Jersey has 21 minutes remaining. The gentleman from Kentucky has 20 minutes remaining. Mr. PALLONE. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. At this time, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Green), who is the ranking member of the Health Subcommittee. (Mr. GENE GREEN of Texas asked and was given permission to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. GENE GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, let me explain the problem we have and the need for this bill today. The bill is the exact same language that passed this House last Congress, and it came through our committee, the Energy and Commerce Committee. Now, what this bill does is give the Department of Energy some deadlines to make a decision on our national interests--that is what it does--so we can do it. They have held those permits sometimes up to 2 years to make that determination. If you have a free trade agreement with the United States, we can export natural gas to you. But they need to decide the national interests. I want the DOE to do that, but I also want to make a decision in very quick time. We know who our friends are, we know who our adversaries are. We don't really want to send it to our adversaries, we want to send it to our friends. So that is DOE's job. The reason we need this bill is that right now today, or yesterday, gas is $2.88 per million cubic feet. It was up about $4, which is still not great for a producer. But what we have been doing in south Texas is flaring natural gas. It is bad for the environment. It is bad for the people who produce it because they don't have a customer. And what we need to do is be able to export what we can't use. In Texas we are very proud of Blue Bell ice cream. In fact, their advertising slogan is: ``We eat all we can and we sell the rest.'' I have a chemical industry, I have a utility industry that uses natural gas. They are using it. But we still have a lot of production. So why would we not use all we can in our country and sell the rest and make somebody else pay for those jobs that we have in our community? And that is the problem. We know the price of oil is going down. But oil and natural gas sometimes come out of the same well. So that is why we need to make sure that we have the right, on a reasonable timeframe, to export natural gas to countries that we want to be friendly with. I would love to have a natural gas export right now to Ukraine. The infrastructure over there is not there. It could get there with some reversing pipelines. H.R. 351 represents a bipartisan effort to legislate and warrant its approval. [[Page H648]] We worked together on this bill, and it represents that hard work. The bill is good for the economy, the climate, and the U.S. security interests. The United States has natural resources to become the largest exporter of LNG in the world. Our natural gas reserves can meet all our domestic natural gas needs and still have an excess capacity of 3 trillion cubic feet. Before we discuss H.R. 351 it is important we clarify the LNG permitting process, just so there is no confusion. A project applicant must submit two separate applications: the first to the Department of Energy and the second to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, FERC. In the Department of Energy, there are two complete separate processes. First, the project must submit an application to export. If the project sends LNG to a country with which the U.S. has a free trade agreement, the application is automatically approved. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired. Mr. PALLONE. I yield the gentleman an additional 2 minutes. Mr. GENE GREEN of Texas. I thank the ranking member. I appreciate it. If the project sends the LNG to a country without a free trade agreement, then the DOE must issue a permit based on the public interest. These are very important determinations. However, LNG will not leave the United States with DOE approval only. For a project to actually export LNG, in either case, the applicant must receive a FERC permit. FERC reviews the environmental impacts of the actual LNG facility. FERC conducts and reviews all environmental impacts to satisfy the requirements of NEPA. No company will export a single cubic foot of LNG without FERC approval. FERC's process takes 12 to 18 months and costs approximately $100 million. We have worked extremely hard to protect the environment. It is the DOE non-FTA process that is the problem. The DOE currently has approximately 30 non-FTA permits awaiting decision. The DOE has held most of these permits almost 4 years. Even the DOE recognized this huge problem and tried to address the backlog last summer by changing the approval process. Unfortunately, the changes failed to expedite approval or provide any certainty to companies who are investing $100 million, and these are U.S. companies. H.R. 351 resolved this issue only after it receives all environmental permits. H.R. 351 would place a 30-day timeline for the DOE to issue a decision after the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission completes its environmental reviews. Once again, we have protected the environmental review process. We have protected the public interest. And DOE, which held some of these applications 4 years--we cannot allow DOE to sit on these permits any longer. They must do their job and do it in a timely fashion. Opponents of H.R. 351 say if all permits are approved, we will export more than 35 trillion cubic feet. Opponents say exports will double or triple domestic natural gas prices. Opponents say exports of that size will endanger our domestic industry, raise electricity prices, and have ruinous effects on our economy. Mr. Speaker, I urge passage of the bill. Mr. Speaker, I represent enormous petrochemical facilities, power generators, and workers. I remember when domestic natural gas prices caused companies in my district to move jobs overseas. If what opponents of H.R. 351 say were even remotely possible, I would be the first one to oppose this bill. My constituents work at those facilities. Those facilities pay taxes and fund the hospitals and schools in my district. There are dozens of applications pending at DOE. No more than a handful of projects will be constructed and ultimately export LNG. But each project deserves a fair opportunity at review. Each company deserves the opportunity to pursue financing in the capital markets. The government should not make those decisions. Each LNG facility costs billions, not to mention the jobs associated with pipeline construction, electric transmission, local services, etc. I ask my colleagues to support H.R. 351 and support this bipartisan effort. Mr. WHITFIELD. At this time, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Turner), who has been a real leader on helping America become energy independent. Mr. TURNER. Mr. Speaker, U.S. natural gas exports will create American jobs and will bolster our strategic partnerships. I serve as president of the NATO Parliamentary Assembly, and many foreign leaders and officials have expressed to me their need for energy diversification. As you know, Russia, the largest supplier of natural gas to Europe, has repeatedly used natural gas pricing to draw governments closer to its orbit and punished West-leaning governments with higher prices. U.S. natural gas exports will foster a more dynamic and competitive world energy market, helping to curb the use of energy as a political weapon. And regardless of where natural gas from the United States is shipped, increasing supply in the global market will help international customers with greater choice and leverage to negotiate prices. In fact, the Obama administration has made this exact same argument. The State Department's energy envoy recently stated: Now where the gas will go doesn't matter. The fact that we have approved exports of natural gas has already had an impact on Europe. And where the molecule actually ends up going also doesn't matter. Now, I understand there have been questions about whether or not European countries, such as Ukraine, are prepared to receive U.S. natural gas. Many of our European allies are implementing infrastructure projects to diversify their natural gas resources. For example, Poland and Lithuania are opening LNG import terminals to reduce their dependence on Russian gas. Just last week, Poland and Ukraine announced an agreement to construct a pipeline that will allow Ukraine to access natural gas from two LNG import terminals, potentially from the United States. England and Spain already have contracts in place to receive U.S. natural gas. These are just a few examples of how these infrastructure projects will help Europe diversify its natural gas resources. Mr. Speaker, last year, President Obama, in a joint statement with European leaders, welcomed U.S. natural gas exports to help our European allies and our strategic partners. I am encouraged by the President's statements. These words must be followed by action. The President must work with Congress to enact H.R. 351. I urge all of my colleagues to support it. {time} 0945 Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I have heard my colleagues suggest that there is a delay in the DOE's approval of LNG export applications. For instance, on Monday night at the Rules Committee, Mr. Johnson indicated that the DOE has approved only five out of 38 applications since 2010. Even if the gentleman from Ohio is correct in his assertion, the fact is that the five applications approved by the Obama administration since 2010 are five more than were approved by the Reagan administration or by either Bush administration. In fact, it is five more than were approved by the Clinton, Carter, Ford, or Nixon administration. In 2011, the DOE approved the first LNG export application for the Cheniere Sabine Pass facility. That facility is set to become operational at the end of this year. That was the DOE's first approval to export LNG since the 1960s. The dramatic growth of natural gas production and supply in the United States was considered impossible a decade ago, so the DOE commissioned a study to help it decide how to address additional applications. After establishing a transparent and systematic system for reviewing and authorizing LNG export applications, the DOE began to rapidly issue decisions. The record demonstrates that the DOE has moved aggressively to authorize LNG exports, granting three additional final authorizations and four conditional approvals since August of 2013. To date, the DOE has approved the export of enough LNG to make the United States the world leader in LNG exports. All other pending applications are still under review at FERC, not at the DOE, so it is important to understand that this bill does not change the [[Page H649]] FERC review process--the site approvals, the environmental approvals. I would also remind my colleagues that the DOE automatically deems LNG exports to free trade agreement countries to be in the public interest. Before the DOE can issue a decision on the pending applications, both FERC approval and construction will need to be completed. That could take months or, more likely, years, but this bill will not affect that timeline, which will be the critical factor in how much more gas can be exported. That is why I want to emphasize that this bill is unnecessary and will not materially change the LNG export situation anytime soon. I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. WHITFIELD. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Upton), the chairman of the Energy and Commerce Committee. Mr. UPTON. Mr. Speaker, they say that you can't have too much of a good thing, but with our impressive natural gas production, that is exactly what we have today. We now have so much natural gas that we cannot only meet our own energy needs and still have extra to sell, but our natural gas boom can be used as a force for good here at home as a source for jobs and across the globe as a source of stable energy. There is no question that the whole shale revolution helped break the fever of the Great Recession. Thanks to innovation and technological advancement, energy production remained a welcome bright spot in our national economy, but we aren't out of the woods yet. We all know that. Millions of folks, certainly in Michigan and across the country, still find themselves unemployed, underemployed, or facing stagnant paychecks. This bill, this legislation, will help accelerate their return to full employment. At the request of the Department of Energy, NERA Economic Consulting evaluated the economic impacts of U.S. LNG exports. The NERA study showed a net positive impact to the United States economy and estimated that LNG exports would actually reduce the average number of unemployed workers by as much as 45,000 people by 2018. We will also see tens of thousands of additional jobs created in the supply chain. I am talking about good-paying jobs that will help families achieve a better life. The bill will also advance our foreign policy goals. U.S. LNG exports can provide our allies with a secure and affordable supply of energy and can reduce the influence of hostile exporting nations like Russia, which continues to threaten Ukraine and, really, all of Europe's natural gas supply. Passing this bill will send the welcome signal to our allies in Eastern Europe that, yes, an alternative source of energy is on its way. The domestic and geopolitical benefits make increasing U.S. LNG exports a win-win, but the Department of Energy continues to hold up the process. Since 2010, the DOE has only issued a final decision on five applications to export LNG to countries with which we don't share a free trade agreement. This bill would help jump-start approvals so that we can start creating jobs and sending our surplus gas to those countries that need it the most. It would give the DOE 30 days to issue a decision following the completion of the environmental review. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired. Mr. WHITFIELD. I yield the gentleman an additional 30 seconds. Mr. UPTON. The U.S. is now a global energy superpower, and with that power, we have a chance to do some real good. Saying ``yes'' to energy is good for workers here at home and is good for global allies. I thank Representative Bill Johnson for his leadership on this issue, and I would hope that everybody would support this bipartisan piece of legislation. Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Under the current approval process for LNG exports, the Department of Energy has a tool to protect American consumers, and that tool is the public interest determination. The DOE has the ability to weigh the benefits and costs of additional LNG exports, including the impact of increased domestic natural gas prices on consumers, who use gas to heat and cool their homes and to turn on the lights. Rigid deadlines, as suggested in this legislation, could prevent the DOE from conducting a meaningful public interest review, and that means that the DOE might not be able to ensure that high levels of LNG exports do not harm American consumers by raising the costs of electricity or home heating or cooling. I think consumers, Mr. Speaker, have reason to be concerned. Experts at the nonpartisan U.S. Energy Information Administration examined this issue, and here is what they found: In the scenarios with additional gas exports, consumers will consume less and pay more on both their natural gas and electricity bills. Furthermore, the EIA calculated that high levels of LNG exports could mean increased residential, commercial, and industrial consumer energy costs of $7 billion to $14 billion per year between 2020 and 2040. Make no mistake. American consumers will foot that bill. Recent experience with gasoline and propane exports also offers cautionary tales. The Midwest and Northeast experienced sharp propane price spikes and shortages last winter. Significant increases in propane exports were a key factor in the skyrocketing prices that hurt consumers. Just yesterday, the Center for American Progress released an analysis on the potential impact of expanded LNG exports on consumers. They found that, in 2020, residential consumers would pay 4.3 percent more for natural gas per year, and those in the Midwest--in States like Arkansas, Louisiana, and Texas--would be the hardest hit by price increases. By 2040, consumers in the mid-Atlantic States would pay 10 percent more for natural gas per year. These figures are not insignificant. We need to make sure that LNG exports do not hurt consumers. Right now, the DOE has the ability to do that. So, before we disregard any meaningful public interest review and allow the unrestricted exporting of LNG, let's be sure that our constituents won't be left footing the bill. I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. WHITFIELD. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the distinguished gentleman from Texas (Mr. Babin). Mr. BABIN. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 351, the LNG Permitting Certainty and Transparency Act. America's energy producers and the tens of thousands of Americans they employ stand ready to meet the demand for a reliable and secure source of natural gas from America and the world. They have completed their reviews, have passed their tests, and are ready to get to work, but there is one big problem--the Obama administration is standing in the way. The President and his anti- American energy agenda have placed a de facto ban on LNG exports by logjamming their requests and using bureaucratic red tape to block America's progress. This bill breaks the bureaucratic gridlock and expedites the approval of LNG exports. I have seen firsthand the jobs and the opportunities that an LNG facility has created for the people of east Texas, in my district. Let's help the American worker by approving H.R. 351. Mr. PALLONE. Again, Mr. Speaker, may I ask the time that remains on both sides. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from New Jersey has 11 minutes remaining, and the gentleman from Kentucky has 13 minutes remaining. Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from New York (Mr. Tonko), who is the ranking member of our Environment Subcommittee. Mr. TONKO. I thank the gentleman from New Jersey. Mr. Speaker, it is unfortunate that we are beginning the 114th Congress the way we ended the previous one--with legislation that is more about message than about solving real problems. The message of H.R. 351 is that we are interested in elevating the interests of the oil and gas industry above any others. Consumers will not benefit from this policy, and manufacturers will not benefit from this policy. Eliminating the public interest determination sends that message clearly. [[Page H650]] In spite of the assertions by its supporters, H.R. 351 won't do much for our allies either, especially those in Europe or Ukraine. The bill fixes no problem. There is no backlog of applications at the Department of Energy. Japan, our ally and the world's largest purchaser of LNG, has three importers who signed contracts in 2013 with three approved LNG export facilities, those being Freeport, Cameron, and Cove Point. Because natural gas is such an important and strategic resource, we should, if anything, be questioning the administration about the wisdom of issuing so many approvals. Why? They are relying on assumptions, models, and estimates of recoverable domestic gas reserves that are very uncertain and that have been decreasing as new information becomes available. Exporters sign these contracts to guarantee deliveries for some 10 to 20 years. I am not willing to risk price spikes for consumers, families, and small businesses or to risk the benefits of lower gas prices for our manufacturing sector for a slightly improved trade balance. I am unwilling to repeal the requirement for a consideration of the public interest before more export facilities are approved, not for a resource that is so strategic and widely used. H.R. 351 does not fix any real problems, but it could, indeed, help to create some. Therefore, Mr. Speaker, I urge the defeat of this bill. Mr. WHITFIELD. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from California (Mr. McCarthy), the distinguished majority leader. Mr. McCARTHY. I thank the gentleman for yielding. Mr. Speaker, the President likes to talk about infrastructure. In his State of the Union Address, he said that there is bipartisan support for infrastructure legislation and that Republicans and Democrats need to ``set our sights higher than a single oil pipeline.'' We have listened, and we have done that. After passing a bill to approve Keystone, this House passed another bill last week to reform the natural gas permitting process. Now the House is on its third energy infrastructure bill with Representative Bill Johnson's LNG Permitting Certainty and Transparency Act. I know the President doesn't pay much attention to what goes on here on Capitol Hill, but three infrastructure bills in 3 weeks is hard to miss. Here are some other numbers, Mr. Speaker, that I think the President really should remember: though the Department of Energy has received 37 permits in the past 5 years, it has only approved five permits in that time. That is one a year. If the President cared about infrastructure as much as he says, I think he would get his administration to process the rest of them now. Passing this bill would also lead to the creation of an estimated 45,000 jobs. More permit approvals mean more opportunity. More opportunity requires more infrastructure. More infrastructure means more jobs. Delay has become a hallmark of this Presidency, but Americans are done delaying job creation by ignoring America's energy abundance. {time} 1000 American energy supports American jobs. It supports a strong economy. It also gives our friends--like Ukraine, our allies--an alternative source of energy, diluting the power countries like Russia and Iran who use their oil to coerce and even oppress. Mr. Speaker, the President should know that here in the House we have set our sights very high; but, Mr. Speaker, the question is: Will the President set his sights higher than his veto pen? Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Rush). Mr. RUSH. Mr. Speaker, again, I wanted to return to the floor because the thought occurs to me, as it should to all of the American people, that we should consider the impact of this bill, the impact of LNG exports, and the impact that it would have on U.S. manufacturing. Mr. Speaker, at the end of the day, let us protect, by all means, American jobs. Let us protect American manufacturing. Cheap domestic natural gas prices are providing a big boost and competitive advantage to U.S. manufacturing. We can all agree on that on both sides of the aisle. Mr. Speaker, the disagreement occurs when the other side, the Republicans, are asking us in this Congress to make a hasty decision that could undermine the advantage that we are now experiencing in the rapid increase in manufacturing. This bill runs the risk of reducing our competitive advantage that we have now in the manufacturing sector. It requires DOE to rush its process and make final decisions on pending applications to export a huge quantity of LNG. If all of the pending applications are granted, DOE will authorize the export of approximately 38 million cubic feet per day of LNG. That is more than half of the total U.S. natural gas consumption. It is more than the world's largest LNG exporter, Qatar, currently makes each and every day. There is no question, Mr. Speaker, in my mind or in the minds of the American people that exports of that magnitude will increase the domestic price of natural gas. It just makes common sense, and it is what the EIA found when it studied the economic impact of increased LNG imports. Where is your study? How do you answer the conclusions of the EIA when it found again that the economic impact of increased influence will increase the domestic price of natural gas? What amount of American manufacturing? What amount of American jobs? Let's protect American manufacturing. Let's protect American jobs. Because this bill truncates DOE's public interest review, the Department may not even be able to fully analyze the impacts of the very high level of LNG exports on American consumers, on American jobs, and on American manufacturing. My friends on the other side--and they are indeed my friends--always want to talk about American manufacturing, how we have to support American manufacturing, how we have to raise the level of American manufacturing, how we have to increase the American manufacturing sector, how we have to increase the American manufacturing jobs. This very bill could undermine all that sense of goodwill and all those pronouncements from the other side. What about American manufacturing and what about American manufacturing jobs? Don't abandon American manufacturing. Don't abandon American manufacturing jobs. Don't abandon the American people. Let's slow this process down. All we are doing, Mr. Speaker, is jeopardizing American manufacturing and American manufacturing jobs. Mr. WHITFIELD. Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my time. Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, in closing, as the ranking member of the Energy and Commerce Committee, I am committed to developing sound energy policy, and that policy surely includes consideration of the role that natural gas can play in our energy mix. Our energy picture is changing every year. The latest development is low oil prices, but we have other developments in recent years, including rapidly increasing domestic production of oil and natural gas and a welcomed increase in wind and solar electricity production. We are becoming more efficient, but our energy infrastructure is becoming outdated. We need to look at the ways we produce and use energy, but we also need to look at the ways that we move, transmit, and store energy. We need to innovate in the energy space, but we also need to maintain reliability and lower energy bills. We need to look at all our energy issues through the lens of climate change and public health. Mr. Speaker, I think there are legitimate questions about whether we want to send our natural gas to other countries. That might help our trade balance, but it would have negative impacts on our domestic manufacturing sector. I don't claim that I have all the answers. I know that we looked at some of these issues last Congress, but I don't agree that a clear consensus emerged. In any event, this is a new [[Page H651]] Congress with scores of new Members who have never looked at this issue before. I think we should take these issues back to the Energy and Commerce Committee and let the committee and its 12 new members do its job. Let us look at the facts again as they are today, not last year or last Congress. I think if we were to do that, we would see that even if this legislation was once necessary, it isn't anymore. DOE has modernized its process and any backlog that once existed isn't an issue at this point. DOE and the administration have opened the way for LNG exports, but I think it continues to be necessary for us to assess whether approving an application for additional export is in the public interest because becoming the world's largest exporter of natural gas is not something we should do lightly, unadvisedly, or without the latest facts. This January, we have spent much of our time bringing bills from last Congress to the floor and rushing them through to the Senate, which is still considering the Keystone legislation we passed the first week of this year. I think we might well have served ourselves and the American people better by sitting down together in the Energy and Commerce Committee and working carefully on an energy policy aimed at the future rather than at an energy policy aimed at the past. I am going to vote ``no'' on this legislation, and I encourage my colleagues to oppose it as well. I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. WHITFIELD. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. The former speaker, the distinguished gentleman from Illinois, talked a lot about the impact on the manufacturing base in America this legislation might have. I would like to point out that the National Association of Manufacturers, which is the largest manufacturing association in the United States, representing manufacturers in every industrial sector in all 50 States, in a letter dated yesterday, urges Members to support H.R. 351. They go on to say that it is important to ensure that ``market forces, rather than bureaucratic inertia, govern international trade.'' That is really what this legislation is all about; it is about market forces. Representatives from countries around the world are coming to us and asking for this product. We are fortunate in America that we have an abundance of natural gas. In fact, the Energy Information Agency reported today that it is so abundant that natural gas prices have dropped to their lowest level since September 2012. Earlier, there was an expression of concern about increased natural gas prices. We understand that prices go up and prices go down, but right now, they are at their lowest level since September 2012, and when natural gas prices go down too low, you see less production. That increases prices as well. We didn't just wake up one day and decide to introduce this legislation. Concerned groups involved in this business came to Congress and said: We need some help. When we started having hearings on this a year and 2 years ago, the Department of Energy started trying to speed up the process a little bit, but we are not dictating what their decision should be on allowing the export to non-free trade agreement countries. We are just saying: You need to make the decision sooner, and we want some transparency. That is all this legislation is about. Now, we understand that any time you talk in today's world about exporting a fossil fuel, one of the undercurrents is climate change, and I would remind everyone that CO 2 emissions in America are the lowest that they have been in 20 years. This country does not have to take a backseat to any country in the world, and so we want the market to play its role. This is a good, commonsense piece of legislation that will create jobs in America, will encourage the expansion of more natural gas production at a time when the world needs it and we need it. I would urge every Member of this House to vote in favor of H.R. 351, and I yield back the balance of my time. Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise to speak in opposition to H.R. 351, the ``LNG Permitting Certainty and Transparency Act.'' Mr. Speaker, I am not anti-energy exploration. I am not anti-trade. I am, however strongly ``pro-jobs,'' ``pro-economic growth,'' and ``pro- sustainable environment.'' As a Member of Congress from Houston I have always been mindful of the importance of, and have strongly advocated for, national energy policies that will make our nation energy independent, preserve and create jobs, and keep our nation's economy strong. That is why I carefully consider each energy legislative proposal brought to the floor on its individual merits and support them when they are sound, balanced, fair, and promote the national interest. Where they fall short, I believe in working across the aisle to improve them if possible by offering constructive amendments. Although I believe the nation would benefit by increased exports of natural gas, the legislation before contains several provisions that are of great concern to me. Pursuant to Section 2, subsection (a) of the bill, an application for authorization to export LNG is ``deemed'' approved if the Department of Energy (DOE) or other federal agencies do not approve or deny the application within 30 days of the conclusion of the site review. I have three concerns with this regulatory scheme. First, as a senior member of the Committee on the Judiciary, I have a problem with ``deeming'' something done that has not been done in fact. Thus, the provision is unwise. Second, this provision is a remedy in search of a problem. There is no lengthy or intolerable backlog of neglected natural gas export authority applications awaiting action by DOE. The provision is unnecessary because DOE has to date authorized the export of over 10 billion cubic feet per day of LNG to non-Free Trade Agreement countries. Together with exports to FTA countries, this level of LNG exports that would transform the United States into one of the world's largest exporters. Third, the provision is irresponsible because it would require DOE and other agencies to make decisions based on incomplete information or information that may not be available within the stringent deadlines, and to deny applications that otherwise would have been approved, but for lack of sufficient review time. Supporters of this bill argue that it is vital, in the face of Russian aggression and restrictions, to provide our allies in Europe with additional exports of LNG. However, because actual exports through approved terminals are not expected to begin until late 2015, this legislation will have no impact on current exports. And, limiting the time for review would prevent DOE from properly analyzing the domestic impact that of exporting large amounts of LNG. The Energy Information Administration (EIA) estimates that increased exports could result in an increase of as much as 8 percent in domestic LNG prices. Given the inherent delicacy involved in assessing the impact of trade authorizations, both domestically and abroad, this state of affairs is likely to lead to DOE erring on the side of caution and denying applications that may otherwise have been approved if it had more time and more resources to carry out its responsibilities. For these reasons, I urge all Members to oppose the bill before us and urge my colleagues to join me. The SPEAKER pro tempore. All time for debate has expired. Pursuant to House Resolution 48, the previous question is ordered on the bill. The question is on the engrossment and third reading of the bill. The bill was ordered to be engrossed and read a third time, and was read the third time. Motion to Recommit Mr. GARAMENDI. Mr. Speaker, I have a motion to recommit at the desk. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is the gentleman opposed to the bill? Mr. GARAMENDI. I am opposed. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Clerk will report the motion to recommit. The Clerk read as follows: Mr. Garamendi moves to recommit the bill, H.R. 351, to the Committee on Energy and Commerce with instructions to report the same back to the House forthwith with the following amendment: At the end of the bill, insert the following new section: SEC. 4. PROTECTING OUR NATIONAL SECURITY AND CREATING AMERICAN JOBS. In reviewing an application for authorization to export natural gas under section 3 of the Natural Gas Act (15 U.S.C. 717b), the Department of Energy-- (1) shall deny such application if the natural gas would be exported to any nation [[Page H652]] that is a state sponsor of terrorism or otherwise threatens America's national security, or to any nation or corporation that steals America's military technology or intellectual property through cyber-attacks; and (2) shall require, as a condition for approval of any such authorization, the applicant to ensure that United States- flagged and built ships and shipping containers are used to export the LNG as such vessels become available for charter. Mr. WHITFIELD (during the reading). Mr. Speaker, I reserve a point of order against the motion to recommit. The SPEAKER pro tempore. A point of order is reserved. The Clerk will continue to read. The Clerk continued to read. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from California is recognized for 5 minutes in support of his motion. Mr. GARAMENDI. Mr. Speaker, this final amendment to the bill will not kill the bill. Frankly, it will substantially improve it. It won't send it back to committee. If adopted, the bill will come to the floor for a vote later this morning. We have heard a lot of discussion here about jobs in the Rules Committee, and I thank the chair, Mr. Whitfield, for his interest in this particular proposal and for the Rules Committee listening to the debate very carefully about how we can significantly advance America's national interest. {time} 1015 Natural gas is a strategic asset. It has allowed us to substantially reduce our energy costs in the United States; replace, re-power many of our power plants; bring down the cost; and, frankly, lead to an increased manufacturing sector. Shipbuilding is also a strategic national asset. Our Navy depends upon it. However, 107,000 Americans work in the shipbuilding industry in our ports and ship yards. It is a strategic asset, as are the mariners. American mariners are also a strategic asset. What we are trying to do with this amendment is to bring together these three strategic assets of America and advance the American economy and our national security at the same time. This amendment would simply require that if we are going to export liquefied natural gas, a strategic asset, then we should do it in a way that advances our national security and our economy by requiring that those ships be manned and ``womanned'' by American mariners, the captains, the engineers, the sailors, that they be American. This is a safety issue. Natural gas is a very volatile issue, and, under current law, when it is imported, it has to have American mariners on board. Similarly, by requiring that the ships be American-built, we will be able to employ several hundred thousand new men and women in our shipyards. If it is about jobs--and we all claim this bill is about jobs--then let's take it another step. Let's take it another step, so that we really rebuild the American shipping industry, that we put American mariners to work, that we revitalize our shipyards, so that our U.S. Navy will be able to have a robust competition for their ships. There are 117 shipyards in the United States that build ships. None of them, yet, build these tankers. They could if we pass this amendment. Let's build it in America. Let's make it in America. This is a strategy that is employed by India, which has a tender out to buy gas from the United States. That tender requires that three of the ships used to transport that be built in India. I say let's build the other seven in the United States. They want American natural gas; build the ships in America. We know that this is a big industry. Cheniere needs 100 ships when they begin to ship natural gas, LNG, from their new terminal in Texas-- 100 ships. Are those American ships? No, not without this amendment. Those ships will be Chinese ships in Chinese shipyards built by Chinese. How about America? How about building it in America? That is what this amendment is about. We can all agree that we want American jobs. Is there one among the 435 of us who wants the jobs to be in China or Korea or Japan? I don't think so. Let's do it in America. This is an American-made amendment. This is an amendment for American workers, American shipyards. This is not going to kill the bill. This is going to make this bill into a real ``Make It In America,'' a real American jobs bill with hundreds of thousands of jobs spread throughout this Nation. Mr. Chairman, work with us. Make this into a real, robust American jobs bill. Adopt this amendment. Put aside the normal game we play with MTRs, which is just kind of a Kabuki dance here. Let's do it for the American workers, for the American shipyards all across this Nation. That is what this is about. This is an unexpected opportunity that has come about because of our great natural gas industry here. Take advantage of it. Think about the national security. Think about our shipyards, the U.S. Navy, the mariners. Make it in America. Adopt this amendment. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. WHITFIELD. Mr. Speaker, I withdraw my reservation of a point of order. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The reservation of the point of order is withdrawn. Mr. WHITFIELD. Mr. Speaker, I claim the time in opposition to the motion. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Kentucky is recognized for 5 minutes in opposition to the motion. Mr. WHITFIELD. Mr. Speaker, first of all, I want to thank the gentleman from California for offering this motion to recommit. It has two basic parts to it. The first part relates to denying applications of natural gas that would be exported to any nation that is a state- sponsored terrorist. We feel quite confident that, under the existing law and under H.R. 351, the Department of Energy is not going to approve the export of natural gas that is going to be in the public interest to any terrorist state. The second question, which is a very important question--and as I said in the Rules Committee and say on the floor, I am delighted that Mr. Garamendi has raised this issue about U.S.-flagged ships being involved in the export. As you know, his amendment goes to the Jones Act, and the Jones Act, as we all know, requires U.S.-flagged ships between ports here in the United States, but it does not expand to export and the use in other countries, and that raises a much broader issue than this very narrow- focused bill. I do think that that discussion needs to take place at some point in time, but, at this time, I am going to respectfully request the Members to reject the motion to recommit. I, and others, would look forward to talking to Mr. Garamendi in more detail about a broader debate on what impact expanding the Jones Act would have on our international trade. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Without objection, the previous question is ordered on the motion to recommit. There was no objection. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion to recommit. The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that the noes appeared to have it. Mr. GARAMENDI. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays. The yeas and nays were ordered. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 9 of rule XX, the Speaker will reduce to 5 minutes the minimum time for any electronic vote on the question of passage of the bill.

Mr. Speaker, pursuant to House Resolution 48, I call up the bill (H.R. 351) to provide for expedited approval of exportation of natural gas, and for other purposes, and ask for its immediate consideration in the House. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The text of the bill is as follows: H.R. 351 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. This Act may be cited as the ``LNG Permitting Certainty and Transparency Act''. SEC. 2. ACTION ON APPLICATIONS. (a) Decision Deadline.--For proposals that must also obtain authorization from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission or the United States Maritime Administration to site, construct, expand, or operate LNG export facilities, the Department of Energy shall issue a final decision on any application for the authorization to export natural gas under section 3 of the Natural Gas Act (15 U.S.C. 717b) not later than 30 days after the later of-- (1) the conclusion of the review to site, construct, expand, or operate the LNG facilities required by the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (42 U.S. C. 4321 et seq.); or (2) the date of enactment of this Act. (b) Conclusion of Review.--For purposes of subsection (a), review required by the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 shall be considered concluded-- (1) for a project requiring an Environmental Impact Statement, 30 days after publication of a Final Environmental Impact Statement; (2) for a project for which an Environmental Assessment has been prepared, 30 days after publication by the Department of Energy of a Finding of No Significant Impact; and (3) upon a determination by the lead agency that an application is eligible for a categorical exclusion pursuant National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 implementing regulations. (c) Judicial Action.--(1) The United States Court of Appeals for the circuit in which the export facility will be located pursuant to an application described in subsection (a) shall have original and exclusive jurisdiction over any civil action for the review of-- (A) an order issued by the Department of Energy with respect to such application; or (B) the Department of Energy's failure to issue a final decision on such application. (2) If the Court in a civil action described in paragraph (1) finds that the Department of Energy has failed to issue a final decision on the application as required under subsection (a), the Court shall order the Department of Energy to issue such final decision not later than 30 days after the Court's order. (3) The Court shall set any civil action brought under this subsection for expedited consideration and shall set the matter on the docket as soon as practical after the filing date of the initial pleading. SEC. 3. PUBLIC DISCLOSURE OF EXPORT DESTINATIONS. Section 3 of the Natural Gas Act (15 U.S.C. 717b) is amended by adding at the end the following: ``(g) Public Disclosure of LNG Export Destinations.--As a condition for approval of any authorization to export LNG, the Secretary of Energy shall require the applicant to publicly disclose the specific destination or destinations of any such authorized LNG exports.''. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to House Resolution 48, the gentleman from Kentucky (Mr. Whitfield) and the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Pallone) each will control 30 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Kentucky. General Leave Mr. WHITFIELD. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and to include extraneous material on H.R. 351. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Kentucky? There was no objection. Mr. WHITFIELD. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 351, the LNG Permitting Certainty and Transparency Act sponsored by Congressman Bill Johnson of Ohio. All of us recognize that the economy in the U.S. has been sputtering. We have had great advancements in technology, however, and innovation in hydraulic fracturing and horizontal drilling have led America to become the number one natural gas producing nation in the world. Our natural gas output has rapidly increased since 2005 and is expected to continue rising in the decades ahead in response to growing demand. Plentiful natural gas is helping many domestic energy producers and manufacturers and is spurring new investment and job growth here in America. The Committee on Energy and Commerce has held multiple hearings and forums to discuss the domestic growth in natural gas production and its potential impact on trade, geopolitics, and energy production and consumption in America. We now have the opportunity to bring more of this critical energy resource to other parts of the world while stimulating our energy security, economic growth, and foreign policy. I might add that over the last year, many of us have been really surprised by the number of representatives from other countries in Europe and around the world who are pleading with America to export their natural gas so that those countries are not as dependent upon countries like Russia and others. I might also add that, in 2012, the Department of Energy commissioned a report by NERA Economic Consulting to assess the economic impacts of LNG exports. NERA recently updated this study to include the most current projections from the Energy Information Administration. Like the 2012 study, the update found that U.S. LNG exports will bring widespread economic benefits, touching many parts of our economy, and that those benefits would consistently increase as exports increase. The NERA study also found that the construction of new LNG export projects is estimated to put up to 45,000 unemployed Americans back to work. I might also add that this legislation does not in any way change anything that FERC has responsibility for in approving siting of these natural gas pipelines and facilities for export, so we are not affecting in any way any environmental aspects of it. I might also say that the reason this bill is being introduced is because we think that the Department of Energy has been dragging its feet a little bit. They have responsibility over the commodity of the natural gas, and they have to go through a process. This legislation also applies only to non-free trade agreements that the U.S. deals with. Since 2010, the Department of Energy has issued a final decision on five of the 37 applications to export LNG to countries where the U.S. does not have a free trade agreement. [[Page H646]] Now, DOE's authority to regulate the export of natural gas arises under section 3 of the Natural Gas Act. This provision creates a rebuttable presumption that a proposed export of natural gas is in the public interest. DOE must grant the application unless opponents of the application overcome the presumption, and there are 18 countries where we have these free trade agreements. DOE's process to review applications to export LNG to non-free trade agreement countries is much more complex and unpredictable, and this legislation would help clarify that and create some certainty. It amends section 3 of the Natural Gas Act to give DOE 30 days to issue a final decision on an LNG export application after a complete NEPA environmental review on the facility. Additionally, H.R. 351 provides for expedited judicial reviews by the United States court of appeals for the circuit in which the export facility will be located, and this is important as well. It requires public disclosure of export destinations, so we know where it is going as a condition of approval of authorization to export LNG. This is a very important piece of legislation. I want to commend Mr. Johnson of Ohio for introducing this legislation, and I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to this legislation which is simply unnecessary. The Department of Energy currently conducts a public interest review of all applications to export liquefied natural gas to a country without a free trade agreement with the United States. To date, DOE has approved four such applications to export LNG and has issued conditional approvals to four additional applications. DOE has approved all applications that have completed their required NEPA review, and so there is no backlog or delay at the DOE to speak of. With these permits alone, we have the ability to become one of the largest exporters of natural gas in the world, and so legislation to impose an arbitrary 30-day deadline on DOE, as suggested by the underlying bill, is simply unnecessary. With regard to exporting natural gas, we should keep in mind that low domestic natural gas prices can provide an important competitive advantage to U.S. manufacturing, and simple economics tells us that additional demand due to unrestricted exports can raise domestic natural gas prices, so we should think twice about giving away this advantage for short-term export profits when we are trying hard to rebuild our long-term manufacturing base. We should also remember that the bill will not result in LNG exports to Europe for some time, if at all. Although one LNG export terminal is set to begin full operation later this year, all other terminals remain under construction or are in the planning process. DOE's conditional approval for those facilities allows them to continue moving forward, but this legislation won't help speed up their construction or affect how quickly they can actually operate, so passing this bill today will not magically send LNG from the proposed terminals tomorrow. When the United States actually begins to export significant quantities of LNG, it will most likely go to Asia, not Europe. The export terminals most likely to get constructed have already signed long-term contracts to supply LNG to various customers, and those destinations are primarily in Asia. Mr. Speaker, I oppose this bill because I don't believe the phantom LNG export backlog is one of the pressing issues facing ordinary Americans, and I don't believe that expediting this type of infrastructure is what our country needs most. I believe our country should be encouraging the use of renewable energy resources like wind and solar power. We should be investing in increased energy efficiency and a smart grid. We should be trying to find ways to make our energy infrastructure more resilient and capable of withstanding extreme weather events, like Hurricane Sandy. These are the types of clean energy solutions that America should be investing in, the type that will enhance our energy security, reduce carbon emissions, and lower overall energy costs to customers. Unfortunately, this bill doesn't achieve any of these goals. In fact, the 30-day deadline in the bill could have counterproductive results. If DOE is forced to make a decision before they have determined if the project is in the public interest, it may have no choice but to deny the application, and that outcome certainly doesn't benefit anyone, especially the applicants. This is the third time this month that the Republican majority has brought secondhand energy legislation to the floor, legislation that passed the House last Congress. Like the two bills before it, H.R. 351 would also serve no real purpose. I just hope that we can begin soon to look at new energy legislation that will move America forward in developing a clean energy infrastructure. In the meantime, I would urge my colleagues to vote against this bill, and I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. WHITFIELD. Mr. Speaker, at this time, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Johnson), the author of this legislation. Mr. JOHNSON of Ohio. Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman for yielding. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 351, the LNG Permitting Certainty and Transparency Act. This important legislation will bring certainty to the Department of Energy's review process for LNG export applications, create American jobs, continue spurring America's manufacturing comeback, and provide a stable source of energy to our allies in Europe and around the world. Thanks to the energy renaissance occurring throughout eastern and southeastern Ohio and across the United States, America is able to produce large quantities of natural gas like never before, enough to meet our domestic natural gas demands and export excess LNG to the global marketplace. Through the abundance of natural gas, we have an opportunity to significantly affect geopolitics and to create American jobs, but only if we enact smart policies like H.R. 351. The window of opportunity for LNG exports will not remain open indefinitely, so it is important that Congress act immediately. If Congress fails to act, companies will continue to face regulatory uncertainty, which creates hesitancy in securing financing for constructing LNG terminals, plus nations with near-term energy needs will look elsewhere. Potential geopolitical benefits such as reducing the oppressive influence of other exporters like Russia and Iran, while simultaneously strengthening ties with our allies, could be ultimately jeopardized. Some of my colleagues are concerned that increased LNG exports will not really help our allies in Europe, but that is simply not true. Regardless of where U.S. natural gas is sent, increasing the supply and competition in the international market will provide global consumers with greater choice and, most importantly, increased leverage when negotiating LNG pricing contracts. In fact, by no longer importing such large amounts of LNG, the U.S. has already indirectly helped our European allies. With the passage of this legislation, even more LNG will be free to go to places that need it most. Equally important, if we delay, domestic economic benefits may also fail to materialize, specifically the opportunity to create some 45,000 jobs by 2018 and increase hardworking taxpayer salaries by $1 billion over 6 years. This is a win for manufacturing, especially those who make drilling equipment pipeline components, not to mention the refining, petrochemicals, and chemicals sectors. For these reasons, Congress must pass H.R. 351. To date, DOE has issued a final decision on only five of the 38 pending LNG export applications received since 2010. This is unacceptable. I urge my colleagues to help bring certainty to DOE's approval process, create jobs, help maximize American energy production, and help our allies abroad by voting for this important legislation. Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Rush), the ranking member of the Subcommittee on Energy and Power. [[Page H647]] Mr. RUSH. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the ranking member of the full committee, Mr. Pallone, for his leadership and for his positive contributions to this entire institution. Mr. Speaker, I am here to oppose H.R. 351 because, once again, it is a proposed solution to a problem that we can't find, a problem that we have searched high and low for. This problem, Mr. Speaker, simply doesn't exist. Here we are, here we go once again, coming up with solutions to a problem that doesn't even exist. When will my colleagues on the other side do something productively in this Congress and come up with real solutions to problems that do exist for the American people? Mr. Speaker, currently, the Department of Energy, as we speak today, has already approved not one, not two, not three, not even four, but five applications--five--for existing LNG, and there are four more conditional approvals pending. {time} 0930 Altogether, Mr. Speaker, the approved applications authorize the export of over 10 million cubic feet per day of LNG. The pending applications collectively seek an additional 27.5 billion cubic feet of LNG exported each and every day--27.5. Where is the problem? Show me the problem. Show me the way. Point out the problem. Mr. Speaker, this 30-day deadline that arbitrarily mandates the DOE application process would short-circuit the public interest review-- short circuit--cut it short. The public doesn't have any input. No review by the public. The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Collins of Georgia). The time of the gentleman has expired. Mr. PALLONE. I yield the gentleman an additional 2 minutes. Mr. RUSH. This arbitrary mandatory 30-day deadline would unnecessarily fast-track the DOE to hastily make a decision on export applications, regardless of how complex the application may be. The result of this ambiguous 30-day deadline may negatively affect DOE's ability to soberly and thoroughly assess the impact that cumulative exports may have on natural gas prices. What would be the effect of gas at the station, at the pump, on the American people, and we all of a sudden, without any study, without any conversation, without any consideration, just force the DOE to arbitrarily meet this 30-day deadline? What is going to be the effect on the consumer in terms of these gas prices at the pump? Are they going to skyrocket as a result of this hasty, irresponsible action? Tell me, do you have answers to that? It may even result in the unintended consequence of actually denying applications if the agency does not have the time to complete its due diligence. This is insane. This is the utmost of insanity. Mr. Speaker, I must oppose this bill because at the end of the day when you skim away all of the rhetoric and all the hyperbole around this bill, it will not speed up energy exports to Europe and it will not speed up exports to our other allies. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has again expired. Mr. PALLONE. I yield the gentleman an additional 1 minute. Mr. RUSH. Mr. Speaker, to paraphrase Elvis Presley: let this body return this bill to sender, return it to sender, address unknown, no such problem, no such home. Mr. Speaker, let's send this bill back to committee where it can go through regular order, and we can have a thorough discussion on these important issues before voting on such a consequential bill. Mr. WHITFIELD. Mr. Speaker, at this time, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Gibbs), who has been a real leader in helping America become energy independent. Mr. GIBBS. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of this bill because this is simply a commonsense bill. As you know, the U.S. is now the largest producer of natural gas in the world and has proven gas resources to supply our needs for decades to come. This is an achievement that we have reached despite roadblocks and delays from the executive branch. The latest delay is the Department of Energy's rule from last summer to hold up export terminal applications. This important bill streamlines the review process for LNG exports by requiring a timeline for making a decision and making agencies work together on the review. This is commonsense change, Mr. Speaker. Innovations in the harvesting and production of natural gas have cut energy bills for families across the country. Those are the same innovations that have also made it affordable to ship LNG around the globe. The responsible and safe development of our natural resources through new technologies, such as horizontal drilling, have begun an energy and manufacturing renaissance in America. And who is feeling the benefits? American families and businesses with an affordable and reliable energy supply. But that could all end unless we let the free market work. Let's end the administration's de facto ban on new exports and bring market stability to the global gas market. Let's get the government out of the way, and let's give our American innovators a chance to work. Mr. Speaker, my district, the State of Ohio, and the entire Nation will reap the benefits of more jobs, increased pay, and lower energy costs if we pass this bill. I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 351 and end the self-imposed restrictions on LNG exports. Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, may I ask how much time is remaining on both sides? The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from New Jersey has 21 minutes remaining. The gentleman from Kentucky has 20 minutes remaining. Mr. PALLONE. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. At this time, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Green), who is the ranking member of the Health Subcommittee. (Mr. GENE GREEN of Texas asked and was given permission to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. GENE GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, let me explain the problem we have and the need for this bill today. The bill is the exact same language that passed this House last Congress, and it came through our committee, the Energy and Commerce Committee. Now, what this bill does is give the Department of Energy some deadlines to make a decision on our national interests--that is what it does--so we can do it. They have held those permits sometimes up to 2 years to make that determination. If you have a free trade agreement with the United States, we can export natural gas to you. But they need to decide the national interests. I want the DOE to do that, but I also want to make a decision in very quick time. We know who our friends are, we know who our adversaries are. We don't really want to send it to our adversaries, we want to send it to our friends. So that is DOE's job. The reason we need this bill is that right now today, or yesterday, gas is $2.88 per million cubic feet. It was up about $4, which is still not great for a producer. But what we have been doing in south Texas is flaring natural gas. It is bad for the environment. It is bad for the people who produce it because they don't have a customer. And what we need to do is be able to export what we can't use. In Texas we are very proud of Blue Bell ice cream. In fact, their advertising slogan is: ``We eat all we can and we sell the rest.'' I have a chemical industry, I have a utility industry that uses natural gas. They are using it. But we still have a lot of production. So why would we not use all we can in our country and sell the rest and make somebody else pay for those jobs that we have in our community? And that is the problem. We know the price of oil is going down. But oil and natural gas sometimes come out of the same well. So that is why we need to make sure that we have the right, on a reasonable timeframe, to export natural gas to countries that we want to be friendly with. I would love to have a natural gas export right now to Ukraine. The infrastructure over there is not there. It could get there with some reversing pipelines. H.R. 351 represents a bipartisan effort to legislate and warrant its approval. [[Page H648]] We worked together on this bill, and it represents that hard work. The bill is good for the economy, the climate, and the U.S. security interests. The United States has natural resources to become the largest exporter of LNG in the world. Our natural gas reserves can meet all our domestic natural gas needs and still have an excess capacity of 3 trillion cubic feet. Before we discuss H.R. 351 it is important we clarify the LNG permitting process, just so there is no confusion. A project applicant must submit two separate applications: the first to the Department of Energy and the second to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, FERC. In the Department of Energy, there are two complete separate processes. First, the project must submit an application to export. If the project sends LNG to a country with which the U.S. has a free trade agreement, the application is automatically approved. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired. Mr. PALLONE. I yield the gentleman an additional 2 minutes. Mr. GENE GREEN of Texas. I thank the ranking member. I appreciate it. If the project sends the LNG to a country without a free trade agreement, then the DOE must issue a permit based on the public interest. These are very important determinations. However, LNG will not leave the United States with DOE approval only. For a project to actually export LNG, in either case, the applicant must receive a FERC permit. FERC reviews the environmental impacts of the actual LNG facility. FERC conducts and reviews all environmental impacts to satisfy the requirements of NEPA. No company will export a single cubic foot of LNG without FERC approval. FERC's process takes 12 to 18 months and costs approximately $100 million. We have worked extremely hard to protect the environment. It is the DOE non-FTA process that is the problem. The DOE currently has approximately 30 non-FTA permits awaiting decision. The DOE has held most of these permits almost 4 years. Even the DOE recognized this huge problem and tried to address the backlog last summer by changing the approval process. Unfortunately, the changes failed to expedite approval or provide any certainty to companies who are investing $100 million, and these are U.S. companies. H.R. 351 resolved this issue only after it receives all environmental permits. H.R. 351 would place a 30-day timeline for the DOE to issue a decision after the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission completes its environmental reviews. Once again, we have protected the environmental review process. We have protected the public interest. And DOE, which held some of these applications 4 years--we cannot allow DOE to sit on these permits any longer. They must do their job and do it in a timely fashion. Opponents of H.R. 351 say if all permits are approved, we will export more than 35 trillion cubic feet. Opponents say exports will double or triple domestic natural gas prices. Opponents say exports of that size will endanger our domestic industry, raise electricity prices, and have ruinous effects on our economy. Mr. Speaker, I urge passage of the bill. Mr. Speaker, I represent enormous petrochemical facilities, power generators, and workers. I remember when domestic natural gas prices caused companies in my district to move jobs overseas. If what opponents of H.R. 351 say were even remotely possible, I would be the first one to oppose this bill. My constituents work at those facilities. Those facilities pay taxes and fund the hospitals and schools in my district. There are dozens of applications pending at DOE. No more than a handful of projects will be constructed and ultimately export LNG. But each project deserves a fair opportunity at review. Each company deserves the opportunity to pursue financing in the capital markets. The government should not make those decisions. Each LNG facility costs billions, not to mention the jobs associated with pipeline construction, electric transmission, local services, etc. I ask my colleagues to support H.R. 351 and support this bipartisan effort. Mr. WHITFIELD. At this time, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Turner), who has been a real leader on helping America become energy independent. Mr. TURNER. Mr. Speaker, U.S. natural gas exports will create American jobs and will bolster our strategic partnerships. I serve as president of the NATO Parliamentary Assembly, and many foreign leaders and officials have expressed to me their need for energy diversification. As you know, Russia, the largest supplier of natural gas to Europe, has repeatedly used natural gas pricing to draw governments closer to its orbit and punished West-leaning governments with higher prices. U.S. natural gas exports will foster a more dynamic and competitive world energy market, helping to curb the use of energy as a political weapon. And regardless of where natural gas from the United States is shipped, increasing supply in the global market will help international customers with greater choice and leverage to negotiate prices. In fact, the Obama administration has made this exact same argument. The State Department's energy envoy recently stated: Now where the gas will go doesn't matter. The fact that we have approved exports of natural gas has already had an impact on Europe. And where the molecule actually ends up going also doesn't matter. Now, I understand there have been questions about whether or not European countries, such as Ukraine, are prepared to receive U.S. natural gas. Many of our European allies are implementing infrastructure projects to diversify their natural gas resources. For example, Poland and Lithuania are opening LNG import terminals to reduce their dependence on Russian gas. Just last week, Poland and Ukraine announced an agreement to construct a pipeline that will allow Ukraine to access natural gas from two LNG import terminals, potentially from the United States. England and Spain already have contracts in place to receive U.S. natural gas. These are just a few examples of how these infrastructure projects will help Europe diversify its natural gas resources. Mr. Speaker, last year, President Obama, in a joint statement with European leaders, welcomed U.S. natural gas exports to help our European allies and our strategic partners. I am encouraged by the President's statements. These words must be followed by action. The President must work with Congress to enact H.R. 351. I urge all of my colleagues to support it. {time} 0945 Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I have heard my colleagues suggest that there is a delay in the DOE's approval of LNG export applications. For instance, on Monday night at the Rules Committee, Mr. Johnson indicated that the DOE has approved only five out of 38 applications since 2010. Even if the gentleman from Ohio is correct in his assertion, the fact is that the five applications approved by the Obama administration since 2010 are five more than were approved by the Reagan administration or by either Bush administration. In fact, it is five more than were approved by the Clinton, Carter, Ford, or Nixon administration. In 2011, the DOE approved the first LNG export application for the Cheniere Sabine Pass facility. That facility is set to become operational at the end of this year. That was the DOE's first approval to export LNG since the 1960s. The dramatic growth of natural gas production and supply in the United States was considered impossible a decade ago, so the DOE commissioned a study to help it decide how to address additional applications. After establishing a transparent and systematic system for reviewing and authorizing LNG export applications, the DOE began to rapidly issue decisions. The record demonstrates that the DOE has moved aggressively to authorize LNG exports, granting three additional final authorizations and four conditional approvals since August of 2013. To date, the DOE has approved the export of enough LNG to make the United States the world leader in LNG exports. All other pending applications are still under review at FERC, not at the DOE, so it is important to understand that this bill does not change the [[Page H649]] FERC review process--the site approvals, the environmental approvals. I would also remind my colleagues that the DOE automatically deems LNG exports to free trade agreement countries to be in the public interest. Before the DOE can issue a decision on the pending applications, both FERC approval and construction will need to be completed. That could take months or, more likely, years, but this bill will not affect that timeline, which will be the critical factor in how much more gas can be exported. That is why I want to emphasize that this bill is unnecessary and will not materially change the LNG export situation anytime soon. I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. WHITFIELD. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Upton), the chairman of the Energy and Commerce Committee. Mr. UPTON. Mr. Speaker, they say that you can't have too much of a good thing, but with our impressive natural gas production, that is exactly what we have today. We now have so much natural gas that we cannot only meet our own energy needs and still have extra to sell, but our natural gas boom can be used as a force for good here at home as a source for jobs and across the globe as a source of stable energy. There is no question that the whole shale revolution helped break the fever of the Great Recession. Thanks to innovation and technological advancement, energy production remained a welcome bright spot in our national economy, but we aren't out of the woods yet. We all know that. Millions of folks, certainly in Michigan and across the country, still find themselves unemployed, underemployed, or facing stagnant paychecks. This bill, this legislation, will help accelerate their return to full employment. At the request of the Department of Energy, NERA Economic Consulting evaluated the economic impacts of U.S. LNG exports. The NERA study showed a net positive impact to the United States economy and estimated that LNG exports would actually reduce the average number of unemployed workers by as much as 45,000 people by 2018. We will also see tens of thousands of additional jobs created in the supply chain. I am talking about good-paying jobs that will help families achieve a better life. The bill will also advance our foreign policy goals. U.S. LNG exports can provide our allies with a secure and affordable supply of energy and can reduce the influence of hostile exporting nations like Russia, which continues to threaten Ukraine and, really, all of Europe's natural gas supply. Passing this bill will send the welcome signal to our allies in Eastern Europe that, yes, an alternative source of energy is on its way. The domestic and geopolitical benefits make increasing U.S. LNG exports a win-win, but the Department of Energy continues to hold up the process. Since 2010, the DOE has only issued a final decision on five applications to export LNG to countries with which we don't share a free trade agreement. This bill would help jump-start approvals so that we can start creating jobs and sending our surplus gas to those countries that need it the most. It would give the DOE 30 days to issue a decision following the completion of the environmental review. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired. Mr. WHITFIELD. I yield the gentleman an additional 30 seconds. Mr. UPTON. The U.S. is now a global energy superpower, and with that power, we have a chance to do some real good. Saying ``yes'' to energy is good for workers here at home and is good for global allies. I thank Representative Bill Johnson for his leadership on this issue, and I would hope that everybody would support this bipartisan piece of legislation. Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Under the current approval process for LNG exports, the Department of Energy has a tool to protect American consumers, and that tool is the public interest determination. The DOE has the ability to weigh the benefits and costs of additional LNG exports, including the impact of increased domestic natural gas prices on consumers, who use gas to heat and cool their homes and to turn on the lights. Rigid deadlines, as suggested in this legislation, could prevent the DOE from conducting a meaningful public interest review, and that means that the DOE might not be able to ensure that high levels of LNG exports do not harm American consumers by raising the costs of electricity or home heating or cooling. I think consumers, Mr. Speaker, have reason to be concerned. Experts at the nonpartisan U.S. Energy Information Administration examined this issue, and here is what they found: In the scenarios with additional gas exports, consumers will consume less and pay more on both their natural gas and electricity bills. Furthermore, the EIA calculated that high levels of LNG exports could mean increased residential, commercial, and industrial consumer energy costs of $7 billion to $14 billion per year between 2020 and 2040. Make no mistake. American consumers will foot that bill. Recent experience with gasoline and propane exports also offers cautionary tales. The Midwest and Northeast experienced sharp propane price spikes and shortages last winter. Significant increases in propane exports were a key factor in the skyrocketing prices that hurt consumers. Just yesterday, the Center for American Progress released an analysis on the potential impact of expanded LNG exports on consumers. They found that, in 2020, residential consumers would pay 4.3 percent more for natural gas per year, and those in the Midwest--in States like Arkansas, Louisiana, and Texas--would be the hardest hit by price increases. By 2040, consumers in the mid-Atlantic States would pay 10 percent more for natural gas per year. These figures are not insignificant. We need to make sure that LNG exports do not hurt consumers. Right now, the DOE has the ability to do that. So, before we disregard any meaningful public interest review and allow the unrestricted exporting of LNG, let's be sure that our constituents won't be left footing the bill. I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. WHITFIELD. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the distinguished gentleman from Texas (Mr. Babin). Mr. BABIN. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 351, the LNG Permitting Certainty and Transparency Act. America's energy producers and the tens of thousands of Americans they employ stand ready to meet the demand for a reliable and secure source of natural gas from America and the world. They have completed their reviews, have passed their tests, and are ready to get to work, but there is one big problem--the Obama administration is standing in the way. The President and his anti- American energy agenda have placed a de facto ban on LNG exports by logjamming their requests and using bureaucratic red tape to block America's progress. This bill breaks the bureaucratic gridlock and expedites the approval of LNG exports. I have seen firsthand the jobs and the opportunities that an LNG facility has created for the people of east Texas, in my district. Let's help the American worker by approving H.R. 351. Mr. PALLONE. Again, Mr. Speaker, may I ask the time that remains on both sides. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from New Jersey has 11 minutes remaining, and the gentleman from Kentucky has 13 minutes remaining. Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from New York (Mr. Tonko), who is the ranking member of our Environment Subcommittee. Mr. TONKO. I thank the gentleman from New Jersey. Mr. Speaker, it is unfortunate that we are beginning the 114th Congress the way we ended the previous one--with legislation that is more about message than about solving real problems. The message of H.R. 351 is that we are interested in elevating the interests of the oil and gas industry above any others. Consumers will not benefit from this policy, and manufacturers will not benefit from this policy. Eliminating the public interest determination sends that message clearly. [[Page H650]] In spite of the assertions by its supporters, H.R. 351 won't do much for our allies either, especially those in Europe or Ukraine. The bill fixes no problem. There is no backlog of applications at the Department of Energy. Japan, our ally and the world's largest purchaser of LNG, has three importers who signed contracts in 2013 with three approved LNG export facilities, those being Freeport, Cameron, and Cove Point. Because natural gas is such an important and strategic resource, we should, if anything, be questioning the administration about the wisdom of issuing so many approvals. Why? They are relying on assumptions, models, and estimates of recoverable domestic gas reserves that are very uncertain and that have been decreasing as new information becomes available. Exporters sign these contracts to guarantee deliveries for some 10 to 20 years. I am not willing to risk price spikes for consumers, families, and small businesses or to risk the benefits of lower gas prices for our manufacturing sector for a slightly improved trade balance. I am unwilling to repeal the requirement for a consideration of the public interest before more export facilities are approved, not for a resource that is so strategic and widely used. H.R. 351 does not fix any real problems, but it could, indeed, help to create some. Therefore, Mr. Speaker, I urge the defeat of this bill. Mr. WHITFIELD. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from California (Mr. McCarthy), the distinguished majority leader. Mr. McCARTHY. I thank the gentleman for yielding. Mr. Speaker, the President likes to talk about infrastructure. In his State of the Union Address, he said that there is bipartisan support for infrastructure legislation and that Republicans and Democrats need to ``set our sights higher than a single oil pipeline.'' We have listened, and we have done that. After passing a bill to approve Keystone, this House passed another bill last week to reform the natural gas permitting process. Now the House is on its third energy infrastructure bill with Representative Bill Johnson's LNG Permitting Certainty and Transparency Act. I know the President doesn't pay much attention to what goes on here on Capitol Hill, but three infrastructure bills in 3 weeks is hard to miss. Here are some other numbers, Mr. Speaker, that I think the President really should remember: though the Department of Energy has received 37 permits in the past 5 years, it has only approved five permits in that time. That is one a year. If the President cared about infrastructure as much as he says, I think he would get his administration to process the rest of them now. Passing this bill would also lead to the creation of an estimated 45,000 jobs. More permit approvals mean more opportunity. More opportunity requires more infrastructure. More infrastructure means more jobs. Delay has become a hallmark of this Presidency, but Americans are done delaying job creation by ignoring America's energy abundance. {time} 1000 American energy supports American jobs. It supports a strong economy. It also gives our friends--like Ukraine, our allies--an alternative source of energy, diluting the power countries like Russia and Iran who use their oil to coerce and even oppress. Mr. Speaker, the President should know that here in the House we have set our sights very high; but, Mr. Speaker, the question is: Will the President set his sights higher than his veto pen? Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Rush). Mr. RUSH. Mr. Speaker, again, I wanted to return to the floor because the thought occurs to me, as it should to all of the American people, that we should consider the impact of this bill, the impact of LNG exports, and the impact that it would have on U.S. manufacturing. Mr. Speaker, at the end of the day, let us protect, by all means, American jobs. Let us protect American manufacturing. Cheap domestic natural gas prices are providing a big boost and competitive advantage to U.S. manufacturing. We can all agree on that on both sides of the aisle. Mr. Speaker, the disagreement occurs when the other side, the Republicans, are asking us in this Congress to make a hasty decision that could undermine the advantage that we are now experiencing in the rapid increase in manufacturing. This bill runs the risk of reducing our competitive advantage that we have now in the manufacturing sector. It requires DOE to rush its process and make final decisions on pending applications to export a huge quantity of LNG. If all of the pending applications are granted, DOE will authorize the export of approximately 38 million cubic feet per day of LNG. That is more than half of the total U.S. natural gas consumption. It is more than the world's largest LNG exporter, Qatar, currently makes each and every day. There is no question, Mr. Speaker, in my mind or in the minds of the American people that exports of that magnitude will increase the domestic price of natural gas. It just makes common sense, and it is what the EIA found when it studied the economic impact of increased LNG imports. Where is your study? How do you answer the conclusions of the EIA when it found again that the economic impact of increased influence will increase the domestic price of natural gas? What amount of American manufacturing? What amount of American jobs? Let's protect American manufacturing. Let's protect American jobs. Because this bill truncates DOE's public interest review, the Department may not even be able to fully analyze the impacts of the very high level of LNG exports on American consumers, on American jobs, and on American manufacturing. My friends on the other side--and they are indeed my friends--always want to talk about American manufacturing, how we have to support American manufacturing, how we have to raise the level of American manufacturing, how we have to increase the American manufacturing sector, how we have to increase the American manufacturing jobs. This very bill could undermine all that sense of goodwill and all those pronouncements from the other side. What about American manufacturing and what about American manufacturing jobs? Don't abandon American manufacturing. Don't abandon American manufacturing jobs. Don't abandon the American people. Let's slow this process down. All we are doing, Mr. Speaker, is jeopardizing American manufacturing and American manufacturing jobs. Mr. WHITFIELD. Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my time. Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, in closing, as the ranking member of the Energy and Commerce Committee, I am committed to developing sound energy policy, and that policy surely includes consideration of the role that natural gas can play in our energy mix. Our energy picture is changing every year. The latest development is low oil prices, but we have other developments in recent years, including rapidly increasing domestic production of oil and natural gas and a welcomed increase in wind and solar electricity production. We are becoming more efficient, but our energy infrastructure is becoming outdated. We need to look at the ways we produce and use energy, but we also need to look at the ways that we move, transmit, and store energy. We need to innovate in the energy space, but we also need to maintain reliability and lower energy bills. We need to look at all our energy issues through the lens of climate change and public health. Mr. Speaker, I think there are legitimate questions about whether we want to send our natural gas to other countries. That might help our trade balance, but it would have negative impacts on our domestic manufacturing sector. I don't claim that I have all the answers. I know that we looked at some of these issues last Congress, but I don't agree that a clear consensus emerged. In any event, this is a new [[Page H651]] Congress with scores of new Members who have never looked at this issue before. I think we should take these issues back to the Energy and Commerce Committee and let the committee and its 12 new members do its job. Let us look at the facts again as they are today, not last year or last Congress. I think if we were to do that, we would see that even if this legislation was once necessary, it isn't anymore. DOE has modernized its process and any backlog that once existed isn't an issue at this point. DOE and the administration have opened the way for LNG exports, but I think it continues to be necessary for us to assess whether approving an application for additional export is in the public interest because becoming the world's largest exporter of natural gas is not something we should do lightly, unadvisedly, or without the latest facts. This January, we have spent much of our time bringing bills from last Congress to the floor and rushing them through to the Senate, which is still considering the Keystone legislation we passed the first week of this year. I think we might well have served ourselves and the American people better by sitting down together in the Energy and Commerce Committee and working carefully on an energy policy aimed at the future rather than at an energy policy aimed at the past. I am going to vote ``no'' on this legislation, and I encourage my colleagues to oppose it as well. I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. WHITFIELD. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. The former speaker, the distinguished gentleman from Illinois, talked a lot about the impact on the manufacturing base in America this legislation might have. I would like to point out that the National Association of Manufacturers, which is the largest manufacturing association in the United States, representing manufacturers in every industrial sector in all 50 States, in a letter dated yesterday, urges Members to support H.R. 351. They go on to say that it is important to ensure that ``market forces, rather than bureaucratic inertia, govern international trade.'' That is really what this legislation is all about; it is about market forces. Representatives from countries around the world are coming to us and asking for this product. We are fortunate in America that we have an abundance of natural gas. In fact, the Energy Information Agency reported today that it is so abundant that natural gas prices have dropped to their lowest level since September 2012. Earlier, there was an expression of concern about increased natural gas prices. We understand that prices go up and prices go down, but right now, they are at their lowest level since September 2012, and when natural gas prices go down too low, you see less production. That increases prices as well. We didn't just wake up one day and decide to introduce this legislation. Concerned groups involved in this business came to Congress and said: We need some help. When we started having hearings on this a year and 2 years ago, the Department of Energy started trying to speed up the process a little bit, but we are not dictating what their decision should be on allowing the export to non-free trade agreement countries. We are just saying: You need to make the decision sooner, and we want some transparency. That is all this legislation is about. Now, we understand that any time you talk in today's world about exporting a fossil fuel, one of the undercurrents is climate change, and I would remind everyone that CO 2 emissions in America are the lowest that they have been in 20 years. This country does not have to take a backseat to any country in the world, and so we want the market to play its role. This is a good, commonsense piece of legislation that will create jobs in America, will encourage the expansion of more natural gas production at a time when the world needs it and we need it. I would urge every Member of this House to vote in favor of H.R. 351, and I yield back the balance of my time. Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise to speak in opposition to H.R. 351, the ``LNG Permitting Certainty and Transparency Act.'' Mr. Speaker, I am not anti-energy exploration. I am not anti-trade. I am, however strongly ``pro-jobs,'' ``pro-economic growth,'' and ``pro- sustainable environment.'' As a Member of Congress from Houston I have always been mindful of the importance of, and have strongly advocated for, national energy policies that will make our nation energy independent, preserve and create jobs, and keep our nation's economy strong. That is why I carefully consider each energy legislative proposal brought to the floor on its individual merits and support them when they are sound, balanced, fair, and promote the national interest. Where they fall short, I believe in working across the aisle to improve them if possible by offering constructive amendments. Although I believe the nation would benefit by increased exports of natural gas, the legislation before contains several provisions that are of great concern to me. Pursuant to Section 2, subsection (a) of the bill, an application for authorization to export LNG is ``deemed'' approved if the Department of Energy (DOE) or other federal agencies do not approve or deny the application within 30 days of the conclusion of the site review. I have three concerns with this regulatory scheme. First, as a senior member of the Committee on the Judiciary, I have a problem with ``deeming'' something done that has not been done in fact. Thus, the provision is unwise. Second, this provision is a remedy in search of a problem. There is no lengthy or intolerable backlog of neglected natural gas export authority applications awaiting action by DOE. The provision is unnecessary because DOE has to date authorized the export of over 10 billion cubic feet per day of LNG to non-Free Trade Agreement countries. Together with exports to FTA countries, this level of LNG exports that would transform the United States into one of the world's largest exporters. Third, the provision is irresponsible because it would require DOE and other agencies to make decisions based on incomplete information or information that may not be available within the stringent deadlines, and to deny applications that otherwise would have been approved, but for lack of sufficient review time. Supporters of this bill argue that it is vital, in the face of Russian aggression and restrictions, to provide our allies in Europe with additional exports of LNG. However, because actual exports through approved terminals are not expected to begin until late 2015, this legislation will have no impact on current exports. And, limiting the time for review would prevent DOE from properly analyzing the domestic impact that of exporting large amounts of LNG. The Energy Information Administration (EIA) estimates that increased exports could result in an increase of as much as 8 percent in domestic LNG prices. Given the inherent delicacy involved in assessing the impact of trade authorizations, both domestically and abroad, this state of affairs is likely to lead to DOE erring on the side of caution and denying applications that may otherwise have been approved if it had more time and more resources to carry out its responsibilities. For these reasons, I urge all Members to oppose the bill before us and urge my colleagues to join me. The SPEAKER pro tempore. All time for debate has expired. Pursuant to House Resolution 48, the previous question is ordered on the bill. The question is on the engrossment and third reading of the bill. The bill was ordered to be engrossed and read a third time, and was read the third time. Motion to Recommit Mr. GARAMENDI. Mr. Speaker, I have a motion to recommit at the desk. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is the gentleman opposed to the bill? Mr. GARAMENDI. I am opposed. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Clerk will report the motion to recommit. The Clerk read as follows: Mr. Garamendi moves to recommit the bill, H.R. 351, to the Committee on Energy and Commerce with instructions to report the same back to the House forthwith with the following amendment: At the end of the bill, insert the following new section: SEC. 4. PROTECTING OUR NATIONAL SECURITY AND CREATING AMERICAN JOBS. In reviewing an application for authorization to export natural gas under section 3 of the Natural Gas Act (15 U.S.C. 717b), the Department of Energy-- (1) shall deny such application if the natural gas would be exported to any nation [[Page H652]] that is a state sponsor of terrorism or otherwise threatens America's national security, or to any nation or corporation that steals America's military technology or intellectual property through cyber-attacks; and (2) shall require, as a condition for approval of any such authorization, the applicant to ensure that United States- flagged and built ships and shipping containers are used to export the LNG as such vessels become available for charter. Mr. WHITFIELD (during the reading). Mr. Speaker, I reserve a point of order against the motion to recommit. The SPEAKER pro tempore. A point of order is reserved. The Clerk will continue to read. The Clerk continued to read. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from California is recognized for 5 minutes in support of his motion. Mr. GARAMENDI. Mr. Speaker, this final amendment to the bill will not kill the bill. Frankly, it will substantially improve it. It won't send it back to committee. If adopted, the bill will come to the floor for a vote later this morning. We have heard a lot of discussion here about jobs in the Rules Committee, and I thank the chair, Mr. Whitfield, for his interest in this particular proposal and for the Rules Committee listening to the debate very carefully about how we can significantly advance America's national interest. {time} 1015 Natural gas is a strategic asset. It has allowed us to substantially reduce our energy costs in the United States; replace, re-power many of our power plants; bring down the cost; and, frankly, lead to an increased manufacturing sector. Shipbuilding is also a strategic national asset. Our Navy depends upon it. However, 107,000 Americans work in the shipbuilding industry in our ports and ship yards. It is a strategic asset, as are the mariners. American mariners are also a strategic asset. What we are trying to do with this amendment is to bring together these three strategic assets of America and advance the American economy and our national security at the same time. This amendment would simply require that if we are going to export liquefied natural gas, a strategic asset, then we should do it in a way that advances our national security and our economy by requiring that those ships be manned and ``womanned'' by American mariners, the captains, the engineers, the sailors, that they be American. This is a safety issue. Natural gas is a very volatile issue, and, under current law, when it is imported, it has to have American mariners on board. Similarly, by requiring that the ships be American-built, we will be able to employ several hundred thousand new men and women in our shipyards. If it is about jobs--and we all claim this bill is about jobs--then let's take it another step. Let's take it another step, so that we really rebuild the American shipping industry, that we put American mariners to work, that we revitalize our shipyards, so that our U.S. Navy will be able to have a robust competition for their ships. There are 117 shipyards in the United States that build ships. None of them, yet, build these tankers. They could if we pass this amendment. Let's build it in America. Let's make it in America. This is a strategy that is employed by India, which has a tender out to buy gas from the United States. That tender requires that three of the ships used to transport that be built in India. I say let's build the other seven in the United States. They want American natural gas; build the ships in America. We know that this is a big industry. Cheniere needs 100 ships when they begin to ship natural gas, LNG, from their new terminal in Texas-- 100 ships. Are those American ships? No, not without this amendment. Those ships will be Chinese ships in Chinese shipyards built by Chinese. How about America? How about building it in America? That is what this amendment is about. We can all agree that we want American jobs. Is there one among the 435 of us who wants the jobs to be in China or Korea or Japan? I don't think so. Let's do it in America. This is an American-made amendment. This is an amendment for American workers, American shipyards. This is not going to kill the bill. This is going to make this bill into a real ``Make It In America,'' a real American jobs bill with hundreds of thousands of jobs spread throughout this Nation. Mr. Chairman, work with us. Make this into a real, robust American jobs bill. Adopt this amendment. Put aside the normal game we play with MTRs, which is just kind of a Kabuki dance here. Let's do it for the American workers, for the American shipyards all across this Nation. That is what this is about. This is an unexpected opportunity that has come about because of our great natural gas industry here. Take advantage of it. Think about the national security. Think about our shipyards, the U.S. Navy, the mariners. Make it in America. Adopt this amendment. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. WHITFIELD. Mr. Speaker, I withdraw my reservation of a point of order. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The reservation of the point of order is withdrawn. Mr. WHITFIELD. Mr. Speaker, I claim the time in opposition to the motion. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Kentucky is recognized for 5 minutes in opposition to the motion. Mr. WHITFIELD. Mr. Speaker, first of all, I want to thank the gentleman from California for offering this motion to recommit. It has two basic parts to it. The first part relates to denying applications of natural gas that would be exported to any nation that is a state- sponsored terrorist. We feel quite confident that, under the existing law and under H.R. 351, the Department of Energy is not going to approve the export of natural gas that is going to be in the public interest to any terrorist state. The second question, which is a very important question--and as I said in the Rules Committee and say on the floor, I am delighted that Mr. Garamendi has raised this issue about U.S.-flagged ships being involved in the export. As you know, his amendment goes to the Jones Act, and the Jones Act, as we all know, requires U.S.-flagged ships between ports here in the United States, but it does not expand to export and the use in other countries, and that raises a much broader issue than this very narrow- focused bill. I do think that that discussion needs to take place at some point in time, but, at this time, I am going to respectfully request the Members to reject the motion to recommit. I, and others, would look forward to talking to Mr. Garamendi in more detail about a broader debate on what impact expanding the Jones Act would have on our international trade. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Without objection, the previous question is ordered on the motion to recommit. There was no objection. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion to recommit. The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that the noes appeared to have it. Mr. GARAMENDI. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays. The yeas and nays were ordered. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 9 of rule XX, the Speaker will reduce to 5 minutes the minimum time for any electronic vote on the question of passage of the bill. The vote was taken by electronic device, and there were--yeas 175, nays 237, not voting 21, as follows: [Roll No. 49] YEAS--175 Adams Aguilar Ashford Bass Beatty Becerra Bera Beyer Bishop (GA) Blumenauer Bonamici Boyle (PA) Brown (FL) Brownley (CA) Bustos Butterfield Capps Caardenas Carney Carson (IN) Cartwright Castor (FL) Castro (TX) Chu (CA) Cicilline Clark (MA) Clarke (NY) Cleaver Clyburn Cohen Connolly Conyers Cooper Costa Courtney Cuellar Cummings Davis (CA) Davis, Danny DeGette Delaney DeLauro DelBene DeSaulnier Deutch Dingell Doggett Doyle (PA) Duncan (TN) Edwards Ellison Eshoo Esty Farr [[Page H653]] Fattah Foster Frankel (FL) Fudge Gabbard Gallego Garamendi Graham Grayson Green, Al Green, Gene Grijalva Hahn Hastings Heck (WA) Higgins Himes Hinojosa Honda Hoyer Huffman Israel Jackson Lee Jeffries Johnson (GA) Johnson, E.

Mr. Speaker, I was unavoidably detained and missed Roll Call vote numbers 49 and 50. Had I been present, I would have voted aye on Roll Call vote number 49, and no on Roll Call vote number 50. Personal Explanation Mr. DeFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, on January 28, 2015 I was unable to be present and missed the following votes: On Roll Call vote 49, on Agreeing to the Motion to Recommit With Instructions to H.R. 351, the LNG Permitting Certainty and Transparency Act, I would have voted AYE. On Roll Call vote 50, on Passage of H.R. 351, the LNG Permitting Certainty and Transparency Act, I would have voted NO. ____________________",package_114_121.csv,72726,72726,72798,"[congressional record volume 161, number 14 (wednesday, january 28, 2015)] [house] [pages h645-h654] from the congressional record online through the government publishing office [ www.gpo.gov ] {time} 0915 lng permitting certainty and transparency act mr. whitfield. mr. speaker, pursuant to house resolution 48, i call up the bill (h.r. 351) to provide for expedited approval of exportation of natural gas, and for other purposes, and ask for its immediate consideration in the house. the clerk read the title of the bill. the text of the bill is as follows: h.r. 351 be it enacted by the senate and house of representatives of the united states of america in congress assembled, section 1. short title. this act may be cited as the ``lng permitting certainty and transparency act''. sec. 2. action on applications. (a) decision deadline.--for proposals that must also obtain authorization from the federal energy regulatory commission or the united states maritime administration to site, construct, expand, or operate lng export facilities, the department of energy shall issue a final decision on any application for the authorization to export natural gas under section 3 of the natural gas act (15 u.s.c. 717b) not later than 30 days after the later of-- (1) the conclusion of the review to site, construct, expand, or operate the lng facilities required by the national environmental policy act of 1969 (42 u.s. c. 4321 et seq.); or (2) the date of enactment of this act. (b) conclusion of review.--for purposes of subsection (a), review required by the national environmental policy act of 1969 shall be considered concluded-- (1) for a project requiring an environmental impact statement, 30 days after publication of a final environmental impact statement; (2) for a project for which an environmental assessment has been prepared, 30 days after publication by the department of energy of a finding of no significant impact; and (3) upon a determination by the lead agency that an application is eligible for a categorical exclusion pursuant national environmental policy act of 1969 implementing regulations. (c) judicial action.--(1) the united states court of appeals for the circuit in which the export facility will be located pursuant to an application described in subsection (a) shall have original and exclusive jurisdiction over any civil action for the review of-- (a) an order issued by the department of energy with respect to such application; or (b) the department of energy's failure to issue a final decision on such application. (2) if the court in a civil action described in paragraph (1) finds that the department of energy has failed to issue a final decision on the application as required under subsection (a), the court shall order the department of energy to issue such final decision not later than 30 days after the court's order. (3) the court shall set any civil action brought under this subsection for expedited consideration and shall set the matter on the docket as soon as practical after the filing date of the initial pleading. sec. 3. public disclosure of export destinations. section 3 of the natural gas act (15 u.s.c. 717b) is amended by adding at the end the following: ``(g) public disclosure of lng export destinations.--as a condition for approval of any authorization to export lng, the secretary of energy shall require the applicant to publicly disclose the specific destination or destinations of any such authorized lng exports.''. the speaker pro tempore. pursuant to house resolution 48, the gentleman from kentucky (mr. whitfield) and the gentleman from new jersey (mr. pallone) each will control 30 minutes. the chair recognizes the gentleman from kentucky. general leave mr. whitfield. mr. speaker, i ask unanimous consent that all members may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and to include extraneous material on h.r. 351. the speaker pro tempore. is there objection to the request of the gentleman from kentucky? there was no objection. mr. whitfield. mr. speaker, i yield myself such time as i may consume. mr. speaker, i rise today in support of h.r. 351, the lng permitting certainty and transparency act sponsored by congressman bill johnson of ohio. all of us recognize that the economy in the u.s. has been sputtering. we have had great advancements in technology, however, and innovation in hydraulic fracturing and horizontal drilling have led america to become the number one natural gas producing nation in the world. our natural gas output has rapidly increased since 2005 and is expected to continue rising in the decades ahead in response to growing demand. plentiful natural gas is helping many domestic energy producers and manufacturers and is spurring new investment and job growth here in america. the committee on energy and commerce has held multiple hearings and forums to discuss the domestic growth in natural gas production and its potential impact on trade, geopolitics, and energy production and consumption in america. we now have the opportunity to bring more of this critical energy resource to other parts of the world while stimulating our energy security, economic growth, and foreign policy. i might add that over the last year, many of us have been really surprised by the number of representatives from other countries in europe and around the world who are pleading with america to export their natural gas so that those countries are not as dependent upon countries like russia and others. i might also add that, in 2012, the department of energy commissioned a report by nera economic consulting to assess the economic impacts of lng exports. nera recently updated this study to include the most current projections from the energy information administration. like the 2012 study, the update found that u.s. lng exports will bring widespread economic benefits, touching many parts of our economy, and that those benefits would consistently increase as exports increase. the nera study also found that the construction of new lng export projects is estimated to put up to 45,000 unemployed americans back to work. i might also add that this legislation does not in any way change anything that ferc has responsibility for in approving siting of these natural gas pipelines and facilities for export, so we are not affecting in any way any environmental aspects of it. i might also say that the reason this bill is being introduced is because we think that the department of energy has been dragging its feet a little bit. they have responsibility over the commodity of the natural gas, and they have to go through a process. this legislation also applies only to non-free trade agreements that the u.s. deals with. since 2010, the department of energy has issued a final decision on five of the 37 applications to export lng to countries where the u.s. does not have a free trade agreement. [[page h646]] now, doe's authority to regulate the export of natural gas arises under section 3 of the natural gas act. this provision creates a rebuttable presumption that a proposed export of natural gas is in the public interest. doe must grant the application unless opponents of the application overcome the presumption, and there are 18 countries where we have these free trade agreements. doe's process to review applications to export lng to non-free trade agreement countries is much more complex and unpredictable, and this legislation would help clarify that and create some certainty. it amends section 3 of the natural gas act to give doe 30 days to issue a final decision on an lng export application after a complete nepa environmental review on the facility. additionally, h.r. 351 provides for expedited judicial reviews by the united states court of appeals for the circuit in which the export facility will be located, and this is important as well. it requires public disclosure of export destinations, so we know where it is going as a condition of approval of authorization to export lng. this is a very important piece of legislation. i want to commend mr. johnson of ohio for introducing this legislation, and i reserve the balance of my time. mr. pallone. mr. speaker, i yield myself such time as i may consume. mr. speaker, i rise in opposition to this legislation which is simply unnecessary. the department of energy currently conducts a public interest review of all applications to export liquefied natural gas to a country without a free trade agreement with the united states. to date, doe has approved four such applications to export lng and has issued conditional approvals to four additional applications. doe has approved all applications that have completed their required nepa review, and so there is no backlog or delay at the doe to speak of. with these permits alone, we have the ability to become one of the largest exporters of natural gas in the world, and so legislation to impose an arbitrary 30-day deadline on doe, as suggested by the underlying bill, is simply unnecessary. with regard to exporting natural gas, we should keep in mind that low domestic natural gas prices can provide an important competitive advantage to u.s. manufacturing, and simple economics tells us that additional demand due to unrestricted exports can raise domestic natural gas prices, so we should think twice about giving away this advantage for short-term export profits when we are trying hard to rebuild our long-term manufacturing base. we should also remember that the bill will not result in lng exports to europe for some time, if at all. although one lng export terminal is set to begin full operation later this year, all other terminals remain under construction or are in the planning process. doe's conditional approval for those facilities allows them to continue moving forward, but this legislation won't help speed up their construction or affect how quickly they can actually operate, so passing this bill today will not magically send lng from the proposed terminals tomorrow. when the united states actually begins to export significant quantities of lng, it will most likely go to asia, not europe. the export terminals most likely to get constructed have already signed long-term contracts to supply lng to various customers, and those destinations are primarily in asia. mr. speaker, i oppose this bill because i don't believe the phantom lng export backlog is one of the pressing issues facing ordinary americans, and i don't believe that expediting this type of infrastructure is what our country needs most. i believe our country should be encouraging the use of renewable energy resources like wind and solar power. we should be investing in increased energy efficiency and a smart grid. we should be trying to find ways to make our energy infrastructure more resilient and capable of withstanding extreme weather events, like hurricane sandy. these are the types of clean energy solutions that america should be investing in, the type that will enhance our energy security, reduce carbon emissions, and lower overall energy costs to customers. unfortunately, this bill doesn't achieve any of these goals. in fact, the 30-day deadline in the bill could have counterproductive results. if doe is forced to make a decision before they have determined if the project is in the public interest, it may have no choice but to deny the application, and that outcome certainly doesn't benefit anyone, especially the applicants. this is the third time this month that the republican majority has brought secondhand energy legislation to the floor, legislation that passed the house last congress. like the two bills before it, h.r. 351 would also serve no real purpose. i just hope that we can begin soon to look at new energy legislation that will move america forward in developing a clean energy infrastructure. in the meantime, i would urge my colleagues to vote against this bill, and i reserve the balance of my time. mr. whitfield. mr. speaker, at this time, i yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from ohio (mr. johnson), the author of this legislation. mr. johnson of ohio. mr. speaker, i thank the chairman for yielding. mr. speaker, i rise today in strong support of h.r. 351, the lng permitting certainty and transparency act. this important legislation will bring certainty to the department of energy's review process for lng export applications, create american jobs, continue spurring america's manufacturing comeback, and provide a stable source of energy to our allies in europe and around the world. thanks to the energy renaissance occurring throughout eastern and southeastern ohio and across the united states, america is able to produce large quantities of natural gas like never before, enough to meet our domestic natural gas demands and export excess lng to the global marketplace. through the abundance of natural gas, we have an opportunity to significantly affect geopolitics and to create american jobs, but only if we enact smart policies like h.r. 351. the window of opportunity for lng exports will not remain open indefinitely, so it is important that congress act immediately. if congress fails to act, companies will continue to face regulatory uncertainty, which creates hesitancy in securing financing for constructing lng terminals, plus nations with near-term energy needs will look elsewhere. potential geopolitical benefits such as reducing the oppressive influence of other exporters like russia and iran, while simultaneously strengthening ties with our allies, could be ultimately jeopardized. some of my colleagues are concerned that increased lng exports will not really help our allies in europe, but that is simply not true. regardless of where u.s. natural gas is sent, increasing the supply and competition in the international market will provide global consumers with greater choice and, most importantly, increased leverage when negotiating lng pricing contracts. in fact, by no longer importing such large amounts of lng, the u.s. has already indirectly helped our european allies. with the passage of this legislation, even more lng will be free to go to places that need it most. equally important, if we delay, domestic economic benefits may also fail to materialize, specifically the opportunity to create some 45,000 jobs by 2018 and increase hardworking taxpayer salaries by $1 billion over 6 years. this is a win for manufacturing, especially those who make drilling equipment pipeline components, not to mention the refining, petrochemicals, and chemicals sectors. for these reasons, congress must pass h.r. 351. to date, doe has issued a final decision on only five of the 38 pending lng export applications received since 2010. this is unacceptable. i urge my colleagues to help bring certainty to doe's approval process, create jobs, help maximize american energy production, and help our allies abroad by voting for this important legislation. mr. pallone. mr. speaker, i yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from illinois (mr. rush), the ranking member of the subcommittee on energy and power. [[page h647]] mr. rush. mr. speaker, i want to thank the ranking member of the full committee, mr. pallone, for his leadership and for his positive contributions to this entire institution. mr. speaker, i am here to oppose h.r. 351 because, once again, it is a proposed solution to a problem that we can't find, a problem that we have searched high and low for. this problem, mr. speaker, simply doesn't exist. here we are, here we go once again, coming up with solutions to a problem that doesn't even exist. when will my colleagues on the other side do something productively in this congress and come up with real solutions to problems that do exist for the american people? mr. speaker, currently, the department of energy, as we speak today, has already approved not one, not two, not three, not even four, but five applications--five--for existing lng, and there are four more conditional approvals pending. {time} 0930 altogether, mr. speaker, the approved applications authorize the export of over 10 million cubic feet per day of lng. the pending applications collectively seek an additional 27.5 billion cubic feet of lng exported each and every day--27.5. where is the problem? show me the problem. show me the way. point out the problem. mr. speaker, this 30-day deadline that arbitrarily mandates the doe application process would short-circuit the public interest review-- short circuit--cut it short. the public doesn't have any input. no review by the public. the speaker pro tempore (mr. collins of georgia). the time of the gentleman has expired. mr. pallone. i yield the gentleman an additional 2 minutes. mr. rush. this arbitrary mandatory 30-day deadline would unnecessarily fast-track the doe to hastily make a decision on export applications, regardless of how complex the application may be. the result of this ambiguous 30-day deadline may negatively affect doe's ability to soberly and thoroughly assess the impact that cumulative exports may have on natural gas prices. what would be the effect of gas at the station, at the pump, on the american people, and we all of a sudden, without any study, without any conversation, without any consideration, just force the doe to arbitrarily meet this 30-day deadline? what is going to be the effect on the consumer in terms of these gas prices at the pump? are they going to skyrocket as a result of this hasty, irresponsible action? tell me, do you have answers to that? it may even result in the unintended consequence of actually denying applications if the agency does not have the time to complete its due diligence. this is insane. this is the utmost of insanity. mr. speaker, i must oppose this bill because at the end of the day when you skim away all of the rhetoric and all the hyperbole around this bill, it will not speed up energy exports to europe and it will not speed up exports to our other allies. the speaker pro tempore. the time of the gentleman has again expired. mr. pallone. i yield the gentleman an additional 1 minute. mr. rush. mr. speaker, to paraphrase elvis presley: let this body return this bill to sender, return it to sender, address unknown, no such problem, no such home. mr. speaker, let's send this bill back to committee where it can go through regular order, and we can have a thorough discussion on these important issues before voting on such a consequential bill. mr. whitfield. mr. speaker, at this time, i yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from ohio (mr. gibbs), who has been a real leader in helping america become energy independent. mr. gibbs. mr. speaker, i thank the gentleman for yielding. mr. speaker, i rise today in support of this bill because this is simply a commonsense bill. as you know, the u.s. is now the largest producer of natural gas in the world and has proven gas resources to supply our needs for decades to come. this is an achievement that we have reached despite roadblocks and delays from the executive branch. the latest delay is the department of energy's rule from last summer to hold up export terminal applications. this important bill streamlines the review process for lng exports by requiring a timeline for making a decision and making agencies work together on the review. this is commonsense change, mr. speaker. innovations in the harvesting and production of natural gas have cut energy bills for families across the country. those are the same innovations that have also made it affordable to ship lng around the globe. the responsible and safe development of our natural resources through new technologies, such as horizontal drilling, have begun an energy and manufacturing renaissance in america. and who is feeling the benefits? american families and businesses with an affordable and reliable energy supply. but that could all end unless we let the free market work. let's end the administration's de facto ban on new exports and bring market stability to the global gas market. let's get the government out of the way, and let's give our american innovators a chance to work. mr. speaker, my district, the state of ohio, and the entire nation will reap the benefits of more jobs, increased pay, and lower energy costs if we pass this bill. i urge my colleagues to support h.r. 351 and end the self-imposed restrictions on lng exports. mr. pallone. mr. speaker, may i ask how much time is remaining on both sides? the speaker pro tempore. the gentleman from new jersey has 21 minutes remaining. the gentleman from kentucky has 20 minutes remaining. mr. pallone. thank you, mr. speaker. at this time, i yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from texas (mr. green), who is the ranking member of the health subcommittee. (mr. gene green of texas asked and was given permission to revise and extend his remarks.) mr. gene green of texas. mr. speaker, let me explain the problem we have and the need for this bill today. the bill is the exact same language that passed this house last congress, and it came through our committee, the energy and commerce committee. now, what this bill does is give the department of energy some deadlines to make a decision on our national interests--that is what it does--so we can do it. they have held those permits sometimes up to 2 years to make that determination. if you have a free trade agreement with the united states, we can export natural gas to you. but they need to decide the national interests. i want the doe to do that, but i also want to make a decision in very quick time. we know who our friends are, we know who our adversaries are. we don't really want to send it to our adversaries, we want to send it to our friends. so that is doe's job. the reason we need this bill is that right now today, or yesterday, gas is $2.88 per million cubic feet. it was up about $4, which is still not great for a producer. but what we have been doing in south texas is flaring natural gas. it is bad for the environment. it is bad for the people who produce it because they don't have a customer. and what we need to do is be able to export what we can't use. in texas we are very proud of blue bell ice cream. in fact, their advertising slogan is: ``we eat all we can and we sell the rest.'' i have a chemical industry, i have a utility industry that uses natural gas. they are using it. but we still have a lot of production. so why would we not use all we can in our country and sell the rest and make somebody else pay for those jobs that we have in our community? and that is the problem. we know the price of oil is going down. but oil and natural gas sometimes come out of the same well. so that is why we need to make sure that we have the right, on a reasonable timeframe, to export natural gas to countries that we want to be friendly with. i would love to have a natural gas export right now to ukraine. the infrastructure over there is not there. it could get there with some reversing pipelines. h.r. 351 represents a bipartisan effort to legislate and warrant its approval. [[page h648]] we worked together on this bill, and it represents that hard work. the bill is good for the economy, the climate, and the u.s. security interests. the united states has natural resources to become the largest exporter of lng in the world. our natural gas reserves can meet all our domestic natural gas needs and still have an excess capacity of 3 trillion cubic feet. before we discuss h.r. 351 it is important we clarify the lng permitting process, just so there is no confusion. a project applicant must submit two separate applications: the first to the department of energy and the second to the federal energy regulatory commission, ferc. in the department of energy, there are two complete separate processes. first, the project must submit an application to export. if the project sends lng to a country with which the u.s. has a free trade agreement, the application is automatically approved. the speaker pro tempore. the time of the gentleman has expired. mr. pallone. i yield the gentleman an additional 2 minutes. mr. gene green of texas. i thank the ranking member. i appreciate it. if the project sends the lng to a country without a free trade agreement, then the doe must issue a permit based on the public interest. these are very important determinations. however, lng will not leave the united states with doe approval only. for a project to actually export lng, in either case, the applicant must receive a ferc permit. ferc reviews the environmental impacts of the actual lng facility. ferc conducts and reviews all environmental impacts to satisfy the requirements of nepa. no company will export a single cubic foot of lng without ferc approval. ferc's process takes 12 to 18 months and costs approximately $100 million. we have worked extremely hard to protect the environment. it is the doe non-fta process that is the problem. the doe currently has approximately 30 non-fta permits awaiting decision. the doe has held most of these permits almost 4 years. even the doe recognized this huge problem and tried to address the backlog last summer by changing the approval process. unfortunately, the changes failed to expedite approval or provide any certainty to companies who are investing $100 million, and these are u.s. companies. h.r. 351 resolved this issue only after it receives all environmental permits. h.r. 351 would place a 30-day timeline for the doe to issue a decision after the federal energy regulatory commission completes its environmental reviews. once again, we have protected the environmental review process. we have protected the public interest. and doe, which held some of these applications 4 years--we cannot allow doe to sit on these permits any longer. they must do their job and do it in a timely fashion. opponents of h.r. 351 say if all permits are approved, we will export more than 35 trillion cubic feet. opponents say exports will double or triple domestic natural gas prices. opponents say exports of that size will endanger our domestic industry, raise electricity prices, and have ruinous effects on our economy. mr. speaker, i urge passage of the bill. mr. speaker, i represent enormous petrochemical facilities, power generators, and workers. i remember when domestic natural gas prices caused companies in my district to move jobs overseas. if what opponents of h.r. 351 say were even remotely possible, i would be the first one to oppose this bill. my constituents work at those facilities. those facilities pay taxes and fund the hospitals and schools in my district. there are dozens of applications pending at doe. no more than a handful of projects will be constructed and ultimately export lng. but each project deserves a fair opportunity at review. each company deserves the opportunity to pursue financing in the capital markets. the government should not make those decisions. each lng facility costs billions, not to mention the jobs associated with pipeline construction, electric transmission, local services, etc. i ask my colleagues to support h.r. 351 and support this bipartisan effort. mr. whitfield. at this time, i yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from ohio (mr. turner), who has been a real leader on helping america become energy independent. mr. turner. mr. speaker, u.s. natural gas exports will create american jobs and will bolster our strategic partnerships. i serve as president of the nato parliamentary assembly, and many foreign leaders and officials have expressed to me their need for energy diversification. as you know, russia, the largest supplier of natural gas to europe, has repeatedly used natural gas pricing to draw governments closer to its orbit and punished west-leaning governments with higher prices. u.s. natural gas exports will foster a more dynamic and competitive world energy market, helping to curb the use of energy as a political weapon. and regardless of where natural gas from the united states is shipped, increasing supply in the global market will help international customers with greater choice and leverage to negotiate prices. in fact, the obama administration has made this exact same argument. the state department's energy envoy recently stated: now where the gas will go doesn't matter. the fact that we have approved exports of natural gas has already had an impact on europe. and where the molecule actually ends up going also doesn't matter. now, i understand there have been questions about whether or not european countries, such as ukraine, are prepared to receive u.s. natural gas. many of our european allies are implementing infrastructure projects to diversify their natural gas resources. for example, poland and lithuania are opening lng import terminals to reduce their dependence on russian gas. just last week, poland and ukraine announced an agreement to construct a pipeline that will allow ukraine to access natural gas from two lng import terminals, potentially from the united states. england and spain already have contracts in place to receive u.s. natural gas. these are just a few examples of how these infrastructure projects will help europe diversify its natural gas resources. mr. speaker, last year, president obama, in a joint statement with european leaders, welcomed u.s. natural gas exports to help our european allies and our strategic partners. i am encouraged by the president's statements. these words must be followed by action. the president must work with congress to enact h.r. 351. i urge all of my colleagues to support it. {time} 0945 mr. pallone. mr. speaker, i yield myself such time as i may consume. i have heard my colleagues suggest that there is a delay in the doe's approval of lng export applications. for instance, on monday night at the rules committee, mr. johnson indicated that the doe has approved only five out of 38 applications since 2010. even if the gentleman from ohio is correct in his assertion, the fact is that the five applications approved by the obama administration since 2010 are five more than were approved by the reagan administration or by either bush administration. in fact, it is five more than were approved by the clinton, carter, ford, or nixon administration. in 2011, the doe approved the first lng export application for the cheniere sabine pass facility. that facility is set to become operational at the end of this year. that was the doe's first approval to export lng since the 1960s. the dramatic growth of natural gas production and supply in the united states was considered impossible a decade ago, so the doe commissioned a study to help it decide how to address additional applications. after establishing a transparent and systematic system for reviewing and authorizing lng export applications, the doe began to rapidly issue decisions. the record demonstrates that the doe has moved aggressively to authorize lng exports, granting three additional final authorizations and four conditional approvals since august of 2013. to date, the doe has approved the export of enough lng to make the united states the world leader in lng exports. all other pending applications are still under review at ferc, not at the doe, so it is important to understand that this bill does not change the [[page h649]] ferc review process--the site approvals, the environmental approvals. i would also remind my colleagues that the doe automatically deems lng exports to free trade agreement countries to be in the public interest. before the doe can issue a decision on the pending applications, both ferc approval and construction will need to be completed. that could take months or, more likely, years, but this bill will not affect that timeline, which will be the critical factor in how much more gas can be exported. that is why i want to emphasize that this bill is unnecessary and will not materially change the lng export situation anytime soon. i reserve the balance of my time. mr. whitfield. mr. speaker, i yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from michigan (mr. upton), the chairman of the energy and commerce committee. mr. upton. mr. speaker, they say that you can't have too much of a good thing, but with our impressive natural gas production, that is exactly what we have today. we now have so much natural gas that we cannot only meet our own energy needs and still have extra to sell, but our natural gas boom can be used as a force for good here at home as a source for jobs and across the globe as a source of stable energy. there is no question that the whole shale revolution helped break the fever of the great recession. thanks to innovation and technological advancement, energy production remained a welcome bright spot in our national economy, but we aren't out of the woods yet. we all know that. millions of folks, certainly in michigan and across the country, still find themselves unemployed, underemployed, or facing stagnant paychecks. this bill, this legislation, will help accelerate their return to full employment. at the request of the department of energy, nera economic consulting evaluated the economic impacts of u.s. lng exports. the nera study showed a net positive impact to the united states economy and estimated that lng exports would actually reduce the average number of unemployed workers by as much as 45,000 people by 2018. we will also see tens of thousands of additional jobs created in the supply chain. i am talking about good-paying jobs that will help families achieve a better life. the bill will also advance our foreign policy goals. u.s. lng exports can provide our allies with a secure and affordable supply of energy and can reduce the influence of hostile exporting nations like russia, which continues to threaten ukraine and, really, all of europe's natural gas supply. passing this bill will send the welcome signal to our allies in eastern europe that, yes, an alternative source of energy is on its way. the domestic and geopolitical benefits make increasing u.s. lng exports a win-win, but the department of energy continues to hold up the process. since 2010, the doe has only issued a final decision on five applications to export lng to countries with which we don't share a free trade agreement. this bill would help jump-start approvals so that we can start creating jobs and sending our surplus gas to those countries that need it the most. it would give the doe 30 days to issue a decision following the completion of the environmental review. the speaker pro tempore. the time of the gentleman has expired. mr. whitfield. i yield the gentleman an additional 30 seconds. mr. upton. the u.s. is now a global energy superpower, and with that power, we have a chance to do some real good. saying ``yes'' to energy is good for workers here at home and is good for global allies. i thank representative bill johnson for his leadership on this issue, and i would hope that everybody would support this bipartisan piece of legislation. mr. pallone. mr. speaker, i yield myself such time as i may consume. under the current approval process for lng exports, the department of energy has a tool to protect american consumers, and that tool is the public interest determination. the doe has the ability to weigh the benefits and costs of additional lng exports, including the impact of increased domestic natural gas prices on consumers, who use gas to heat and cool their homes and to turn on the lights. rigid deadlines, as suggested in this legislation, could prevent the doe from conducting a meaningful public interest review, and that means that the doe might not be able to ensure that high levels of lng exports do not harm american consumers by raising the costs of electricity or home heating or cooling. i think consumers, mr. speaker, have reason to be concerned. experts at the nonpartisan u.s. energy information administration examined this issue, and here is what they found: in the scenarios with additional gas exports, consumers will consume less and pay more on both their natural gas and electricity bills. furthermore, the eia calculated that high levels of lng exports could mean increased residential, commercial, and industrial consumer energy costs of $7 billion to $14 billion per year between 2020 and 2040. make no mistake. american consumers will foot that bill. recent experience with gasoline and propane exports also offers cautionary tales. the midwest and northeast experienced sharp propane price spikes and shortages last winter. significant increases in propane exports were a key factor in the skyrocketing prices that hurt consumers. just yesterday, the center for american progress released an analysis on the potential impact of expanded lng exports on consumers. they found that, in 2020, residential consumers would pay 4.3 percent more for natural gas per year, and those in the midwest--in states like arkansas, louisiana, and texas--would be the hardest hit by price increases. by 2040, consumers in the mid-atlantic states would pay 10 percent more for natural gas per year. these figures are not insignificant. we need to make sure that lng exports do not hurt consumers. right now, the doe has the ability to do that. so, before we disregard any meaningful public interest review and allow the unrestricted exporting of lng, let's be sure that our constituents won't be left footing the bill. i reserve the balance of my time. mr. whitfield. mr. speaker, i yield 2 minutes to the distinguished gentleman from texas (mr. babin). mr. babin. thank you, mr. chairman. mr. speaker, i rise in strong support of h.r. 351, the lng permitting certainty and transparency act. america's energy producers and the tens of thousands of americans they employ stand ready to meet the demand for a reliable and secure source of natural gas from america and the world. they have completed their reviews, have passed their tests, and are ready to get to work, but there is one big problem--the obama administration is standing in the way. the president and his anti- american energy agenda have placed a de facto ban on lng exports by logjamming their requests and using bureaucratic red tape to block america's progress. this bill breaks the bureaucratic gridlock and expedites the approval of lng exports. i have seen firsthand the jobs and the opportunities that an lng facility has created for the people of east texas, in my district. let's help the american worker by approving h.r. 351. mr. pallone. again, mr. speaker, may i ask the time that remains on both sides. the speaker pro tempore. the gentleman from new jersey has 11 minutes remaining, and the gentleman from kentucky has 13 minutes remaining. mr. pallone. mr. speaker, i yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from new york (mr. tonko), who is the ranking member of our environment subcommittee. mr. tonko. i thank the gentleman from new jersey. mr. speaker, it is unfortunate that we are beginning the 114th congress the way we ended the previous one--with legislation that is more about message than about solving real problems. the message of h.r. 351 is that we are interested in elevating the interests of the oil and gas industry above any others. consumers will not benefit from this policy, and manufacturers will not benefit from this policy. eliminating the public interest determination sends that message clearly. [[page h650]] in spite of the assertions by its supporters, h.r. 351 won't do much for our allies either, especially those in europe or ukraine. the bill fixes no problem. there is no backlog of applications at the department of energy. japan, our ally and the world's largest purchaser of lng, has three importers who signed contracts in 2013 with three approved lng export facilities, those being freeport, cameron, and cove point. because natural gas is such an important and strategic resource, we should, if anything, be questioning the administration about the wisdom of issuing so many approvals. why? they are relying on assumptions, models, and estimates of recoverable domestic gas reserves that are very uncertain and that have been decreasing as new information becomes available. exporters sign these contracts to guarantee deliveries for some 10 to 20 years. i am not willing to risk price spikes for consumers, families, and small businesses or to risk the benefits of lower gas prices for our manufacturing sector for a slightly improved trade balance. i am unwilling to repeal the requirement for a consideration of the public interest before more export facilities are approved, not for a resource that is so strategic and widely used. h.r. 351 does not fix any real problems, but it could, indeed, help to create some. therefore, mr. speaker, i urge the defeat of this bill. mr. whitfield. mr. speaker, i yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from california (mr. mccarthy), the distinguished majority leader. mr. mccarthy. i thank the gentleman for yielding. mr. speaker, the president likes to talk about infrastructure. in his state of the union address, he said that there is bipartisan support for infrastructure legislation and that republicans and democrats need to ``set our sights higher than a single oil pipeline.'' we have listened, and we have done that. after passing a bill to approve keystone, this house passed another bill last week to reform the natural gas permitting process. now the house is on its third energy infrastructure bill with representative bill johnson's lng permitting certainty and transparency act. i know the president doesn't pay much attention to what goes on here on capitol hill, but three infrastructure bills in 3 weeks is hard to miss. here are some other numbers, mr. speaker, that i think the president really should remember: though the department of energy has received 37 permits in the past 5 years, it has only approved five permits in that time. that is one a year. if the president cared about infrastructure as much as he says, i think he would get his administration to process the rest of them now. passing this bill would also lead to the creation of an estimated 45,000 jobs. more permit approvals mean more opportunity. more opportunity requires more infrastructure. more infrastructure means more jobs. delay has become a hallmark of this presidency, but americans are done delaying job creation by ignoring america's energy abundance. {time} 1000 american energy supports american jobs. it supports a strong economy. it also gives our friends--like ukraine, our allies--an alternative source of energy, diluting the power countries like russia and iran who use their oil to coerce and even oppress. mr. speaker, the president should know that here in the house we have set our sights very high; but, mr. speaker, the question is: will the president set his sights higher than his veto pen? mr. pallone. mr. speaker, i yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from illinois (mr. rush). mr. rush. mr. speaker, again, i wanted to return to the floor because the thought occurs to me, as it should to all of the american people, that we should consider the impact of this bill, the impact of lng exports, and the impact that it would have on u.s. manufacturing. mr. speaker, at the end of the day, let us protect, by all means, american jobs. let us protect american manufacturing. cheap domestic natural gas prices are providing a big boost and competitive advantage to u.s. manufacturing. we can all agree on that on both sides of the aisle. mr. speaker, the disagreement occurs when the other side, the republicans, are asking us in this congress to make a hasty decision that could undermine the advantage that we are now experiencing in the rapid increase in manufacturing. this bill runs the risk of reducing our competitive advantage that we have now in the manufacturing sector. it requires doe to rush its process and make final decisions on pending applications to export a huge quantity of lng. if all of the pending applications are granted, doe will authorize the export of approximately 38 million cubic feet per day of lng. that is more than half of the total u.s. natural gas consumption. it is more than the world's largest lng exporter, qatar, currently makes each and every day. there is no question, mr. speaker, in my mind or in the minds of the american people that exports of that magnitude will increase the domestic price of natural gas. it just makes common sense, and it is what the eia found when it studied the economic impact of increased lng imports. where is your study? how do you answer the conclusions of the eia when it found again that the economic impact of increased influence will increase the domestic price of natural gas? what amount of american manufacturing? what amount of american jobs? let's protect american manufacturing. let's protect american jobs. because this bill truncates doe's public interest review, the department may not even be able to fully analyze the impacts of the very high level of lng exports on american consumers, on american jobs, and on american manufacturing. my friends on the other side--and they are indeed my friends--always want to talk about american manufacturing, how we have to support american manufacturing, how we have to raise the level of american manufacturing, how we have to increase the american manufacturing sector, how we have to increase the american manufacturing jobs. this very bill could undermine all that sense of goodwill and all those pronouncements from the other side. what about american manufacturing and what about american manufacturing jobs? don't abandon american manufacturing. don't abandon american manufacturing jobs. don't abandon the american people. let's slow this process down. all we are doing, mr. speaker, is jeopardizing american manufacturing and american manufacturing jobs. mr. whitfield. mr. speaker, i continue to reserve the balance of my time. mr. pallone. mr. speaker, i yield myself such time as i may consume. mr. speaker, in closing, as the ranking member of the energy and commerce committee, i am committed to developing sound energy policy, and that policy surely includes consideration of the role that natural gas can play in our energy mix. our energy picture is changing every year. the latest development is low oil prices, but we have other developments in recent years, including rapidly increasing domestic production of oil and natural gas and a welcomed increase in wind and solar electricity production. we are becoming more efficient, but our energy infrastructure is becoming outdated. we need to look at the ways we produce and use energy, but we also need to look at the ways that we move, transmit, and store energy. we need to innovate in the energy space, but we also need to maintain reliability and lower energy bills. we need to look at all our energy issues through the lens of climate change and public health. mr. speaker, i think there are legitimate questions about whether we want to send our natural gas to other countries. that might help our trade balance, but it would have negative impacts on our domestic manufacturing sector. i don't claim that i have all the answers. i know that we looked at some of these issues last congress, but i don't agree that a clear consensus emerged. in any event, this is a new [[page h651]] congress with scores of new members who have never looked at this issue before. i think we should take these issues back to the energy and commerce committee and let the committee and its 12 new members do its job. let us look at the facts again as they are today, not last year or last congress. i think if we were to do that, we would see that even if this legislation was once necessary, it isn't anymore. doe has modernized its process and any backlog that once existed isn't an issue at this point. doe and the administration have opened the way for lng exports, but i think it continues to be necessary for us to assess whether approving an application for additional export is in the public interest because becoming the world's largest exporter of natural gas is not something we should do lightly, unadvisedly, or without the latest facts. this january, we have spent much of our time bringing bills from last congress to the floor and rushing them through to the senate, which is still considering the keystone legislation we passed the first week of this year. i think we might well have served ourselves and the american people better by sitting down together in the energy and commerce committee and working carefully on an energy policy aimed at the future rather than at an energy policy aimed at the past. i am going to vote ``no'' on this legislation, and i encourage my colleagues to oppose it as well. i yield back the balance of my time. mr. whitfield. mr. speaker, i yield myself such time as i may consume. the former speaker, the distinguished gentleman from illinois, talked a lot about the impact on the manufacturing base in america this legislation might have. i would like to point out that the national association of manufacturers, which is the largest manufacturing association in the united states, representing manufacturers in every industrial sector in all 50 states, in a letter dated yesterday, urges members to support h.r. 351. they go on to say that it is important to ensure that ``market forces, rather than bureaucratic inertia, govern international trade.'' that is really what this legislation is all about; it is about market forces. representatives from countries around the world are coming to us and asking for this product. we are fortunate in america that we have an abundance of natural gas. in fact, the energy information agency reported today that it is so abundant that natural gas prices have dropped to their lowest level since september 2012. earlier, there was an expression of concern about increased natural gas prices. we understand that prices go up and prices go down, but right now, they are at their lowest level since september 2012, and when natural gas prices go down too low, you see less production. that increases prices as well. we didn't just wake up one day and decide to introduce this legislation. concerned groups involved in this business came to congress and said: we need some help. when we started having hearings on this a year and 2 years ago, the department of energy started trying to speed up the process a little bit, but we are not dictating what their decision should be on allowing the export to non-free trade agreement countries. we are just saying: you need to make the decision sooner, and we want some transparency. that is all this legislation is about. now, we understand that any time you talk in today's world about exporting a fossil fuel, one of the undercurrents is climate change, and i would remind everyone that co 2 emissions in america are the lowest that they have been in 20 years. this country does not have to take a backseat to any country in the world, and so we want the market to play its role. this is a good, commonsense piece of legislation that will create jobs in america, will encourage the expansion of more natural gas production at a time when the world needs it and we need it. i would urge every member of this house to vote in favor of h.r. 351, and i yield back the balance of my time. ms. jackson lee. mr. speaker, i rise to speak in opposition to h.r. 351, the ``lng permitting certainty and transparency act.'' mr. speaker, i am not anti-energy exploration. i am not anti-trade. i am, however strongly ``pro-jobs,'' ``pro-economic growth,'' and ``pro- sustainable environment.'' as a member of congress from houston i have always been mindful of the importance of, and have strongly advocated for, national energy policies that will make our nation energy independent, preserve and create jobs, and keep our nation's economy strong. that is why i carefully consider each energy legislative proposal brought to the floor on its individual merits and support them when they are sound, balanced, fair, and promote the national interest. where they fall short, i believe in working across the aisle to improve them if possible by offering constructive amendments. although i believe the nation would benefit by increased exports of natural gas, the legislation before contains several provisions that are of great concern to me. pursuant to section 2, subsection (a) of the bill, an application for authorization to export lng is ``deemed'' approved if the department of energy (doe) or other federal agencies do not approve or deny the application within 30 days of the conclusion of the site review. i have three concerns with this regulatory scheme. first, as a senior member of the committee on the judiciary, i have a problem with ``deeming'' something done that has not been done in fact. thus, the provision is unwise. second, this provision is a remedy in search of a problem. there is no lengthy or intolerable backlog of neglected natural gas export authority applications awaiting action by doe. the provision is unnecessary because doe has to date authorized the export of over 10 billion cubic feet per day of lng to non-free trade agreement countries. together with exports to fta countries, this level of lng exports that would transform the united states into one of the world's largest exporters. third, the provision is irresponsible because it would require doe and other agencies to make decisions based on incomplete information or information that may not be available within the stringent deadlines, and to deny applications that otherwise would have been approved, but for lack of sufficient review time. supporters of this bill argue that it is vital, in the face of russian aggression and restrictions, to provide our allies in europe with additional exports of lng. however, because actual exports through approved terminals are not expected to begin until late 2015, this legislation will have no impact on current exports. and, limiting the time for review would prevent doe from properly analyzing the domestic impact that of exporting large amounts of lng. the energy information administration (eia) estimates that increased exports could result in an increase of as much as 8 percent in domestic lng prices. given the inherent delicacy involved in assessing the impact of trade authorizations, both domestically and abroad, this state of affairs is likely to lead to doe erring on the side of caution and denying applications that may otherwise have been approved if it had more time and more resources to carry out its responsibilities. for these reasons, i urge all members to oppose the bill before us and urge my colleagues to join me. the speaker pro tempore. all time for debate has expired. pursuant to house resolution 48, the previous question is ordered on the bill. the question is on the engrossment and third reading of the bill. the bill was ordered to be engrossed and read a third time, and was read the third time. motion to recommit mr. garamendi. mr. speaker, i have a motion to recommit at the desk. the speaker pro tempore. is the gentleman opposed to the bill? mr. garamendi. i am opposed. the speaker pro tempore. the clerk will report the motion to recommit. the clerk read as follows: mr. garamendi moves to recommit the bill, h.r. 351, to the committee on energy and commerce with instructions to report the same back to the house forthwith with the following amendment: at the end of the bill, insert the following new section: sec. 4. protecting our national security and creating american jobs. in reviewing an application for authorization to export natural gas under section 3 of the natural gas act (15 u.s.c. 717b), the department of energy-- (1) shall deny such application if the natural gas would be exported to any nation [[page h652]] that is a state sponsor of terrorism or otherwise threatens america's national security, or to any nation or corporation that steals america's military technology or intellectual property through cyber-attacks; and (2) shall require, as a condition for approval of any such authorization, the applicant to ensure that united states- flagged and built ships and shipping containers are used to export the lng as such vessels become available for charter. mr. whitfield (during the reading). mr. speaker, i reserve a point of order against the motion to recommit. the speaker pro tempore. a point of order is reserved. the clerk will continue to read. the clerk continued to read. the speaker pro tempore. pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from california is recognized for 5 minutes in support of his motion. mr. garamendi. mr. speaker, this final amendment to the bill will not kill the bill. frankly, it will substantially improve it. it won't send it back to committee. if adopted, the bill will come to the floor for a vote later this morning. we have heard a lot of discussion here about jobs in the rules committee, and i thank the chair, mr. whitfield, for his interest in this particular proposal and for the rules committee listening to the debate very carefully about how we can significantly advance america's national interest. {time} 1015 natural gas is a strategic asset. it has allowed us to substantially reduce our energy costs in the united states; replace, re-power many of our power plants; bring down the cost; and, frankly, lead to an increased manufacturing sector. shipbuilding is also a strategic national asset. our navy depends upon it. however, 107,000 americans work in the shipbuilding industry in our ports and ship yards. it is a strategic asset, as are the mariners. american mariners are also a strategic asset. what we are trying to do with this amendment is to bring together these three strategic assets of america and advance the american economy and our national security at the same time. this amendment would simply require that if we are going to export liquefied natural gas, a strategic asset, then we should do it in a way that advances our national security and our economy by requiring that those ships be manned and ``womanned'' by american mariners, the captains, the engineers, the sailors, that they be american. this is a safety issue. natural gas is a very volatile issue, and, under current law, when it is imported, it has to have american mariners on board. similarly, by requiring that the ships be american-built, we will be able to employ several hundred thousand new men and women in our shipyards. if it is about jobs--and we all claim this bill is about jobs--then let's take it another step. let's take it another step, so that we really rebuild the american shipping industry, that we put american mariners to work, that we revitalize our shipyards, so that our u.s. navy will be able to have a robust competition for their ships. there are 117 shipyards in the united states that build ships. none of them, yet, build these tankers. they could if we pass this amendment. let's build it in america. let's make it in america. this is a strategy that is employed by india, which has a tender out to buy gas from the united states. that tender requires that three of the ships used to transport that be built in india. i say let's build the other seven in the united states. they want american natural gas; build the ships in america. we know that this is a big industry. cheniere needs 100 ships when they begin to ship natural gas, lng, from their new terminal in texas-- 100 ships. are those american ships? no, not without this amendment. those ships will be chinese ships in chinese shipyards built by chinese. how about america? how about building it in america? that is what this amendment is about. we can all agree that we want american jobs. is there one among the 435 of us who wants the jobs to be in china or korea or japan? i don't think so. let's do it in america. this is an american-made amendment. this is an amendment for american workers, american shipyards. this is not going to kill the bill. this is going to make this bill into a real ``make it in america,'' a real american jobs bill with hundreds of thousands of jobs spread throughout this nation. mr. chairman, work with us. make this into a real, robust american jobs bill. adopt this amendment. put aside the normal game we play with mtrs, which is just kind of a kabuki dance here. let's do it for the american workers, for the american shipyards all across this nation. that is what this is about. this is an unexpected opportunity that has come about because of our great natural gas industry here. take advantage of it. think about the national security. think about our shipyards, the u.s. navy, the mariners. make it in america. adopt this amendment. mr. speaker, i yield back the balance of my time. mr. whitfield. mr. speaker, i withdraw my reservation of a point of order. the speaker pro tempore. the reservation of the point of order is withdrawn. mr. whitfield. mr. speaker, i claim the time in opposition to the motion. the speaker pro tempore. the gentleman from kentucky is recognized for 5 minutes in opposition to the motion. mr. whitfield. mr. speaker, first of all, i want to thank the gentleman from california for offering this motion to recommit. it has two basic parts to it. the first part relates to denying applications of natural gas that would be exported to any nation that is a state- sponsored terrorist. we feel quite confident that, under the existing law and under h.r. 351, the department of energy is not going to approve the export of natural gas that is going to be in the public interest to any terrorist state. the second question, which is a very important question--and as i said in the rules committee and say on the floor, i am delighted that mr. garamendi has raised this issue about u.s.-flagged ships being involved in the export. as you know, his amendment goes to the jones act, and the jones act, as we all know, requires u.s.-flagged ships between ports here in the united states, but it does not expand to export and the use in other countries, and that raises a much broader issue than this very narrow- focused bill. i do think that that discussion needs to take place at some point in time, but, at this time, i am going to respectfully request the members to reject the motion to recommit. i, and others, would look forward to talking to mr. garamendi in more detail about a broader debate on what impact expanding the jones act would have on our international trade. mr. speaker, i yield back the balance of my time. the speaker pro tempore. without objection, the previous question is ordered on the motion to recommit. there was no objection. the speaker pro tempore. the question is on the motion to recommit. the question was taken; and the speaker pro tempore announced that the noes appeared to have it. mr. garamendi. mr. speaker, on that i demand the yeas and nays. the yeas and nays were ordered. the speaker pro tempore. pursuant to clause 9 of rule xx, the speaker will reduce to 5 minutes the minimum time for any electronic vote on the question of passage

Under the Speaker's announced policy of January 6, 2015, the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Gohmert) is recognized for 60 minutes as the designee of the majority leader. Mr. GOHMERT. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Clawson). No Nuclear Iran Mr. CLAWSON. Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. Gohmert for yielding to me. Already a grave and growing existential threat to Israel, a nuclear armed Iran would be a colossal, horrific game changer. It would launch a nuclear arms race in what is already the world's most dangerous neighborhood. We all know that this must not be allowed to happen. The Islamic Republic of Iran's nuclear ambitions are made more dire when considering that they are the world's most dangerous state supporter of Islamic extremist terrorism, with a destabilizing presence in Lebanon, in Syria, and in Iraq. And Iran's financial and military support for the Houthi rebels in Yemen has led to the collapse of the Hadi government. Thus, Iran today exerts major influence, not just in rebel territories, but in four Middle East capitals--Beirut, Baghdad, Damascus and Sana'a. The crisis in Yemen threatens to launch yet another civil war in the region, and this severely handcuffs U.S. counterterrorism operations against AQAP. Islamists in Iran and elsewhere repeatedly threaten to slaughter all standing in their way--with their ultimate targets being Israel and the United States--us, their great Satan. They must never be allowed nuclear weapons capabilities. Does anyone really doubt whether they would use these capabilities someday? Well, there must be some reason why Iran is developing ICBMs. Last week, Iran's Channel 2 broadcast satellite imagery showing recently constructed missile-related sites. Those sites included a launch pad capable of firing an ICBM, and on that launch pad was a never-seen-before missile measuring 27 meters in length. While we negotiate, the Iran story gets worse. We have been extending deadlines and softening sanctions on Iran, while they fail to meet their end of the bargain. {time} 1115 It is bizarre to me that we are debating with the Iranians the numbers of their centrifuges but leaving off the table their support for terrorism, their ICBMs, and their continued human rights violations. Is it the right thing to do to sit across the table, remain silent about the costs we and our allies have paid and are paying because of their financial and military support of our enemies? Does this make sense? Shouldn't we insist on adding to the agenda Iran's destabilizing actions in the region and also their ICBM program that puts us all at risk? Merely delaying some of the potential horror for a decade or so is not a good option in my view. A bad deal where we declare victory by kicking this can down the road is far worse than no deal at all. Iran now threatens to end nuclear talks if Congress increases sanctions against their regime. I say we must never yield to threats from Iran or any other nation. We must stand strong, continue sanctions, and even strengthen them until Iran gets the message. I believe that strengthening sanctions will get us a better deal. Leverage produces a better deal. We must remain unwavering in our support for Israel. We must listen carefully to the concerns of Prime Minister Netanyahu on this subject. I hope we unite with our Arab partners and do all that is possible to prevent Iran from going nuclear. We must lead the civilized world in this crucial mission. I think this is our destiny. We urge President Obama to join with Congress in this resolve. Mr. GOHMERT. Mr. Speaker, there is a great deal going on, and I think the first thing that needs to be addressed is the 70th anniversary of something that should never have happened in civilized society. This is the 70th anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz death camp. As a schoolboy growing up in east Texas, later attending Texas A&M, and especially in my time, my 4 years in the United States Army, as we discussed and looked at World War II, things that had occurred then--I was a history major and was with the Army for 4 years and majored in history. It was just always amazing. How could people who said they were civilized kill 6 million of any race, gender, national origin? How could that happen? But it did happen. On learning that Eisenhower required people from the surrounding villages to be brought in to help clean up concentration camps, death camps--as I understood the reason--was so no one could ever deny that the death camps occurred. I thought that seemed ridiculous. How could anybody deny the Holocaust? There aren't all that many survivors, but there are enough, and the evidence is there, and it clearly happened. But just as Hitler showed, if any lie is told often enough, people begin to believe it, especially if it is even printed. Here is something that was in print yesterday from a man named Martin Greenfield from foxnews.com, and these are Martin Greenfield's words. Mr. Greenfield said: Seventy years ago, I was in a Nazi concentration camp. Since then, I have seen tyrants and dictators enter and exit the global stage; yet as the world prepares to mark the 70th anniversary of the Auschwitz liberation, it is perhaps well and right that we reflect on how the Holocaust shocked the moral imagination on a scale the world could scarcely fathom. Why ponder such things? Because for far too many, the Holocaust remains a mystery. A major poll taken last year of 53,000 people found that just 54 percent had ever heard of the Holocaust. Knowledge of Auschwitz is likely even more limited, particularly among young people. Past surveys have shown that nearly half of Britons had never heard of Auschwitz. Some schoolchildren even thought Auschwitz was a type of beer. Here at home in America, a debate erupted last year when a teenager posted a smiling selfie at Auschwitz. Whatever your opinion on the appropriateness of her actions, I was at least pleased to be reminded that some young Americans still visit the Nazi concentration camp to learn history up close. I, too, visited Auschwitz as a teenager. In 1944, my family and I stood in line before Dr. Josef Mengele--the Nazi physician known as the ``Angel of Death''--as my mother, grandparents, two sisters, and baby brother were [[Page H656]] all sent to the left to be burned in Hitler's ovens. My father and I were sent to the right. The first night inside Auschwitz, my father said we must separate because, together, we would suffer double. He quoted his father, ``On your own, you will survive,'' his father told him. ``You are young and strong, and I know you will survive. If you survive by yourself, you must honor us by living, by not feeling sorry for us. This is what you must do.'' That was the last time I ever saw my father. I am grateful for my father's words of grace and guidance. They echo in my heart even still. It is a cruel thing, feeling guilty for surviving, but my father erased any future guilt and replaced it with purpose. It was a gift only a father's wisdom could give. It gave me a reason to go forward, a reason to be. It does still. Part of heeding my father's words involved replacing the horrors of my Holocaust past with a life spent creating beauty in the form of hand-tailored suits for U.S. Presidents, Hollywood films, and the world's most influential men. In fact, my first sewing lesson took place in the Auschwitz concentration camp laundry when I accidentally ripped the collar of a Nazi soldier's shirt. A guard beat me before a kind, older inmate taught me how to sew a simple stitch to repair the torn shirt. It was hardly the ideal tailoring apprenticeship, but it was my first lesson in the skill that became my livelihood. But at 86, another part of honoring my father's wishes requires being a voice for the voiceless. Indeed, as parents, educators, and citizens, we must all do our part to help ensure that ``Never Forget'' remains much more than a threadbare catchphrase that gathers dust and loses meaning with each passing year. For example, many people are surprised to learn that Auschwitz was actually a complex comprised of three main camps and dozens of satellites. The United States Holocaust Memorial Museum's statistics estimate that between 1940 and 1945, at least 1.1 million Jews and 200,000 of Hitler's undesirables were sent to the Auschwitz complex. Of those, 1.1 million were murdered. As I have noted elsewhere, that number would have been far greater were it not for the courage of the American soldiers, sailors, airmen, and marines who traveled around the world to defeat a moral darkness that consumed at least 6 million Jewish souls. That is a lesson worthy of remembrance. The 70th anniversary of the liberation marks that moment when freedom conquered barbarism through sureness of virtue and strength of will. Sadly, as recent events reveal, that remains a lesson humanity must learn and relearn from generation to generation. The word ``Holocaust'' means sacrifice by fire. May the memory of the millions who were engulfed in the flames like my family never be forgotten. That is Martin Greenfield, 70 years after being liberated from Auschwitz death camp. There is another article from CBC News. Aleksandra Sagan includes this regarding Mordechai Ronen, 82, born with the family name Markovits. He would be making a second visit to Auschwitz for the commemoration ceremonies. At nearly 12, Ronen saw Auschwitz for the first time as a prisoner after soldiers forced all the Jews in his Hungarian town into a ghetto and, 2 weeks later, shipped them in cattle cars to the camp. Dr. Josef Mengele, the Nazis' Angel of Death, sent Ronen's mother and two sisters to the gas chambers on arrival. Young Ronen made a lifesaving decision when he held on to his father's hand and joined the line of men. He spent about 2 weeks at Auschwitz, where he witnessed soldiers using an infant for target practice and slept on piles of corpses to avoid selection for the gas chamber. He and his father were moved to a nearby labor camp where the brutality continued. One day, his father told Ronen he could no longer get up to work for the cement brigade. Ronen last saw his father as soldiers took him away. It is the only day he remembers crying and the day he decided to survive. Ronen was liberated from a third camp, Gunskirchen, and remembers walking to a nearby town, knocking on a resident's door and asking if he could take a shower. Ronen, who prefers to be called a ``victorer'' rather than a survivor, first returned to Auschwitz in 1999, when he guided then-Prime Minister Jean Chretien around the grounds. It is important to Ronen to show the world he is alive and to share the history of the Holocaust. ``Maybe the world will realize what we went through, and it will be the end, and we are going to have peace and quiet in the world,'' he explains. Unfortunately, it is not the end of horrors. Tragically, Christians now are being killed, persecuted, and tortured in greater numbers than ever in the history of the world. {time} 1130 Anti-Semitism, hatred against Jews, is growing like I couldn't have imagined. In college, when I studied in history, I couldn't have imagined the kind of anti-Jewish hatred, the kind of anti-Semitism that would be growing as it has, and the United States of America would be doing precious little about it instead of standing up for the Jewish people and calling out anti-Semitism where it exists and where it grows and proliferates, as it does in the United Nations, for example, as it has in Europe, as it has in England, as it has right here in America. It is unconscionable that at a time in world history when the United States is said to be the true superpower of the world--even as that power has been seen as diminishing by people around the world, as polling indicates around the world, but still to be seen as the great superpower--as anti-Jewish hatred grows and we do precious little about it, and even at times stoke those flames, even in our universities, who are so proud of accepting massive amounts of money from people who are part of organizations that hate Jews and fund such courses or seminars on things like Islamophobia, not a liberated mental process of recognizing anti-Semitism, recognizing Jewish hatred--no, stoking those flames against the Jewish people. It is unbelievable that it is happening here in America as well. And it is even more unbelievable that it is happening among what some would refer to as the intelligentsia, those who are supposed to be more enlightened than the rest of a nation, who see things as they truly are. And yet, in America, some of those supposed enlightened intelligentsia are growing to be some of the most anti-Semitic people in the country. How did all this happen? Money for one thing, political power for another. But it has to stop. Money and initially power in Nazi Germany stoked the flames of anti-Jewish hatred. But there is anti-Christian hatred growing as well. Radical Islam has proliferated around the world. Violent radical Islam has grown. They aren't junior varsities. These are literal cutthroats who have to be stopped. It is not enough for the United States administration to beg radical Islamists, Jew- and Christian-hating leaders to sit at the table or offer to let their murderers go free if they will just sit down and visit with us, reminiscent of what Jimmy Carter wanted to do after an act of war was committed against our Embassy, and in the 36 years that have followed, what appeared to radical Islamists as a weak, paper tiger, toothless America did nothing but beg to sit down and talk and try to encourage Iran to let our prisoners go. It was not until Ronald Reagan took office they were released. They never wanted to fight the United States superpower. That has been changed over the years. Since '79, when they committed an act of war, attacked our Embassy, around the world people have been shown: Oh, you can do that against the United States and get away with it. The good thing is they may end up leaving your country and then they may offer to give you money. They may offer to release murderers from prison so they can come back and help kill more Americans. You know, they are not very smart over there in the United States. That has been going on since 1979. It is tragic when we encourage radical Islamist holocausts, which is what they would like to do, they said they were going to do, by letting the murderers go. How could this administration for months now think that Yemen was a great example of moderate Islam working out? I have known since a constituent months ago was in jeopardy, and we were able to get special ops people to help get them out. According to them, the Embassy was attacked many months ago. Back at the time Embassy personnel officially said: ``No, it was a nearby attack, but it wasn't us.'' When the Iranian-backed Houthis, the radical Islamists in Yemen, were taking over the capital and taking over the country--and instead of standing up firmly against them and protecting our American interests we were releasing murderers, radical Islamic murderers--we were talking about how wonderful things were in Yemen. That is exactly how the kind of anti-Jewish, anti-Christian sentiment could grow to the point of having a holocaust. [[Page H657]] It is literally breathtaking for an administration not to understand that while it is trying to placate radical Islamic leaders in Iran and telling them: ``We just want to talk. As long as you will keep talking to us, we will keep Israel from protecting themselves to their own detriment. Just keep talking to us and you keep those centrifuges spinning, that is fine with us.'' Now we know, we have been informed, that the administration has taken complete dismantlement of the centrifuges and their equipment to help them create nuclear weapons off the table. It is not even something they are demanding anymore. In other words, the word is out that this administration is apparently okay with Iran getting nukes but just would prefer that it wait until after this President leaves office. It doesn't matter when a President leaves office. If an administration gives bloodthirsty zealots the ability to create a holocaust, history does not forgive them simply because they had already left office when the holocaust actually started. Nigeria doesn't need us to send troops to stop the radical Islamists there, but they need help. Boko Haram continues to kill, rape, torture. There it is about going after Christians. The small-scale holocausts that Boko Haram is creating don't get so much as a whimper these days from this administration. They may say a few words, but they are hollow and they do not affect Boko Haram as they continue to be emboldened. Just like when the IRS was caught redhanded being weaponized and used as a Democratic political tool, which appears to have violated criminal law--yes, we have had hearings, but we haven't held them accountable. And, therefore, it seems to have encouraged even more impropriety by people within the IRS. When people get caught in impropriety and don't pay a cost, then you see what we are seeing in Nigeria, you see what we are seeing in Afghanistan, in Pakistan, in Syria, in Iran, in Iraq, and in Libya. Oh, I know the President, his administration, bragged about the Arab Spring and about taking out Qadhafi, who had become an ally after he gave up any efforts for nuclear weapons, completely opened his defenses to the United States. This administration and the prior administration had agreements with Qadhafi. But this administration never lets agreements get in the way of helping radical Islamists. Because this administration did help radical Islam turn Libya into a smoking country where people die, where our own people were not protected, because of the fantasy of those who thought that somehow the name, the United States, would be adequate to keep Chris Stevens and the other Americans safe in Benghazi. We didn't need to give them added security like they asked for, we didn't even need to respond when Chris Stevens called and said they were under attack--never said anything about a video because it was not. But that smokescreen worked. The President got reelected. He didn't have to account for that before the election, still hasn't had to account for where he was and why help was not forthcoming. I mean, even after 20 hours this administration that had planes--we know for sure within 3\1/2\ hours--after 20 hours they get a private plane there, that is it. David Ubben, with most of his leg, right leg, blown off, no painkillers, no morphine, they don't have a C-130 that they land to take him up in on a gurney. They get a private plane from somebody who wasn't even American, and they have to knock David up against the door, turning the gurney every which way trying to get him in, without painkillers, causing more pain, more suffering, because this administration, apparently they were thinking that if they sent more help than just a private plane like that, a military plane, if that were sent, it might look like Libya were not the wonderful country that this administration helped create by bombing Qadhafi out of existence. And, yes, it was not, it is true, it was not a U.S. bomb that took Qadhafi out. But our bombs put him on the run, our bombs stopped his caravan. Our President wouldn't respond for 3 days after Qadhafi offered to leave in exile and avoid any bloodshed before it all started. This administration didn't respond. Obviously, they were okay with having bloodshed and Qadhafi being wiped out. So they got what they were hoping for, obviously. {time} 1145 But what do we have now? We have a country in Libya that is in absolute turmoil. By the way, because Libya is in turmoil due to this administration, they are helping turn Egypt into as much turmoil as they can. Thank God for President el-Sisi. In having met with him on more than one occasion, I was impressed by the man. Before he was President, he asked that we bring back a message to this administration since this administration-- this President--froze the helicopters that were being sent, the Apaches. The question was: Does this administration--does this President--not understand that we use the Apache helicopters to keep the Suez Canal open? Although there were some that bought Morsi's lies that he was deweaponizing the Sinai--supposedly to diminish the threat to Israel from the Sinai--and after Morsi was removed for his unconstitutional actions, not in a coup but in an uprising, which was a peaceful revolution by reportedly over 30 million of their 90 million people, they found that the Sinai had been dramatically weaponized and had been contributing weapons equipment to Gaza to help threaten and cause terror to Israel. Once again, whether it is the Sinai, Gaza, northern Israel that was given to Lebanon, it seems going back to the very inception of Israel-- back when Israel was first brought, according to the Bible, into the Promised Land--we know of Canaan. The Canaanites no longer exist, so other people claim it who are not Canaanites. Actually, the Israelis had claim to it after the Canaanites. Others who occupied the land back over 3,000 years ago don't exist. This land, according to the Bible, was given to the children of Israel. It seems to be true that there has never been a time when Israel gave away land when trying to buy peace that that land that they gave away was not used as a staging area from which to attack it. Gaza, what a noble thing to do by the Israelis. They took an area that was prosperous, self-sustaining, with greenhouses growing vegetables that would feed the people who lived there. An amazing place was the Gaza Strip. Then some noble Israeli leaders thought, Do you know what? It is not required. We are getting absolutely nothing in return, but we are going to do the unilateral act that will be so noble, that will be so full of grace that the world, even those who don't like us, will go, Wow. Those Israelis, they are okay. They are nice folks. Look, they didn't get anything in return; yet they still gave away the Gaza Strip. What a wonderful group of people. I mean, that just doesn't happen. The United States never gave back its land to England or to Spain or to France or to other countries that initially had claims here. Other countries don't do that, but Israel did. They gave away the Gaza Strip. Previous to that, they had given away what northern Israel now calls southern Lebanon. Southern Lebanon, people will recall, has been the site of attacks on Israelis--war. So how was this grace, this beneficence of Israel's giving the Gaza Strip to the Palestinians, rewarded? It has been rewarded by their giving back to Israel thousands upon thousands upon thousands of rockets. Some kill. All terrorize. All cost money to Israel. The most important problem they have created is the threat to life, the threat to their existence; and we still have people in this country who say, Well, if you just keep giving away land, eventually, they will be satisfied, when the very materials that are being promoted by the people this administration supports among the Islamists--they made very clear the reason we name holidays, streets, areas, parks after suicide bombers who kill innocent children, women, men is that we, ultimately, are going to destroy Israel and wipe it off the map. We hate Jews that much; and this administration thinks, somehow, they will bring radical Islam around to really being this group of peace. Now, there is a document that was an exhibit in the United States v. the Holy Land Foundation in which there were many individuals and groups named as coconspirators. They were [[Page H658]] not indicted, but they were named as coconspirators. It includes the Council on American-Islamic Relations, CAIR, which has a nice office building just up the street here, and the Islamic Society of North America, ISNA, the leader of which is Imam Magid, who goes to the White House, who goes to the State Department, who advises the President and let's him know when somebody is criticizing Islam, so the administration steps in and goes after him. In this exhibit from the Holy Land Foundation trial--it was the biggest funding of terrorism case ever in U.S. history, and people who were involved originally had indicated the goal was to convict these first five, to name all of these coconspirators, and if we get convictions of those first five, like we think we should, then we proceed and go after the remainder. They were convicted in late 2008. President Obama took office a month or two later, and this administration would under no circumstances go after these people who had been alleged in the documents of funding radical Islamic terrorism even after the U.S. District Court in Dallas and the U.S. Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals in New Orleans confirmed that there was plenty of evidence to support that someone like ISNA or CAIR was a legitimate coconspirator named in the indictment and that their names would not be removed. I have asked for years now of the Justice Department to make available the documents that were provided to the convicted terrorists--those funding terrorism or terrorists--and this administration now, for years, has drug their feet and has refused to provide all of the documents that were provided to the terrorists. On one occasion, the Attorney General basically said there are issues here of privilege, and my point was--and is--you gave them to the terrorists; surely, you can give them to Members of Congress. But the answer is, no, they can't. They are going to keep obfuscating. They don't want us to see all of the documents that they had in their possession that they gave to the terrorists. I have a feeling, if we saw all of the documents, it would be very, very clear in the purging that this administration has done of our training materials of the FBI's, of the intelligence agency's, of the State Department's, and the Justice Department's that, if there is anything that might bother a radical Islamist who wants to kill us, then it has to be removed. They removed it. In the document from a 1991 meeting, in what is called an ``Explanatory Memorandum,'' it spells out their goals. It was written in 1991 by a member of the board of directors of the Muslim Brotherhood in North America and by a senior Hamas leader named Mohamed Akram. It had been approved by the Muslim Brotherhood's Shura Council and Organizational Conference, and it was meant for internal review by the Muslim Brotherhood leadership in Egypt. It was not intended for public consumption. These are the words from the introduction that is part of this document from the Center for Security Policy. Mr. Speaker, I want to quote from the document, itself, prepared by the Muslim Brotherhood in 1991, setting their goals for America: One: The Memorandum is Derived from: One, the general strategic goal of the group in America, which was approved by the Shura Council and the Organizational Conference for the year 1987, is: ``Enablement of Islam in North America, meaning: establishing an effective and stable Islamic movement led by the Muslim Brotherhood which adopts Muslims' causes domestically and globally and which works to expand the observant Muslim base; aims at unifying and directing Muslims' efforts; presents Islam as a civilization alternative; and supports the global Islamic state--if that name sounds familiar--wherever it is.'' Two, the priority that is approved by the Shura Council for the work of the group in its current and former session, which is ``settlement.'' Skipping down to ``Two: An Introduction to the Explanatory Memorandum,'' it says: The question we are facing is: ``How do you like to see the Islam movement in North America in 10 years?'' or ``taking along'' the following sentence when planning and working ``Islamic Work in North America in the year 2000: A strategic vision.'' It goes on: Also, we must summon and take along elements of the general strategic goal of the group in North America. For those large numbers of people in college who may not realize, North America is where we live. The document says: I will intentionally repeat them in numbers. They are: One, establishing an effective and stable Islamic movement led by the Muslim Brotherhood. Two, adopting Muslims' causes domestically and globally. Three, expanding the observant Muslim base. Four, unifying and directing Muslim efforts. Five, presenting Islam as a civilization alternative. Six, supporting the establishment of the global Islamic state, wherever it is. {time} 1200 The document says: It must be stressed that it has become clear and emphatically known that all is in agreement that we must ``settle'' or ``enable'' Islam and its movement in this part of the world. Three: The Concept of Settlement: The term was mentioned in the group's ``dictionary'' and documents with various meanings in spite of the fact that everyone meant one thing with it. We believe that the understanding of the essence is the same, and we will attempt here to give the word and its ``meanings'' a practical explanation with a practical movement tone and not a philosophical linguistic explanation, while stressing that this explanation of ours is not complete until our explanation of ``the process'' of settlement itself is understood which is mentioned in the following paragraph. We briefly say the following: Settlement: ``That Islam and its movement become a part of the homeland it lives in.'' Establishment: ``That Islam turns into firmly rooted organizations on whose bases civilization, structure, and testimony are built.'' Further down, it goes on, ``That Islam is stable in the land.'' Rooting: ``That Islam is resident and not a passing thing or rooted `entrenched' in the soil of the spot where it moves and not a strange plant to it.'' Four: The Process of Settlement: In order for Islam and its movement to become ``a part of the homeland'' in which it lives-- Talking about North America. --``stable'' in its land, ``rooted'' in the spirits and minds of its people, ``enabled'' in the life of its society and has firmly established ``organizations'' on which the Islamic structure is built and with which the testimony of civilization is achieved, the movement must plan and struggle to obtain ``the keys'' and the tools of this process in carrying out this grand mission as a ``civilization jihadist'' responsibility which lies on the shoulders of Muslims and--on top of them--the Muslim Brotherhood in this country. Talking about here in the United States, North America. ``Among these keys and tools are the following.'' It goes on to talk about the settlement concept and the fundamental shift toward settlement of this country. Number four: Understanding the Role of the Muslim Brother in North America: The process of settlement is a ``civilization jihadist process,'' with all the word means. Anyway, it goes on. Another place here, it says: There is a conviction--with which this memorandum disagrees--that our focus in attempting to settle Islam in this country will lead to negligence in our duty towards the global Islamic movement in supporting its project to establish the state. We believe that the reply is in two segments. One, the success of the movement in America-- Talking about the United States of America. One, the success of the movement in America in establishing an observant Islamic base with power and effectiveness will be the best support and aid to the global movement project. And the second is the global movement has not succeeded yet in ``distributing roles'' to its branches, stating what is the needed from them as one of the participants or contributors to the project to establish the global Islamic state. The day this happens, the children of the American Ikhwani branch will have far-reaching impact and positions that make the ancestors proud. It is a great document goal for taking over the United States, which brings another story to the surface. It is from Bob Price from breitbart.com. ``Islamic Tribunal Confirmed in Texas; Attorney Claims 'It's Voluntary,''' and it talks about the new Islamic tribunal in Texas that has been confirmed now by Breitbart Texas. The tribunal is operating as a nonprofit organization in Dallas. Because when you understand the goals, if there is a major defeat or a major success, [[Page H659]] Muslim Brotherhood requires a mosque be built there and a presence there. Naturally, they would want one at Ground Zero in New York; further, they would want a mosque and a strong presence in Dallas which was, they believe, the place of their big defeat when the Holy Land Foundation principals were convicted and sent to prison. I did want to point out, as we finish up here today, that the President was giving an excellent speech in India about the importance of stopping the global war on women. He didn't call it that. He only calls it that for Republicans, but there is a war on women, and it is not by Republicans. It is radical Islam and even some moderate Islamists. He is giving this talk about the importance of recognizing the importance and the equality of women--or some of us might say they are more equal than we are--but as he was doing that, this picture was on Saudi television. We have our United States President depicted here, and this is the First Lady of the United States of America being blurred out by this country's allies because she wasn't covered. Michelle Obama should never need to be covered if she doesn't want to be; yet at the very time our President is talking about equality of women, he fails to notice that people that he considers allies are treating his own wife like this. Mr. Speaker, it is critical that we stand up against radical Islam or any Islam that wants a settlement civilization jihad in America. Anything and anybody who disagrees with the United States Constitution and wants to destroy it, tear it down, is an enemy to the United States and needs to be recognized as such and not welcomed with open arms at the State Department and the White House. With that, I yield back the balance of my time. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 14 (Wednesday, January 28, 2015)] [House] [Pages H655-H659] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] COMBATING TERRORISM The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under the Speaker's announced policy of January 6, 2015, the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Gohmert) is recognized for 60 minutes as the designee of the majority leader. Mr. GOHMERT. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Clawson). No Nuclear Iran Mr. CLAWSON. Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. Gohmert for yielding to me. Already a grave and growing existential threat to Israel, a nuclear armed Iran would be a colossal, horrific game changer. It would launch a nuclear arms race in what is already the world's most dangerous neighborhood. We all know that this must not be allowed to happen. The Islamic Republic of Iran's nuclear ambitions are made more dire when considering that they are the world's most dangerous state supporter of Islamic extremist terrorism, with a destabilizing presence in Lebanon, in Syria, and in Iraq. And Iran's financial and military support for the Houthi rebels in Yemen has led to the collapse of the Hadi government. Thus, Iran today exerts major influence, not just in rebel territories, but in four Middle East capitals--Beirut, Baghdad, Damascus and Sana'a. The crisis in Yemen threatens to launch yet another civil war in the region, and this severely handcuffs U.S. counterterrorism operations against AQAP. Islamists in Iran and elsewhere repeatedly threaten to slaughter all standing in their way--with their ultimate targets being Israel and the United States--us, their great Satan. They must never be allowed nuclear weapons capabilities. Does anyone really doubt whether they would use these capabilities someday? Well, there must be some reason why Iran is developing ICBMs. Last week, Iran's Channel 2 broadcast satellite imagery showing recently constructed missile-related sites. Those sites included a launch pad capable of firing an ICBM, and on that launch pad was a never-seen-before missile measuring 27 meters in length. While we negotiate, the Iran story gets worse. We have been extending deadlines and softening sanctions on Iran, while they fail to meet their end of the bargain. {time} 1115 It is bizarre to me that we are debating with the Iranians the numbers of their centrifuges but leaving off the table their support for terrorism, their ICBMs, and their continued human rights violations. Is it the right thing to do to sit across the table, remain silent about the costs we and our allies have paid and are paying because of their financial and military support of our enemies? Does this make sense? Shouldn't we insist on adding to the agenda Iran's destabilizing actions in the region and also their ICBM program that puts us all at risk? Merely delaying some of the potential horror for a decade or so is not a good option in my view. A bad deal where we declare victory by kicking this can down the road is far worse than no deal at all. Iran now threatens to end nuclear talks if Congress increases sanctions against their regime. I say we must never yield to threats from Iran or any other nation. We must stand strong, continue sanctions, and even strengthen them until Iran gets the message. I believe that strengthening sanctions will get us a better deal. Leverage produces a better deal. We must remain unwavering in our support for Israel. We must listen carefully to the concerns of Prime Minister Netanyahu on this subject. I hope we unite with our Arab partners and do all that is possible to prevent Iran from going nuclear. We must lead the civilized world in this crucial mission. I think this is our destiny. We urge President Obama to join with Congress in this resolve. Mr. GOHMERT. Mr. Speaker, there is a great deal going on, and I think the first thing that needs to be addressed is the 70th anniversary of something that should never have happened in civilized society. This is the 70th anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz death camp. As a schoolboy growing up in east Texas, later attending Texas A&M, and especially in my time, my 4 years in the United States Army, as we discussed and looked at World War II, things that had occurred then--I was a history major and was with the Army for 4 years and majored in history. It was just always amazing. How could people who said they were civilized kill 6 million of any race, gender, national origin? How could that happen? But it did happen. On learning that Eisenhower required people from the surrounding villages to be brought in to help clean up concentration camps, death camps--as I understood the reason--was so no one could ever deny that the death camps occurred. I thought that seemed ridiculous. How could anybody deny the Holocaust? There aren't all that many survivors, but there are enough, and the evidence is there, and it clearly happened. But just as Hitler showed, if any lie is told often enough, people begin to believe it, especially if it is even printed. Here is something that was in print yesterday from a man named Martin Greenfield from foxnews.com, and these are Martin Greenfield's words. Mr. Greenfield said: Seventy years ago, I was in a Nazi concentration camp. Since then, I have seen tyrants and dictators enter and exit the global stage; yet as the world prepares to mark the 70th anniversary of the Auschwitz liberation, it is perhaps well and right that we reflect on how the Holocaust shocked the moral imagination on a scale the world could scarcely fathom. Why ponder such things? Because for far too many, the Holocaust remains a mystery. A major poll taken last year of 53,000 people found that just 54 percent had ever heard of the Holocaust. Knowledge of Auschwitz is likely even more limited, particularly among young people. Past surveys have shown that nearly half of Britons had never heard of Auschwitz. Some schoolchildren even thought Auschwitz was a type of beer. Here at home in America, a debate erupted last year when a teenager posted a smiling selfie at Auschwitz. Whatever your opinion on the appropriateness of her actions, I was at least pleased to be reminded that some young Americans still visit the Nazi concentration camp to learn history up close. I, too, visited Auschwitz as a teenager. In 1944, my family and I stood in line before Dr. Josef Mengele--the Nazi physician known as the ``Angel of Death''--as my mother, grandparents, two sisters, and baby brother were [[Page H656]] all sent to the left to be burned in Hitler's ovens. My father and I were sent to the right. The first night inside Auschwitz, my father said we must separate because, together, we would suffer double. He quoted his father, ``On your own, you will survive,'' his father told him. ``You are young and strong, and I know you will survive. If you survive by yourself, you must honor us by living, by not feeling sorry for us. This is what you must do.'' That was the last time I ever saw my father. I am grateful for my father's words of grace and guidance. They echo in my heart even still. It is a cruel thing, feeling guilty for surviving, but my father erased any future guilt and replaced it with purpose. It was a gift only a father's wisdom could give. It gave me a reason to go forward, a reason to be. It does still. Part of heeding my father's words involved replacing the horrors of my Holocaust past with a life spent creating beauty in the form of hand-tailored suits for U.S. Presidents, Hollywood films, and the world's most influential men. In fact, my first sewing lesson took place in the Auschwitz concentration camp laundry when I accidentally ripped the collar of a Nazi soldier's shirt. A guard beat me before a kind, older inmate taught me how to sew a simple stitch to repair the torn shirt. It was hardly the ideal tailoring apprenticeship, but it was my first lesson in the skill that became my livelihood. But at 86, another part of honoring my father's wishes requires being a voice for the voiceless. Indeed, as parents, educators, and citizens, we must all do our part to help ensure that ``Never Forget'' remains much more than a threadbare catchphrase that gathers dust and loses meaning with each passing year. For example, many people are surprised to learn that Auschwitz was actually a complex comprised of three main camps and dozens of satellites. The United States Holocaust Memorial Museum's statistics estimate that between 1940 and 1945, at least 1.1 million Jews and 200,000 of Hitler's undesirables were sent to the Auschwitz complex. Of those, 1.1 million were murdered. As I have noted elsewhere, that number would have been far greater were it not for the courage of the American soldiers, sailors, airmen, and marines who traveled around the world to defeat a moral darkness that consumed at least 6 million Jewish souls. That is a lesson worthy of remembrance. The 70th anniversary of the liberation marks that moment when freedom conquered barbarism through sureness of virtue and strength of will. Sadly, as recent events reveal, that remains a lesson humanity must learn and relearn from generation to generation. The word ``Holocaust'' means sacrifice by fire. May the memory of the millions who were engulfed in the flames like my family never be forgotten. That is Martin Greenfield, 70 years after being liberated from Auschwitz death camp. There is another article from CBC News. Aleksandra Sagan includes this regarding Mordechai Ronen, 82, born with the family name Markovits. He would be making a second visit to Auschwitz for the commemoration ceremonies. At nearly 12, Ronen saw Auschwitz for the first time as a prisoner after soldiers forced all the Jews in his Hungarian town into a ghetto and, 2 weeks later, shipped them in cattle cars to the camp. Dr. Josef Mengele, the Nazis' Angel of Death, sent Ronen's mother and two sisters to the gas chambers on arrival. Young Ronen made a lifesaving decision when he held on to his father's hand and joined the line of men. He spent about 2 weeks at Auschwitz, where he witnessed soldiers using an infant for target practice and slept on piles of corpses to avoid selection for the gas chamber. He and his father were moved to a nearby labor camp where the brutality continued. One day, his father told Ronen he could no longer get up to work for the cement brigade. Ronen last saw his father as soldiers took him away. It is the only day he remembers crying and the day he decided to survive. Ronen was liberated from a third camp, Gunskirchen, and remembers walking to a nearby town, knocking on a resident's door and asking if he could take a shower. Ronen, who prefers to be called a ``victorer'' rather than a survivor, first returned to Auschwitz in 1999, when he guided then-Prime Minister Jean Chretien around the grounds. It is important to Ronen to show the world he is alive and to share the history of the Holocaust. ``Maybe the world will realize what we went through, and it will be the end, and we are going to have peace and quiet in the world,'' he explains. Unfortunately, it is not the end of horrors. Tragically, Christians now are being killed, persecuted, and tortured in greater numbers than ever in the history of the world. {time} 1130 Anti-Semitism, hatred against Jews, is growing like I couldn't have imagined. In college, when I studied in history, I couldn't have imagined the kind of anti-Jewish hatred, the kind of anti-Semitism that would be growing as it has, and the United States of America would be doing precious little about it instead of standing up for the Jewish people and calling out anti-Semitism where it exists and where it grows and proliferates, as it does in the United Nations, for example, as it has in Europe, as it has in England, as it has right here in America. It is unconscionable that at a time in world history when the United States is said to be the true superpower of the world--even as that power has been seen as diminishing by people around the world, as polling indicates around the world, but still to be seen as the great superpower--as anti-Jewish hatred grows and we do precious little about it, and even at times stoke those flames, even in our universities, who are so proud of accepting massive amounts of money from people who are part of organizations that hate Jews and fund such courses or seminars on things like Islamophobia, not a liberated mental process of recognizing anti-Semitism, recognizing Jewish hatred--no, stoking those flames against the Jewish people. It is unbelievable that it is happening here in America as well. And it is even more unbelievable that it is happening among what some would refer to as the intelligentsia, those who are supposed to be more enlightened than the rest of a nation, who see things as they truly are. And yet, in America, some of those supposed enlightened intelligentsia are growing to be some of the most anti-Semitic people in the country. How did all this happen? Money for one thing, political power for another. But it has to stop. Money and initially power in Nazi Germany stoked the flames of anti-Jewish hatred. But there is anti-Christian hatred growing as well. Radical Islam has proliferated around the world. Violent radical Islam has grown. They aren't junior varsities. These are literal cutthroats who have to be stopped. It is not enough for the United States administration to beg radical Islamists, Jew- and Christian-hating leaders to sit at the table or offer to let their murderers go free if they will just sit down and visit with us, reminiscent of what Jimmy Carter wanted to do after an act of war was committed against our Embassy, and in the 36 years that have followed, what appeared to radical Islamists as a weak, paper tiger, toothless America did nothing but beg to sit down and talk and try to encourage Iran to let our prisoners go. It was not until Ronald Reagan took office they were released. They never wanted to fight the United States superpower. That has been changed over the years. Since '79, when they committed an act of war, attacked our Embassy, around the world people have been shown: Oh, you can do that against the United States and get away with it. The good thing is they may end up leaving your country and then they may offer to give you money. They may offer to release murderers from prison so they can come back and help kill more Americans. You know, they are not very smart over there in the United States. That has been going on since 1979. It is tragic when we encourage radical Islamist holocausts, which is what they would like to do, they said they were going to do, by letting the murderers go. How could this administration for months now think that Yemen was a great example of moderate Islam working out? I have known since a constituent months ago was in jeopardy, and we were able to get special ops people to help get them out. According to them, the Embassy was attacked many months ago. Back at the time Embassy personnel officially said: ``No, it was a nearby attack, but it wasn't us.'' When the Iranian-backed Houthis, the radical Islamists in Yemen, were taking over the capital and taking over the country--and instead of standing up firmly against them and protecting our American interests we were releasing murderers, radical Islamic murderers--we were talking about how wonderful things were in Yemen. That is exactly how the kind of anti-Jewish, anti-Christian sentiment could grow to the point of having a holocaust. [[Page H657]] It is literally breathtaking for an administration not to understand that while it is trying to placate radical Islamic leaders in Iran and telling them: ``We just want to talk. As long as you will keep talking to us, we will keep Israel from protecting themselves to their own detriment. Just keep talking to us and you keep those centrifuges spinning, that is fine with us.'' Now we know, we have been informed, that the administration has taken complete dismantlement of the centrifuges and their equipment to help them create nuclear weapons off the table. It is not even something they are demanding anymore. In other words, the word is out that this administration is apparently okay with Iran getting nukes but just would prefer that it wait until after this President leaves office. It doesn't matter when a President leaves office. If an administration gives bloodthirsty zealots the ability to create a holocaust, history does not forgive them simply because they had already left office when the holocaust actually started. Nigeria doesn't need us to send troops to stop the radical Islamists there, but they need help. Boko Haram continues to kill, rape, torture. There it is about going after Christians. The small-scale holocausts that Boko Haram is creating don't get so much as a whimper these days from this administration. They may say a few words, but they are hollow and they do not affect Boko Haram as they continue to be emboldened. Just like when the IRS was caught redhanded being weaponized and used as a Democratic political tool, which appears to have violated criminal law--yes, we have had hearings, but we haven't held them accountable. And, therefore, it seems to have encouraged even more impropriety by people within the IRS. When people get caught in impropriety and don't pay a cost, then you see what we are seeing in Nigeria, you see what we are seeing in Afghanistan, in Pakistan, in Syria, in Iran, in Iraq, and in Libya. Oh, I know the President, his administration, bragged about the Arab Spring and about taking out Qadhafi, who had become an ally after he gave up any efforts for nuclear weapons, completely opened his defenses to the United States. This administration and the prior administration had agreements with Qadhafi. But this administration never lets agreements get in the way of helping radical Islamists. Because this administration did help radical Islam turn Libya into a smoking country where people die, where our own people were not protected, because of the fantasy of those who thought that somehow the name, the United States, would be adequate to keep Chris Stevens and the other Americans safe in Benghazi. We didn't need to give them added security like they asked for, we didn't even need to respond when Chris Stevens called and said they were under attack--never said anything about a video because it was not. But that smokescreen worked. The President got reelected. He didn't have to account for that before the election, still hasn't had to account for where he was and why help was not forthcoming. I mean, even after 20 hours this administration that had planes--we know for sure within 3\1/2\ hours--after 20 hours they get a private plane there, that is it. David Ubben, with most of his leg, right leg, blown off, no painkillers, no morphine, they don't have a C-130 that they land to take him up in on a gurney. They get a private plane from somebody who wasn't even American, and they have to knock David up against the door, turning the gurney every which way trying to get him in, without painkillers, causing more pain, more suffering, because this administration, apparently they were thinking that if they sent more help than just a private plane like that, a military plane, if that were sent, it might look like Libya were not the wonderful country that this administration helped create by bombing Qadhafi out of existence. And, yes, it was not, it is true, it was not a U.S. bomb that took Qadhafi out. But our bombs put him on the run, our bombs stopped his caravan. Our President wouldn't respond for 3 days after Qadhafi offered to leave in exile and avoid any bloodshed before it all started. This administration didn't respond. Obviously, they were okay with having bloodshed and Qadhafi being wiped out. So they got what they were hoping for, obviously. {time} 1145 But what do we have now? We have a country in Libya that is in absolute turmoil. By the way, because Libya is in turmoil due to this administration, they are helping turn Egypt into as much turmoil as they can. Thank God for President el-Sisi. In having met with him on more than one occasion, I was impressed by the man. Before he was President, he asked that we bring back a message to this administration since this administration-- this President--froze the helicopters that were being sent, the Apaches. The question was: Does this administration--does this President--not understand that we use the Apache helicopters to keep the Suez Canal open? Although there were some that bought Morsi's lies that he was deweaponizing the Sinai--supposedly to diminish the threat to Israel from the Sinai--and after Morsi was removed for his unconstitutional actions, not in a coup but in an uprising, which was a peaceful revolution by reportedly over 30 million of their 90 million people, they found that the Sinai had been dramatically weaponized and had been contributing weapons equipment to Gaza to help threaten and cause terror to Israel. Once again, whether it is the Sinai, Gaza, northern Israel that was given to Lebanon, it seems going back to the very inception of Israel-- back when Israel was first brought, according to the Bible, into the Promised Land--we know of Canaan. The Canaanites no longer exist, so other people claim it who are not Canaanites. Actually, the Israelis had claim to it after the Canaanites. Others who occupied the land back over 3,000 years ago don't exist. This land, according to the Bible, was given to the children of Israel. It seems to be true that there has never been a time when Israel gave away land when trying to buy peace that that land that they gave away was not used as a staging area from which to attack it. Gaza, what a noble thing to do by the Israelis. They took an area that was prosperous, self-sustaining, with greenhouses growing vegetables that would feed the people who lived there. An amazing place was the Gaza Strip. Then some noble Israeli leaders thought, Do you know what? It is not required. We are getting absolutely nothing in return, but we are going to do the unilateral act that will be so noble, that will be so full of grace that the world, even those who don't like us, will go, Wow. Those Israelis, they are okay. They are nice folks. Look, they didn't get anything in return; yet they still gave away the Gaza Strip. What a wonderful group of people. I mean, that just doesn't happen. The United States never gave back its land to England or to Spain or to France or to other countries that initially had claims here. Other countries don't do that, but Israel did. They gave away the Gaza Strip. Previous to that, they had given away what northern Israel now calls southern Lebanon. Southern Lebanon, people will recall, has been the site of attacks on Israelis--war. So how was this grace, this beneficence of Israel's giving the Gaza Strip to the Palestinians, rewarded? It has been rewarded by their giving back to Israel thousands upon thousands upon thousands of rockets. Some kill. All terrorize. All cost money to Israel. The most important problem they have created is the threat to life, the threat to their existence; and we still have people in this country who say, Well, if you just keep giving away land, eventually, they will be satisfied, when the very materials that are being promoted by the people this administration supports among the Islamists--they made very clear the reason we name holidays, streets, areas, parks after suicide bombers who kill innocent children, women, men is that we, ultimately, are going to destroy Israel and wipe it off the map. We hate Jews that much; and this administration thinks, somehow, they will bring radical Islam around to really being this group of peace. Now, there is a document that was an exhibit in the United States v. the Holy Land Foundation in which there were many individuals and groups named as coconspirators. They were [[Page H658]] not indicted, but they were named as coconspirators. It includes the Council on American-Islamic Relations, CAIR, which has a nice office building just up the street here, and the Islamic Society of North America, ISNA, the leader of which is Imam Magid, who goes to the White House, who goes to the State Department, who advises the President and let's him know when somebody is criticizing Islam, so the administration steps in and goes after him. In this exhibit from the Holy Land Foundation trial--it was the biggest funding of terrorism case ever in U.S. history, and people who were involved originally had indicated the goal was to convict these first five, to name all of these coconspirators, and if we get convictions of those first five, like we think we should, then we proceed and go after the remainder. They were convicted in late 2008. President Obama took office a month or two later, and this administration would under no circumstances go after these people who had been alleged in the documents of funding radical Islamic terrorism even after the U.S. District Court in Dallas and the U.S. Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals in New Orleans confirmed that there was plenty of evidence to support that someone like ISNA or CAIR was a legitimate coconspirator named in the indictment and that their names would not be removed. I have asked for years now of the Justice Department to make available the documents that were provided to the convicted terrorists--those funding terrorism or terrorists--and this administration now, for years, has drug their feet and has refused to provide all of the documents that were provided to the terrorists. On one occasion, the Attorney General basically said there are issues here of privilege, and my point was--and is--you gave them to the terrorists; surely, you can give them to Members of Congress. But the answer is, no, they can't. They are going to keep obfuscating. They don't want us to see all of the documents that they had in their possession that they gave to the terrorists. I have a feeling, if we saw all of the documents, it would be very, very clear in the purging that this administration has done of our training materials of the FBI's, of the intelligence agency's, of the State Department's, and the Justice Department's that, if there is anything that might bother a radical Islamist who wants to kill us, then it has to be removed. They removed it. In the document from a 1991 meeting, in what is called an ``Explanatory Memorandum,'' it spells out their goals. It was written in 1991 by a member of the board of directors of the Muslim Brotherhood in North America and by a senior Hamas leader named Mohamed Akram. It had been approved by the Muslim Brotherhood's Shura Council and Organizational Conference, and it was meant for internal review by the Muslim Brotherhood leadership in Egypt. It was not intended for public consumption. These are the words from the introduction that is part of this document from the Center for Security Policy. Mr. Speaker, I want to quote from the document, itself, prepared by the Muslim Brotherhood in 1991, setting their goals for America: One: The Memorandum is Derived from: One, the general strategic goal of the group in America, which was approved by the Shura Council and the Organizational Conference for the year 1987, is: ``Enablement of Islam in North America, meaning: establishing an effective and stable Islamic movement led by the Muslim Brotherhood which adopts Muslims' causes domestically and globally and which works to expand the observant Muslim base; aims at unifying and directing Muslims' efforts; presents Islam as a civilization alternative; and supports the global Islamic state--if that name sounds familiar--wherever it is.'' Two, the priority that is approved by the Shura Council for the work of the group in its current and former session, which is ``settlement.'' Skipping down to ``Two: An Introduction to the Explanatory Memorandum,'' it says: The question we are facing is: ``How do you like to see the Islam movement in North America in 10 years?'' or ``taking along'' the following sentence when planning and working ``Islamic Work in North America in the year 2000: A strategic vision.'' It goes on: Also, we must summon and take along elements of the general strategic goal of the group in North America. For those large numbers of people in college who may not realize, North America is where we live. The document says: I will intentionally repeat them in numbers. They are: One, establishing an effective and stable Islamic movement led by the Muslim Brotherhood. Two, adopting Muslims' causes domestically and globally. Three, expanding the observant Muslim base. Four, unifying and directing Muslim efforts. Five, presenting Islam as a civilization alternative. Six, supporting the establishment of the global Islamic state, wherever it is. {time} 1200 The document says: It must be stressed that it has become clear and emphatically known that all is in agreement that we must ``settle'' or ``enable'' Islam and its movement in this part of the world. Three: The Concept of Settlement: The term was mentioned in the group's ``dictionary'' and documents with various meanings in spite of the fact that everyone meant one thing with it. We believe that the understanding of the essence is the same, and we will attempt here to give the word and its ``meanings'' a practical explanation with a practical movement tone and not a philosophical linguistic explanation, while stressing that this explanation of ours is not complete until our explanation of ``the process'' of settlement itself is understood which is mentioned in the following paragraph. We briefly say the following: Settlement: ``That Islam and its movement become a part of the homeland it lives in.'' Establishment: ``That Islam turns into firmly rooted organizations on whose bases civilization, structure, and testimony are built.'' Further down, it goes on, ``That Islam is stable in the land.'' Rooting: ``That Islam is resident and not a passing thing or rooted `entrenched' in the soil of the spot where it moves and not a strange plant to it.'' Four: The Process of Settlement: In order for Islam and its movement to become ``a part of the homeland'' in which it lives-- Talking about North America. --``stable'' in its land, ``rooted'' in the spirits and minds of its people, ``enabled'' in the life of its society and has firmly established ``organizations'' on which the Islamic structure is built and with which the testimony of civilization is achieved, the movement must plan and struggle to obtain ``the keys'' and the tools of this process in carrying out this grand mission as a ``civilization jihadist'' responsibility which lies on the shoulders of Muslims and--on top of them--the Muslim Brotherhood in this country. Talking about here in the United States, North America. ``Among these keys and tools are the following.'' It goes on to talk about the settlement concept and the fundamental shift toward settlement of this country. Number four: Understanding the Role of the Muslim Brother in North America: The process of settlement is a ``civilization jihadist process,'' with all the word means. Anyway, it goes on. Another place here, it says: There is a conviction--with which this memorandum disagrees--that our focus in attempting to settle Islam in this country will lead to negligence in our duty towards the global Islamic movement in supporting its project to establish the state. We believe that the reply is in two segments. One, the success of the movement in America-- Talking about the United States of America. One, the success of the movement in America in establishing an observant Islamic base with power and effectiveness will be the best support and aid to the global movement project. And the second is the global movement has not succeeded yet in ``distributing roles'' to its branches, stating what is the needed from them as one of the participants or contributors to the project to establish the global Islamic state. The day this happens, the children of the American Ikhwani branch will have far-reaching impact and positions that make the ancestors proud. It is a great document goal for taking over the United States, which brings another story to the surface. It is from Bob Price from breitbart.com. ``Islamic Tribunal Confirmed in Texas; Attorney Claims 'It's Voluntary,''' and it talks about the new Islamic tribunal in Texas that has been confirmed now by Breitbart Texas. The tribunal is operating as a nonprofit organization in Dallas. Because when you understand the goals, if there is a major defeat or a major success, [[Page H659]] Muslim Brotherhood requires a mosque be built there and a presence there. Naturally, they would want one at Ground Zero in New York; further, they would want a mosque and a strong presence in Dallas which was, they believe, the place of their big defeat when the Holy Land Foundation principals were convicted and sent to prison. I did want to point out, as we finish up here today, that the President was giving an excellent speech in India about the importance of stopping the global war on women. He didn't call it that. He only calls it that for Republicans, but there is a war on women, and it is not by Republicans. It is radical Islam and even some moderate Islamists. He is giving this talk about the importance of recognizing the importance and the equality of women--or some of us might say they are more equal than we are--but as he was doing that, this picture was on Saudi television. We have our United States President depicted here, and this is the First Lady of the United States of America being blurred out by this country's allies because she wasn't covered. Michelle Obama should never need to be covered if she doesn't want to be; yet at the very time our President is talking about equality of women, he fails to notice that people that he considers allies are treating his own wife like this. Mr. Speaker, it is critical that we stand up against radical Islam or any Islam that wants a settlement civilization jihad in America. Anything and anybody who disagrees with the United States Constitution and wants to destroy it, tear it down, is an enemy to the United States and needs to be recognized as such and not welcomed with open arms at the State Department and the White House. With that, I yield back the balance of my time. ____________________","Congressional Record, Volume 161 Issue 14 (Wednesday, January 28, 2015) [Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 14 (Wednesday, January 28, 2015)] [House] [Pages H655-H659] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] COMBATING TERRORISM The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under the Speaker's announced policy of January 6, 2015, the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Gohmert) is recognized for 60 minutes as the designee of the majority leader. Mr. GOHMERT. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Clawson). No Nuclear Iran Mr. CLAWSON. Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. Gohmert for yielding to me. Already a grave and growing existential threat to Israel, a nuclear armed Iran would be a colossal, horrific game changer. It would launch a nuclear arms race in what is already the world's most dangerous neighborhood. We all know that this must not be allowed to happen. The Islamic Republic of Iran's nuclear ambitions are made more dire when considering that they are the world's most dangerous state supporter of Islamic extremist terrorism, with a destabilizing presence in Lebanon, in Syria, and in Iraq. And Iran's financial and military support for the Houthi rebels in Yemen has led to the collapse of the Hadi government. Thus, Iran today exerts major influence, not just in rebel territories, but in four Middle East capitals--Beirut, Baghdad, Damascus and Sana'a. The crisis in Yemen threatens to launch yet another civil war in the region, and this severely handcuffs U.S. counterterrorism operations against AQAP. Islamists in Iran and elsewhere repeatedly threaten to slaughter all standing in their way--with their ultimate targets being Israel and the United States--us, their great Satan. They must never be allowed nuclear weapons capabilities. Does anyone really doubt whether they would use these capabilities someday? Well, there must be some reason why Iran is developing ICBMs. Last week, Iran's Channel 2 broadcast satellite imagery showing recently constructed missile-related sites. Those sites included a launch pad capable of firing an ICBM, and on that launch pad was a never-seen-before missile measuring 27 meters in length. While we negotiate, the Iran story gets worse. We have been extending deadlines and softening sanctions on Iran, while they fail to meet their end of the bargain. {time} 1115 It is bizarre to me that we are debating with the Iranians the numbers of their centrifuges but leaving off the table their support for terrorism, their ICBMs, and their continued human rights violations. Is it the right thing to do to sit across the table, remain silent about the costs we and our allies have paid and are paying because of their financial and military support of our enemies? Does this make sense? Shouldn't we insist on adding to the agenda Iran's destabilizing actions in the region and also their ICBM program that puts us all at risk? Merely delaying some of the potential horror for a decade or so is not a good option in my view. A bad deal where we declare victory by kicking this can down the road is far worse than no deal at all. Iran now threatens to end nuclear talks if Congress increases sanctions against their regime. I say we must never yield to threats from Iran or any other nation. We must stand strong, continue sanctions, and even strengthen them until Iran gets the message. I believe that strengthening sanctions will get us a better deal. Leverage produces a better deal. We must remain unwavering in our support for Israel. We must listen carefully to the concerns of Prime Minister Netanyahu on this subject. I hope we unite with our Arab partners and do all that is possible to prevent Iran from going nuclear. We must lead the civilized world in this crucial mission. I think this is our destiny. We urge President Obama to join with Congress in this resolve. Mr. GOHMERT. Mr. Speaker, there is a great deal going on, and I think the first thing that needs to be addressed is the 70th anniversary of something that should never have happened in civilized society. This is the 70th anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz death camp. As a schoolboy growing up in east Texas, later attending Texas A&M, and especially in my time, my 4 years in the United States Army, as we discussed and looked at World War II, things that had occurred then--I was a history major and was with the Army for 4 years and majored in history. It was just always amazing. How could people who said they were civilized kill 6 million of any race, gender, national origin? How could that happen? But it did happen. On learning that Eisenhower required people from the surrounding villages to be brought in to help clean up concentration camps, death camps--as I understood the reason--was so no one could ever deny that the death camps occurred. I thought that seemed ridiculous. How could anybody deny the Holocaust? There aren't all that many survivors, but there are enough, and the evidence is there, and it clearly happened. But just as Hitler showed, if any lie is told often enough, people begin to believe it, especially if it is even printed. Here is something that was in print yesterday from a man named Martin Greenfield from foxnews.com, and these are Martin Greenfield's words. Mr. Greenfield said: Seventy years ago, I was in a Nazi concentration camp. Since then, I have seen tyrants and dictators enter and exit the global stage; yet as the world prepares to mark the 70th anniversary of the Auschwitz liberation, it is perhaps well and right that we reflect on how the Holocaust shocked the moral imagination on a scale the world could scarcely fathom. Why ponder such things? Because for far too many, the Holocaust remains a mystery. A major poll taken last year of 53,000 people found that just 54 percent had ever heard of the Holocaust. Knowledge of Auschwitz is likely even more limited, particularly among young people. Past surveys have shown that nearly half of Britons had never heard of Auschwitz. Some schoolchildren even thought Auschwitz was a type of beer. Here at home in America, a debate erupted last year when a teenager posted a smiling selfie at Auschwitz. Whatever your opinion on the appropriateness of her actions, I was at least pleased to be reminded that some young Americans still visit the Nazi concentration camp to learn history up close. I, too, visited Auschwitz as a teenager. In 1944, my family and I stood in line before Dr. Josef Mengele--the Nazi physician known as the ``Angel of Death''--as my mother, grandparents, two sisters, and baby brother were [[Page H656]] all sent to the left to be burned in Hitler's ovens. My father and I were sent to the right. The first night inside Auschwitz, my father said we must separate because, together, we would suffer double. He quoted his father, ``On your own, you will survive,'' his father told him. ``You are young and strong, and I know you will survive. If you survive by yourself, you must honor us by living, by not feeling sorry for us. This is what you must do.'' That was the last time I ever saw my father. I am grateful for my father's words of grace and guidance. They echo in my heart even still. It is a cruel thing, feeling guilty for surviving, but my father erased any future guilt and replaced it with purpose. It was a gift only a father's wisdom could give. It gave me a reason to go forward, a reason to be. It does still. Part of heeding my father's words involved replacing the horrors of my Holocaust past with a life spent creating beauty in the form of hand-tailored suits for U.S. Presidents, Hollywood films, and the world's most influential men. In fact, my first sewing lesson took place in the Auschwitz concentration camp laundry when I accidentally ripped the collar of a Nazi soldier's shirt. A guard beat me before a kind, older inmate taught me how to sew a simple stitch to repair the torn shirt. It was hardly the ideal tailoring apprenticeship, but it was my first lesson in the skill that became my livelihood. But at 86, another part of honoring my father's wishes requires being a voice for the voiceless. Indeed, as parents, educators, and citizens, we must all do our part to help ensure that ``Never Forget'' remains much more than a threadbare catchphrase that gathers dust and loses meaning with each passing year. For example, many people are surprised to learn that Auschwitz was actually a complex comprised of three main camps and dozens of satellites. The United States Holocaust Memorial Museum's statistics estimate that between 1940 and 1945, at least 1.1 million Jews and 200,000 of Hitler's undesirables were sent to the Auschwitz complex. Of those, 1.1 million were murdered. As I have noted elsewhere, that number would have been far greater were it not for the courage of the American soldiers, sailors, airmen, and marines who traveled around the world to defeat a moral darkness that consumed at least 6 million Jewish souls. That is a lesson worthy of remembrance. The 70th anniversary of the liberation marks that moment when freedom conquered barbarism through sureness of virtue and strength of will. Sadly, as recent events reveal, that remains a lesson humanity must learn and relearn from generation to generation. The word ``Holocaust'' means sacrifice by fire. May the memory of the millions who were engulfed in the flames like my family never be forgotten. That is Martin Greenfield, 70 years after being liberated from Auschwitz death camp. There is another article from CBC News. Aleksandra Sagan includes this regarding Mordechai Ronen, 82, born with the family name Markovits. He would be making a second visit to Auschwitz for the commemoration ceremonies. At nearly 12, Ronen saw Auschwitz for the first time as a prisoner after soldiers forced all the Jews in his Hungarian town into a ghetto and, 2 weeks later, shipped them in cattle cars to the camp. Dr. Josef Mengele, the Nazis' Angel of Death, sent Ronen's mother and two sisters to the gas chambers on arrival. Young Ronen made a lifesaving decision when he held on to his father's hand and joined the line of men. He spent about 2 weeks at Auschwitz, where he witnessed soldiers using an infant for target practice and slept on piles of corpses to avoid selection for the gas chamber. He and his father were moved to a nearby labor camp where the brutality continued. One day, his father told Ronen he could no longer get up to work for the cement brigade. Ronen last saw his father as soldiers took him away. It is the only day he remembers crying and the day he decided to survive. Ronen was liberated from a third camp, Gunskirchen, and remembers walking to a nearby town, knocking on a resident's door and asking if he could take a shower. Ronen, who prefers to be called a ``victorer'' rather than a survivor, first returned to Auschwitz in 1999, when he guided then-Prime Minister Jean Chretien around the grounds. It is important to Ronen to show the world he is alive and to share the history of the Holocaust. ``Maybe the world will realize what we went through, and it will be the end, and we are going to have peace and quiet in the world,'' he explains. Unfortunately, it is not the end of horrors. Tragically, Christians now are being killed, persecuted, and tortured in greater numbers than ever in the history of the world. {time} 1130 Anti-Semitism, hatred against Jews, is growing like I couldn't have imagined. In college, when I studied in history, I couldn't have imagined the kind of anti-Jewish hatred, the kind of anti-Semitism that would be growing as it has, and the United States of America would be doing precious little about it instead of standing up for the Jewish people and calling out anti-Semitism where it exists and where it grows and proliferates, as it does in the United Nations, for example, as it has in Europe, as it has in England, as it has right here in America. It is unconscionable that at a time in world history when the United States is said to be the true superpower of the world--even as that power has been seen as diminishing by people around the world, as polling indicates around the world, but still to be seen as the great superpower--as anti-Jewish hatred grows and we do precious little about it, and even at times stoke those flames, even in our universities, who are so proud of accepting massive amounts of money from people who are part of organizations that hate Jews and fund such courses or seminars on things like Islamophobia, not a liberated mental process of recognizing anti-Semitism, recognizing Jewish hatred--no, stoking those flames against the Jewish people. It is unbelievable that it is happening here in America as well. And it is even more unbelievable that it is happening among what some would refer to as the intelligentsia, those who are supposed to be more enlightened than the rest of a nation, who see things as they truly are. And yet, in America, some of those supposed enlightened intelligentsia are growing to be some of the most anti-Semitic people in the country. How did all this happen? Money for one thing, political power for another. But it has to stop. Money and initially power in Nazi Germany stoked the flames of anti-Jewish hatred. But there is anti-Christian hatred growing as well. Radical Islam has proliferated around the world. Violent radical Islam has grown. They aren't junior varsities. These are literal cutthroats who have to be stopped. It is not enough for the United States administration to beg radical Islamists, Jew- and Christian-hating leaders to sit at the table or offer to let their murderers go free if they will just sit down and visit with us, reminiscent of what Jimmy Carter wanted to do after an act of war was committed against our Embassy, and in the 36 years that have followed, what appeared to radical Islamists as a weak, paper tiger, toothless America did nothing but beg to sit down and talk and try to encourage Iran to let our prisoners go. It was not until Ronald Reagan took office they were released. They never wanted to fight the United States superpower. That has been changed over the years. Since '79, when they committed an act of war, attacked our Embassy, around the world people have been shown: Oh, you can do that against the United States and get away with it. The good thing is they may end up leaving your country and then they may offer to give you money. They may offer to release murderers from prison so they can come back and help kill more Americans. You know, they are not very smart over there in the United States. That has been going on since 1979. It is tragic when we encourage radical Islamist holocausts, which is what they would like to do, they said they were going to do, by letting the murderers go. How could this administration for months now think that Yemen was a great example of moderate Islam working out? I have known since a constituent months ago was in jeopardy, and we were able to get special ops people to help get them out. According to them, the Embassy was attacked many months ago. Back at the time Embassy personnel officially said: ``No, it was a nearby attack, but it wasn't us.'' When the Iranian-backed Houthis, the radical Islamists in Yemen, were taking over the capital and taking over the country--and instead of standing up firmly against them and protecting our American interests we were releasing murderers, radical Islamic murderers--we were talking about how wonderful things were in Yemen. That is exactly how the kind of anti-Jewish, anti-Christian sentiment could grow to the point of having a holocaust. [[Page H657]] It is literally breathtaking for an administration not to understand that while it is trying to placate radical Islamic leaders in Iran and telling them: ``We just want to talk. As long as you will keep talking to us, we will keep Israel from protecting themselves to their own detriment. Just keep talking to us and you keep those centrifuges spinning, that is fine with us.'' Now we know, we have been informed, that the administration has taken complete dismantlement of the centrifuges and their equipment to help them create nuclear weapons off the table. It is not even something they are demanding anymore. In other words, the word is out that this administration is apparently okay with Iran getting nukes but just would prefer that it wait until after this President leaves office. It doesn't matter when a President leaves office. If an administration gives bloodthirsty zealots the ability to create a holocaust, history does not forgive them simply because they had already left office when the holocaust actually started. Nigeria doesn't need us to send troops to stop the radical Islamists there, but they need help. Boko Haram continues to kill, rape, torture. There it is about going after Christians. The small-scale holocausts that Boko Haram is creating don't get so much as a whimper these days from this administration. They may say a few words, but they are hollow and they do not affect Boko Haram as they continue to be emboldened. Just like when the IRS was caught redhanded being weaponized and used as a Democratic political tool, which appears to have violated criminal law--yes, we have had hearings, but we haven't held them accountable. And, therefore, it seems to have encouraged even more impropriety by people within the IRS. When people get caught in impropriety and don't pay a cost, then you see what we are seeing in Nigeria, you see what we are seeing in Afghanistan, in Pakistan, in Syria, in Iran, in Iraq, and in Libya. Oh, I know the President, his administration, bragged about the Arab Spring and about taking out Qadhafi, who had become an ally after he gave up any efforts for nuclear weapons, completely opened his defenses to the United States. This administration and the prior administration had agreements with Qadhafi. But this administration never lets agreements get in the way of helping radical Islamists. Because this administration did help radical Islam turn Libya into a smoking country where people die, where our own people were not protected, because of the fantasy of those who thought that somehow the name, the United States, would be adequate to keep Chris Stevens and the other Americans safe in Benghazi. We didn't need to give them added security like they asked for, we didn't even need to respond when Chris Stevens called and said they were under attack--never said anything about a video because it was not. But that smokescreen worked. The President got reelected. He didn't have to account for that before the election, still hasn't had to account for where he was and why help was not forthcoming. I mean, even after 20 hours this administration that had planes--we know for sure within 3\1/2\ hours--after 20 hours they get a private plane there, that is it. David Ubben, with most of his leg, right leg, blown off, no painkillers, no morphine, they don't have a C-130 that they land to take him up in on a gurney. They get a private plane from somebody who wasn't even American, and they have to knock David up against the door, turning the gurney every which way trying to get him in, without painkillers, causing more pain, more suffering, because this administration, apparently they were thinking that if they sent more help than just a private plane like that, a military plane, if that were sent, it might look like Libya were not the wonderful country that this administration helped create by bombing Qadhafi out of existence. And, yes, it was not, it is true, it was not a U.S. bomb that took Qadhafi out. But our bombs put him on the run, our bombs stopped his caravan. Our President wouldn't respond for 3 days after Qadhafi offered to leave in exile and avoid any bloodshed before it all started. This administration didn't respond. Obviously, they were okay with having bloodshed and Qadhafi being wiped out. So they got what they were hoping for, obviously. {time} 1145 But what do we have now? We have a country in Libya that is in absolute turmoil. By the way, because Libya is in turmoil due to this administration, they are helping turn Egypt into as much turmoil as they can. Thank God for President el-Sisi. In having met with him on more than one occasion, I was impressed by the man. Before he was President, he asked that we bring back a message to this administration since this administration-- this President--froze the helicopters that were being sent, the Apaches. The question was: Does this administration--does this President--not understand that we use the Apache helicopters to keep the Suez Canal open? Although there were some that bought Morsi's lies that he was deweaponizing the Sinai--supposedly to diminish the threat to Israel from the Sinai--and after Morsi was removed for his unconstitutional actions, not in a coup but in an uprising, which was a peaceful revolution by reportedly over 30 million of their 90 million people, they found that the Sinai had been dramatically weaponized and had been contributing weapons equipment to Gaza to help threaten and cause terror to Israel. Once again, whether it is the Sinai, Gaza, northern Israel that was given to Lebanon, it seems going back to the very inception of Israel-- back when Israel was first brought, according to the Bible, into the Promised Land--we know of Canaan. The Canaanites no longer exist, so other people claim it who are not Canaanites. Actually, the Israelis had claim to it after the Canaanites. Others who occupied the land back over 3,000 years ago don't exist. This land, according to the Bible, was given to the children of Israel. It seems to be true that there has never been a time when Israel gave away land when trying to buy peace that that land that they gave away was not used as a staging area from which to attack it. Gaza, what a noble thing to do by the Israelis. They took an area that was prosperous, self-sustaining, with greenhouses growing vegetables that would feed the people who lived there. An amazing place was the Gaza Strip. Then some noble Israeli leaders thought, Do you know what? It is not required. We are getting absolutely nothing in return, but we are going to do the unilateral act that will be so noble, that will be so full of grace that the world, even those who don't like us, will go, Wow. Those Israelis, they are okay. They are nice folks. Look, they didn't get anything in return; yet they still gave away the Gaza Strip. What a wonderful group of people. I mean, that just doesn't happen. The United States never gave back its land to England or to Spain or to France or to other countries that initially had claims here. Other countries don't do that, but Israel did. They gave away the Gaza Strip. Previous to that, they had given away what northern Israel now calls southern Lebanon. Southern Lebanon, people will recall, has been the site of attacks on Israelis--war. So how was this grace, this beneficence of Israel's giving the Gaza Strip to the Palestinians, rewarded? It has been rewarded by their giving back to Israel thousands upon thousands upon thousands of rockets. Some kill. All terrorize. All cost money to Israel. The most important problem they have created is the threat to life, the threat to their existence; and we still have people in this country who say, Well, if you just keep giving away land, eventually, they will be satisfied, when the very materials that are being promoted by the people this administration supports among the Islamists--they made very clear the reason we name holidays, streets, areas, parks after suicide bombers who kill innocent children, women, men is that we, ultimately, are going to destroy Israel and wipe it off the map. We hate Jews that much; and this administration thinks, somehow, they will bring radical Islam around to really being this group of peace. Now, there is a document that was an exhibit in the United States v. the Holy Land Foundation in which there were many individuals and groups named as coconspirators. They were [[Page H658]] not indicted, but they were named as coconspirators. It includes the Council on American-Islamic Relations, CAIR, which has a nice office building just up the street here, and the Islamic Society of North America, ISNA, the leader of which is Imam Magid, who goes to the White House, who goes to the State Department, who advises the President and let's him know when somebody is criticizing Islam, so the administration steps in and goes after him. In this exhibit from the Holy Land Foundation trial--it was the biggest funding of terrorism case ever in U.S. history, and people who were involved originally had indicated the goal was to convict these first five, to name all of these coconspirators, and if we get convictions of those first five, like we think we should, then we proceed and go after the remainder. They were convicted in late 2008. President Obama took office a month or two later, and this administration would under no circumstances go after these people who had been alleged in the documents of funding radical Islamic terrorism even after the U.S. District Court in Dallas and the U.S. Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals in New Orleans confirmed that there was plenty of evidence to support that someone like ISNA or CAIR was a legitimate coconspirator named in the indictment and that their names would not be removed. I have asked for years now of the Justice Department to make available the documents that were provided to the convicted terrorists--those funding terrorism or terrorists--and this administration now, for years, has drug their feet and has refused to provide all of the documents that were provided to the terrorists. On one occasion, the Attorney General basically said there are issues here of privilege, and my point was--and is--you gave them to the terrorists; surely, you can give them to Members of Congress. But the answer is, no, they can't. They are going to keep obfuscating. They don't want us to see all of the documents that they had in their possession that they gave to the terrorists. I have a feeling, if we saw all of the documents, it would be very, very clear in the purging that this administration has done of our training materials of the FBI's, of the intelligence agency's, of the State Department's, and the Justice Department's that, if there is anything that might bother a radical Islamist who wants to kill us, then it has to be removed. They removed it. In the document from a 1991 meeting, in what is called an ``Explanatory Memorandum,'' it spells out their goals. It was written in 1991 by a member of the board of directors of the Muslim Brotherhood in North America and by a senior Hamas leader named Mohamed Akram. It had been approved by the Muslim Brotherhood's Shura Council and Organizational Conference, and it was meant for internal review by the Muslim Brotherhood leadership in Egypt. It was not intended for public consumption. These are the words from the introduction that is part of this document from the Center for Security Policy. Mr. Speaker, I want to quote from the document, itself, prepared by the Muslim Brotherhood in 1991, setting their goals for America: One: The Memorandum is Derived from: One, the general strategic goal of the group in America, which was approved by the Shura Council and the Organizational Conference for the year 1987, is: ``Enablement of Islam in North America, meaning: establishing an effective and stable Islamic movement led by the Muslim Brotherhood which adopts Muslims' causes domestically and globally and which works to expand the observant Muslim base; aims at unifying and directing Muslims' efforts; presents Islam as a civilization alternative; and supports the global Islamic state--if that name sounds familiar--wherever it is.'' Two, the priority that is approved by the Shura Council for the work of the group in its current and former session, which is ``settlement.'' Skipping down to ``Two: An Introduction to the Explanatory Memorandum,'' it says: The question we are facing is: ``How do you like to see the Islam movement in North America in 10 years?'' or ``taking along'' the following sentence when planning and working ``Islamic Work in North America in the year 2000: A strategic vision.'' It goes on: Also, we must summon and take along elements of the general strategic goal of the group in North America. For those large numbers of people in college who may not realize, North America is where we live. The document says: I will intentionally repeat them in numbers. They are: One, establishing an effective and stable Islamic movement led by the Muslim Brotherhood. Two, adopting Muslims' causes domestically and globally. Three, expanding the observant Muslim base. Four, unifying and directing Muslim efforts. Five, presenting Islam as a civilization alternative. Six, supporting the establishment of the global Islamic state, wherever it is. {time} 1200 The document says: It must be stressed that it has become clear and emphatically known that all is in agreement that we must ``settle'' or ``enable'' Islam and its movement in this part of the world. Three: The Concept of Settlement: The term was mentioned in the group's ``dictionary'' and documents with various meanings in spite of the fact that everyone meant one thing with it. We believe that the understanding of the essence is the same, and we will attempt here to give the word and its ``meanings'' a practical explanation with a practical movement tone and not a philosophical linguistic explanation, while stressing that this explanation of ours is not complete until our explanation of ``the process'' of settlement itself is understood which is mentioned in the following paragraph. We briefly say the following: Settlement: ``That Islam and its movement become a part of the homeland it lives in.'' Establishment: ``That Islam turns into firmly rooted organizations on whose bases civilization, structure, and testimony are built.'' Further down, it goes on, ``That Islam is stable in the land.'' Rooting: ``That Islam is resident and not a passing thing or rooted `entrenched' in the soil of the spot where it moves and not a strange plant to it.'' Four: The Process of Settlement: In order for Islam and its movement to become ``a part of the homeland'' in which it lives-- Talking about North America. --``stable'' in its land, ``rooted'' in the spirits and minds of its people, ``enabled'' in the life of its society and has firmly established ``organizations'' on which the Islamic structure is built and with which the testimony of civilization is achieved, the movement must plan and struggle to obtain ``the keys'' and the tools of this process in carrying out this grand mission as a ``civilization jihadist'' responsibility which lies on the shoulders of Muslims and--on top of them--the Muslim Brotherhood in this country. Talking about here in the United States, North America. ``Among these keys and tools are the following.'' It goes on to talk about the settlement concept and the fundamental shift toward settlement of this country. Number four: Understanding the Role of the Muslim Brother in North America: The process of settlement is a ``civilization jihadist process,'' with all the word means. Anyway, it goes on. Another place here, it says: There is a conviction--with which this memorandum disagrees--that our focus in attempting to settle Islam in this country will lead to negligence in our duty towards the global Islamic movement in supporting its project to establish the state. We believe that the reply is in two segments. One, the success of the movement in America-- Talking about the United States of America. One, the success of the movement in America in establishing an observant Islamic base with power and effectiveness will be the best support and aid to the global movement project. And the second is the global movement has not succeeded yet in ``distributing roles'' to its branches, stating what is the needed from them as one of the participants or contributors to the project to establish the global Islamic state. The day this happens, the children of the American Ikhwani branch will have far-reaching impact and positions that make the ancestors proud. It is a great document goal for taking over the United States, which brings another story to the surface. It is from Bob Price from breitbart.com. ``Islamic Tribunal Confirmed in Texas; Attorney Claims 'It's Voluntary,''' and it talks about the new Islamic tribunal in Texas that has been confirmed now by Breitbart Texas. The tribunal is operating as a nonprofit organization in Dallas. Because when you understand the goals, if there is a major defeat or a major success, [[Page H659]] Muslim Brotherhood requires a mosque be built there and a presence there. Naturally, they would want one at Ground Zero in New York; further, they would want a mosque and a strong presence in Dallas which was, they believe, the place of their big defeat when the Holy Land Foundation principals were convicted and sent to prison. I did want to point out, as we finish up here today, that the President was giving an excellent speech in India about the importance of stopping the global war on women. He didn't call it that. He only calls it that for Republicans, but there is a war on women, and it is not by Republicans. It is radical Islam and even some moderate Islamists. He is giving this talk about the importance of recognizing the importance and the equality of women--or some of us might say they are more equal than we are--but as he was doing that, this picture was on Saudi television. We have our United States President depicted here, and this is the First Lady of the United States of America being blurred out by this country's allies because she wasn't covered. Michelle Obama should never need to be covered if she doesn't want to be; yet at the very time our President is talking about equality of women, he fails to notice that people that he considers allies are treating his own wife like this. Mr. Speaker, it is critical that we stand up against radical Islam or any Islam that wants a settlement civilization jihad in America. Anything and anybody who disagrees with the United States Constitution and wants to destroy it, tear it down, is an enemy to the United States and needs to be recognized as such and not welcomed with open arms at the State Department and the White House. With that, I yield back the balance of my time. ____________________",package_114_121.csv,34543,34543,34615,"[congressional record volume 161, number 14 (wednesday, january 28, 2015)] [house] [pages h655-h659] from the congressional record online through the government publishing office [ www.gpo.gov ] combating terrorism the speaker pro tempore. under the speaker's announced policy of january 6, 2015, the gentleman from texas (mr. gohmert) is recognized for 60 minutes as the designee of the majority leader. mr. gohmert. mr. speaker, i yield to the gentleman from florida (mr. clawson). no nuclear iran mr. clawson. mr. speaker, i thank mr. gohmert for yielding to me. already a grave and growing existential threat to israel, a nuclear armed iran would be a colossal, horrific game changer. it would launch a nuclear arms race in what is already the world's most dangerous neighborhood. we all know that this must not be allowed to happen. the islamic republic of iran's nuclear ambitions are made more dire when considering that they are the world's most dangerous state supporter of islamic extremist terrorism, with a destabilizing presence in lebanon, in syria, and in iraq. and iran's financial and military support for the houthi rebels in yemen has led to the collapse of the hadi government. thus, iran today exerts major influence, not just in rebel territories, but in four middle east capitals--beirut, baghdad, damascus and sana'a. the crisis in yemen threatens to launch yet another civil war in the region, and this severely handcuffs u.s. counterterrorism operations against aqap. islamists in iran and elsewhere repeatedly threaten to slaughter all standing in their way--with their ultimate targets being israel and the united states--us, their great satan. they must never be allowed nuclear weapons capabilities. does anyone really doubt whether they would use these capabilities someday? well, there must be some reason why iran is developing icbms. last week, iran's channel 2 broadcast satellite imagery showing recently constructed missile-related sites. those sites included a launch pad capable of firing an icbm, and on that launch pad was a never-seen-before missile measuring 27 meters in length. while we negotiate, the iran story gets worse. we have been extending deadlines and softening sanctions on iran, while they fail to meet their end of the bargain. {time} 1115 it is bizarre to me that we are debating with the iranians the numbers of their centrifuges but leaving off the table their support for terrorism, their icbms, and their continued human rights violations. is it the right thing to do to sit across the table, remain silent about the costs we and our allies have paid and are paying because of their financial and military support of our enemies? does this make sense? shouldn't we insist on adding to the agenda iran's destabilizing actions in the region and also their icbm program that puts us all at risk? merely delaying some of the potential horror for a decade or so is not a good option in my view. a bad deal where we declare victory by kicking this can down the road is far worse than no deal at all. iran now threatens to end nuclear talks if congress increases sanctions against their regime. i say we must never yield to threats from iran or any other nation. we must stand strong, continue sanctions, and even strengthen them until iran gets the message. i believe that strengthening sanctions will get us a better deal. leverage produces a better deal. we must remain unwavering in our support for israel. we must listen carefully to the concerns of prime minister netanyahu on this subject. i hope we unite with our arab partners and do all that is possible to prevent iran from going nuclear. we must lead the civilized world in this crucial mission. i think this is our destiny. we urge president obama to join with congress in this resolve. mr. gohmert. mr. speaker, there is a great deal going on, and i think the first thing that needs to be addressed is the 70th anniversary of something that should never have happened in civilized society. this is the 70th anniversary of the liberation of auschwitz death camp. as a schoolboy growing up in east texas, later attending texas a&m, and especially in my time, my 4 years in the united states army, as we discussed and looked at world war ii, things that had occurred then--i was a history major and was with the army for 4 years and majored in history. it was just always amazing. how could people who said they were civilized kill 6 million of any race, gender, national origin? how could that happen? but it did happen. on learning that eisenhower required people from the surrounding villages to be brought in to help clean up concentration camps, death camps--as i understood the reason--was so no one could ever deny that the death camps occurred. i thought that seemed ridiculous. how could anybody deny the holocaust? there aren't all that many survivors, but there are enough, and the evidence is there, and it clearly happened. but just as hitler showed, if any lie is told often enough, people begin to believe it, especially if it is even printed. here is something that was in print yesterday from a man named martin greenfield from foxnews.com, and these are martin greenfield's words. mr. greenfield said: seventy years ago, i was in a nazi concentration camp. since then, i have seen tyrants and dictators enter and exit the global stage; yet as the world prepares to mark the 70th anniversary of the auschwitz liberation, it is perhaps well and right that we reflect on how the holocaust shocked the moral imagination on a scale the world could scarcely fathom. why ponder such things? because for far too many, the holocaust remains a mystery. a major poll taken last year of 53,000 people found that just 54 percent had ever heard of the holocaust. knowledge of auschwitz is likely even more limited, particularly among young people. past surveys have shown that nearly half of britons had never heard of auschwitz. some schoolchildren even thought auschwitz was a type of beer. here at home in america, a debate erupted last year when a teenager posted a smiling selfie at auschwitz. whatever your opinion on the appropriateness of her actions, i was at least pleased to be reminded that some young americans still visit the nazi concentration camp to learn history up close. i, too, visited auschwitz as a teenager. in 1944, my family and i stood in line before dr. josef mengele--the nazi physician known as the ``angel of death''--as my mother, grandparents, two sisters, and baby brother were [[page h656]] all sent to the left to be burned in hitler's ovens. my father and i were sent to the right. the first night inside auschwitz, my father said we must separate because, together, we would suffer double. he quoted his father, ``on your own, you will survive,'' his father told him. ``you are young and strong, and i know you will survive. if you survive by yourself, you must honor us by living, by not feeling sorry for us. this is what you must do.'' that was the last time i ever saw my father. i am grateful for my father's words of grace and guidance. they echo in my heart even still. it is a cruel thing, feeling guilty for surviving, but my father erased any future guilt and replaced it with purpose. it was a gift only a father's wisdom could give. it gave me a reason to go forward, a reason to be. it does still. part of heeding my father's words involved replacing the horrors of my holocaust past with a life spent creating beauty in the form of hand-tailored suits for u.s. presidents, hollywood films, and the world's most influential men. in fact, my first sewing lesson took place in the auschwitz concentration camp laundry when i accidentally ripped the collar of a nazi soldier's shirt. a guard beat me before a kind, older inmate taught me how to sew a simple stitch to repair the torn shirt. it was hardly the ideal tailoring apprenticeship, but it was my first lesson in the skill that became my livelihood. but at 86, another part of honoring my father's wishes requires being a voice for the voiceless. indeed, as parents, educators, and citizens, we must all do our part to help ensure that ``never forget'' remains much more than a threadbare catchphrase that gathers dust and loses meaning with each passing year. for example, many people are surprised to learn that auschwitz was actually a complex comprised of three main camps and dozens of satellites. the united states holocaust memorial museum's statistics estimate that between 1940 and 1945, at least 1.1 million jews and 200,000 of hitler's undesirables were sent to the auschwitz complex. of those, 1.1 million were murdered. as i have noted elsewhere, that number would have been far greater were it not for the courage of the american soldiers, sailors, airmen, and marines who traveled around the world to defeat a moral darkness that consumed at least 6 million jewish souls. that is a lesson worthy of remembrance. the 70th anniversary of the liberation marks that moment when freedom conquered barbarism through sureness of virtue and strength of will. sadly, as recent events reveal, that remains a lesson humanity must learn and relearn from generation to generation. the word ``holocaust'' means sacrifice by fire. may the memory of the millions who were engulfed in the flames like my family never be forgotten. that is martin greenfield, 70 years after being liberated from auschwitz death camp. there is another article from cbc news. aleksandra sagan includes this regarding mordechai ronen, 82, born with the family name markovits. he would be making a second visit to auschwitz for the commemoration ceremonies. at nearly 12, ronen saw auschwitz for the first time as a prisoner after soldiers forced all the jews in his hungarian town into a ghetto and, 2 weeks later, shipped them in cattle cars to the camp. dr. josef mengele, the nazis' angel of death, sent ronen's mother and two sisters to the gas chambers on arrival. young ronen made a lifesaving decision when he held on to his father's hand and joined the line of men. he spent about 2 weeks at auschwitz, where he witnessed soldiers using an infant for target practice and slept on piles of corpses to avoid selection for the gas chamber. he and his father were moved to a nearby labor camp where the brutality continued. one day, his father told ronen he could no longer get up to work for the cement brigade. ronen last saw his father as soldiers took him away. it is the only day he remembers crying and the day he decided to survive. ronen was liberated from a third camp, gunskirchen, and remembers walking to a nearby town, knocking on a resident's door and asking if he could take a shower. ronen, who prefers to be called a ``victorer'' rather than a survivor, first returned to auschwitz in 1999, when he guided then-prime minister jean chretien around the grounds. it is important to ronen to show the world he is alive and to share the history of the holocaust. ``maybe the world will realize what we went through, and it will be the end, and we are going to have peace and quiet in the world,'' he explains. unfortunately, it is not the end of horrors. tragically, christians now are being killed, persecuted, and tortured in greater numbers than ever in the history of the world. {time} 1130 anti-semitism, hatred against jews, is growing like i couldn't have imagined. in college, when i studied in history, i couldn't have imagined the kind of anti-jewish hatred, the kind of anti-semitism that would be growing as it has, and the united states of america would be doing precious little about it instead of standing up for the jewish people and calling out anti-semitism where it exists and where it grows and proliferates, as it does in the united nations, for example, as it has in europe, as it has in england, as it has right here in america. it is unconscionable that at a time in world history when the united states is said to be the true superpower of the world--even as that power has been seen as diminishing by people around the world, as polling indicates around the world, but still to be seen as the great superpower--as anti-jewish hatred grows and we do precious little about it, and even at times stoke those flames, even in our universities, who are so proud of accepting massive amounts of money from people who are part of organizations that hate jews and fund such courses or seminars on things like islamophobia, not a liberated mental process of recognizing anti-semitism, recognizing jewish hatred--no, stoking those flames against the jewish people. it is unbelievable that it is happening here in america as well. and it is even more unbelievable that it is happening among what some would refer to as the intelligentsia, those who are supposed to be more enlightened than the rest of a nation, who see things as they truly are. and yet, in america, some of those supposed enlightened intelligentsia are growing to be some of the most anti-semitic people in the country. how did all this happen? money for one thing, political power for another. but it has to stop. money and initially power in nazi germany stoked the flames of anti-jewish hatred. but there is anti-christian hatred growing as well. radical islam has proliferated around the world. violent radical islam has grown. they aren't junior varsities. these are literal cutthroats who have to be stopped. it is not enough for the united states administration to beg radical islamists, jew- and christian-hating leaders to sit at the table or offer to let their murderers go free if they will just sit down and visit with us, reminiscent of what jimmy carter wanted to do after an act of war was committed against our embassy, and in the 36 years that have followed, what appeared to radical islamists as a weak, paper tiger, toothless america did nothing but beg to sit down and talk and try to encourage iran to let our prisoners go. it was not until ronald reagan took office they were released. they never wanted to fight the united states superpower. that has been changed over the years. since '79, when they committed an act of war, attacked our embassy, around the world people have been shown: oh, you can do that against the united states and get away with it. the good thing is they may end up leaving your country and then they may offer to give you money. they may offer to release murderers from prison so they can come back and help kill more americans. you know, they are not very smart over there in the united states. that has been going on since 1979. it is tragic when we encourage radical islamist holocausts, which is what they would like to do, they said they were going to do, by letting the murderers go. how could this administration for months now think that yemen was a great example of moderate islam working out? i have known since a constituent months ago was in jeopardy, and we were able to get special ops people to help get them out. according to them, the embassy was attacked many months ago. back at the time embassy personnel officially said: ``no, it was a nearby attack, but it wasn't us.'' when the iranian-backed houthis, the radical islamists in yemen, were taking over the capital and taking over the country--and instead of standing up firmly against them and protecting our american interests we were releasing murderers, radical islamic murderers--we were talking about how wonderful things were in yemen. that is exactly how the kind of anti-jewish, anti-christian sentiment could grow to the point of having a holocaust. [[page h657]] it is literally breathtaking for an administration not to understand that while it is trying to placate radical islamic leaders in iran and telling them: ``we just want to talk. as long as you will keep talking to us, we will keep israel from protecting themselves to their own detriment. just keep talking to us and you keep those centrifuges spinning, that is fine with us.'' now we know, we have been informed, that the administration has taken complete dismantlement of the centrifuges and their equipment to help them create nuclear weapons off the table. it is not even something they are demanding anymore. in other words, the word is out that this administration is apparently okay with iran getting nukes but just would prefer that it wait until after this president leaves office. it doesn't matter when a president leaves office. if an administration gives bloodthirsty zealots the ability to create a holocaust, history does not forgive them simply because they had already left office when the holocaust actually started. nigeria doesn't need us to send troops to stop the radical islamists there, but they need help. boko haram continues to kill, rape, torture. there it is about going after christians. the small-scale holocausts that boko haram is creating don't get so much as a whimper these days from this administration. they may say a few words, but they are hollow and they do not affect boko haram as they continue to be emboldened. just like when the irs was caught redhanded being weaponized and used as a democratic political tool, which appears to have violated criminal law--yes, we have had hearings, but we haven't held them accountable. and, therefore, it seems to have encouraged even more impropriety by people within the irs. when people get caught in impropriety and don't pay a cost, then you see what we are seeing in nigeria, you see what we are seeing in afghanistan, in pakistan, in syria, in iran, in iraq, and in libya. oh, i know the president, his administration, bragged about the arab spring and about taking out qadhafi, who had become an ally after he gave up any efforts for nuclear weapons, completely opened his defenses to the united states. this administration and the prior administration had agreements with qadhafi. but this administration never lets agreements get in the way of helping radical islamists. because this administration did help radical islam turn libya into a smoking country where people die, where our own people were not protected, because of the fantasy of those who thought that somehow the name, the united states, would be adequate to keep chris stevens and the other americans safe in benghazi. we didn't need to give them added security like they asked for, we didn't even need to respond when chris stevens called and said they were under attack--never said anything about a video because it was not. but that smokescreen worked. the president got reelected. he didn't have to account for that before the election, still hasn't had to account for where he was and why help was not forthcoming. i mean, even after 20 hours this administration that had planes--we know for sure within 3\1/2\ hours--after 20 hours they get a private plane there, that is it. david ubben, with most of his leg, right leg, blown off, no painkillers, no morphine, they don't have a c-130 that they land to take him up in on a gurney. they get a private plane from somebody who wasn't even american, and they have to knock david up against the door, turning the gurney every which way trying to get him in, without painkillers, causing more pain, more suffering, because this administration, apparently they were thinking that if they sent more help than just a private plane like that, a military plane, if that were sent, it might look like libya were not the wonderful country that this administration helped create by bombing qadhafi out of existence. and, yes, it was not, it is true, it was not a u.s. bomb that took qadhafi out. but our bombs put him on the run, our bombs stopped his caravan. our president wouldn't respond for 3 days after qadhafi offered to leave in exile and avoid any bloodshed before it all started. this administration didn't respond. obviously, they were okay with having bloodshed and qadhafi being wiped out. so they got what they were hoping for, obviously. {time} 1145 but what do we have now? we have a country in libya that is in absolute turmoil. by the way, because libya is in turmoil due to this administration, they are helping turn egypt into as much turmoil as they can. thank god for president el-sisi. in having met with him on more than one occasion, i was impressed by the man. before he was president, he asked that we bring back a message to this administration since this administration-- this president--froze the helicopters that were being sent, the apaches. the question was: does this administration--does this president--not understand that we use the apache helicopters to keep the suez canal open? although there were some that bought morsi's lies that he was deweaponizing the sinai--supposedly to diminish the threat to israel from the sinai--and after morsi was removed for his unconstitutional actions, not in a coup but in an uprising, which was a peaceful revolution by reportedly over 30 million of their 90 million people, they found that the sinai had been dramatically weaponized and had been contributing weapons equipment to gaza to help threaten and cause terror to israel. once again, whether it is the sinai, gaza, northern israel that was given to lebanon, it seems going back to the very inception of israel-- back when israel was first brought, according to the bible, into the promised land--we know of canaan. the canaanites no longer exist, so other people claim it who are not canaanites. actually, the israelis had claim to it after the canaanites. others who occupied the land back over 3,000 years ago don't exist. this land, according to the bible, was given to the children of israel. it seems to be true that there has never been a time when israel gave away land when trying to buy peace that that land that they gave away was not used as a staging area from which to attack it. gaza, what a noble thing to do by the israelis. they took an area that was prosperous, self-sustaining, with greenhouses growing vegetables that would feed the people who lived there. an amazing place was the gaza strip. then some noble israeli leaders thought, do you know what? it is not required. we are getting absolutely nothing in return, but we are going to do the unilateral act that will be so noble, that will be so full of grace that the world, even those who don't like us, will go, wow. those israelis, they are okay. they are nice folks. look, they didn't get anything in return; yet they still gave away the gaza strip. what a wonderful group of people. i mean, that just doesn't happen. the united states never gave back its land to england or to spain or to france or to other countries that initially had claims here. other countries don't do that, but israel did. they gave away the gaza strip. previous to that, they had given away what northern israel now calls southern lebanon. southern lebanon, people will recall, has been the site of attacks on israelis--war. so how was this grace, this beneficence of israel's giving the gaza strip to the palestinians, rewarded? it has been rewarded by their giving back to israel thousands upon thousands upon thousands of rockets. some kill. all terrorize. all cost money to israel. the most important problem they have created is the threat to life, the threat to their existence; and we still have people in this country who say, well, if you just keep giving away land, eventually, they will be satisfied, when the very materials that are being promoted by the people this administration supports among the islamists--they made very clear the reason we name holidays, streets, areas, parks after suicide bombers who kill innocent children, women, men is that we, ultimately, are going to destroy israel and wipe it off the map. we hate jews that much; and this administration thinks, somehow, they will bring radical islam around to really being this group of peace. now, there is a document that was an exhibit in the united states v. the holy land foundation in which there were many individuals and groups named as coconspirators. they were [[page h658]] not indicted, but they were named as coconspirators. it includes the council on american-islamic relations, cair, which has a nice office building just up the street here, and the islamic society of north america, isna, the leader of which is imam magid, who goes to the white house, who goes to the state department, who advises the president and let's him know when somebody is criticizing islam, so the administration steps in and goes after him. in this exhibit from the holy land foundation trial--it was the biggest funding of terrorism case ever in u.s. history, and people who were involved originally had indicated the goal was to convict these first five, to name all of these coconspirators, and if we get convictions of those first five, like we think we should, then we proceed and go after the remainder. they were convicted in late 2008. president obama took office a month or two later, and this administration would under no circumstances go after these people who had been alleged in the documents of funding radical islamic terrorism even after the u.s. district court in dallas and the u.s. fifth circuit court of appeals in new orleans confirmed that there was plenty of evidence to support that someone like isna or cair was a legitimate coconspirator named in the indictment and that their names would not be removed. i have asked for years now of the justice department to make available the documents that were provided to the convicted terrorists--those funding terrorism or terrorists--and this administration now, for years, has drug their feet and has refused to provide all of the documents that were provided to the terrorists. on one occasion, the attorney general basically said there are issues here of privilege, and my point was--and is--you gave them to the terrorists; surely, you can give them to members of congress. but the answer is, no, they can't. they are going to keep obfuscating. they don't want us to see all of the documents that they had in their possession that they gave to the terrorists. i have a feeling, if we saw all of the documents, it would be very, very clear in the purging that this administration has done of our training materials of the fbi's, of the intelligence agency's, of the state department's, and the justice department's that, if there is anything that might bother a radical islamist who wants to kill us, then it has to be removed. they removed it. in the document from a 1991 meeting, in what is called an ``explanatory memorandum,'' it spells out their goals. it was written in 1991 by a member of the board of directors of the muslim brotherhood in north america and by a senior hamas leader named mohamed akram. it had been approved by the muslim brotherhood's shura council and organizational conference, and it was meant for internal review by the muslim brotherhood leadership in egypt. it was not intended for public consumption. these are the words from the introduction that is part of this document from the center for security policy. mr. speaker, i want to quote from the document, itself, prepared by the muslim brotherhood in 1991, setting their goals for america: one: the memorandum is derived from: one, the general strategic goal of the group in america, which was approved by the shura council and the organizational conference for the year 1987, is: ``enablement of islam in north america, meaning: establishing an effective and stable islamic movement led by the muslim brotherhood which adopts muslims' causes domestically and globally and which works to expand the observant muslim base; aims at unifying and directing muslims' efforts; presents islam as a civilization alternative; and supports the global islamic state--if that name sounds familiar--wherever it is.'' two, the priority that is approved by the shura council for the work of the group in its current and former session, which is ``settlement.'' skipping down to ``two: an introduction to the explanatory memorandum,'' it says: the question we are facing is: ``how do you like to see the islam movement in north america in 10 years?'' or ``taking along'' the following sentence when planning and working ``islamic work in north america in the year 2000: a strategic vision.'' it goes on: also, we must summon and take along elements of the general strategic goal of the group in north america. for those large numbers of people in college who may not realize, north america is where we live. the document says: i will intentionally repeat them in numbers. they are: one, establishing an effective and stable islamic movement led by the muslim brotherhood. two, adopting muslims' causes domestically and globally. three, expanding the observant muslim base. four, unifying and directing muslim efforts. five, presenting islam as a civilization alternative. six, supporting the establishment of the global islamic state, wherever it is. {time} 1200 the document says: it must be stressed that it has become clear and emphatically known that all is in agreement that we must ``settle'' or ``enable'' islam and its movement in this part of the world. three: the concept of settlement: the term was mentioned in the group's ``dictionary'' and documents with various meanings in spite of the fact that everyone meant one thing with it. we believe that the understanding of the essence is the same, and we will attempt here to give the word and its ``meanings'' a practical explanation with a practical movement tone and not a philosophical linguistic explanation, while stressing that this explanation of ours is not complete until our explanation of ``the process'' of settlement itself is understood which is mentioned in the following paragraph. we briefly say the following: settlement: ``that islam and its movement become a part of the homeland it lives in.'' establishment: ``that islam turns into firmly rooted organizations on whose bases civilization, structure, and testimony are built.'' further down, it goes on, ``that islam is stable in the land.'' rooting: ``that islam is resident and not a passing thing or rooted `entrenched' in the soil of the spot where it moves and not a strange plant to it.'' four: the process of settlement: in order for islam and its movement to become ``a part of the homeland'' in which it lives-- talking about north america. --``stable'' in its land, ``rooted'' in the spirits and minds of its people, ``enabled'' in the life of its society and has firmly established ``organizations'' on which the islamic structure is built and with which the testimony of civilization is achieved, the movement must plan and struggle to obtain ``the keys'' and the tools of this process in carrying out this grand mission as a ``civilization jihadist'' responsibility which lies on the shoulders of muslims and--on top of them--the muslim brotherhood in this country. talking about here in the united states, north america. ``among these keys and tools are the following.'' it goes on to talk about the settlement concept and the fundamental shift toward settlement of this country. number four: understanding the role of the muslim brother in north america: the process of settlement is a ``civilization jihadist process,'' with all the word means. anyway, it goes on. another place here, it says: there is a conviction--with which this memorandum disagrees--that our focus in attempting to settle islam in this country will lead to negligence in our duty towards the global islamic movement in supporting its project to establish the state. we believe that the reply is in two segments. one, the success of the movement in america-- talking about the united states of america. one, the success of the movement in america in establishing an observant islamic base with power and effectiveness will be the best support and aid to the global movement project. and the second is the global movement has not succeeded yet in ``distributing roles'' to its branches, stating what is the needed from them as one of the participants or contributors to the project to establish the global islamic state. the day this happens, the children of the american ikhwani branch will have far-reaching impact and positions that make the ancestors proud. it is a great document goal for taking over the united states, which brings another story to the surface. it is from bob price from breitbart.com. ``islamic tribunal confirmed in texas; attorney claims 'it's voluntary,''' and it talks about the new islamic tribunal in texas that has been confirmed now by breitbart texas. the tribunal is operating as a nonprofit organization in dallas. because when you understand the goals, if there is a major defeat or a major success, [[page h659]] muslim brotherhood requires a mosque be built there and a presence there. naturally, they would want one at ground zero in new york; further, they would want a mosque and a strong presence in dallas which was, they believe, the place of their big defeat when the holy land foundation principals were convicted and sent to prison. i did want to point out, as we finish up here today, that the president was giving an excellent speech in india about the importance of stopping the global war on women. he didn't call it that. he only calls it that for republicans, but there is a war on women, and it is not by republicans. it is radical islam and even some moderate islamists. he is giving this talk about the importance of recognizing the importance and the equality of women--or some of us might say they are more equal than we are--but as he was doing that, this picture was on saudi television. we have our united states president depicted here, and this is the first lady of the united states of america being blurred out by this country's allies because she wasn't covered. michelle obama should never need to be covered if she doesn't want to be; yet at the very time our president is talking about equality of women, he fails to notice that people that he considers allies are treating his own wife like this. mr. speaker, it is critical that we stand up against radical islam or any islam that wants a settlement civilization jihad in america. anything and anybody who disagrees with the united states constitution and wants to destroy it, tear it down, is an enemy to the united states and needs to be recognized as such and not welcomed with open arms at the state department and the white house. with that, i yield back the balance of my time. ____________________",34543

We expect the filibuster of good American jobs to soon come to an end. That is good news for the Senate. It is even better news for the people we represent. It would show their Congress is capable of defying the powerful special interests that oppose Keystone so we can get things done for the middle class.

Mr. President, 30 days from today, on February 27, the Department of Homeland Security, the [[Page S550]] lead agency in protecting America from terrorism, will run out of money. The only way to prevent this important government agency from shutting down is for Congress to pass legislation to fund the Department and to do it quickly. This morning, we moved to the second reading, what is known as a clean appropriations bill, which will provide resources for this critical Department. I hope the Senate can take that up quickly and pass it quickly as well. We should not even be debating the funding for the Homeland Security Department. Every other government agency has been funded through the end of the fiscal year, the end of September, but not the Department of Homeland Security. The House Republicans insisted on separating this critical agency from the rest of the Federal Government and treating it differently, giving it temporary funding--what is known as a continuing resolution--and making it extremely difficult for the Department of Homeland Security to do its job to keep America safe. Why did the Republicans insist that this one agency be treated differently, funded in a way that it can't do its job effectively? They are using the deadline, the end of February, on this Department's funding in an attempt to force the Senate to accept extreme anti- immigrant amendments that have been attached to the homeland security bill in the House. The House Republicans' message to the Senate is very straightforward: Accept our controversial immigration amendments or we will shut down the Homeland Security Department. That is the height of irresponsibility. Now is not the time to play politics with homeland security. Just this weekend the world witnessed another horrible terrorist act, the beheading of a Japanese hostage by the terrorist group ISIS. In light of the terrorist threat we currently face, it would be the height of irresponsibility to shut down the Department of Homeland Security as threatened by the House Republicans. That is one of the key government agencies charged with protecting Americans. Today I am calling on the Senate majority leader for a clean appropriations bill that we moved forward on the calendar this morning. Let's pass this bill. Let's make sure we do it in a timely way. Let's fund this Department. Some Republican leaders are arguing, well, it is not such a big deal, giving temporary funding to the Department of Homeland Security, playing roulette with the prospects of whether it will be funded for the rest of this fiscal year. Last week the Republican chairman of the Senate homeland security committee here in the Senate reportedly said, and I quote, that he ``isn't that concerned about the potential shutdown of the Homeland Security Department.'' Jeh Johnson, the Secretary of Homeland Security, has a much different view. He says our homeland security is already at risk because the Department is operating under a short-term funding bill known as a continuing resolution. Listen to what Secretary Johnson said: ``As long as this Department continues to operate on a [continuing resolution], we are prevented from funding key homeland security initiatives [including] new grants to state and local law enforcement [and] additional border security resources.'' How many times have we heard from the other side of the aisle the highest priority in America is our border security? Many of us agreed and voted for a comprehensive immigration reform that folded more resources than ever into protecting the border. Now the same people, the same elected officials, who have been arguing for a strong border are underfunding the Department with that responsibility. The Secretary reminds us their approach to this is going to jeopardize investments in border security. What are these amendments the House Republicans feel so strongly about that they are willing to risk the funding of this critical agency? The bill the House passed would defund President Obama's immigration policies, including the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals Program known as DACA. A quick history about how we reached the point we are at today. It was 14 years ago when I introduced the DREAM Act. The DREAM Act was designed to take care of children brought to America by their parents, children who were undocumented, and to give those children a chance, if they led a good life and finished school, if they were prepared to go to college or join our military, to have a path to legal status. Over the years this has been debated widely. Even many Republican leaders have stepped up and said, well, it is fundamentally just. Why would you hold the children responsible for a decision made by their parents to come to this country? Why would you jeopardize the future of a child because the parents came here, overstayed their visa, or failed to file the necessary papers for their child? Even former Arkansas Governor Huckabee, interviewed this Sunday on television, made that very point. You don't arrest a parent for speeding in the front seat and then arrest the baby sitting in the back seat for speeding. He made that point in light of his decisions as the Governor of Arkansas. Over time this concept of the DREAM Act has been moving toward acceptance by both political parties but moving very slowly. For 14 years we have been debating this one simple idea, that children should not be held responsible for the wrongdoing of their parents, that young people brought to this country and undocumented should be given a chance. And, of course, 2\1/2\ years ago, President Obama did something. He did it at the request of many Senators, including myself. We wrote to him and said, Mr. President, while the Senate and Congress debate the future of the DREAM Act, there are literally thousands of these young people who have no future in America. They don't know which way to turn. They can't get drivers licenses. They can't go to school with any government assistance. They don't have any basic idea what their future is going to be. The President said, here is what I will do. I will create this Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals Program, the DACA Program. If these young people will come forward, if they will submit a filing fee to cover the cost of the program, if they will submit themselves to background checks, then we will give them temporary status in America-- temporary status in America. We are not making them citizens or declaring them legal forever. We are saying they can go to school and work without the fear of deportation. We estimate there are 2 million young people in our Nation of 350 million-plus who would qualify for this DACA treatment. Six hundred thousand have in fact registered in the 2\1/2\ years since the President's decision. DACA put on hold deportation so these young people who grow up in this country would have a chance. These are the DREAMers. They are the ones we have referred to over and over on the floor and tell their stories. Think about it. America is already invested in these young people. We paid for their education. We sent them to the classrooms in the schools. They stood there every morning by their desk, hand over their heart, pledging allegiance to the same flag we pledged allegiance to this morning. They sang the only national anthem they have ever known. They are just asking for a chance. Over the years I have come to the floor to tell their stories because leaving the explanation at this point really doesn't touch on the reality of who these DREAMers are. I am going to tell another story this morning, and I want the record to show this young man I am about to speak about, Juan Rios. He is a person whom the House Republicans want to deport. They have said by their vote--by the amendment they put on this appropriations bill--they want Juan Rios to leave the United States of America. That is their goal, deport the DREAMers, all of those who have signed up for DACA and those who might sign up. That is just part of what they are trying to achieve. But that to me is the starting point that ought to be our starting point for debate. Juan Rios was brought to the United States when he was 10 years old. In high school Juan decided what his calling was. It was military service. He became a leader in the Air Force Junior ROTC in his high school, group commander, and armed drill team captain, and he rose to the rank of cadet lieutenant colonel. This photo is of Juan in uniform in high school. His dream was to attend [[Page S551]] the Air Force Academy. Of course, it is a dream that couldn't happen. He is undocumented. Instead, he enrolled in Arizona State University. In 2010 Juan Rios graduated from Arizona State University. What course did he study? It was a degree in aeronautical engineering. He is some student. This is a picture of him at his graduation. But after he graduated with his degree in engineering, he didn't know which way to turn. He couldn't enlist in the military like he wanted to. He couldn't work as an engineer because he was undocumented. His talents were wasted. He sent me a letter at that time and said: The United States of America is the country I want to live my life in, where I want to flourish as a productive citizen, where I want to grow old among my lifelong friends and where I want to one day fall in love and raise a family. So what happened to Juan after DACA, when the Executive order gave him the opportunity to have temporary protection and not be deported? In February 2013, after signing up for DACA, he interviewed for his first engineering job. Today Juan is working as a mechanical engineer in the semiconductor industry. At the age of 27 he learned how to drive and bought his first car. After living in Arizona for 17 years, he was finally able to visit the Grand Canyon for the first time. Juan sent a letter to me last week and said: I am fortunate to have found the opportunity to prove myself as a professional and to work in a place where I feel my contributions are valued and recognized. The past two years have changed my life in every way imaginable. I think DACA is a responsibility, a privilege, and an opportunity for everyone who receives it to demonstrate that we as a community of Dreamers have so much to contribute to society. Juan Rios is trying to prove to everyone that he is worth this investment, that he is worth this trust. He has done it. He will continue to do it. So why in the world do the House Republicans want to deport Juan Rios? Why do they want to give up on this young man, with his idealism, his determination, and his record of accomplishment? Why do they want him to leave the United States of America? Well, it is because he was brought here as a 5-year-old-- undocumented. For that decision by his parents, the House Republicans would say: We have no use for Juan Rios. We don't want him to stay. There are so many other stories similar to this one. It is clear that DACA works for America. I have been to Chicago so many times and met with these DREAMers. I know these young men and women. I believe in them, and I believe they are going to make a difference in this country. I also want to remind my friends on the Republican side of the aisle that America is a nation of immigrants. Our diversity is our strength. We come to this great country from so many different places, and we bring so many different cultures, languages, religions, ethnic backgrounds, and cuisines. We bring it all here, and we make it part of America's future. I know a little bit about this story because my mother was an immigrant herself. She was brought here at the age of 2. Today I stand on the floor of the Senate representing the great State of Illinois. That is my story. That is my family story. That is America's story. There is something else I would say to the critics of immigrants. Immigrants bring something special to America. Each one of these immigrant families took the greatest risk of their lives to come to America. Some of them literally risked their lives to do it. Others came to this country where they didn't speak the language, knew very few people, and didn't have any idea what their future would be. But they had heard about this America place, and they believed this was a better opportunity for them and for their kids. I am sure that is what brought my family to this country--my mother to this country--and I am sure that is what has brought a lot of people. That is part of our DNA. Those immigrants, their courage, and their determination to be part of America and its future really bring to this country an energy that just can't be matched in many other places in the world. House Republicans would kill that dream, and they have showed us that by this horrible amendment they have attached to the Department of Homeland Security appropriations. They think America is stronger if we tell Juan Rios to leave. I don't. It is shameless to play politics with the life of this young man and hundreds of thousands of others. It is just shameless to put homeland security funding at risk, to punish Juan Rios for having been brought to this country as a child. The House Republicans feel so strongly about deporting DREAMers they are willing to hold up the homeland security funding bill. The House Republicans are telling the Senate and the President: Deport the DREAMers or we are going to shut down the agency responsible for protecting America from terrorism. I hope the Senate majority leader will reject this blackmail, and I hope that in the spirit of the Senate, where we came together on a bipartisan basis to pass immigration reform almost 2 years ago, we will reject this hate-filled message from the House Republicans. For our part, Senate Democrats will insist that the Department of Homeland Security be funded and that the President have the authority-- which every President has had--to establish his own immigration policies. I see there is another colleague on the floor. I yield the floor. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 14 (Wednesday, January 28, 2015)] [Senate] [Pages S549-S551] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY FUNDING Mr. DURBIN.

Over the years this has been debated widely. Even many Republican leaders have stepped up and said, well, it is fundamentally just. Why would you hold the children responsible for a decision made by their parents to come to this country? Why would you jeopardize the future of a child because the parents came here, overstayed their visa, or failed to file the necessary papers for their child? Even former Arkansas Governor Huckabee, interviewed this Sunday on television, made that very point. You don't arrest a parent for speeding in the front seat and then arrest the baby sitting in the back seat for speeding. He made that point in light of his decisions as the Governor of Arkansas. Over time this concept of the DREAM Act has been moving toward acceptance by both political parties but moving very slowly. For 14 years we have been debating this one simple idea, that children should not be held responsible for the wrongdoing of their parents, that young people brought to this country and undocumented should be given a chance. And, of course, 2\1/2\ years ago, President Obama did something. He did it at the request of many Senators, including myself. We wrote to him and said, Mr. President, while the Senate and Congress debate the future of the DREAM Act, there are literally thousands of these young people who have no future in America. They don't know which way to turn. They can't get drivers licenses. They can't go to school with any government assistance. They don't have any basic idea what their future is going to be. The President said, here is what I will do. I will create this Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals Program, the DACA Program. If these young people will come forward, if they will submit a filing fee to cover the cost of the program, if they will submit themselves to background checks, then we will give them temporary status in America-- temporary status in America. We are not making them citizens or declaring them legal forever. We are saying they can go to school and work without the fear of deportation. We estimate there are 2 million young people in our Nation of 350 million-plus who would qualify for this DACA treatment. Six hundred thousand have in fact registered in the 2\1/2\ years since the President's decision. DACA put on hold deportation so these young people who grow up in this country would have a chance. These are the DREAMers. They are the ones we have referred to over and over on the floor and tell their stories. Think about it. America is already invested in these young people. We paid for their education. We sent them to the classrooms in the schools. They stood there every morning by their desk, hand over their heart, pledging allegiance to the same flag we pledged allegiance to this morning. They sang the only national anthem they have ever known. They are just asking for a chance. Over the years I have come to the floor to tell their stories because leaving the explanation at this point really doesn't touch on the reality of who these DREAMers are. I am going to tell another story this morning, and I want the record to show this young man I am about to speak about, Juan Rios. He is a person whom the House Republicans want to deport. They have said by their vote--by the amendment they put on this appropriations bill--they want Juan Rios to leave the United States of America. That is their goal, deport the DREAMers, all of those who have signed up for DACA and those who might sign up. That is just part of what they are trying to achieve. But that to me is the starting point that ought to be our starting point for debate. Juan Rios was brought to the United States when he was 10 years old. In high school Juan decided what his calling was. It was military service. He became a leader in the Air Force Junior ROTC in his high school, group commander, and armed drill team captain, and he rose to the rank of cadet lieutenant colonel. This photo is of Juan in uniform in high school. His dream was to attend [[Page S551]] the Air Force Academy. Of course, it is a dream that couldn't happen. He is undocumented. Instead, he enrolled in Arizona State University. In 2010 Juan Rios graduated from Arizona State University. What course did he study? It was a degree in aeronautical engineering. He is some student. This is a picture of him at his graduation. But after he graduated with his degree in engineering, he didn't know which way to turn. He couldn't enlist in the military like he wanted to. He couldn't work as an engineer because he was undocumented. His talents were wasted. He sent me a letter at that time and said: The United States of America is the country I want to live my life in, where I want to flourish as a productive citizen, where I want to grow old among my lifelong friends and where I want to one day fall in love and raise a family. So what happened to Juan after DACA, when the Executive order gave him the opportunity to have temporary protection and not be deported? In February 2013, after signing up for DACA, he interviewed for his first engineering job. Today Juan is working as a mechanical engineer in the semiconductor industry. At the age of 27 he learned how to drive and bought his first car. After living in Arizona for 17 years, he was finally able to visit the Grand Canyon for the first time. Juan sent a letter to me last week and said: I am fortunate to have found the opportunity to prove myself as a professional and to work in a place where I feel my contributions are valued and recognized. The past two years have changed my life in every way imaginable. I think DACA is a responsibility, a privilege, and an opportunity for everyone who receives it to demonstrate that we as a community of Dreamers have so much to contribute to society. Juan Rios is trying to prove to everyone that he is worth this investment, that he is worth this trust. He has done it. He will continue to do it. So why in the world do the House Republicans want to deport Juan Rios? Why do they want to give up on this young man, with his idealism, his determination, and his record of accomplishment? Why do they want him to leave the United States of America? Well, it is because he was brought here as a 5-year-old-- undocumented. For that decision by his parents, the House Republicans would say: We have no use for Juan Rios. We don't want him to stay. There are so many other stories similar to this one. It is clear that DACA works for America. I have been to Chicago so many times and met with these DREAMers. I know these young men and women. I believe in them, and I believe they are going to make a difference in this country. I also want to remind my friends on the Republican side of the aisle that America is a nation of immigrants. Our diversity is our strength. We come to this great country from so many different places, and we bring so many different cultures, languages, religions, ethnic backgrounds, and cuisines. We bring it all here, and we make it part of America's future. I know a little bit about this story because my mother was an immigrant herself. She was brought here at the age of 2. Today I stand on the floor of the Senate representing the great State of Illinois. That is my story. That is my family story. That is America's story. There is something else I would say to the critics of immigrants. Immigrants bring something special to America. Each one of these immigrant families took the greatest risk of their lives to come to America. Some of them literally risked their lives to do it. Others came to this country where they didn't speak the language, knew very few people, and didn't have any idea what their future would be. But they had heard about this America place, and they believed this was a better opportunity for them and for their kids. I am sure that is what brought my family to this country--my mother to this country--and I am sure that is what has brought a lot of people. That is part of our DNA. Those immigrants, their courage, and their determination to be part of America and its future really bring to this country an energy that just can't be matched in many other places in the world. House Republicans would kill that dream, and they have showed us that by this horrible amendment they have attached to the Department of Homeland Security appropriations. They think America is stronger if we tell Juan Rios to leave. I don't. It is shameless to play politics with the life of this young man and hundreds of thousands of others. It is just shameless to put homeland security funding at risk, to punish Juan Rios for having been brought to this country as a child. The House Republicans feel so strongly about deporting DREAMers they are willing to hold up the homeland security funding bill. The House Republicans are telling the Senate and the President: Deport the DREAMers or we are going to shut down the agency responsible for protecting America from terrorism. I hope the Senate majority leader will reject this blackmail, and I hope that in the spirit of the Senate, where we came together on a bipartisan basis to pass immigration reform almost 2 years ago, we will reject this hate-filled message from the House Republicans. For our part, Senate Democrats will insist that the Department of Homeland Security be funded and that the President have the authority-- which every President has had--to establish his own immigration policies. I see there is another colleague on the floor. I yield the floor. ____________________",package_114_121.csv,14312,14312,14384,"[congressional record volume 161, number 14 (wednesday, january 28, 2015)] [senate] [pages s549-s551] from the congressional record online through the government publishing office [ www.gpo.gov ] department of homeland security funding mr. durbin. mr. president, 30 days from today, on february 27, the department of homeland security, the [[page s550]] lead agency in protecting america from terrorism, will run out of money. the only way to prevent this important government agency from shutting down is for congress to pass legislation to fund the department and to do it quickly. this morning, we moved to the second reading, what is known as a clean appropriations bill, which will provide resources for this critical department. i hope the senate can take that up quickly and pass it quickly as well. we should not even be debating the funding for the homeland security department. every other government agency has been funded through the end of the fiscal year, the end of september, but not the department of homeland security. the house republicans insisted on separating this critical agency from the rest of the federal government and treating it differently, giving it temporary funding--what is known as a continuing resolution--and making it extremely difficult for the department of homeland security to do its job to keep america safe. why did the republicans insist that this one agency be treated differently, funded in a way that it can't do its job effectively? they are using the deadline, the end of february, on this department's funding in an attempt to force the senate to accept extreme anti- immigrant amendments that have been attached to the homeland security bill in the house. the house republicans' message to the senate is very straightforward: accept our controversial immigration amendments or we will shut down the homeland security department. that is the height of irresponsibility. now is not the time to play politics with homeland security. just this weekend the world witnessed another horrible terrorist act, the beheading of a japanese hostage by the terrorist group isis. in light of the terrorist threat we currently face, it would be the height of irresponsibility to shut down the department of homeland security as threatened by the house republicans. that is one of the key government agencies charged with protecting americans. today i am calling on the senate majority leader for a clean appropriations bill that we moved forward on the calendar this morning. let's pass this bill. let's make sure we do it in a timely way. let's fund this department. some republican leaders are arguing, well, it is not such a big deal, giving temporary funding to the department of homeland security, playing roulette with the prospects of whether it will be funded for the rest of this fiscal year. last week the republican chairman of the senate homeland security committee here in the senate reportedly said, and i quote, that he ``isn't that concerned about the potential shutdown of the homeland security department.'' jeh johnson, the secretary of homeland security, has a much different view. he says our homeland security is already at risk because the department is operating under a short-term funding bill known as a continuing resolution. listen to what secretary johnson said: ``as long as this department continues to operate on a [continuing resolution], we are prevented from funding key homeland security initiatives [including] new grants to state and local law enforcement [and] additional border security resources.'' how many times have we heard from the other side of the aisle the highest priority in america is our border security? many of us agreed and voted for a comprehensive immigration reform that folded more resources than ever into protecting the border. now the same people, the same elected officials, who have been arguing for a strong border are underfunding the department with that responsibility. the secretary reminds us their approach to this is going to jeopardize investments in border security. what are these amendments the house republicans feel so strongly about that they are willing to risk the funding of this critical agency? the bill the house passed would defund president obama's immigration policies, including the deferred action for childhood arrivals program known as daca. a quick history about how we reached the point we are at today. it was 14 years ago when i introduced the dream act. the dream act was designed to take care of children brought to america by their parents, children who were undocumented, and to give those children a chance, if they led a good life and finished school, if they were prepared to go to college or join our military, to have a path to legal status. over the years this has been debated widely. even many republican leaders have stepped up and said, well, it is fundamentally just. why would you hold the children responsible for a decision made by their parents to come to this country?

Mr. President, last November the American people sent an unmistakable message to Washington, DC. Voters across the country said they were tired of the gridlock and they were tired of the lack of action by the Democratic-led Senate. Well, we are now working again for the American people because voters said it was time for a new majority--the Republican majority--to get the Senate working again and to get America on a better course. Republicans heard the message. We heard it loud and clear, and we have been doing exactly what the American people have sent us here to do. Under Republican leadership the Senate is working again for the American people, and the best example of that is the bill we are considering now in the Senate on the Keystone XL Pipeline project. The Obama administration has blocked and delayed this job-creating project for 6 years. Now Republicans are moving forward. We are moving it forward as well. We have had an open debate on the bill, and we have allowed amendments to the bill. Imagine that. We are actually debating legislation on the floor of the Senate, and Senators are actually offering amendments to that bill. We are all familiar with the milestone the Senate reached last week. Last year, under the Democratic leadership, there were a total of 15 up-or-down votes on amendments--15 for the entire year under Harry Reid. That is all the Democratic leader allowed. But by the end of the day last Thursday, we completed our 25th amendment vote. Just 22 days into the year, the Senate had already been more productive on amendments than it was on 365 days under Democratic leadership. We didn't stop there. Today the Senate will vote on up to 18 more amendments to the Keystone jobs bill and then another 12 after that. Several Democratic Senators complained the other day about what they said was a lack of amendment votes on this bill. Well, where were they last year when the Democratic leader allowed only 15 votes to get an up-or-down vote on an amendment for an entire year? [[Page S552]] Senator Schatz and Senator Markey, two Democrats, had never had a vote on one of their amendments in the Senate before Republicans gave them a vote last week. Senator Coons will get his first vote on an amendment today. All of these amendments aren't the only way again the Senate is working for the American people. Another is going to happen on Thursday. The Energy and Natural Resources Committee is going to hold a hearing on a bill that I introduced earlier this month. We have four Republican sponsors on that bill and four Democratic sponsors: Senators Heinrich, Bennet, Heitkamp, and Kaine. It is the LNG Permitting Certainty and Transparency Act. Now Senator Toomey, a Republican, was added as cosponsor, and Senator Udall, a Democrat, was added as cosponsor. So there are five Republican and five Democratic cosponsors. This is an idea that the House considered last year, and it passed with bipartisan support. Forty-six Democrats voted in favor of increasing America's exports of liquefied natural gas. The House is expected to vote again and pass a bill like this one this week. This is an idea that has bipartisan support in the Senate as well. So it should be a no-brainer. Plans to send American energy overseas are wrapped up in Washington redtape, and Americans who are eager for the jobs on these projects continue to wait. This bipartisan bill will do a lot to fix that problem. It would set clear deadlines for Washington to make timely decisions on these import permits--export permits, important permits to export liquefied natural gas. Once there has been an agreement and an appropriate environmental review, the Secretary of Energy will have only 45 days to act on a permit application. Increasing American natural gas exports would do three important things. No. 1, it would create jobs. That is, of course, most important. These are American jobs, jobs for Americans. The private sector wants to create these jobs--not government jobs but private sector jobs. No. 2, it would help to reduce our Nation's trade deficit. The trade deficit currently stands at $39 billion. No. 3, these exports would support our American allies. Last year Russia invaded Ukraine and seized control of Crimea. Why? Largely because of the natural gas facilities there. There was a group of Senators who were actually in Ukraine. I was one of them the day the Russian helicopters landed just north of the gas plants there. This was about the gas. Well, we could help reduce the threat Russia poses to Europe by offering more options for our allies to buy American natural gas. There is no good reason for the endless delays on these export permits. Our bill would speed up the process. These export projects are job creators with bipartisan support. They have been stuck in Washington's bureaucrat gridlock. The Senate is going to be acting to get these projects moving. That is why the American people sent us to the Senate. It is how the Senate is supposed to work. Committees consider the ideas on both sides, the bills get debated in committee and on the floor, and every Senator has a chance to talk about it and then to offer amendments that might improve legislation. That is how it has always worked before. It is a slow process. It was meant to produce consensus. The majority leader, Harry Reid, changed all of that. The Democratic majority leader did everything he could to block amendments and to bypass and to skip committees. Did he do it to make better laws? No, not at all. Did he do it to speed up action so the Senate could be more productive? Of course not. It was a transparent campaign tactic to keep vulnerable Democratic Senators from having to take tough votes. Even Democrats couldn't get votes on their amendments. Well, that gimmick by Harry Reid--the campaign tricks--failed, and the American people were not fooled. That is one of the reasons voters across the country chose Republicans to lead both Houses of Congress. The American people said they deserve better, and the American people are absolutely right. The American people want Democrats to start working with Republicans to get things done. That is what Senator Heinrich and I--and others who are cosponsoring this measure today--are doing with our bill. The American people want an honest debate on important issues such as the Keystone jobs bill, as well. The American people want their representatives in the Senate to be able to offer amendments to bills such as this one. That is how the Senate should work. That is how the Senate is working under Republican leadership, and that is how it is going to continue to work. So I am pleased to see the votes are going to be held on these amendments. I am pleased to stand and cast my vote on behalf of the people of Wyoming. I look forward to more votes, more debate, and more consideration of ideas from both sides of the aisle. It is interesting that President Obama has threatened to veto eight separate pieces of legislation so far this year. It is interesting to the point that it has a headline in today's USA Today, page 2A: ``Obama veto threats are at record high.'' Veto threats are at a record high. The President has said he will veto another two bills that haven't even been introduced yet. If they haven't even been introduced, how does he know what they are going to say? How does he know what they are going to say once they go through the process of being amended, passed in the House, passed in the Senate, and get to his desk? The President should reconsider each and every one of these veto threats. The Senate is moving forward. The White House is putting up roadblocks. That is not what the American people were asking for in November. The American people want us to work together to get things done, to make their lives better. It is about them. It is not about the people who sit in this body, it is about the American people--their quality of life, people living paycheck to paycheck, day to day, what their lives are about. The Republican Congress and this Senate continue to listen to the American people. The President of the United States continues to ignore them. I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cotton). The clerk will call the roll. The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. MORAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 14 (Wednesday, January 28, 2015)] [Senate] [Pages S551-S552] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] WORKING FOR THE AMERICAN PEOPLE Mr. BARRASSO.

The private sector wants to create these jobs--not government jobs but private sector jobs. No. 2, it would help to reduce our Nation's trade deficit. The trade deficit currently stands at $39 billion. No. 3, these exports would support our American allies. Last year Russia invaded Ukraine and seized control of Crimea. Why? Largely because of the natural gas facilities there. There was a group of Senators who were actually in Ukraine. I was one of them the day the Russian helicopters landed just north of the gas plants there. This was about the gas. Well, we could help reduce the threat Russia poses to Europe by offering more options for our allies to buy American natural gas. There is no good reason for the endless delays on these export permits. Our bill would speed up the process. These export projects are job creators with bipartisan support. They have been stuck in Washington's bureaucrat gridlock. The Senate is going to be acting to get these projects moving. That is why the American people sent us to the Senate. It is how the Senate is supposed to work. Committees consider the ideas on both sides, the bills get debated in committee and on the floor, and every Senator has a chance to talk about it and then to offer amendments that might improve legislation. That is how it has always worked before. It is a slow process. It was meant to produce consensus. The majority leader, Harry Reid, changed all of that. The Democratic majority leader did everything he could to block amendments and to bypass and to skip committees. Did he do it to make better laws? No, not at all. Did he do it to speed up action so the Senate could be more productive? Of course not. It was a transparent campaign tactic to keep vulnerable Democratic Senators from having to take tough votes. Even Democrats couldn't get votes on their amendments. Well, that gimmick by Harry Reid--the campaign tricks--failed, and the American people were not fooled. That is one of the reasons voters across the country chose Republicans to lead both Houses of Congress. The American people said they deserve better, and the American people are absolutely right. The American people want Democrats to start working with Republicans to get things done. That is what Senator Heinrich and I--and others who are cosponsoring this measure today--are doing with our bill. The American people want an honest debate on important issues such as the Keystone jobs bill, as well. The American people want their representatives in the Senate to be able to offer amendments to bills such as this one. That is how the Senate should work. That is how the Senate is working under Republican leadership, and that is how it is going to continue to work. So I am pleased to see the votes are going to be held on these amendments. I am pleased to stand and cast my vote on behalf of the people of Wyoming. I look forward to more votes, more debate, and more consideration of ideas from both sides of the aisle. It is interesting that President Obama has threatened to veto eight separate pieces of legislation so far this year. It is interesting to the point that it has a headline in today's USA Today, page 2A: ``Obama veto threats are at record high.'' Veto threats are at a record high. The President has said he will veto another two bills that haven't even been introduced yet. If they haven't even been introduced, how does he know what they are going to say? How does he know what they are going to say once they go through the process of being amended, passed in the House, passed in the Senate, and get to his desk? The President should reconsider each and every one of these veto threats. The Senate is moving forward. The White House is putting up roadblocks. That is not what the American people were asking for in November. The American people want us to work together to get things done, to make their lives better. It is about them. It is not about the people who sit in this body, it is about the American people--their quality of life, people living paycheck to paycheck, day to day, what their lives are about. The Republican Congress and this Senate continue to listen to the American people. The President of the United States continues to ignore them. I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cotton). The clerk will call the roll. The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. MORAN.

Mr. President, last November the American people sent an unmistakable message to Washington, DC. Voters across the country said they were tired of the gridlock and they were tired of the lack of action by the Democratic-led Senate. Well, we are now working again for the American people because voters said it was time for a new majority--the Republican majority--to get the Senate working again and to get America on a better course. Republicans heard the message. We heard it loud and clear, and we have been doing exactly what the American people have sent us here to do. Under Republican leadership the Senate is working again for the American people, and the best example of that is the bill we are considering now in the Senate on the Keystone XL Pipeline project. The Obama administration has blocked and delayed this job-creating project for 6 years. Now Republicans are moving forward. We are moving it forward as well. We have had an open debate on the bill, and we have allowed amendments to the bill. Imagine that. We are actually debating legislation on the floor of the Senate, and Senators are actually offering amendments to that bill. We are all familiar with the milestone the Senate reached last week. Last year, under the Democratic leadership, there were a total of 15 up-or-down votes on amendments--15 for the entire year under Harry Reid. That is all the Democratic leader allowed. But by the end of the day last Thursday, we completed our 25th amendment vote. Just 22 days into the year, the Senate had already been more productive on amendments than it was on 365 days under Democratic leadership. We didn't stop there. Today the Senate will vote on up to 18 more amendments to the Keystone jobs bill and then another 12 after that. Several Democratic Senators complained the other day about what they said was a lack of amendment votes on this bill. Well, where were they last year when the Democratic leader allowed only 15 votes to get an up-or-down vote on an amendment for an entire year? [[Page S552]] Senator Schatz and Senator Markey, two Democrats, had never had a vote on one of their amendments in the Senate before Republicans gave them a vote last week. Senator Coons will get his first vote on an amendment today. All of these amendments aren't the only way again the Senate is working for the American people. Another is going to happen on Thursday. The Energy and Natural Resources Committee is going to hold a hearing on a bill that I introduced earlier this month. We have four Republican sponsors on that bill and four Democratic sponsors: Senators Heinrich, Bennet, Heitkamp, and Kaine. It is the LNG Permitting Certainty and Transparency Act. Now Senator Toomey, a Republican, was added as cosponsor, and Senator Udall, a Democrat, was added as cosponsor. So there are five Republican and five Democratic cosponsors. This is an idea that the House considered last year, and it passed with bipartisan support. Forty-six Democrats voted in favor of increasing America's exports of liquefied natural gas. The House is expected to vote again and pass a bill like this one this week. This is an idea that has bipartisan support in the Senate as well. So it should be a no-brainer. Plans to send American energy overseas are wrapped up in Washington redtape, and Americans who are eager for the jobs on these projects continue to wait. This bipartisan bill will do a lot to fix that problem. It would set clear deadlines for Washington to make timely decisions on these import permits--export permits, important permits to export liquefied natural gas. Once there has been an agreement and an appropriate environmental review, the Secretary of Energy will have only 45 days to act on a permit application. Increasing American natural gas exports would do three important things. No. 1, it would create jobs. That is, of course, most important. These are American jobs, jobs for Americans.

CREC-2015-01-28-pt1-PgS552,CREC-2015-01-28,114,FAIR TAX ACT,"[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 14 (Wednesday, January 28, 2015)] [Senate] [Pages S552-S553] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] FAIR TAX ACT Mr. MORAN. Mr. President, we have had a lot of talk--certainly in the last year or so and certainly as this new session of Congress begins-- on the importance of tax reform. Our country is at a point in time where we certainly are no longer competitive globally. The economy now is one that works against us because of our Tax Code. I think there is general consensus in the Senate that reforming the Tax Code is of significant importance, something that must be done. I am often asked not only when I am back in Kansas but here in Washington, DC: Do you expect there to be broad-based tax reform? And we keep guessing about the likelihood of that happening. I think it is typical of elected officials, politicians, to always talk about the need for comprehensive tax reform. We talk about lowering rates, making the tax system more fair, less bureaucratic, less paperwork. I certainly join in those sentiments and believe that the current circumstance we have in regard to our Tax Code is such that it limits the freedom of Americans--American business men and women, individuals, and their families. We make way too many decisions based upon the consequences of those decisions and how they are affected by the Tax Code. So I am all on board on tax reform, but I wish to talk about what I believe is the best solution toward tax reform. And it is not tinkering with the current system; it is an overhaul of the current Tax Code. I have joined my colleague from Georgia, Senator Perdue, in once again introducing the fair tax plan. I started a long time ago in Congress, knowing that we needed to make significant changes in our Tax Code, with [[Page S553]] the belief that most Americans ought to be able to file a tax return without the need of professional help, that we ought to be able to make decisions that are in the best interests of ourselves, our families, and our businesses without always going to the Tax Code to see what the consequences of those decisions were. I looked at a variety of proposals that were being considered at the time and continue to be considered today and ultimately reached the conclusion that the Fair Tax is the best option for significant reform. I wish to speak for just a minute about why I think that is the case. As I said, Senator Perdue and I introduced S. 25, the Fair Tax Act of 2015. I have been a cosponsor of that legislation. It was originally introduced in the Senate by the former Senator from Georgia, Mr. Saxby Chambliss, and I am pleased to now succeed him in his efforts to see that not only is this topic discussed in Congress but ultimately that the Fair Tax Act becomes law. It is a significant step in the direction of individual freedom. I would highlight for my colleagues--and I have said this on the Senate floor before--I think the greatest responsibility we have as American citizens is to pass on to the next generation of Americans the freedoms and liberties guaranteed by our Constitution and the opportunity for every American to live the American dream. The Fair Tax, in my view, brings both of those goals front and center. Greater freedom and protection of individual liberties is certainly a component of the Fair Tax, and the opportunity for every American to pursue the American dream is a result that comes from the Fair Tax. It is that Fair Tax direction and individual freedom that caught my attention. It is the concept our Founding Fathers knew so well. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired. Mr. MORAN. I ask unanimous consent for additional time. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. MORAN. Mr. President, the Fair Tax repeals all Federal, corporate, and individual taxes, payroll taxes, capital gains taxes, and estate and gift taxes and replaces them with a revenue-neutral personal consumption tax. The Fair Tax allows Americans to keep the entirety of their income, putting individuals in charge of their own finances, not the government--or, more specifically, not the Internal Revenue Service. All Americans should be able to trust the IRS, which exercises great authority over the lives of Americans in this country, but we know from past experiences that expectation is no longer founded. So getting rid of the Internal Revenue Service is a significant benefit that comes from the passage of the Fair Tax. I recognize that consumption taxes can be regressive, meaning they are harmful to those at lower income levels. So the Fair Tax takes that into account by providing a pre-rebate for those who fall below certain poverty income levels so that the basics--the things we by necessity need to by in our individual daily lives--are not covered by a tax, therefore creating greater progressivity to what otherwise would be a more regressive tax and something that I think is still important in this country to make certain we don't overtax those at the lowest income levels in the United States. Certainly, our current Tax Code has significant complexities with all the paperwork. By some estimates, U.S. companies are currently holding over $20 trillion overseas. With the passage of the Fair Tax, foreign investments would no longer continue to sit on the sidelines when they could be brought back to America to drive economic growth and create jobs. For international businesses looking to relocate to the United States, the Fair Tax would be a welcomed sign. But the Fair Tax also benefits the consumer. It also benefits the everyday citizen, as I said, because of the pre-rebate. With my time being short, I look forward to having a dialogue on the Senate floor and in the committees over the next few months, and I ask my colleagues to seriously take a look at S. 25 and to join the Senator from Georgia, Mr. Perdue, and me and others in promotion of a program that reduces the complexity of the Tax Code in our lives, rids us of the Internal Revenue Service, protects the progressivity of the tax circumstance we find today, and most importantly, allows us to continue to pursue the American dream and promotes our individual freedoms and liberties. The Fair Tax is worthy of people's consideration. It ought to be more than just a talking point. It deserves a debate, a discussion, a vote, and consideration by the Senate. Mr. President, I yield back the remainder of my time, and I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 14 (Wednesday, January 28, 2015)] [Senate] [Pages S552-S553] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] FAIR TAX ACT Mr. MORAN.

I am often asked not only when I am back in Kansas but here in Washington, DC: Do you expect there to be broad-based tax reform? And we keep guessing about the likelihood of that happening. I think it is typical of elected officials, politicians, to always talk about the need for comprehensive tax reform. We talk about lowering rates, making the tax system more fair, less bureaucratic, less paperwork. I certainly join in those sentiments and believe that the current circumstance we have in regard to our Tax Code is such that it limits the freedom of Americans--American business men and women, individuals, and their families. We make way too many decisions based upon the consequences of those decisions and how they are affected by the Tax Code. So I am all on board on tax reform, but I wish to talk about what I believe is the best solution toward tax reform. And it is not tinkering with the current system; it is an overhaul of the current Tax Code. I have joined my colleague from Georgia, Senator Perdue, in once again introducing the fair tax plan. I started a long time ago in Congress, knowing that we needed to make significant changes in our Tax Code, with [[Page S553]] the belief that most Americans ought to be able to file a tax return without the need of professional help, that we ought to be able to make decisions that are in the best interests of ourselves, our families, and our businesses without always going to the Tax Code to see what the consequences of those decisions were. I looked at a variety of proposals that were being considered at the time and continue to be considered today and ultimately reached the conclusion that the Fair Tax is the best option for significant reform. I wish to speak for just a minute about why I think that is the case. As I said, Senator Perdue and I introduced S. 25, the Fair Tax Act of 2015. I have been a cosponsor of that legislation. It was originally introduced in the Senate by the former Senator from Georgia, Mr. Saxby Chambliss, and I am pleased to now succeed him in his efforts to see that not only is this topic discussed in Congress but ultimately that the Fair Tax Act becomes law. It is a significant step in the direction of individual freedom. I would highlight for my colleagues--and I have said this on the Senate floor before--I think the greatest responsibility we have as American citizens is to pass on to the next generation of Americans the freedoms and liberties guaranteed by our Constitution and the opportunity for every American to live the American dream. The Fair Tax, in my view, brings both of those goals front and center. Greater freedom and protection of individual liberties is certainly a component of the Fair Tax, and the opportunity for every American to pursue the American dream is a result that comes from the Fair Tax. It is that Fair Tax direction and individual freedom that caught my attention. It is the concept our Founding Fathers knew so well. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired. Mr. MORAN. I ask unanimous consent for additional time. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. MORAN. Mr. President, the Fair Tax repeals all Federal, corporate, and individual taxes, payroll taxes, capital gains taxes, and estate and gift taxes and replaces them with a revenue-neutral personal consumption tax. The Fair Tax allows Americans to keep the entirety of their income, putting individuals in charge of their own finances, not the government--or, more specifically, not the Internal Revenue Service. All Americans should be able to trust the IRS, which exercises great authority over the lives of Americans in this country, but we know from past experiences that expectation is no longer founded. So getting rid of the Internal Revenue Service is a significant benefit that comes from the passage of the Fair Tax. I recognize that consumption taxes can be regressive, meaning they are harmful to those at lower income levels. So the Fair Tax takes that into account by providing a pre-rebate for those who fall below certain poverty income levels so that the basics--the things we by necessity need to by in our individual daily lives--are not covered by a tax, therefore creating greater progressivity to what otherwise would be a more regressive tax and something that I think is still important in this country to make certain we don't overtax those at the lowest income levels in the United States. Certainly, our current Tax Code has significant complexities with all the paperwork. By some estimates, U.S. companies are currently holding over $20 trillion overseas. With the passage of the Fair Tax, foreign investments would no longer continue to sit on the sidelines when they could be brought back to America to drive economic growth and create jobs. For international businesses looking to relocate to the United States, the Fair Tax would be a welcomed sign. But the Fair Tax also benefits the consumer. It also benefits the everyday citizen, as I said, because of the pre-rebate. With my time being short, I look forward to having a dialogue on the Senate floor and in the committees over the next few months, and I ask my colleagues to seriously take a look at S. 25 and to join the Senator from Georgia, Mr. Perdue, and me and others in promotion of a program that reduces the complexity of the Tax Code in our lives, rids us of the Internal Revenue Service, protects the progressivity of the tax circumstance we find today, and most importantly, allows us to continue to pursue the American dream and promotes our individual freedoms and liberties. The Fair Tax is worthy of people's consideration. It ought to be more than just a talking point. It deserves a debate, a discussion, a vote, and consideration by the Senate. Mr. President, I yield back the remainder of my time, and I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER.

CREC-2015-01-28-pt1-PgS553,CREC-2015-01-28,114,DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY FUNDING,"[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 14 (Wednesday, January 28, 2015)] [Senate] [Pages S553-S555] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY FUNDING Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Mr. President, I am very pleased to be here today to speak to my colleagues about funding for the Department of Homeland Security and to be followed by one of my most valued colleagues, Senator Menendez, whose leadership on this issue has been extraordinarily important. I am also pleased to work with him on a letter he sent yesterday to the President concerning Iran sanctions, where his statesmanship-like path to a reasonable solution on this very complex and crucial issue will be enormously important to the future. The Department of Homeland Security is one of the most significant departments in the U.S. Government. It has a mandate that is as complex and crucial as any in keeping American citizens and communities and capabilities safe and secure in a dangerous, complex, and threatening world. In my family, when I was growing up, we had a saying: Don't cut off your nose to spite your face. Unfortunately, that path is exactly what some of my colleagues are choosing to follow in threatening to stop funding for the Department of Homeland Security. We are reminded of the importance of this Department not only as terrorism raises its ugly head repeatedly abroad but also as perhaps more benign threats exist at home--the most recent of them, the snowstorm that hit the Northeast within the past couple of days. The Department of Homeland Security is not only engaged in a fight against terrorism, not only engaged in keeping America safe from threats abroad but is engaged in a wide variety of other tasks that have to do with the Nation's security. That is the key word in its title--``security.'' Americans fear more deeply than ever before that their security is threatened--economic security by stagnating incomes, foreign security as the world becomes more volatile and unpredictable and more threatening, and domestic security as threats abroad metastasize within our own borders. Many people equate the concept of security at home or homeland security with protection against extreme violence from abroad, violent extremism spawning from abroad and in fact stopping those threats. Finding the wrongdoers and stopping them is one of the major tasks the Department of Homeland Security has, but it has a myriad of additional responsibilities that include aiding the victims of natural disasters and extreme weather, citizenship and immigration, routinely handling matters that involve legitimate applications for visas for entry into the United States, and it fights the scourge of human trafficking. I am privileged to have a Caucus on Human Trafficking with my colleague Senator Rob Portman. So I know it forms a diverse collection of responsibilities that are crucial to security. In fact, the Department of Homeland Security's responsibilities are comprehensive--so much so that it is simply unacceptable to play politics with its crucial mission. It is irresponsible to hold its funding hostage in a dangerous game of fiscal chicken and threaten daily activities that are vital to America's present and future security. [[Page S554]] That is why we are here, because some of my friends across the aisle believe stopping the President from exercising discretion on certain immigration issues affecting specific individuals in this country is worth hamstringing and undercutting the entire Department of Homeland Security and forcing an enormous amount of its vital work to grind to a halt. That is the game of chicken we have. The President is expected to relent if the Department of Homeland Security is stopped from functioning, but it is a game that has no place in this Chamber or in this government. We can agree or disagree with the President, and I disagree with the Department of Homeland Security on certain of its policies; for example, on detaining children which it has done routinely on a grandiose scale. I have included an amendment in the measure for immigration reform that passed the Senate. It would stop it from detaining children--a practice I consider shameful and unacceptable-- and I have a long list of other changes I would like to see made in DHS policies. But the way to effectuate those changes in my view is not to withhold funding to stop DHS in its tracks of providing security for the American people, it is to amend the laws to persuade our colleagues to undertake the legislative process and to appeal ultimately to the court of public opinion which can render a verdict far more powerful than the tactics involved here. Chipping away at the President's authority by not only undercutting him but stopping one of his departments is reprehensible. So I urge my colleagues to cease this tactic. The President needs discretion. In fact, I know as a prosecutor, as a former attorney general, and as a one-time U.S. attorney for Connecticut that discretion is essential. There is no way any authority can prosecute every crime. So prosecutors need to select cases based on severity of offense and most important the danger to the public because ultimately protecting the public is what security requires. That is true as well for the Department of Homeland Security. The President has exercised his discretion in a way I find laudable. The exigencies of the present immigration system require the exercise of discretion. The President has done it in a way that is responsible and upholds his duties as Commander in Chief. But even if I disagree with the President on that exercise of discretion with respect to immigration, I would never use this tactic of withholding funding for an entire department, affecting all of its activities and implicating and undercutting security in so dangerous a way. My hope is we will debate immigration policy, that we will approve an immigration reform bill, that it will be on a bipartisan basis just as it was during the last session, that there will be a lot of good-faith disagreement on the floor of this Chamber about those policies and about the President's actions but that we will keep the lights on at the Department of Homeland Security, that we will shine the light on threats to our security that need to be exposed and pursued, that we will further the security of this Nation and protect the public by making sure the DHS funding as a clean bill is approved right away and that we move forward to make sure DHS continues its vital service to the American people. Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, as we approach the near end--I think--of the votes and legislation on the Keystone Pipeline--I know we are having a series of votes later today--I know what is likely to be next up is the question of Department of Homeland Security funding. I hope we can come collectively together to fund the Department of Homeland Security, the Department that keeps us safe in an unsafe world, the Department we created after September 11 to bring together disparate government agencies, all charged with keeping our cities, our ports, our airports, our railways, highways, bridges, and neighborhoods safe from the threat of global terrorism. I particularly understand that as a Member of this body who represents, according to the FBI, the most dangerous 2 miles in America, the chemical coastway, airports, seaports along the Hudson waterfront. This is the Department that funds emergency management in our communities. It protects the President. It is engaged in all domestic counterterrorism efforts. But what are we doing instead? We are being asked, as one of the new Republican majority's first acts of this Congress, to shut down the Department of Homeland Security. Why? Because some of our friends on the other side are willing to take a gamble and put politics ahead of national security, a thinly veiled political stunt in response to the lawful actions of the President of the United States to do something to fix our broken immigration system. Their message is pretty simple: repeal the President's lawful Executive actions on immigration or shut down the Department of Homeland Security. Make no mistake, that is the textbook definition of pure politics: not caring what its impact might be, not caring whom it might hurt, not caring about the families whom it will tear apart, and the fact that it will put our Nation's security at risk. I have been in this Chamber and in the other Chamber for over 20 years, and I don't think I have ever seen such a cavalier political recklessness played with our national security. Why? To prevent the President from taking lawful action to help DREAMers and immigrant families to come out of the shadows after they pass a criminal background check, register with the government, and get right with the law in exchange for being allowed to temporarily stay in the country and obtain a work permit. The bottom line is clear: Republicans are doing all of this just to prevent a clean Department of Homeland Security funding bill from being sent to the President, a critical funding bill that the President has rightfully promised to veto should it include their anti-immigration amendments, a veto which Congress will not override. It is a fool's political errand that is neither good policy nor particularly humane. Our friends on the other side have accepted these anti-immigrant poison pill amendments, knowing full well they will sink the Department of Homeland Security funding bill because they have allowed extremists, such as Steve King, to dictate the party's strategy on immigration. Let's not continuously go down this dark path of partisanship instead of funding national security programs to keep our families and our communities safe. In my view it is shamefully and woefully irresponsible for Republicans to hold up funding for operations that protect every American against terrorism in the wake of what happened in France and against cyber attacks at a time when North Korea just carried out a dramatic attack against a major American corporation. This is not a time to hold up funding to help the Department of Homeland Security investigate cyber crime that could cripple America's electronic infrastructure or when the world is a tinderbox of jihadists and would-be homegrown terrorists willing to die for a perceived version of Islam. If Republican colleagues want to seriously consider this ill- conceived approach, they will be forcing a shutdown of the Department of Homeland Security--a shutdown of our national security infrastructure to pursue their agenda of mass deportations that will tear families apart, an agenda that embraces a system that doesn't distinguish between deporting a working mother with U.S. citizen children and a convicted felon. Instead, I urge my friends on the other side to join us and pass a balanced and comprehensive bill. Let's talk. Let's sit down again and find common ground, as we did in the last Congress where this Senate came together on a bipartisan basis with over 67 votes to send a bill to the House of Representatives that dealt with our broken immigration system, provided for our national security, promoted our national economy, and at the same time made sure our legacy and history as a nation of immigrants was preserved. The answer is not holding up national security funding at a critical time, not turning our backs on the [[Page S555]] hard-working men and women at the Department of Homeland Security in law enforcement who are protecting our borders, our airports, and our coastlines. It is not about trying to score political points by conflating national security and immigration reform, which will only make it harder to address security issues at home and almost impossible to move forward on comprehensive immigration reform. Let's look at what my Republican colleagues are so opposed to. They are opposed to new DHS directives that include a rigorous application process that will ironically help eliminate national security threats. They seem to be opposed to the fact that applicants will have to come forward and register with the government. They will have to pass criminal background checks before they can receive a temporary reprieve from deportation and a work permit. No violent criminals, gang members, or terrorists will be able to take advantage of the program. They seem to be opposed to allowing immigrants who are not a public safety or national security threat to come forward and request deferred action, meaning there will be fewer people living in the shadows, beyond the reach of law enforcement. These directives identify moms and dads who have a U.S. citizen or a legal permanent resident son or daughter and take them out of the deportation queue. They also take DREAMers out of the deportation queue. The House amendment to the Department of Homeland Security funding bill would effectively end the new Deferred Action for Parental Accountability Program and the expanded DACA Program for DREAMers. They would also defund every other aspect of the President's November 20 Executive action that would promote border security, public safety, military service, legal immigration, citizenship, immigration integration, entrepreneurship, civil immigration enforcement priorities, including the prioritization of individuals with convicted felonies and gang activity and terrorist ties for deportation. I will repeat that. It includes a prioritization. I would think the Senate would want to support a prioritization of individuals who are here illegally and are convicted felons and part of gang activities or who have terrorist ties for deportation and any future similar Executive actions. The only directive our Republican colleagues found acceptable, which is interesting--in my mind, you say: Well, none of it can happen by Executive action. But it seems that the only thing that did happen by Executive action that our colleagues found acceptable pertains to pay increases for Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers, which I believe they certainly deserve. These amendments would break apart more families and destroy communities by ensuring that we continue to deport the parents of U.S. citizen and lawful permanent resident children. One of the most mean- spirited amendments would prohibit the use of Federal funds or resources to consider or adjudicate any new, renewed, or previously denied application for deferred action for childhood arrivals. Let's call this amendment what it is: It is an amendment to deport DREAMers and targets all of those young people who came forward and signed up in good faith. I will give an example of whom these amendments attack. I wish to remind my colleagues of who the DREAMers are. DREAMers are young people who came to this country through no choice of their own. The only flag they have ever pledged allegiance to is that of the United States of America. The only national anthem they know is the ``Star-Spangled Banner.'' Their country is this country. I was fortunate to speak with people like the Morales-Cano family 2 weeks ago in New Jersey. They are a family of six, including 13-year- old, U.S.-born Rebecca Morales. Their lives have drastically improved thanks to the program Republicans are hoping to dismantle. If the Republicans are successful, Rebecca would be left alone in the United States without her parents or sisters--an American citizen left alone, perhaps in foster care, because Republicans don't care about prioritizing the deportation of convicted criminals over her mom, dad, and sisters. The story of the Morales-Cano family is a clear example of thousands of deep-rooted families who have waited too long in the shadows for immigration reform. Three years ago, after attending a deferred action for childhood arrivals workshop that my office organized in New Jersey, all three of Rebecca's older sisters--Ingrid, Evelyn, and Lesly--were given an opportunity to begin a new chapter of their lives after qualifying for the President's 2012 Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals Program, joining thousands of others who had been granted relief. Today, look at what this family is doing Ingrid cares for New Jerseyans' health at her job at the Ocean Medical Center. Evelyn moved to Illinois to attend the West Coast Bible College and Seminary. Lesly was able to enroll in Brookdale Community College to pursue her dream of becoming a nurse. Ingrid, Evelyn, and Lesly represent the hundreds of thousands of young individuals who, because of the deferred action for childhood arrivals, can actively contribute to our economy without fear of losing everything they have worked to gain. Romeo Morales and Mrs. Magda Cano de Morales did not qualify for deportation deferrals under DACA and have continued to live with the constant fear of having their family abruptly separated. But thanks to the deferred action for parents program, recently announced by President Obama, both parents will likely qualify to come out of the shadows, register with the government, pass a background check, and join their daughters in their pursuit of the American dream--unless, of course, the Republicans get their way. We cannot let that happen, and I will do everything to ensure that we will not let that happen. These are the real faces of our broken immigration system. There are many families like the Morales-Cano family who have been and remain an economic resource we cannot afford to waste. They are hard-working families who simply want to be full participants in American life, full contributors to the American family, and they want to remain united as a family. We should want them to remain united. I have listened to so many speeches here about family values. Well, the core of a family value is a family being able to stay together, integrated and helping each other and driving each other to success and supporting each other. Ripping families apart is not a family value. We must see through the smoke and mirrors and do what is right for America. Let's stop playing political games. Let's defeat these poison- pill amendments and pass a clean Department of Homeland Security funding bill. Let's not play politics with national security. Let's remember the people behind the policies. Let's remember the Morales- Cano family and the fate of Rebecca if we allow these amendments to pass. With that, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll. Ms. MURKOWSKI. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 14 (Wednesday, January 28, 2015)] [Senate] [Pages S553-S555] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY FUNDING Mr. BLUMENTHAL.

The President needs discretion. In fact, I know as a prosecutor, as a former attorney general, and as a one-time U.S. attorney for Connecticut that discretion is essential. There is no way any authority can prosecute every crime. So prosecutors need to select cases based on severity of offense and most important the danger to the public because ultimately protecting the public is what security requires. That is true as well for the Department of Homeland Security. The President has exercised his discretion in a way I find laudable. The exigencies of the present immigration system require the exercise of discretion. The President has done it in a way that is responsible and upholds his duties as Commander in Chief. But even if I disagree with the President on that exercise of discretion with respect to immigration, I would never use this tactic of withholding funding for an entire department, affecting all of its activities and implicating and undercutting security in so dangerous a way. My hope is we will debate immigration policy, that we will approve an immigration reform bill, that it will be on a bipartisan basis just as it was during the last session, that there will be a lot of good-faith disagreement on the floor of this Chamber about those policies and about the President's actions but that we will keep the lights on at the Department of Homeland Security, that we will shine the light on threats to our security that need to be exposed and pursued, that we will further the security of this Nation and protect the public by making sure the DHS funding as a clean bill is approved right away and that we move forward to make sure DHS continues its vital service to the American people. Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, as we approach the near end--I think--of the votes and legislation on the Keystone Pipeline--I know we are having a series of votes later today--I know what is likely to be next up is the question of Department of Homeland Security funding. I hope we can come collectively together to fund the Department of Homeland Security, the Department that keeps us safe in an unsafe world, the Department we created after September 11 to bring together disparate government agencies, all charged with keeping our cities, our ports, our airports, our railways, highways, bridges, and neighborhoods safe from the threat of global terrorism. I particularly understand that as a Member of this body who represents, according to the FBI, the most dangerous 2 miles in America, the chemical coastway, airports, seaports along the Hudson waterfront. This is the Department that funds emergency management in our communities. It protects the President. It is engaged in all domestic counterterrorism efforts. But what are we doing instead? We are being asked, as one of the new Republican majority's first acts of this Congress, to shut down the Department of Homeland Security. Why? Because some of our friends on the other side are willing to take a gamble and put politics ahead of national security, a thinly veiled political stunt in response to the lawful actions of the President of the United States to do something to fix our broken immigration system. Their message is pretty simple: repeal the President's lawful Executive actions on immigration or shut down the Department of Homeland Security. Make no mistake, that is the textbook definition of pure politics: not caring what its impact might be, not caring whom it might hurt, not caring about the families whom it will tear apart, and the fact that it will put our Nation's security at risk. I have been in this Chamber and in the other Chamber for over 20 years, and I don't think I have ever seen such a cavalier political recklessness played with our national security. Why? To prevent the President from taking lawful action to help DREAMers and immigrant families to come out of the shadows after they pass a criminal background check, register with the government, and get right with the law in exchange for being allowed to temporarily stay in the country and obtain a work permit. The bottom line is clear: Republicans are doing all of this just to prevent a clean Department of Homeland Security funding bill from being sent to the President, a critical funding bill that the President has rightfully promised to veto should it include their anti-immigration amendments, a veto which Congress will not override. It is a fool's political errand that is neither good policy nor particularly humane. Our friends on the other side have accepted these anti-immigrant poison pill amendments, knowing full well they will sink the Department of Homeland Security funding bill because they have allowed extremists, such as Steve King, to dictate the party's strategy on immigration. Let's not continuously go down this dark path of partisanship instead of funding national security programs to keep our families and our communities safe. In my view it is shamefully and woefully irresponsible for Republicans to hold up funding for operations that protect every American against terrorism in the wake of what happened in France and against cyber attacks at a time when North Korea just carried out a dramatic attack against a major American corporation. This is not a time to hold up funding to help the Department of Homeland Security investigate cyber crime that could cripple America's electronic infrastructure or when the world is a tinderbox of jihadists and would-be homegrown terrorists willing to die for a perceived version of Islam. If Republican colleagues want to seriously consider this ill- conceived approach, they will be forcing a shutdown of the Department of Homeland Security--a shutdown of our national security infrastructure to pursue their agenda of mass deportations that will tear families apart, an agenda that embraces a system that doesn't distinguish between deporting a working mother with U.S. citizen children and a convicted felon. Instead, I urge my friends on the other side to join us and pass a balanced and comprehensive bill. Let's talk. Let's sit down again and find common ground, as we did in the last Congress where this Senate came together on a bipartisan basis with over 67 votes to send a bill to the House of Representatives that dealt with our broken immigration system, provided for our national security, promoted our national economy, and at the same time made sure our legacy and history as a nation of immigrants was preserved. The answer is not holding up national security funding at a critical time, not turning our backs on the [[Page S555]] hard-working men and women at the Department of Homeland Security in law enforcement who are protecting our borders, our airports, and our coastlines. It is not about trying to score political points by conflating national security and immigration reform, which will only make it harder to address security issues at home and almost impossible to move forward on comprehensive immigration reform. Let's look at what my Republican colleagues are so opposed to. They are opposed to new DHS directives that include a rigorous application process that will ironically help eliminate national security threats. They seem to be opposed to the fact that applicants will have to come forward and register with the government. They will have to pass criminal background checks before they can receive a temporary reprieve from deportation and a work permit. No violent criminals, gang members, or terrorists will be able to take advantage of the program. They seem to be opposed to allowing immigrants who are not a public safety or national security threat to come forward and request deferred action, meaning there will be fewer people living in the shadows, beyond the reach of law enforcement. These directives identify moms and dads who have a U.S. citizen or a legal permanent resident son or daughter and take them out of the deportation queue. They also take DREAMers out of the deportation queue. The House amendment to the Department of Homeland Security funding bill would effectively end the new Deferred Action for Parental Accountability Program and the expanded DACA Program for DREAMers. They would also defund every other aspect of the President's November 20 Executive action that would promote border security, public safety, military service, legal immigration, citizenship, immigration integration, entrepreneurship, civil immigration enforcement priorities, including the prioritization of individuals with convicted felonies and gang activity and terrorist ties for deportation. I will repeat that. It includes a prioritization. I would think the Senate would want to support a prioritization of individuals who are here illegally and are convicted felons and part of gang activities or who have terrorist ties for deportation and any future similar Executive actions. The only directive our Republican colleagues found acceptable, which is interesting--in my mind, you say: Well, none of it can happen by Executive action. But it seems that the only thing that did happen by Executive action that our colleagues found acceptable pertains to pay increases for Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers, which I believe they certainly deserve. These amendments would break apart more families and destroy communities by ensuring that we continue to deport the parents of U.S. citizen and lawful permanent resident children. One of the most mean- spirited amendments would prohibit the use of Federal funds or resources to consider or adjudicate any new, renewed, or previously denied application for deferred action for childhood arrivals. Let's call this amendment what it is: It is an amendment to deport DREAMers and targets all of those young people who came forward and signed up in good faith. I will give an example of whom these amendments attack. I wish to remind my colleagues of who the DREAMers are. DREAMers are young people who came to this country through no choice of their own. The only flag they have ever pledged allegiance to is that of the United States of America. The only national anthem they know is the ``Star-Spangled Banner.'' Their country is this country. I was fortunate to speak with people like the Morales-Cano family 2 weeks ago in New Jersey. They are a family of six, including 13-year- old, U.S.-born Rebecca Morales. Their lives have drastically improved thanks to the program Republicans are hoping to dismantle. If the Republicans are successful, Rebecca would be left alone in the United States without her parents or sisters--an American citizen left alone, perhaps in foster care, because Republicans don't care about prioritizing the deportation of convicted criminals over her mom, dad, and sisters. The story of the Morales-Cano family is a clear example of thousands of deep-rooted families who have waited too long in the shadows for immigration reform. Three years ago, after attending a deferred action for childhood arrivals workshop that my office organized in New Jersey, all three of Rebecca's older sisters--Ingrid, Evelyn, and Lesly--were given an opportunity to begin a new chapter of their lives after qualifying for the President's 2012 Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals Program, joining thousands of others who had been granted relief. Today, look at what this family is doing Ingrid cares for New Jerseyans' health at her job at the Ocean Medical Center. Evelyn moved to Illinois to attend the West Coast Bible College and Seminary. Lesly was able to enroll in Brookdale Community College to pursue her dream of becoming a nurse. Ingrid, Evelyn, and Lesly represent the hundreds of thousands of young individuals who, because of the deferred action for childhood arrivals, can actively contribute to our economy without fear of losing everything they have worked to gain. Romeo Morales and Mrs. Magda Cano de Morales did not qualify for deportation deferrals under DACA and have continued to live with the constant fear of having their family abruptly separated. But thanks to the deferred action for parents program, recently announced by President Obama, both parents will likely qualify to come out of the shadows, register with the government, pass a background check, and join their daughters in their pursuit of the American dream--unless, of course, the Republicans get their way. We cannot let that happen, and I will do everything to ensure that we will not let that happen. These are the real faces of our broken immigration system. There are many families like the Morales-Cano family who have been and remain an economic resource we cannot afford to waste. They are hard-working families who simply want to be full participants in American life, full contributors to the American family, and they want to remain united as a family. We should want them to remain united. I have listened to so many speeches here about family values. Well, the core of a family value is a family being able to stay together, integrated and helping each other and driving each other to success and supporting each other. Ripping families apart is not a family value. We must see through the smoke and mirrors and do what is right for America. Let's stop playing political games. Let's defeat these poison- pill amendments and pass a clean Department of Homeland Security funding bill. Let's not play politics with national security. Let's remember the people behind the policies. Let's remember the Morales- Cano family and the fate of Rebecca if we allow these amendments to pass. With that, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll. Ms. MURKOWSKI. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. ____________________","Congressional Record, Volume 161 Issue 14 (Wednesday, January 28, 2015) [Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 14 (Wednesday, January 28, 2015)] [Senate] [Pages S553-S555] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY FUNDING Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Mr. President, I am very pleased to be here today to speak to my colleagues about funding for the Department of Homeland Security and to be followed by one of my most valued colleagues, Senator Menendez, whose leadership on this issue has been extraordinarily important. I am also pleased to work with him on a letter he sent yesterday to the President concerning Iran sanctions, where his statesmanship-like path to a reasonable solution on this very complex and crucial issue will be enormously important to the future. The Department of Homeland Security is one of the most significant departments in the U.S. Government. It has a mandate that is as complex and crucial as any in keeping American citizens and communities and capabilities safe and secure in a dangerous, complex, and threatening world. In my family, when I was growing up, we had a saying: Don't cut off your nose to spite your face. Unfortunately, that path is exactly what some of my colleagues are choosing to follow in threatening to stop funding for the Department of Homeland Security. We are reminded of the importance of this Department not only as terrorism raises its ugly head repeatedly abroad but also as perhaps more benign threats exist at home--the most recent of them, the snowstorm that hit the Northeast within the past couple of days. The Department of Homeland Security is not only engaged in a fight against terrorism, not only engaged in keeping America safe from threats abroad but is engaged in a wide variety of other tasks that have to do with the Nation's security. That is the key word in its title--``security.'' Americans fear more deeply than ever before that their security is threatened--economic security by stagnating incomes, foreign security as the world becomes more volatile and unpredictable and more threatening, and domestic security as threats abroad metastasize within our own borders. Many people equate the concept of security at home or homeland security with protection against extreme violence from abroad, violent extremism spawning from abroad and in fact stopping those threats. Finding the wrongdoers and stopping them is one of the major tasks the Department of Homeland Security has, but it has a myriad of additional responsibilities that include aiding the victims of natural disasters and extreme weather, citizenship and immigration, routinely handling matters that involve legitimate applications for visas for entry into the United States, and it fights the scourge of human trafficking. I am privileged to have a Caucus on Human Trafficking with my colleague Senator Rob Portman. So I know it forms a diverse collection of responsibilities that are crucial to security. In fact, the Department of Homeland Security's responsibilities are comprehensive--so much so that it is simply unacceptable to play politics with its crucial mission. It is irresponsible to hold its funding hostage in a dangerous game of fiscal chicken and threaten daily activities that are vital to America's present and future security. [[Page S554]] That is why we are here, because some of my friends across the aisle believe stopping the President from exercising discretion on certain immigration issues affecting specific individuals in this country is worth hamstringing and undercutting the entire Department of Homeland Security and forcing an enormous amount of its vital work to grind to a halt. That is the game of chicken we have. The President is expected to relent if the Department of Homeland Security is stopped from functioning, but it is a game that has no place in this Chamber or in this government. We can agree or disagree with the President, and I disagree with the Department of Homeland Security on certain of its policies; for example, on detaining children which it has done routinely on a grandiose scale. I have included an amendment in the measure for immigration reform that passed the Senate. It would stop it from detaining children--a practice I consider shameful and unacceptable-- and I have a long list of other changes I would like to see made in DHS policies. But the way to effectuate those changes in my view is not to withhold funding to stop DHS in its tracks of providing security for the American people, it is to amend the laws to persuade our colleagues to undertake the legislative process and to appeal ultimately to the court of public opinion which can render a verdict far more powerful than the tactics involved here.

making sure the dhs funding as a clean bill is approved right away and that we move forward to make sure dhs continues its vital service to the american people. mr. president, i yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum. the presiding officer. the clerk will call the roll. the assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll. mr. menendez. mr. president, i ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. the presiding officer. without objection, it is so ordered. mr. menendez. mr. president, as we approach the near end--i think--of the votes and legislation on the keystone pipeline--i know we are having a series of votes later today--i know what is likely to be next up is the question of department of homeland security funding. i hope we can come collectively together to fund the department of homeland security, the department that keeps us safe in an unsafe world, the department we created after september 11 to bring together disparate government agencies, all charged with keeping our cities, our ports, our airports, our railways, highways, bridges, and neighborhoods safe from the threat of global terrorism. i particularly understand that as a member of this body who represents, according to the fbi, the most dangerous 2 miles in america, the chemical coastway, airports, seaports along the hudson waterfront. this is the department that funds emergency management in our communities. it protects the president. it is engaged in all domestic counterterrorism efforts. but what are we doing instead? we are being asked, as one of the new republican majority's first acts of this congress, to shut down the department of homeland security. why? because some of our friends on the other side are willing to take a gamble and put politics ahead of national security, a thinly veiled political stunt in response to the lawful actions of the president of the united states to do something to fix our broken immigration system. their message is pretty simple: repeal the president's lawful executive actions on immigration or shut down the department of homeland security. make no mistake, that is the textbook definition of pure politics: not caring what its impact might be, not caring whom it might hurt, not caring about the families whom it will tear apart, and the fact that it will put our nation's security at risk. i have been in this chamber and in the other chamber for over 20 years, and i don't think i have ever seen such a cavalier political recklessness played with our national security. why? to prevent the president from taking lawful action to help dreamers and immigrant families to come out of the shadows after they pass a criminal background check, register with the government, and get right with the law in exchange for being allowed to temporarily stay in the country and obtain a work permit. the bottom line is clear: republicans are doing all of this just to prevent a clean department of homeland security funding bill from being sent to the president, a critical funding bill that the president has rightfully promised to veto should it include their anti-immigration amendments, a veto which congress will not override. it is a fool's political errand that is neither good policy nor particularly humane. our friends on the other side have accepted these anti-immigrant poison pill amendments, knowing full well they will sink the department of homeland security funding bill because they have allowed extremists, such as steve king, to dictate the party's strategy on immigration. let's not continuously go down this dark path of partisanship instead of funding national security programs to keep our families and our communities safe. in my view it is shamefully and woefully irresponsible for republicans to hold up funding for operations that protect every american against terrorism in the wake of what happened in france and against cyber attacks at a time when north korea just carried out a dramatic attack against a major american corporation. this is not a time to hold up funding to help the department of homeland security investigate cyber crime that could cripple america's electronic infrastructure or when the world is a tinderbox of jihadists and would-be homegrown terrorists willing to die for a perceived version of islam. if republican colleagues want to seriously consider this ill- conceived approach, they will be forcing a shutdown of the department of homeland security--a shutdown of our national security infrastructure to pursue their agenda of mass deportations that will tear families apart, an agenda that embraces a system that doesn't distinguish between deporting a working mother with u.s. citizen children and a convicted felon. instead, i urge my friends on the other side to join us and pass a balanced and comprehensive bill. let's talk. let's sit down again and find common ground, as we did in the last congress where this senate came together on a bipartisan basis with over 67 votes to send a bill to the house of representatives that dealt with our broken immigration system, provided for our national security, promoted our national economy, and at the same time made sure our legacy and history as a nation of immigrants was preserved. the answer is not holding up national security funding at a critical time, not turning our backs on the [[page s555]] hard-working men and women at the department of homeland security in law enforcement who are protecting our borders, our airports, and our coastlines. it is not about trying to score political points by conflating national security and immigration reform, which will only make it harder to address security issues at home and almost impossible to move forward on comprehensive immigration reform. let's look at what my republican colleagues are so opposed to. they are opposed to new dhs directives that include a rigorous application process that will ironically help eliminate national security threats. they seem to be opposed to the fact that applicants will have to come forward and register with the government. they will have to pass criminal background checks before they can receive a temporary reprieve from deportation and a work permit. no violent criminals, gang members, or terrorists will be able to take advantage of the program. they seem to be opposed to allowing immigrants who are not a public safety or national security threat to come forward and request deferred action, meaning there will be fewer people living in the shadows, beyond the reach of law enforcement. these directives identify moms and dads who have a u.s. citizen or a legal permanent resident son or daughter and take them out of the deportation queue. they also take dreamers out of the deportation queue. the house amendment to the department of homeland security funding bill would effectively end the new deferred action for parental accountability program and the expanded daca program for dreamers. they would also defund every other aspect of the president's november 20 executive action that would promote border security, public safety, military service, legal immigration, citizenship, immigration integration, entrepreneurship, civil immigration enforcement priorities, including the prioritization of individuals with convicted felonies and gang activity and terrorist ties for deportation. i will repeat that. it includes a prioritization. i would think the senate would want to support a prioritization of individuals who are here illegally and are convicted felons and part of gang activities or who have terrorist ties for deportation and any future similar executive actions. the only directive our republican colleagues found acceptable, which is interesting--in my mind, you say: well, none of it can happen by executive action. but it seems that the only thing that did happen by executive action that our colleagues found acceptable pertains to pay increases for immigration and customs enforcement officers, which i believe they certainly deserve. these amendments would break apart more families and destroy communities by ensuring that we continue to deport the parents of u.s. citizen and lawful permanent resident children. one of the most mean- spirited amendments would prohibit the use of federal funds or resources to consider or adjudicate any new, renewed, or previously denied application for deferred action for childhood arrivals. let's call this amendment what it is: it is an amendment to deport dreamers and targets all of those young people who came forward and signed up in good faith. i will give an example of whom these amendments attack. i wish to remind my colleagues of who the dreamers are. dreamers are young people who came to this country through no choice of their own. the only flag they have ever pledged allegiance to is that of the united states of america. the only national anthem they know is the ``star-spangled banner.'' their country is this country. i was fortunate to speak with people like the morales-cano family 2 weeks ago in new jersey. they are a family of six, including 13-year- old, u.s.-born rebecca morales. their lives have drastically improved thanks to the program republicans are hoping to dismantle. if the republicans are successful, rebecca would be left alone in the united states without her parents or sisters--an american citizen left alone, perhaps in foster care, because republicans don't care about prioritizing the deportation of convicted criminals over her mom, dad, and sisters. the story of the morales-cano family is a clear example of thousands of deep-rooted families who have waited too long in the shadows for immigration reform. three years ago, after attending a deferred action for childhood arrivals workshop that my office organized in new jersey, all three of rebecca's older sisters--ingrid, evelyn, and lesly--were given an opportunity to begin a new chapter of their lives after qualifying for the president's 2012 deferred action for childhood arrivals program, joining thousands of others who had been granted relief. today, look at what this family is doing ingrid cares for new jerseyans' health at her job at the ocean medical center. evelyn moved to illinois to attend the west coast bible college and seminary. lesly was able to enroll in brookdale community college to pursue her dream of becoming a nurse. ingrid, evelyn, and lesly represent the hundreds of thousands of young individuals who, because of the deferred action for childhood arrivals, can actively contribute to our economy without fear of losing everything they have worked to gain. romeo morales and mrs. magda cano de morales did not qualify for deportation deferrals under daca and have continued to live with the constant fear of having their family abruptly separated. but thanks to the deferred action for parents program, recently announced by president obama, both parents will likely qualify to come out of the shadows, register with the government, pass a background check, and join their daughters in their pursuit of the american dream--unless, of course, the republicans get their way. we cannot let that happen, and i will do everything to ensure that we will not let that happen. these are the real faces of our broken immigration system. there are many families like the morales-cano family who have been and remain an economic resource we cannot afford to waste. they are hard-working families who simply want to be full participants in american life, full contributors to the american family, and they want to remain united as a family. we should want them to remain united. i have listened to so many speeches here about family values. well, the core of a family value is a family being able to stay together, integrated and helping each other and driving each other to success and supporting each other. ripping families apart is not a family value. we must see through the smoke and mirrors and do what is right for america. let's stop playing political games. let's defeat these poison- pill amendments and pass a clean department of homeland security funding bill. let's not play politics with national security. let's remember the people behind the policies. let's remember the morales- cano family and the fate of rebecca if we allow these amendments to pass. with that, i yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum. the presiding officer. the clerk will call the roll. the assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll. ms. murkowski. i ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. the presiding officer. without objection, it is so ordered.

CREC-2015-01-28-pt1-PgS577-2,CREC-2015-01-28,114,TRIBUTE TO BEN RICHMOND,"[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 14 (Wednesday, January 28, 2015)] [Senate] [Pages S577-S578] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] TRIBUTE TO BEN RICHMOND Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I rise to pay tribute to a great Kentuckian and a man who has dedicated his entire career to promoting civil rights and helping people. My good friend Ben Richmond, the longtime president and CEO of the Louisville Urban League, recently announced his impending retirement from that position. Mr. Richmond has served as president and CEO of the Louisville Urban League for nearly 30 years--since 1987. Mr. Richmond is a civil rights champion who has led a venerable civil rights institution such as the Louisville Urban League to new heights. Under his tenure, the Louisville Urban League has promoted job training and education for many in Louisville's African-American community. His body of work is so outstanding that in 2007 he received from the city the Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Freedom Award, a recognition for a local activist who is dedicated to King's principles and who has promoted peace, equality, and justice. Since Mr. Richmond took over the Louisville Urban League, the staff has grown from around 20 to 30 and the annual budget grown from under $1 million to around $3.3 million. Mr. Richmond is the driving force for fundraising for the budget. The Louisville Urban League placed more than 200 people in jobs last year with a combined annual income of nearly $5 million. It helped about 1,000 prepare for finding employment through career expos, job training, referrals, and career counseling. It also has many programs to help youth and seniors. The Louisville Urban League is nearly halfway towards realizing their goal of seeing 15,000 local African Americans earn college degrees between 2012 and 2020. Mr. Richmond oversaw the Louisville Urban League's move to a new headquarters in 1990. And under Mr. Richmond's tenure, the Louisville Urban League was just one of 13 Urban League affiliates nationwide to receive a top score in a self-audit required by the National Urban League. I should add my interest in the Urban League is personal--my father once served on the board of the Louisville Urban League. I believe he knew Ben Richmond. We are lucky, that after his retirement, Mr. Richmond plans on staying in Louisville. Our city can continue to benefit from his wisdom and experience. I want to wish my good friend Mr. Ben Richmond all the best in retirement, and I ask my Senate colleagues to join me in congratulating Ben for his successful tenure at the helm of the Louisville Urban League. The city of Louisville and the State of Kentucky have certainly benefitted immeasurably by his many efforts over the decades. The Louisville Courier-Journal newspaper recently published an article extolling Mr. Ben Richmond's many accomplishments. I ask unanimous consent that said article be printed in the Record. There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows: [From the Courier-Journal, Jan. 21, 2015] Urban League CEO Richmond Retiring (By Sheldon S. Shafer) Ben Richmond, a cornerstone of local social activism for more than a quarter century and a major advocate of economic equality, is retiring as president and CEO of the Louisville Urban League. Richmond announced his impending retirement at an Urban League board meeting Tuesday, after serving as head of the civil-rights organization since 1987. Under the leadership of Richmond, a mainstay in the push to improve economic development in western Louisville, the Urban League has long been dedicated to promoting job training and education, primarily for Louisville's poorer citizens. Richmond ``has been one of the anchors for diversity and for stability in not only the African-American community but the overall Louisville community,'' said Raoul Cunningham, Louisville NAACP president. ``I am going to miss Ben, his counsel and his cooperative spirit.'' Richmond ``has become known around the country for innovative and groundbreaking approaches to helping residents improve their quality of life,'' said Dan Hall, a University of Louisville vice president and the Urban League board chairman. ``He is intensely passionate about helping individuals find a pathway to success.'' Richmond received Louisville Metro's Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Freedom Award in 2007, an annual recognition given by the city to a local activist dedicated to King's principles and who has promoted peace, equality and justice. Then-Mayor Jerry Abramson said at the time that ``over his decades of leadership, countless lives have been improved through Ben's tireless efforts in workforce development, housing and youth programs.'' The national Urban League was founded in 1910, and the Louisville agency in 1921. The [[Page S578]] local league was set up chiefly to help rural black Southerners who had moved to Louisville after World War I. The Louisville Urban League under Richmond has greatly expanded its reach. It placed about 250 people in jobs last year and helped around 1,000 more prepare for finding employment. The league's career-development efforts range from helping job seekers draft resumes to mock job interviews. In recent times the league has sponsored Saturday morning enrichment classes for children. And it has found buyers for dozens of new single-family homes built on vacant or abandoned property under its Project Rebound program in Russell, helping to transform the surrounding neighborhood. League efforts annually include career expos; job training, referrals and career counseling; a variety of services for employers; homeownership training and counseling; a health and wellness program called Get Fit Louisville; a walk to defeat childhood obesity; and a long list of programs to help both youths and seniors in many ways. Benjamin K. Richmond, 71 and single, was born in Durham, N.C., and raised in Jackson, Miss. Richmond came to the Louisville Urban League as president and CEO in 1987, after top jobs with league affiliates in Wisconsin and Michigan. Richmond here replaced the league's longtime leader, the late Art Walters. Walters, who died in 2010 at age 91, directed the Louisville Urban League from 1970 to 1987. Since Richmond took over, the league's staff has grown from around 20 to 30--also aided by dozens of volunteers--and its annual budget has grown from under $1 million to around $3.3 million this year. The funds have been cobbled together largely by Richmond--from Metro United Way and numerous public and private sources. The current budget, for instance, includes about $340,000 from United Way, less than $100,000 from Metro Government and a $1.2 million federal grant earmarked primarily for programs for seniors. The league has several departments, including the Center for Workforce Development, the Center for Housing and Financial Empowerment and the Center for Youth Development and Education. Richmond said in an interview Monday that he expects to remain on the job until around June 30, or until a replacement is named by the agency's board, after a planned national search. He said he may then stay on under a contract for a while longer. Richmond intends to stay in Louisville, while traveling some to visit relatives in Mississippi and Arizona. But he pledges to remain active, noting that ``there are many opportunities in both the public and private sectors here. I will see what emerges. But I want to have fun.'' Among many achievements during his tenure, Richmond cited: Opening the league headquarters in 1990 at 1535 W. Broadway, a 19,000-square-foot office, community meeting site, classroom and job-training facility. The league invested $1.6 million in the headquarters, which was paid off long ago. Richmond said the league headquarters has spurred significant nearby development along Broadway. The economic impact of the league in terms of finding jobs for more than 200 people last year. Their combined annual income should be nearly $5 million. Richmond noted that in recent years the league helped find jobs for dozens of minorities in construction of the KFC Yum! Center, and he said the league was instrumental in getting the PGA of America to establish an urban youth golf program and also hire top staff minorities. That a halfway point has nearly been reached toward a goal--shared with partner organizations such as Simmons College and Jefferson Community and Technical College--to have 15,000 local African-Americans earn college degrees between 2012 and 2020. The minority effort is part of the community's 55,000 Degrees effort. That the league last year received a top score in a self- audit--a review of its staff, policies, finances and procedures--required every three years by the National Urban League. The Louisville agency was just one of 13 affiliates of the national organization to achieve that status, Richmond said. Richmond said he is proud that under his oversight the local league has attained financial stability, adding that he believes his organized is widely respected. Under Richmond, the league has become more diversified. About half of its 36-member board and about half the staff are white. Richmond said he has strived to ``practice what we preach--racial diversity.'' Richmond ``has been a tremendous leader,'' said Metro Councilman David Tandy, D-4th District. ``There is still work to do, but he has been at the forefront of the second, or third, wave of the civil-rights movement, focusing on economic opportunity. ... He has played a pivotal role in the community.'' Richmond ``has tried to create opportunities and meet challenges our community has faced,'' said longtime ally Sam Watkins, president of the Louisville Central Community Center, another West End-based, pro-development group. ``He's been a champion for west Louisville and has been proactive in trying to garner desperately needed attention for the area's issues and problems.'' ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 14 (Wednesday, January 28, 2015)] [Senate] [Pages S577-S578] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] TRIBUTE TO BEN RICHMOND Mr. McCONNELL.

Mr. Richmond oversaw the Louisville Urban League's move to a new headquarters in 1990. And under Mr. Richmond's tenure, the Louisville Urban League was just one of 13 Urban League affiliates nationwide to receive a top score in a self-audit required by the National Urban League. I should add my interest in the Urban League is personal--my father once served on the board of the Louisville Urban League. I believe he knew Ben Richmond. We are lucky, that after his retirement, Mr. Richmond plans on staying in Louisville. Our city can continue to benefit from his wisdom and experience. I want to wish my good friend Mr. Ben Richmond all the best in retirement, and I ask my Senate colleagues to join me in congratulating Ben for his successful tenure at the helm of the Louisville Urban League. The city of Louisville and the State of Kentucky have certainly benefitted immeasurably by his many efforts over the decades. The Louisville Courier-Journal newspaper recently published an article extolling Mr. Ben Richmond's many accomplishments. I ask unanimous consent that said article be printed in the Record. There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows: [From the Courier-Journal, Jan. 21, 2015] Urban League CEO Richmond Retiring (By Sheldon S. Shafer) Ben Richmond, a cornerstone of local social activism for more than a quarter century and a major advocate of economic equality, is retiring as president and CEO of the Louisville Urban League. Richmond announced his impending retirement at an Urban League board meeting Tuesday, after serving as head of the civil-rights organization since 1987. Under the leadership of Richmond, a mainstay in the push to improve economic development in western Louisville, the Urban League has long been dedicated to promoting job training and education, primarily for Louisville's poorer citizens. Richmond ``has been one of the anchors for diversity and for stability in not only the African-American community but the overall Louisville community,'' said Raoul Cunningham, Louisville NAACP president. ``I am going to miss Ben, his counsel and his cooperative spirit.'' Richmond ``has become known around the country for innovative and groundbreaking approaches to helping residents improve their quality of life,'' said Dan Hall, a University of Louisville vice president and the Urban League board chairman. ``He is intensely passionate about helping individuals find a pathway to success.'' Richmond received Louisville Metro's Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Freedom Award in 2007, an annual recognition given by the city to a local activist dedicated to King's principles and who has promoted peace, equality and justice. Then-Mayor Jerry Abramson said at the time that ``over his decades of leadership, countless lives have been improved through Ben's tireless efforts in workforce development, housing and youth programs.'' The national Urban League was founded in 1910, and the Louisville agency in 1921. The [[Page S578]] local league was set up chiefly to help rural black Southerners who had moved to Louisville after World War I. The Louisville Urban League under Richmond has greatly expanded its reach. It placed about 250 people in jobs last year and helped around 1,000 more prepare for finding employment. The league's career-development efforts range from helping job seekers draft resumes to mock job interviews. In recent times the league has sponsored Saturday morning enrichment classes for children. And it has found buyers for dozens of new single-family homes built on vacant or abandoned property under its Project Rebound program in Russell, helping to transform the surrounding neighborhood. League efforts annually include career expos; job training, referrals and career counseling; a variety of services for employers; homeownership training and counseling; a health and wellness program called Get Fit Louisville; a walk to defeat childhood obesity; and a long list of programs to help both youths and seniors in many ways. Benjamin K. Richmond, 71 and single, was born in Durham, N.C., and raised in Jackson, Miss. Richmond came to the Louisville Urban League as president and CEO in 1987, after top jobs with league affiliates in Wisconsin and Michigan. Richmond here replaced the league's longtime leader, the late Art Walters. Walters, who died in 2010 at age 91, directed the Louisville Urban League from 1970 to 1987. Since Richmond took over, the league's staff has grown from around 20 to 30--also aided by dozens of volunteers--and its annual budget has grown from under $1 million to around $3.3 million this year. The funds have been cobbled together largely by Richmond--from Metro United Way and numerous public and private sources. The current budget, for instance, includes about $340,000 from United Way, less than $100,000 from Metro Government and a $1.2 million federal grant earmarked primarily for programs for seniors. The league has several departments, including the Center for Workforce Development, the Center for Housing and Financial Empowerment and the Center for Youth Development and Education. Richmond said in an interview Monday that he expects to remain on the job until around June 30, or until a replacement is named by the agency's board, after a planned national search. He said he may then stay on under a contract for a while longer. Richmond intends to stay in Louisville, while traveling some to visit relatives in Mississippi and Arizona. But he pledges to remain active, noting that ``there are many opportunities in both the public and private sectors here. I will see what emerges. But I want to have fun.'' Among many achievements during his tenure, Richmond cited: Opening the league headquarters in 1990 at 1535 W. Broadway, a 19,000-square-foot office, community meeting site, classroom and job-training facility. The league invested $1.6 million in the headquarters, which was paid off long ago. Richmond said the league headquarters has spurred significant nearby development along Broadway. The economic impact of the league in terms of finding jobs for more than 200 people last year. Their combined annual income should be nearly $5 million. Richmond noted that in recent years the league helped find jobs for dozens of minorities in construction of the KFC Yum! Center, and he said the league was instrumental in getting the PGA of America to establish an urban youth golf program and also hire top staff minorities. That a halfway point has nearly been reached toward a goal--shared with partner organizations such as Simmons College and Jefferson Community and Technical College--to have 15,000 local African-Americans earn college degrees between 2012 and 2020. The minority effort is part of the community's 55,000 Degrees effort. That the league last year received a top score in a self- audit--a review of its staff, policies, finances and procedures--required every three years by the National Urban League. The Louisville agency was just one of 13 affiliates of the national organization to achieve that status, Richmond said. Richmond said he is proud that under his oversight the local league has attained financial stability, adding that he believes his organized is widely respected. Under Richmond, the league has become more diversified. About half of its 36-member board and about half the staff are white. Richmond said he has strived to ``practice what we preach--racial diversity.'' Richmond ``has been a tremendous leader,'' said Metro Councilman David Tandy, D-4th District. ``There is still work to do, but he has been at the forefront of the second, or third, wave of the civil-rights movement, focusing on economic opportunity. ... He has played a pivotal role in the community.'' Richmond ``has tried to create opportunities and meet challenges our community has faced,'' said longtime ally Sam Watkins, president of the Louisville Central Community Center, another West End-based, pro-development group. ``He's been a champion for west Louisville and has been proactive in trying to garner desperately needed attention for the area's issues and problems.''

The Senator from Alaska. Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I am ready to go this morning. I have comfortable shoes on. I am ready for a good, long day and to process a bunch of amendments. I see the Senate doing its work. I know we have important business before the Senate. I know the Judiciary Committee is holding the hearing to listen to the comments from Loretta Lynch, who has been nominated to be Attorney General. Obviously these are very important issues the committee is discussing today. Interspersed with all of that, we are going to be having a relatively long series of votes this afternoon, which makes it a little bit choppy and a little bit chaotic, but we have business to do in the Senate. I am pleased we are at this point where I think we can honestly say we are looking at the final stretch in this discussion on the bipartisan, 60-sponsored bill to approve the Keystone XL Pipeline after more than 2,320 days of delay. At this point we are past that last call for amendments on the bill. We have spent a lot of time over the past couple of days negotiating which of the roughly 200 first-degree amendments that have been filed would come up for votes. We have a pretty good list. Again, we have 18 of them that will be before us beginning this afternoon. There will be more we will be dealing with at a later point. But I do think this is significant. I was reading the newspaper this morning, and there is no shortage of critics out there, folks who would say the Senate is broken and can't possibly be fixed. There was an article from an opinion writer which stated: Within the midst of the Keystone debate, McConnell has had to retreat ``on his promise to allow freewheeling amendments.'' The article then goes on to state that yesterday not much of anything happened on the Senate floor where the pipeline debate had stalled. In fairness, maybe the debate, in terms of processing amendments on the floor, had stalled out yesterday, but that did not mean there were not significant and serious negotiations going on between the majority and the minority about how we would proceed. Sometimes when someone tunes in and the Senate is in a quorum call, they think nothing is happening. They think the business of the Senate is not being conducted. I need to assure not only colleagues but those who watch this process on C-SPAN that in fact there is still good business being done. I think that is what has resulted in our opportunity this afternoon to take up some 18 different amendments. There are amendments that are all across the board; 10 of the 18 pending amendments are from colleagues on the other side of the aisle. I think we are certainly being very generous in terms of what is out there. We are trying to ensure that Members who want a vote can have them. Again, keep in mind, with a couple hundred amendments that come forward, we are going to have a lot of duplication. We are going to have issues people may want to make a statement about but might not necessarily want to ask for a vote on. But those that we have in front of us today--everything from issues relating to solar energy to LNG exports, to further discussion about climate change, wilderness, wind tax credits, the Land and Water Conservation Fund--are truly all over the map. When it is suggested that somehow or other Senator McConnell as the majority leader is moving back from his commitment to allow for an open amendment process, so-called freewheeling amendments, I don't think a whole picture of what is happening on the Senate floor is being painted. In fact it is a very open and considerable process. I made mention last week that we broke the records. We blew the top off in terms of the number of amendments we were actually able to process on the Senate floor. We moved through 24 amendments on this bill since the time we started it. Twenty-four amendments is pretty considerable, considering that in all of 2014 there were just 15 amendments that were considered the entire year. In fact, on Thursday alone we processed 15. If we do 18, as is on the roster today, that is pretty significant. I feel good about the point we are at. It is not just because we are churning through amendments, it is because of what the ranking member and I have been able to do as the floor managers on this bill, kind of working back and forth. Yes, sometimes it is tedious. Yes, sometimes it is frustrating. Yes, sometimes Members wish they had more time to talk or there were more hours in our day to process all of this, [[Page S557]] but at some point in time I think we have to recognize when we spend 3 weeks on a bill, that is pretty considerable. When we are able to move 50 amendments--close to 50 amendments is where we may be at the end of this legislation and processing--that is of note. What I appreciate is we are here this morning getting ready to kick off a long afternoon of votes and go back and forth with Members and disruption of their schedules and committee meetings and the inconvenience that causes. But again this is part of what happens around here. It is not a very tightly scheduled environment because we just have so much that is going on. But being able to move forward on this important legislation is good and necessary. I think we are setting the stage for the balance of this Congress-- under the leadership of the Senator from Kentucky, the majority leader, a commitment to have wholesome debate--to have the opportunity for a process that is not only good for Republicans, it is good for Democrats. It is good for the Senate and for the United States. Amendment No. 166 I want to quickly mention an amendment I will have up later this afternoon. This is amendment No. 166. I spoke very briefly to it yesterday when I called it up. But it would require wilderness study areas to be released if Congress has not officially designated them as wilderness within one calendar year. Right now what happens is that when a wilderness study area is designated, it can sit out there on the books almost indefinitely. There have been areas that have been sitting out there without congressional action for a couple of decades. I don't think this was the point of the process. But I would suggest the amendment I have advanced is a critical one to our Western States, certainly to my State of Alaska. Again, the news on Sunday of the President moving toward a wilderness designation of all of ANWR--with the exception of a very small slice but all of ANWR--all 19 million acres in addition to the 1002 area, the 1.57 million acres that have been specifically designated by Congress for further review and study. Right now there are 528 wilderness study areas throughout Alaska and the other 11 Western States. Again, these designations have been made by over time by one administration or another. The next step forward in this process is that Congress needs to act, but Congress hasn't acted. We have had some of these that have been pending since the 1980s. Again, as I suggested yesterday, if we have had something pending for 20, 30 years, I think that is plenty of time to say that Congress has had to review those areas. Even though we have not turned these into wilderness--in other words, even though Congress has not acted to designate these areas as wilderness, what happens to them? They are treated and managed as if they are wilderness. Effectively, we have de facto wilderness. The law requires that only Congress determines whether an area is designated as wilderness. But what has happened is just kind of a lag, a lull, if you will, so they don't even need the congressional designation if in fact it is already being managed as wilderness. We look at the intent behind this. It is clear it was never intended to be this way. We were never supposed to have millions of acres of de facto Agency-decided wilderness around the Western United States. We routinely pass public lands legislation into law. I would like to know we could do it a little more often. As recently as last month, it actually has included new wilderness. So we are not saying that in other areas these wilderness study areas don't get officially designated. There is that process, and we demonstrated that just during the lameduck here. But in the instances where Congress has decided not to act on wilderness study areas, agencies need to start looking at what that broader array of options is for managing the land, whatever that multiple use designation might be. They need to be looking at this critically with the local people in the area and with the other stakeholders who are involved in the planning process, but clearly they are not doing that on their own. So what my amendment would do is essentially provide a 1-year timeframe for wilderness designations to be made. I think, again, that is more than enough time for Congress to consider debate and approve legislation for any area with wide support for a wilderness designation, so we will see that amendment this afternoon. I know the Senator from Washington was on her way, coming from a committee meeting this morning, and had intended to speak. I see Senator Udall is also on the floor. I yield to the Senator from New Mexico if he wishes to speak at this time before Senator Cantwell comes to the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sullivan). The clerk will call the roll. The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. PETERS. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Amendment No. 55 Mr. PETERS. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss my amendment that was made pending by my friend and the ranking member of the Energy and Natural Resources Committee, the Senator from Washington, Ms. Cantwell. The amendment I have offered, amendment No. 55, is a simple, commonsense amendment. It requires the Environmental Protection Agency to complete a study on the potential environmental and health impact of byproducts from tar sands oil that would be transported across our country by the Keystone XL Pipeline. One of these byproducts of tar sands oil is a black, powdery substance known as petroleum coke or petcoke. It is a residual from this tar sands oil and large amounts of it are produced in the refining process. In fact, it is estimated basically for every barrel of oil we get from tar sands, one-third of the material is this dark substance called petcoke. If we are transporting an awful lot of oil through the Keystone Pipeline, it naturally follows that we are going to get massive amounts of this petcoke. I have had an experience with this petcoke in my previous House district in the city of Detroit, where we had petcoke from the refining process of this tar sands oil being piled up along the Detroit River. We had a pile there that was at some times several stories high, a city block long. It was stored along the river in an uncontained fashion. It was blowing into people's homes, it was blowing into businesses, and it was also draining into the Great Lakes watershed. It caused all sorts of problems. I had complaints from constituents who talked about this substance going into their homes. I had businesses talking about--for example, restaurants in the area--their wait staff getting respiratory problems as a result of breathing this in. In fact, we had a video to explain how problematic it can be. I had a video taken by a Canadian resident across the Detroit River that showed the petcoke piles. With some wind blowing, a massive black dust cloud was blowing off of these petcoke piles. In the distance you could see the Ambassador Bridge, which is the bridge that connects Canada to the United States. The dust was so thick and so black it obscured the bridge as it was blowing into the neighborhoods, into the river, and then into Canada. It is a completely unacceptable situation, which is why I believe it is important as we move forward with this legislation that we have a couple of studies. One, we need to understand what are those environmental and health risks associated with petcoke. It is clear this is particulate matter, and if it is not contained, it gets into people's lungs and creates a dust layer throughout communities. It is very important as well in the study not only to study the environmental and health impacts, but what are the best practices to handle this material. With the massive amount of tar sands oil that will come through the Keystone, we will also get massive amounts of petcoke, a substance that has been problematic not only in Detroit, but it has been problematic in the city of Chicago and other places across the country. [[Page S558]] So I believe it is very important that we get these kinds of information as this project moves forward, and it is certainly my hope that we can assure that what happened in Detroit, what is happening in Chicago and other places across this country doesn't happen, that we understand what this substance is, and we understand what those best practices are to handle and to transport this material safely. I urge my colleagues to support amendment No. 55. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll. Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Amendment No. 166 Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I am glad the junior Senator from Alaska is in the Chair because I am going to be discussing things that are of great concern to Alaskans and really to those who care about the rule of law here and how it applies throughout all 50 States fairly and evenly. As I mentioned just a bit ago, I have offered an amendment that would deal with how wilderness study areas are treated. My proposal is one that would put a time limitation on these study areas. I mentioned the amendment was precipitated by the President's announcement this weekend about additional areas of wilderness to be designated in Alaska. I have cited two. The 1980 lands bill, ANILCA--I think it is good for us to have a little bit of a refresher on what ANILCA actually did. In one fell swoop ANILCA designated nearly 60 million acres of wilderness in the State of Alaska. That is pretty substantial. It was more than any other President had ever designated at any other time prior to that. What we have seen since then, with the designation of wilderness, is there has been this fight going back and forth. There have been areas that have been requested for wilderness study areas. But this administration has really taken it a major step forward. On Sunday the President recommended that an additional 12.3 million acres within the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge be designated as wilderness--so an additional 12.3 million acres on top of the 60 million acres that we already have as wilderness in Alaska after ANILCA. This action by the President means that these 12.3 million acres will immediately be managed as wilderness. As I have mentioned, right now there is no deadline or expiration for this designation. Even if Congress fails to act--and I am going to make darn certain we do not act on this wilderness proposal the President has advanced--these acres are being managed as wilderness. Let me just show colleagues what it means for us right now. The small map of Alaska is up there in the corner. It is kind of unfair because it needs to be a much bigger map to get the context. Effectively, what the President is proposing is that in addition to the 7.16 million acres of wilderness that currently exist in the ANWR area--and the ANWR area is a big refuge, a big designation. A little over 7 million acres have already been designated as wilderness. That was done back in 1980. But what he is proposing now is effectively taking the whole balance of the refuge area and making wilderness out of that as well--so 12.3 million acres. Now, keep in mind this also includes the 1002 area up on the northern part of ANWR. That is the area right, which was specifically designated by Congress for further study of its oil and gas potential. Back in 1980, when the wilderness designation was made for the one area--7 million acres of it--it was determined that refuge status would be afforded the balance of the area, and then the 1002 would be reserved-- reserved deliberately for study of its oil and gas potential. That 1980 act was pretty clear in terms of the bargain that had taken place. I am going to read for the record the provision in the law that we refer to as the ``no more'' clause. It states: This Act provides sufficient protection for the national interest in the scenic, natural, cultural and environmental values on the public lands in Alaska, and at the same time provides adequate opportunity for satisfaction of the economic and social needs of the State of Alaska and its people; accordingly, the designation and disposition of the public lands in Alaska pursuant to this Act are found to represent a proper balance between the reservation of national conservation system units and those public lands necessary and appropriate for more intensive use and disposition, and thus Congress believes that the need for future legislation designating new conservation system units, new national conservation areas, or new national recreation areas, has been obviated thereby. The act goes on to state that ``no further studies of Federal lands in the State of Alaska for the single purpose of considering the establishment of a conservation system unit, national recreation area, national conservation area, or for related or similar purposes shall be conducted unless authorized by the Congress.'' So the President is basically choosing to ignore the law as set out in ANILCA--the agreement that Alaska has contributed mightily with its share of wilderness. I remind my colleagues that more than one-half of the wilderness in the entire United States of America is in the State of Alaska. Thus we wrote the law back in 1980 that says no more out of Alaska. They found that balance. Well, this President is tipping that balance. The coastal plain holds an estimated 10.4 billion barrels of oil. I mentioned yesterday that if we can tap into these resources, we could see 1 million barrels a day coming down our Trans-Alaska Pipeline for nearly 30 years. Think about what that would mean, Mr. President--1 million barrels a day filling up that Trans-Alaska Pipeline that is now less than half full, an additional 1 million barrels a day coming into this country. Right now, Americans are enjoying the lower prices of oil. But the President said: Don't get used to these low prices because they may go up. Well, they do not have to go up if we can provide more. If we can increase production in this country, we can theoretically decrease that cost. But we have to be allowed to access that. Think about the source of good-paying jobs, energy security, billions of dollars in new Federal revenues. The energy security part of it is keenly important, but let us also think about the positive national security implications of energy produced in the United States. When we are producing more energy in this country and relying less on others, we are less vulnerable. We have greater ability to deal with hostile nations. Sanctions work better when we don't need to rely on that same oil that some of these nations would like to free up for other countries. From a national security perspective, this is huge. This is where the intersection with the Keystone Pipeline is so interesting: that at the same time this administration has issued this wilderness study it is also fighting so hard to keep us from building the Keystone XL Pipeline, which would allow us to get crude from our friend and neighbor to the north and utilize it to our benefit. The President is saying: No, I don't want to do that. I guess he would much rather receive it from Venezuela or wherever. He says he wants Brazil to be our big trading partner when it comes to oil. Hello. Canada--they share a border. They are our friend. They are our closest friend, our strongest trading partner. Are we going to shut down such an opportunity as that? And: Oh, by the way, that same week let's just go ahead and take off the table permanently one of the greatest reservoirs of crude we have here in the United States next. Let's just take that off the table, too. What does that say? What does that say to other countries? That we don't care about our own energy security? I care about our energy security, and I care about our national security. Again, it stuns me to think that what the President is proposing here is a measure that would take off limits permanently our ability as a nation to access the 1002 area to safely develop this enormous potential. Keep in mind, we are not talking about accessing the full 1.5 million acres in the 1002. The legislation that has been before this Senate, back in 1995 and 2005, asked to open up 2,000 acres--2,000 acres--out of 19.5 million acres in the whole refuge. The Presiding Officer knows Alaskans can do this safely. We have set and met the highest environmental standards in the world. We do it every [[Page S559]] day. Our pipeline, our amazing 800-mile pipeline, has a decades-long record of responsible production. It has carried nearly 17 billion barrels of oil safely across our State, over 2 mountain ranges, multiple rivers, in areas where we are known to have a few earthquakes. It is an engineering marvel. It has served our State and our country well. But instead of recognizing this unparalleled opportunity that we have, we are now facing a mounting lockdown of our resource potential. And the Presiding Officer knows the worst part is, it is not just ANWR we are talking about. Our offshore oil reserves are now also going to be restricted. Just yesterday the President announced he was indefinitely withdrawing 9.8 million acres in the Beaufort and the Chukchi Seas from leasing. So now ANWR is going to be locked up, as well as the Beaufort and Chukchi seas. I don't have a map of these areas that have been taken off limits, but I can tell you that it is an area of roughly 9.8 million acres. There is some real question that I have in my mind. After reading the Interior's press release, I don't have any real comfort that the two sales that are being proposed--one in the Beaufort and one in the Chukchi--will actually stay on schedule. The Secretary of the Interior is quoted saying that: Interior will continue to consider oil and gas exploration in the Arctic. It is not a very firm commitment, as far as I can see. But when we look at it altogether--between the ANWR wilderness designation and the Arctic offshore withdrawal--Alaska has lost more than 22 million acres of land and water where energy could be produced for the good of this country, and it has happened in less than 1 week. It has happened over a span of 3 days--22 million acres. So what is 22 million acres? It is an area about 563 times larger than where we are here in the District of Columbia. It is about 28 Rhode Islands. I know Rhode Island is a small State by comparison, but 28 of them adds up. It is about 4.5 times the size of the State of Massachusetts. Again, this is just to give you an idea of what was taken off limits, indefinitely, by this administration since Sunday. My reaction to all this has been pretty strong. I think it is pretty obvious to anybody who would take a moment to think about it, but I am amazed our President can look at Alaska and think, this is what we need most right now. We are facing a pretty significant budget shortfall. I know our Governor has spoken to the President and the Secretary of Interior about Alaska's situation. Then this is what he gets as a ``we will work with you''? I don't think so. This is not an indication of a Federal Government that wants to work with the State to develop its resources. The Governor asked the Secretary of the Interior for an address, because he said he needed to send an invoice for the lack of any economy Alaska would be able to generate with these actions. The one thing--the one thing more than anything else that could help our State--is to be able to access our Federal lands and our waters so that we can fill up the Trans-Alaska Pipeline, so that we can not only help Alaska but we can help the rest of the country. But that seems to be the one thing this President is intent on denying, whether it is in ANWR, whether it is in our offshore, or whether it is in our National Petroleum Reserve, where this President basically unilaterally took off about half of that in terms of availability of access. I noted that when the President made his announcement on Sunday, the video that went out showed beautiful pictures of the refuge area. Again, this is a big area. This whole refuge is about the size of the State of South Carolina. It is big and there are some amazing spaces--I am the first one to admit it, amazing spaces--just as there are all over Alaska. But I watched that video as he was flying in his airplane to go to India, and I thought to myself: The President hasn't been to Alaska, even though he says he only has three States left to see and Alaska is not included. So I actually asked my staff to find out. By my count, the President has been to Alaska three times during his administration. And he told me, before he was President, he had never been to Alaska. So three times during his administration. All three times were basically to get fuel. And granted, to give him credit, on one of those times he did meet with the troops at Elmendorf, but he never went off the base. The other two times were in the middle of the night for as long as it took to get fuel. In my mind, that is not visiting Alaska. That is not trying to understand who we are. We have some pretty beautiful, wide-open skies. But when you are flying at 35,000, 45,000 feet looking down, that is not how you get a view of Alaska. So outside of this short meet-and-greet, outside of a bargaining chip to gain support from national constituencies, he is basically viewing Alaska as a refueling stop--which is no shortage of irony here in the fact that he is happy to refuel Air Force One in Alaska, but he doesn't seem to want fuel produced in Alaska. I can get pretty frustrated and upset about this. Part of it is because so much of this comes without consultation with us, without listening to the vast majority of Alaskans--as if, once again, we are nothing but a territory and the promises that were made to us at statehood mean nothing. I was born in the territory. It was not that long ago that Alaskans knew what it meant to be kind of kicked around by folks on the outside. We didn't have a voice. We thought statehood was going to change that. We thought that statehood compact--the promises made that Alaska would be able to deliver to its citizens based on the amazing resource wealth that we had--we thought that was going to count for something. Apparently, not enough. I was a little bit surprised to read that the White House counselor, Mr. Podesta, thinks I have overreacted to these announcements and to others that I have been told may be coming--more to come--and he suggested my reaction is not warranted. I would ask any one of the other 99 Senators here: Think about how you would respond if the citizens of your State woke up to a message that we are going to take 12 million acres away from you and your potential to develop in your State; and then on Tuesday, we are going to take away 9.8 million acres. But don't worry, we are the Federal Government, we are here to help. Alaskans want to help themselves. We want to be able to exercise that independence, that free spirit that so many of us in Alaska identify with. We want to help our neighbors, help our families. But this kind of help we don't need. Don't lock us up. Don't shut us out. It was suggested in Mr. Podesta's comments, and I saw it in other press reports, that somehow or other the Interior Department felt compelled to move forward with the timing of these announcements because we were ratcheting up on ANWR. They suggested I had introduced a bill. I haven't introduced a bill. I do intend to introduce a bill. But to somehow suggest this was precipitated because the delegation is making a charge on ANWR is, at this time, unwarranted. It did kind of make me wonder, maybe the White House isn't aware of how Alaskans feel about this. So in the few minutes I want to take this morning I want to read a few of the quotes from our State leaders who have come out against this decision since they were announced, particularly as they relate to ANWR. We have a new, Independent Governor. As I mentioned, he has already had the opportunity to meet with the President and talk about Alaska's issues. Again, he has also met with the Secretary of Interior to talk similarly. Governor Walker says he is ``angry, very angry, that this is happening.'' Our State senate president, Kevin Meyer, said the following: The impact of this decision, if allowed to stand, will harm the future of our Great State and will deal a devastating blow to our economy. I spoke with our house speaker, a gentleman by the name of Mike Chenault from the Kenai Peninsula, an area where we have oil and gas potential in the Cook Inlet. They know about oil and gas. The speaker said: The president just doesn't get it, or he does get it and doesn't care about the will and voice of Alaskans. That's beyond offensive. [[Page S560]] In response to the President's ANWR announcement, Speaker Chenault also had some pretty choice words. He said: Alaska's not a territory anymore and it's high time our federal overlords stopped trying to treat us like one. The Arctic Slope Regional Corporation, whose shareholders, people who actually live on the North Slope, issued a press release stating that: We are staunchly opposed to this relentless and coordinated effort to designate the Coastal Plain of ANWR as Wilderness. This administration has deliberately ignored the input provided by the most affected people within ANWR. Colleagues, remember that when this President is suggesting that this area needs to be named or designated as wilderness, the 1002 area, people live there. People live their lives there--children go to school and people work there. They fly in and out. They have a little grocery store. They try to make an honest living there. They subsist, absolutely; but people live there. To quote from the Arctic Slope Regional Corporation, the corporation's shareholders who live there say, ``this administration has deliberately ignored the input provided by the most affected people within ANWR.'' I think the reason they have ignored it is because they forget people actually live there. How can people live in a wilderness? Democratic State Representative Ben Nageak of Barrow, who is an Inupiat and born in Kaktovik, who lives in the affected area, wrote this: President Barack Obama and his lieutenants at the Interior Department will permanently harm our people and all Alaskans with his colonial attitude and decision making . . . It's terrifying to see the extent by which our pleas for time and a fair hearing of our views fall on deaf ears 5,000 miles away. That is a State representative born and raised in this area, an Inupiat, who is saying 5,000 miles from here you are making decisions without listening to us, without listening to our people. Our North Slope Borough Mayor Charlotte Brower didn't mince any words, either. She said that ``these types of paternalistic, executive fiats seem to be more appropriate for Andrew Jackson's administration than Barack Obama's.'' Pretty tough words. I am starting to think my words were pretty mild based on what I read from the mayor of the North Slope Borough and the Democratic State representative from Barrow. Mayor Brower has invited President Obama and Secretary Jewell to visit the North Slope, and she asked them to meet with the people who actually live there before proposing these types of sweeping land designations. If the President and the Secretary actually accept that invitation, Mayor Brower concluded: They might learn that the Inupiat people who have lived on and cared for these lands for millennia have no interest in living like relics in a giant open air museum. Rather, they hope to have the same rights and privileges enjoyed by people across the rest of the country. That seems like a pretty fair request to me. Even the New York Times interviewed a few Alaskans who didn't hide their feelings. One woman who said she had voted for the President twice said, ``He has just alienated an entire state.'' She described herself as being ``on the fence'' about ANWR before the proposal, but she added, ``without talking to any of us, just doing it by fiat-- that's not how you lead.'' I think she summed it up pretty well. What the President has done, the way he has done it--it is unfair, uncalled for, and it is unwarranted. So for it to be suggested by the counselor from the White House that my response is somehow overreacting or unwarranted, I think they should start listening to all of the people of Alaska. The presiding officer and myself were sent here to represent them and I think we are expressing pretty clearly where Alaskans are coming from on this. This is wrong. It should not be tolerated. And we will not just sit back while this administration locks up our State and the potential of our people. We have a lot more we will be discussing about this. Again, I mentioned on Monday that there was a trifecta with what we see coming out of this administration. I have been told by the Secretary that we would see his ANWR designation and that we would then see the 5-year lease sale that would take areas that had been in deferred status and completely withdraw them for an indefinite period of time, and that there would be a third announcement coming relating to the National Petroleum Reserve--the area where folks who said don't go to ANWR, go to NPRA, go to the National Petroleum Reserve. So the first company that tried to do so is trying to make it happen. What this administration is doing with the mitigation costs they are laying in front of them, the company will determine whether it is going to be economic. But my fear is that will be the third kick to Alaska. So it has been a bad week, a bad week for Alaska. But you know what, we are not people who are deterred by bad news, by bad weather. We have a way to roll with it. I was looking at the front page of the Fairbanks Daily News-Miner yesterday. They had a little recap of what is going on with the weather. It is about 52 below zero in Fort Yukon and 51 below in Fort Greely where we base our ground-based missile defense system. We are pretty proud of what we do. We can still provide for the defense and protection of this country and do it in some pretty cold weather. In Fairbanks, where I went to high school, I think the weather this morning was 47 degrees below zero, but the kids still go to school in this kind of weather. We are doing what we do up north. It is not easy, but it is an amazing place and the people there are pretty resilient. We have been kicked this week, but that doesn't mean we are down. It means we are just getting started. With that, I will have more to say about the process in front of us this afternoon, where we are with Keystone; but again, I am pleased that we have a good series of votes to keep us busy this afternoon, and I appreciate the indulgence of colleagues as we go through a process that can be very disruptive as they are trying to meet with constituents and pursue committee business. But I think we recognize that we want to be on a path toward completion of this bill, and I thank them for their cooperation. With that, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mrs. FISCHER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sasse). Without objection, it is so ordered. Unfunded Mandates Information and Transparency Act Mrs. FISCHER. Mr. President, last week my colleague Senator Lankford and I introduced the Unfunded Mandates Information and Transparency Act--a bill to enhance transparency about the true costs of burdensome Federal regulations affecting our States and localities. Twenty years ago the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act, otherwise known as UMRA, was signed into law to reduce the burden of Federal mandates on State and local governments, as well as the private sector. The statute was intended to fix a simple problem while promoting informed decisions by this Congress. But since UMRA's enactment in 1995, many remain concerned that the law has fallen short. In Nebraska and all across America, our constituents continue to face a growing mountain of redtape that stifles economic growth and holds back progress on a number of fronts. In 2011 alone the Government Accountability Office identified 14 different loopholes that would allow government agencies to avoid conducting the UMRA analysis. In other words, redtape has survived and prospered. By their very nature, Federal mandates are both complex and vague, which is why I have introduced a new bill to fix these shortcomings and increase accountability. My bill, known as the Unfunded Mandates and Information Transparency Act, would address UMRA's loopholes by mandating stricter agency requirements, enhance stakeholder input, and strengthen enforcement mechanisms. Furthermore, this bill has the power to get the job done. It would allow judges to place a stay on a regulation or invalidate a rule if a Federal agency fails to complete the required UMRA [[Page S561]] analysis. It would also close a glaring loophole used by agencies to skirt UMRA requirements. Last but not least, my bill would expand the scope of reporting requirements to include regulations imposed by independent regulatory agencies, such as the EPA. I know many Nebraskans are deeply concerned about the effects of new EPA requirements, such as the proposed water rule--a rule I have forcefully fought since it was first proposed. Nebraskans already go to great lengths to protect and preserve water resources within our State, but now the EPA is going overboard with this new proposal--one that represents a massive Federal power grab and clear disconnect with Main Street America. I share the belief of many Nebraskans that the Federal Government should be held responsible for the rules it puts into place. By clearly notifying taxpayers of the costs of each mandate, which the bill I introduced would require, we can better hold the Federal Government accountable for the economic impact of its costly regulations. I hope my colleagues on both sides of the aisle will join me in supporting this simple, commonsense legislation to help bring greater accountability and transparency to Washington. I thank the Presiding Officer and suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. HOEVEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. HOEVEN. Mr. President, I return to the floor today to discuss the legislation under consideration. As I did yesterday, I wish to begin by again thanking both the Senator from Alaska on our side of the aisle and the Senator from Washington on the other side of the aisle, who are the bill managers--the legislation managers in this case--of the Keystone XL Pipeline approval legislation that I put forward along with Senator Manchin. I wish to begin by thanking both of the managers for their diligence and for their bipartisanship and for working together to advance this legislation, but I also want to make sure all of the Members of this body get a chance to bring their amendments forward, debate those amendments, and have a vote. This afternoon we have scheduled 18 votes, and that is great. Some of those amendments I support; some I oppose. But we are going to do what this body is supposed to do and what the American people elected us to do, and that is to have this discussion and then vote. We are working to advance energy policy for this country that can not only truly help create more energy, jobs, and economic growth but also really address the national security implications of making our country energy secure. By that, I mean producing more energy than we consume and working with Canada, our friend and ally, to do that so that we don't have to depend on OPEC to do that and on parts of the world where there is great instability and where our interests are not aligned with the interests of some of those countries. Also, it enables us to actually weaken some of our opponents that are petro-dependent, countries such as Iran, which is now trying to build a nuclear weapon, as well as, right now, Russia, which is invading its neighbor Ukraine, one of our allies, where we are trying to stop the adventurism of President Putin. By truly becoming energy secure, by providing more supply of energy, we not only benefit every American at the pump--Americans are saving billions of dollars when they pull up to the pump. That is not only good for American consumers, it is good for our small businesses. Energy is a foundational industry that strengthens every other industry out there. It makes us more competitive in the global economy across the board. As I say, it weakens some of our opponents. So that is really the debate in which we are engaged. Yesterday I started to respond to some of the critics who oppose this legislation on the basis of saying this is a project for Canada and not for the United States, and that is not true at all. This pipeline would not only move crude from Canada to our refineries, it would also move crude from production in the United States, including in my State of North Dakota, which now produces 1.2 million barrels of oil a day-- second only to Texas--as well as Montana. So it also moves domestic crude to our refineries as well. Furthermore, it really is about making our Nation energy secure, working with Canada to become energy secure so we don't have to depend on OPEC. That is very much a national interest issue for this country, for this Nation, and for all Americans. I spoke about that a little bit yesterday. The second issue I would like to address is some of the environmental issues. I started to do that yesterday, but I deferred at that time because anytime we can get people to come to the floor to offer their amendments and make them pending, that is what we want to do. At that point we started getting people to come offer their amendments, and the bill managers, through their hard work, were able to get agreement, and we now have 18 amendments pending on a precloture basis. So we have made real progress in getting everyone involved and hopefully building more bipartisan consensus and getting on the energy debate the American people want and getting to a result where we can actually produce legislation that will help our Nation. So I started to get into the second point I wanted to discuss, which is some of the environmental aspects of the oil sands development and how technology is being deployed, with hundreds of millions of private dollars invested in new technologies that are not only producing more energy but doing it with a smaller environmental footprint. That helps to reduce the greenhouse gas emissions of oil that is produced in the oil sands. There are two projects I wish to speak about to give examples of how, if we continue to work to empower this kind of investment in new technologies, we get not only more energy more cost-effectively and more dependably but we also get it with environmental stewardship. The first project I will speak about is a project that has been undertaken in the oil sands in Alberta, Canada. Going back to this earlier chart, we can see that it is up in the Hardisty area, and this second chart is a picture of the project. It is one that is undertaken by the Shell Oil Company. It is called their Quest project. I will read a little bit about the project. Shell Canada will this year complete the world's first oil sands carbon capture and storage project. This is CCS--carbon capture and storage--something we have been working to develop in this country and apply to fossil fuels, not only things such as oil and gas but also coal. This is the new carbon capture technology. They will complete the world's first project. Continuing: The project, called Quest, will begin permanently storing CO 2 by the end of the year and will permanently store more than 1 million tons per year. Let me read that again. The project, called Quest, will begin permanently storing CO 2 by the end of the year and will permanently store more than 1 million tons per year. Quest reduces the emissions from Shell's upgrader by 35 percent--that's the equivalent of taking 175,000 cars off the road each year. Shell will transport the CO 2 50 miles north via pipeline and permanently store it more than a mile below ground under impermeable rock formations. My point is that here is an example of where a private company is working with the Province of Alberta on this project to invest hundreds of millions of dollars in carbon capture and storage technology that will not only apply to the oil sands, but--think about it--this is also technology that is not only being developed but deployed on a commercial scale in production that we can now take advantage of and use in this country to produce more energy from multiple sources-- again, smaller footprint, lower greenhouse gas. Isn't that the solution to better environmental stewardship where we get more energy that we produce here with our closest friends and allies, with better stewardship through investment by private companies in these new technologies and, in this case, working with Alberta? Alberta is also investing in this technology, but this is the innovation of our country, of our companies. This is the kind of ingenuity and [[Page S562]] innovation that helps us build the kind of future we want. In this case, it is a secure energy future by deploying these new technologies. The other point I will make as we look at this chart is that under the old system of oil sand production--remember, it is excavation, so they would be digging up this area and then extracting the oil from the oil sands. But under this new system of development, which is called in situ, they are actually drilling wells, and then they put steam down the hole to bring the oil up, and then they capture the CO 2 and store it underground, so smaller environmental footprint and lower greenhouse gas emissions. Since 1990 the greenhouse gas emissions on a per-barrel basis for oil sands production has gone down by 28 percent. So they have reduced it by almost a third. These new technologies will reduce it further going forward. This is about finding good solutions to create jobs and economic activity and energy security and take us into the future. That is why I wanted to discuss that project for just a minute. A second project I will reference is Exxon's Kearl project, spelled K-E-A-R-L. Just by way of preface, Exxon currently produces over 100,000 barrels of oil a day in the Canadian oil sands. They are going to increase that amount this year to 345,000 barrels a day. Their objective is to get to half a million barrels a day of oil produced in the Canadian oil sands. They are investing $10 billion in this project. That is their investment in this project and these new, better drilling techniques. Let me tell my colleagues a little bit about their project. Exxon is doing it differently than Shell and Quest. They are employing different technologies but investing $10 billion to reduce the environmental footprint, to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, but produce a lot of energy for Canada and for our country. Exxon's Kearl project will use cogeneration for steam, which a low- energy extraction process to recover oil, and heat integration between the extraction and treatment facilities to minimize energy consumption. As a result, oil produced from Kearl will have about the same life- cycle greenhouse gas emissions as many other crude oils refined in the United States as a result of technologies which significantly enhance environmental performance--again, smaller environmental footprint, lower greenhouse gas emissions. This is how we work to address the challenges we face, whether it is producing energy or anything else. We deploy these new technologies that enable us to do it better. Other environmental innovations for Kearl include onsite water storage to eliminate river withdrawals in low-flow periods and progressive land reclamation, which will return the land to the boreal forest. I wish to emphasize that for a minute. What we see around this site, which is actually the Shell site--this is the boreal forest. I have been to Hardisty, and I have seen the oil sands production. I was also taken out to areas where they had reclaimed land that had been formerly used to produce oil sands. Now we can't tell the difference between the land that has been reclaimed and the land that hadn't ever been used in terms of oil production. I was there and I looked at both and I couldn't tell the difference. Of course, that is subjective. You want to return it to the state it was in before it was tapped. With this newer production, there is a much smaller area that we would ultimately have to return to its original state. I wanted to touch on those two projects for a few minutes as well as point out that the Alberta Government actually requires that all land used in the development of oil sands has to be returned to the same or equivalent condition when it is no longer in use. The final point I wish to touch on for just a minute or two is another issue that has been brought up, which is pipeline safety. There have been some references to recent pipeline spills--one in Poplar, MT, actually not too far from where I live in western North Dakota. But the spill is from what is called the Poplar Pipeline, which I believe is owned by the Bridger Company. It is a pipeline that goes underneath the Yellowstone River. It was built in the 1950s, so we are talking about a pipeline that is over 50 years old. Isn't that just the point, that whether it is roads or bridges or buildings or pipelines or transmission lines or anything else, we have to make the investment in new facilities rather than just continuing to rely on old facilities? That is what I want to emphasize about the Keystone XL Pipeline project. This is an investment of $8 billion, not a penny of government investment but $8 billion in private investment in new steel and new technologies. Also, the Department of Transportation's Pipeline and Hazardous Material Safety Administration--PHMSA--the division of the Department of Transportation that oversees pipeline safety, has required 57 special conditions for this pipeline to make sure it is as safe as possible. I am going to touch on some of those to give a sense of what they are. The whole point is that here we are trying to create a business climate, a business environment where companies can put billions of dollars into these new technologies and this new infrastructure so that we can have energy as safely as possible, with the best stewardship possible, so we aren't relying on pipelines or other infrastructure that is more than 50 years old. We are trying to get that upgrade. We are not doing it at taxpayer expense. We are getting tax revenues. We will get hundreds of millions of tax revenues that will come back in from private sector projects where we are trying to empower that investment. At the same time, the PHMSA, the Department of Transportation Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration, has all these requirements that they are making part of the approval process--57 different special safety conditions for the Keystone XL Pipeline. They are conditions such as puncture resistance. For example, TransCanada is required by PHMSA in the environmental impact statement to ensure that the steel used in the pipeline can withstand impact from a 65-ton excavator with 3\1/2\-inch teeth. There is corrosion resistance coating, making sure it has a coating on it that is resistant to corrosion. There is cathodic protection. Cathodic protection is applied to a pipe so where it connects to other--it could be structures such as a bridge. It could be any place where the pipes are connected to make sure those other connections don't rust through into the pipe. For maintenance, TransCanada must submit certification that demonstrates compliance with all 57 conditions before they commence operation of the pipe. Airplanes will patrol the right of away at least 26 times a year. They will send cleaning and inspection tools through the pipeline once a year to collect and analyze basic sediment and water. Compare all of this to a pipeline that was built 50 years ago and laid on the floor of a river--versus a pipeline now, where if they have to cross a river, they use directional drilling. So they go down 25 feet below the river and put the pipe 25 feet down in the rock below the river, versus older pipelines that were just laid in there. Again, this is the new technology--the new safeguards. In horizontal drilling and directional drilling the pipe will be buried approximately 25 feet below riverbeds. So if there any riverbeds that cross, that is 25 feet below using directional drilling. There are automatic shutoff valves. So they will have automatic shutoff valves and they will be placed every 20 miles along the pipeline route. Extra miles will also be placed where there are protected water crossing and other areas of higher consequence. They can be closed remotely on either side of the line, isolating a damaged area within minutes of detection. Again, it is about making sure if there is an issue of any kind, that you can minimize and mitigate any kind of spill. With 100 percent weld inspections, there is a requirement that 100 percent of welds are inspected rather than just some of the welds under a test basis. With satellite monitoring and leak detection, Keystone XL will have more than 13,500 sensors feeding constant and detailed information about flow rates to the control center 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. That is so that if any kind of a leak is detected, it is immediately shut down so you minimize the amount of product that would leak. [[Page S563]] Those are the kinds of safety features--and there are 57 of them-- required by the administration's Pipeline and Hazardous Material Safety Administration. When we talk about pipeline safety and somebody comes in and says there is this pipe that broke so we should never have another pipe, we need to talk about that and address that in a sensible way. We have over 2 million miles of pipe in this country. The point is we do need to build new pipelines and upgrade them and take other steps to make sure the system is safe. But you don't do that by blocking investment in the new technologies and the new pipeline that will help us move product more safely, more cost-effectively, and more dependably. Those are the three issues I wanted to address. Again, I covered some of them yesterday, but I wanted to make sure that any time we had somebody coming down to offer amendments, we deferred to those individuals. I am pleased now we have 18 amendments pending on a whole gamut of issues related to this project, to this energy discussion, and to our efforts to advance a better energy future for our country. Again, I look forward to the debate this afternoon, to voting on these amendments, and to continuing to advance this legislation on behalf of the American people. I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mrs. MURRAY. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Perdue). Without objection, it is so ordered. Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in morning business. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Department of Homeland Security Funding Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I wish to take a few minutes to talk about the latest attempt by the Republicans in the House of Representatives--and a few Republicans in the Senate as well--to hold hostage the basic operation of our government, once again, over politics. While I have several issues with the Department of Homeland Security funding bill that the House has sent to us, I will first discuss this strategy we are seeing from Republicans, as the former chair of the Budget Committee and as someone who has worked across the aisle to break through gridlock in Congress. Two years ago our country was moving constantly from one manufactured crisis to the next. We had debt limit scares that were rattling our businesses and the markets, we were headed toward an absurd and unnecessary government shutdown, and people across the country were losing faith that their elected officials could get anything done when it came to the budget and to our economy. But by working together, Congressman Paul Ryan and I were able to reach a budget deal that prevented another government shutdown and showed the American people that Congress could work together to get things done. Because of that deal we were able to then pass bipartisan spending bills for the past 2 fiscal years, including 11 of the 12 appropriations bills from last year. Although we have a lot of work to do, it is clear that stability in the Federal budget makes a difference for our economy. We have to work together to build on that growth, to continue that certainty, and to make sure our economy is working for all families, not only the wealthiest few. Across the country, businesses have added more than 11 million new jobs--over 58 straight months of job growth. The unemployment rate is now under 6 percent and trending downward, and we have reduced the Federal budget deficit by over two-thirds since 2009. So when I look at the Homeland Security funding bill that the House of Representatives has now sent to us, I see a few things. I see a bill--the way it is drafted and was sent to us will tear apart families who are working hard to make it in America. I see a bill that will put our security at risk, and I see a bill that seriously threatens all of the work we have done recently, Republicans and Democrats, to keep our government functioning because the bill the House has sent over is simply unacceptable. It will not pass the Senate. Republicans know that. Let's be clear about what this bill is, it is a calculated, political gamble from our Republican colleagues. This looming showdown over funding the Department of Homeland Security is no accident. In fact, it is actually a risk they have been planning since last year all because of political pressure from the extreme anti-immigration right wing of their party. If Republicans are willing to risk funding for the Department of Homeland Security for political reasons, I believe the American people deserve to know exactly what that does mean because funding the Department of Homeland Security doesn't only keep the lights on the DHS headquarters, that funding protects our country from terrorist attacks at a time when the world is as dangerous and volatile as ever. It protects our country and American businesses from cyber attacks, a threat that is all too real as we have now seen in recent months. It supports basic security measures at our airports, at our seaports, and along the border. It even supports our Federal emergency management resources that are on call for every community in America. In my home State of Washington, this funding supports the Coast Guard, which protects shippers and sailors throughout Puget Sound, and Customs and Border Protection, which helps facilitate billions in international trade moving through my State, the most trade-dependent State in the country. Not funding these programs is a risk we cannot afford to take. It is reckless and irresponsible and, more than anything else, simply counterproductive for Republicans to put all of this on the line just to score some political points with the tea party and the far right. Unfortunately that appears exactly to be what they are doing. Once again Speaker Boehner and the House Republicans have decided they are willing to break up millions of families and deport millions of DREAMers who are victims themselves of a broken system. They have decided they are willing to stop the President's policy of focusing our law enforcement on national security threats, gang members, and violent criminals. Once again they have decided they are willing to make bipartisan, comprehensive immigration reform that much more difficult to achieve. This is much more than only an annual funding bill. This legislation is a message which has been sent to us loud and clear from House Republicans and Speaker Boehner that they are willing to continue pushing us from crisis to crisis. They are willing to play politics with our national security, and they are willing to turn their backs on millions and millions of children and families. For years now we have seen that strategy doesn't work--it doesn't work. It holds us back. But I have to say I was encouraged when Majority Leader McConnell said that at the end of the day the Senate will fund the Department of Homeland Security. It is clear the House bill will not pass the Senate, so I truly believe it is time for the majority leader to show, as he has promised, that he will let the Senate and Congress work efficiently. It is time for the majority leader to bring a clean DHS appropriations bill to the floor. Let's get it done, passed, and move on to the work that is so important to us. I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. SCHUMER. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I rise to urge my Republican colleagues to pass a clean bill to fund the Department of Homeland Security for the remainder of the fiscal year. We are now only 1 month away from a shutdown of the principal Federal agency charged with keeping Americans safe from terrorism and prepared for natural disasters. [[Page S564]] The President has said he will veto any funding bill that repeals or rolls back his Executive order on immigration, so anything but a clean bill to fund DHS means one thing and one thing alone. Republicans are unilaterally shutting down the agency. No matter what your grievance is, we shouldn't be playing politics with national security. It is alarming that even as we can now count the days, 30, until a Republican security shutdown, so many on the hard right are ready to just dismiss the consequences. Compared to their obsession with President Obama's immigration action and their desire to appease the tea party with radical and practical ideas that would not fix our system, to Republicans shutting down DHS is ``not the end of the world.'' So I will use my time to spell out what a DHS shutdown would mean for our country in the hopes that our Republican colleagues will be jolted back to reality and to common sense. Since this isn't the first time Republicans have put us through a shutdown, we actually have a very good idea as to what a DHS shutdown would look like. Here are just some of the functions that would cease if Republicans failed to put a clean bill on the floor: The bulk of DHS management and headquarter administrative support activities would cease, including much of the homeland security infrastructure that was built during the 9/11 terrorist attacks to improve command, control, and coordination of disparate frontline activities. Securing the Cities, a critical post-9/ 11 funding program that helps pay for nuclear detection capabilities in New York City, Los Angeles, and Washington, DC, could not be awarded in fiscal year 2015. The DHS Nuclear Detection Office, which since 9/11 coordinates on a daily or weekly basis with local law enforcement, will stop operating. FEMA's disaster preparedness unit would cease coordinating regular training activities for law enforcement for weapons of mass destruction events. FEMA employees in Washington and across the country who provide critical preparedness resources to local first responders would be sent home. Twenty-five percent of FEMA's headquarters and regional staff would be furloughed. FEMA personnel working on grants programs, such as funds for intelligence analysts or firefighter needs, would be furloughed, and even those personnel deemed essential would be denied paychecks until a funding bill is passed. This means we are not paying the Coast Guard, we are not paying the TSA, we are not paying the Border Patrol, the Secret Service or FEMA aid workers. So make no mistake, a DHS shutdown would hamstring our ability to combat threats to the homeland and to keep our citizens safe. The irony of course is that one of the programs that shutdown would close completely is E-Verify, which stops unscrupulous employers from hiring undocumented workers and cutting everyone's wages. So in order to make a point on immigration, our Republican colleagues are actually going to stop the program which prevents employers from hiring undocumented workers. Essentially to make a point about needing more immigration enforcement, Republicans are willing to shut down immigration enforcement. In short, I am perplexed as to why Republicans are playing this game of chicken with DHS funding because the only possible outcome that could come from withholding of a clean DHS bill is the shutdown of several critical post- 9/11 programs within the DHS and the furlough of thousands of workers paramount to our Nation's security and disaster preparedness. At a time when we need all hands on deck to keep America safe, Republican efforts to politicize our security would tie DHS's hands behind their back. So I urge my Republican colleagues in the House and Senate to drop this fool's errand and put a clean DHS funding bill on the floor as soon as possible. I yield the floor. Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mrs. SHAHEEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Mrs. SHAHEEN. Mr. President, I am here this afternoon to discuss the two concerns I have about the bill currently before the Senate--the regulation that would grant immediate approval of the Presidential permit necessary to construct and operate the Keystone XL Pipeline. First and foremost, I believe a thorough regulatory review process is critical for any major infrastructure project, particularly one that will cross our country's border. Regulatory review enables the identification of economic impacts from a major project and, more importantly, environmental impacts that infrastructure projects such as the Keystone Pipeline may bring. We shouldn't trade transparency for expediency when it comes to the construction of an international project that has such scope. I can't support a bill that sacrifices these important protections. That is why I voted in the past against legislation to allow the Keystone XL Pipeline to circumvent the normal review process, and that is why I intend to again vote against this bill. I also have a number of concerns about the impact of the Keystone Pipeline on our environment. In the past 2 weeks, we have had a spirited debate on this floor, and a number of my colleagues have come to the floor to talk about the pipeline oilspills we have seen in this country. Just a few days ago, an oil pipeline burst, leaking 50,000 gallons of crude oil into the Yellowstone River in Montana. Yet this spill pales in comparison to the 2010 Kalamazoo River oil spill where over 1 million gallons of oil sands poured into Talmadge Creek in Michigan. The cleanup has already cost more than $1 billion and taken over 4 years to complete. In fact, to date there has been no authoritative study on how the spills of oil sands crude may differ from those of conventional crude oil. This means we have no idea about the spill's long-term effects on the health of wildlife in that river. The other issue that has been raced onto the floor is the fact that right now, because of the way we define crude oil, TransCanada-- supporting and planning to build the Keystone Pipeline--is not required to pay into the federal oil spill liability trust fund, which would ensure taxpayers against any spills. So we have this out-of-state, out- of-country foreign company that is coming in to build this pipeline, and yet they are not required to pay, as any American company would be, into the oil spill liability trust fund. That, to me, doesn't make sense. Circumventing the regulatory process for Keystone prevents us from understanding the health hazards that we would face should another spill occur. I am also concerned that construction of the Keystone Pipeline will increase carbon emissions and undermine some of the most critical climate policies that we have in place. The pipeline poses threats to our environment that have already been identified. Tar sands greenhouse gas emissions are 81 percent greater than those of conventional oil. That is because the production of oil sands crude is more energy intensive, or more greenhouse gas intensive, than conventional crude production. Additional processes are required to extract the oil, remove the sand, and dilute the oil so that it can flow in a pipeline. In addition, if the pipeline is approved, much of the boreal wetlands in Alberta, Canada, which act as a carbon sink, would be destroyed, releasing 11 million to 47 million metric tons of CO 2 into the atmosphere. One of the reasons I am concerned about circumventing the regulatory process is because I believe this could set a precedent for a rushed approval of infrastructure projects currently under consideration in New Hampshire. In New Hampshire, we have two projects that really merit careful consideration and thorough review that could be affected by a precedent that says we should ignore the regulatory process. In New Hampshire, the Northern Pass transmission proposal, which proposes to deliver hydropower from Quebec into the New England energy markets and goes through northern New Hampshire, would bring power to southern New England, but New Hampshire wouldn't benefit. And any suggestion that we would circumvent the [[Page S565]] process is a real concern to people in New Hampshire who would be affected by that project. The other project is the potential reversal of the Portland-Montreal pipeline, which, if the determination were made to do this, would send oil sands through many New Hampshire communities, and that oil would then be shipped to foreign countries. So if we set the precedent of trading transparency for expediency with Keystone, without requiring the completion of a comprehensive approval process, local communities in New Hampshire may not have a meaningful voice in the process that deals with Northern Pass or reversing the Portland-Montreal pipeline. I think that is unacceptable. These three projects--Keystone, Northern Pass, and Portland- Montreal--have one important thing in common: They should undergo the comprehensive environmental and safety approval process required by existing law, and that should be done independent of politics. Circumventing the Presidential permitting process for cross-border pipelines and electric transmission facilities avoids the due process that is needed to determine whether these projects are in the best interests of the country. In New Hampshire, Northern Pass and the Portland-Montreal pipeline have raised serious concerns for people who live in areas impacted by these projects. That is why I worked with the entire New Hampshire congressional delegation in a bipartisan way to ensure that both projects undergo a transparent, thorough, and comprehensive review process. That allows the input of local communities who will be affected by these projects. Like people in New Hampshire and across the country, I share concerns about our Nation's energy future. Throughout my career I have fought for smart policies that will reduce energy costs in New Hampshire and across the country, that will help create jobs, and will protect our air and water from pollution. But I don't believe mandating a project that bypasses the approval process is a smart policy. We need to be smart and thoughtful about our energy future. I think it would set a dangerous precedent for other projects that could have serious consequences in New Hampshire and in other States around the country. I appreciate the debate we have had here on the Senate floor about the Keystone Pipeline, but I will be opposing this bill. I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. NELSON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Ukraine and Syria Mr. NELSON. Mr. President, I want to speak to the Senate about Ukraine and also about Syria. These are two parts of the world that are of particular critical importance to the United States foreign policy today because of what they portend for the future. The fact that our relationship is so rocky with the President of Russia, President Putin, who right up to just a few days after the Olympics suddenly shows his true colors when he invades Crimea, a part of Ukraine, despite all of the agreements when the Soviet Union broke up in the late eighties, early nineties, the agreements that in exchange for moving all of the nuclear weapons out of Ukraine back into Russia, that Russia would forever recognize and respect the sovereignty of Ukraine--well, that went out the window right after the Olympics, and Mr. Putin showed his true colors. He could couch it in all kinds of terms, that there is a Russian naval base that was there, but the fact is the whole world knows what he did, and no one could do anything about it. Then he started to move on the eastern part of Ukraine, and that, of course, is going on as we speak. The so-called rebels aren't really rebels. They are a front for the Russian military propped up with actual troops of the Russian military, sometimes disguised as being free and independent players simply because they don't have on their Russian uniforms; but in fact they have taken them off and put on uniforms that are not Russian uniforms to say that they are part of the rebel force. It is a ruse and everybody knows it is a ruse. I went last August to Ukraine, spoke with almost all of the top-level members of the government and asked what it was they needed. To my surprise, at the time they did not say they needed lethal equipment. They needed up-to-date, up-to-the-minute intelligence, and they needed training. I have urged the U.S. Government to provide that, and we are providing a number of things. This Senator thinks it is clearly in the interest of the United States that we provide more assistance to the Government of Ukraine so their military can have the equipment, including lethal assistance, to hold off Putin's aggression in Eastern Ukraine. This is a particularly critical time. I was there last summer, but what has happened in the meantime is over the course of the past year oil has gone from $100 to $46 a barrel. I remember asking someone when I was there and in the Baltic States what did oil need to get to and below in order for Mr. Putin to start really feeling the pinch, and they said anything under $85 a barrel. It is now around $46 a barrel. Although Russia has significant reserves as of a few months ago, about $450 billion of cash in reserves, that is lower now. Those reserves will hold them for a while because of the price they are getting for their oil. They don't have high production costs in Russia, but because the price is so much lower--half of what they were getting--their revenue is significantly down and therefore all of the money that was being supplied by the Russian Government for so many things, a plethora of different social programs--guess who is feeling the pinch. The people of Russia. So the aggressiveness of Mr. Putin internationally is an attempt to try to take his people's eye off of their own financial depravity and, in fact, get it on the international scene where the President of Russia is quite adept at pounding his chest and banging his fist. The Ukrainians are once again fighting right now as we speak for their territory. The Ukrainian Government took back the Donetsk airport in Eastern Ukraine. Then the rebels came back. And I say ``rebels'' with a wry smile. I mean this is the Russian Army. They came back and they took it again. Last week those Russian-backed rebels broke a shaky ceasefire agreement and they renewed the fighting with the Ukrainian Government military. This Senator feels that we have got to do more to help these people who are trying to protect their independence. If you recall, last year we passed the Ukraine Freedom Support Act which provides further sanctions and lethal aid such as antitank and anti- armor weapons, counterartillery radars, secure communications equipment, and tactical surveillance drones. All of that was needed. The fighting that is following appears to be a steady buildup of Russian support for the rebels. General Hodges, the U.S. Army commander in Europe, said last week that since December Russia had doubled its support for the rebels. General Breedlove, the NATO Supreme Commander, said that Russian electronic warfare and defense systems have been detected in the conflict areas. So let's not fool ourselves, the Russian Army is in there and we have to do more to help them. On Syria, this Senator feels where we are having success right now in Iraq against ISIS with the multiple strikes from the air, with training up the Iraqi Army as the boots on the ground, including some American boots on the ground that are advisers and trainers--at the end of the day we are going to have to do this in Syria if we are going to be successful. It is a lot more complicated in Syria because of the Assad government. The Free Syrian Army we are now starting to train--it is almost an impossible task. We train them, they go in, they try to attack ISIS. ISIS attacks them, but so does the Assad regime. That is not a recipe for success. We are working with the vetted opposition fighters to go after ISIS in Syria. We have to supply support. We have to supply lethal support in addition to the training and equipment in [[Page S566]] order for them to be successful. And for them to be successful, it is absolutely in the interest of the United States. Congress has approved the training and equipping of vetted elements of the Syrian opposition, and the Department of Defense recently announced it will deploy 400 personnel in that effort. We are going to have to do a lot more. The American people are tired of war, and yet we have a new kind of enemy, and we are going to have to take it right to them where they are. Mr. President, I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah. (The remarks of Mr. Hatch pertaining to the introduction of S. 295 are printed in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced Bills and Joint Resolutions.'') Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I wish to say a few words about some of the amendments we will be voting on later this afternoon--three of them in particular. The amendments I am referring to are the Merkley amendment No. 125, the Carper amendment No. 120, and the Heitkamp amendment No. 133. All three of these amendments address sensitive tax issues that fall squarely into the jurisdiction of the Senate Finance Committee, and all of them address issues that are likely to be litigated as the Finance Committee continues its efforts toward comprehensive tax reform. The Finance Committee is going to be very active in this Congress. We had our first bipartisan markup this morning. We already had two hearings, with more scheduled for next week, and perhaps more importantly--at least in the context of these three votes we will be having today--we have taken concrete steps in a process we believe will end in the introduction of bipartisan tax reform legislation. We have appointed five tax reform working groups to address the various areas of reform. Our hope is that over the next few months these working groups will study the issues and provide ideas we can use as we develop a comprehensive tax reform proposal. Ranking Member Wyden is on board with this effort. We are working together every step of the way. If we start singling out individual tax issues here on the floor--even issues Members may feel passionately about--we are going to undermine this bipartisan process. Virtually everyone in both parties agrees that we need to fix our broken, inefficient Tax Code. Sure, there are disagreements on what the substance of tax reform should look like, but there is a growing consensus on the need for reform, which is encouraging. If we are going to be successful in tax reform, we need to make sure these issues are addressed in the tax-writing committees. I think it is safe to say that all of the issues my colleagues are trying to address with their amendments are going to be litigated one way or another in the Finance Committee's efforts this year. That being the case, raising these issues as floor amendments on an unrelated bill is, in my view, very counterproductive. Finally, I would like to note that these amendments would all be subject to a constitutional point of order as they all deal with revenue and would need to be passed first by the House of Representatives. I am not going to raise that point of order at this time; I just want to make note of it for the record. Given all of these concerns, I hope my colleagues--Senators Merkley, Carper, and Heitkamp--will withdraw these amendments so these issues can be addressed in the proper forum. If they do not withdraw their amendments, I plan to vote against all three of them and urge all of my colleagues--particularly those who have an interest in a successful tax reform effort--to do the same. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cruz). The Senator from Colorado. Mr. BENNET. I congratulate the Presiding Officer, and I also congratulate Chairman Hatch for the unanimous vote he got in today's markup in the Finance Committee. It was a great bipartisan start to our work, as he said. I hope we will continue to have these discussions in that manner. Amendment No. 92, as Modified Mr. BENNET. Mr. President, I wish to speak today about the Burr- Bennet amendment No. 92, which we are slated to vote on later today. I will be brief because it is pretty straightforward. The amendment simply reauthorizes the Land and Water Conservation Fund and ensures that a dedicated portion of LWCF funds go to provide new access for our Nation's sports men and women. As many in this body know, the Land and Water Conservation Fund is one of the country's best and most important conservation programs. It is authorized to provide $900 million annually for efforts to preserve and increase access to our public lands and waterways. These resources historically have been used for projects that range from building city parks, to purchasing small parcels of isolated land from willing sellers, all the way to preserving the Nation's historic battlefields. This past summer in Colorado, we completed a huge LWCF project that retired several old mining claims on the San Juan National Forest near the town of Ophir. Over the Fourth of July weekend, the town invited me and my family to join them in a celebration of the accomplishment, and we took them up on that offer without a moment's hesitation. Ophir sits at 9,600 feet above sea level. It is the kind of place that has a sign on its main road--clearly painted by the kids who live in the town--indicating that their population totals 163 people, including, according to the sign, 55 kids, 30 dogs, and 15 cats. When we pulled in on the morning of the celebration, it seemed to me that the entire town was there. Over the course of that day--which included a hike, a picnic, and a formal program--it was amazing to hear from the community about the importance of this LWCF project and how many years so many people in the town devoted themselves to getting it done. Many of our mountain communities get huge portions of their revenue and business through recreation and tourism, and it is for some of these reasons that the town felt LWCF literally helped cement its economic future. I was an LWCF supporter before that visit, but that day really drove home the value of the program to me. That is only one of countless stories from Colorado. I know it can be replicated thousands of times across the country in all 50 States. Those stories and accomplishments alone make this amendment worth supporting. Let's also remember that when we are talking about LWCF, we are not talking about taxpayer dollars. When Congress crafted the measure back in 1965, they had a very innovative solution for how to pay for their concept. Instead of using taxpayer dollars from the Treasury, they decided to dedicate a portion of the revenue the government collects from offshore oil drilling to fund LWCF. This argument was very simple and elegant. As we deplete our natural resources--offshore reserves of oil and gas in this case--we ought to support the conservation of another natural resource: our lands and waterways. As I mentioned, Congress passed a law in 1965, and now it is time to reauthorize it. I thank Senator Burr, who has shown great leadership in crafting the amendment to do just that. This amendment is thoroughly bipartisan and enjoys cosponsors such as Senator Ayotte, Senator Alexander, and Senator Tillis, just to name a few. In fact, I am told there are 246 amendments that have been filed on this bill, and not one amendment has the number of cosponsors that this amendment does. This amendment has more cosponsors than any of the remaining 245 amendments. Before I close and urge my colleagues to vote yes, I want to paraphrase something I said on the floor last week about another amendment. Conservation policies such as LWCF are important to the American people. Protecting our land and water is mom-and-apple-pie stuff in Colorado, and I know our State is not the only one. Conserved lands and wide-open spaces are a huge economic driver across our country, and it is part of who we are in the West. We are not only talking about backcountry parcels, such as the one I visited in Ophir, we are talking about building new parks in inner cities and providing new access to hunters and anglers. The LWCF does all of these things and more. [[Page S567]] I say to my colleagues, if you are for city kids getting a new playground or making sure we protect gold medal trout streams or any number of benefits in between, then you need to be for amendment No. 92 from Senator Burr. I urge all of my colleagues to support the measure when it comes time for a vote later this evening. I think we would make a very meaningful statement about where the Senate is headed if we could supply the votes necessary to actually adopt this amendment. I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. CARDIN. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Flake). Without objection, it is so ordered. Amendment No. 75 Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, it is my understanding that in about a minute we are going to be voting on the first of a series of amendments. The first amendment is the amendment I have offered which I talked about before. I want to remind my colleagues what this amendment does. First, it would require a notification to Governors and to county officials of risks to their drinking water supplies that may be caused by the Keystone Pipeline. Second, the local officials would have the right to bring that information back to the Federal Government so that action could be taken in order to protect their drinking water supplies. Third, it provides a right of action for property owners for damages caused to their wells and drinking water as a direct result of the Keystone Pipeline construction. This is a pretty straightforward amendment. It provides States rights in knowing what is happening with regard to their drinking water, and it provides property owners rights for the damages that could be caused as a result of Keystone. I would urge my colleagues to support the amendment. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time in opposition? The Senator from Alaska. Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I would urge colleagues to oppose the Cardin amendment. In review, it appears that it is designed to halt the construction of this pipeline before it even begins. The amendment tells the President to provide this analysis of the potential risks to public health and environment from a leak or rupture and to provide that to every municipality and every county along the route, as well as to the Governors. Then the Governor can petition the President to effectively locate the pipeline somewhere else, at which point, again, construction could never commence. The Governors of Montana, South Dakota, and Nebraska have already approved the pipeline route through their States. So this amendment is an effort, I think, to build that opposition over contamination fears and in turn, pressure those Governors to reverse their positions and halt the pipeline's construction. I think it is important for colleagues to understand the risks to the water supplies along the pipeline path were examined by the State Department's final SEIS. They were found to be not significant. Again, I will vote no on this amendment and strongly encourage my colleagues to join me with this. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the question occurs on agreeing to amendment No. 75. Mr. CARDIN. I ask for the yeas and nays. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There appears to be a sufficient second. The clerk will call the roll. The legislative clerk called the roll. Mr. CORNYN. The following Senator is necessarily absent: the Senator from Florida (Mr. Rubio). Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the Senator from Nevada (Mr. Reid) is necessarily absent. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Are there any other Senators in the Chamber desiring to vote? The result was announced--yeas 36, nays 62, as follows: [Rollcall Vote No. 31 Leg.] YEAS--36 Baldwin Blumenthal Booker Boxer Brown Cantwell Cardin Casey Coons Durbin Feinstein Franken Gillibrand Heinrich Hirono Kaine King Leahy Markey Menendez Merkley Mikulski Murphy Murray Nelson Peters Reed Sanders Schatz Schumer Shaheen Stabenow Udall Warren Whitehouse Wyden NAYS--62 Alexander Ayotte Barrasso Bennet Blunt Boozman Burr Capito Carper Cassidy Coats Cochran Collins Corker Cornyn Cotton Crapo Cruz Daines Donnelly Enzi Ernst Fischer Flake Gardner Graham Grassley Hatch Heitkamp Heller Hoeven Inhofe Isakson Johnson Kirk Klobuchar Lankford Lee Manchin McCain McCaskill McConnell Moran Murkowski Paul Perdue Portman Risch Roberts Rounds Sasse Scott Sessions Shelby Sullivan Tester Thune Tillis Toomey Vitter Warner Wicker NOT VOTING--2 Reid Rubio The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order requiring 60 votes for the adoption of this amendment, the amendment is rejected. Change of Vote Ms. HEITKAMP. Mr. President, on rollcall No. 31, I voted yea. It was my intention to vote nay. Therefore, I ask unanimous consent that I be permitted to change my vote, since it will not affect the outcome of the vote. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. (The foregoing tally has been changed to reflect the above order.) Ms. MURKOWSKI. I move to reconsider the vote. Mr. WICKER. I move to lay that motion on the table. The motion to lay on the table was agreed to. Amendment No. 70 The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there is now 2 minutes of debate prior to a vote in relation to amendment No. 70, offered by the Senator from Michigan, Mr. Peters. Who yields time? The Senator from Michigan. Mr. PETERS. Mr. President, as Michiganders, Senator Stabenow and I know firsthand how important the Great Lakes are. The lakes are a vital natural resource and an economic engine for our State, region, and the entire country. Unfortunately, Michiganders also know firsthand the environmental dangers and risks when it comes to pipeline leaks. We had the worst inland pipeline leak in our Nation's history near Kalamazoo, MI. Cleanup has taken over 4 years and has cost $1.2 billion. There is a 60-year-old pipeline under the Straits of Mackinac where Lake Michigan and Lake Huron come together. I cannot even fathom what would happen if there were an accident that contaminated the Great Lakes. The results would be catastrophic not only for the Great Lakes but also the entire country. That is why we need to act now and act quickly, and I urge my colleagues to support the Peters-Stabenow amendment. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska. Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I am not entirely certain I like this amendment. This is the first I have heard PHMSA may not have the resources to do its job. It does seem fair to have PHMSA come tell us if they do not have adequate resources. What I most strongly oppose with this amendment is its attempt to tie the construction of the Keystone XL Pipeline to an unrelated pipeline in a different State. There is no limit for the PHMSA study and certification included here, so we could be looking, in addition to the already 2,300-some-odd days this delay has been in place, at further delays. If my colleagues from Michigan are interested in a PHMSA study, I recommend they introduce their effort as a stand-alone bill so it can be considered by the committee of jurisdiction. If it is needed, we can move it through the regular order and certainly consider it in the future. I would ask my colleagues to oppose this amendment, and I remind colleagues that we are on 10-minute votes. [[Page S568]] The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the Peters amendment. Ms. MURKOWSKI. I ask for the yeas and nays. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There appears to be a sufficient second. The clerk will call the roll. The legislative clerk called the roll. Mr. CORNYN. The following Senator is necessarily absent: the Senator from Florida (Mr. Rubio). Mr. DURBIN.

I move to lay that motion on the table. The motion to lay on the table was agreed to. Amendment No. 23 The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there is now 2 minutes of debate equally divided prior to a vote in relation to amendment No. 23, offered by the Senator from Vermont. The Senator from Vermont. Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, the scientific community tells us very clearly that if we are going to reverse climate change and the great dangers it poses for our country and the planet, we must move aggressively to transform our energy system away from fossil fuels to energy efficiency and sustainable energy. This amendment would provide a 15-percent rebate to homeowners so that we could install 10 million new solar rooftops across the country within 10 years. This would result in enough new electrical generation to retire nearly 20 percent of our dirty coal-fired plants and create a significant number of new jobs. So if we are interested in reversing the dangers of climate change and creating jobs, I would urge Senators to support this amendment. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska. Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, the sponsor of this bill knows that I, too, am a supporter of solar, and I think we all are, but it is important to recognize what this measure would do. When we are talking about the benefits to this country and how much it will cost, it is important to understand this. When this was first introduced in the 110th Congress, the goal of 10 million solar roofs legislation was too costly, but we have since seen decreased costs and growth in the solar industry that have made this Federal assistance unnecessary. We have seen the residential solar market grow, we have seen the costs drop. The cost of the solar systems have dropped about 60 percent in the last 4 years. Despite these trends, we are not close to reaching that 1 million mark let alone the 10 million installations. So the real question is, How much is this going to cost us to achieve? The proposed rebate per system is the lesser of 15 percent of the initial capital cost. This puts the Federal Government on the hook for up to $100 billion to pay for these installations. We can debate the merits of jobs and job creation, but I again urge my colleagues to oppose the Sanders amendment. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time has expired. The question is on agreeing to the Sanders amendment. Ms. STABENOW. I ask for the yeas and nays. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There is a sufficient second. The clerk will call the roll. The legislative clerk called the roll. Mr. CORNYN. The following Senator is necessarily absent: the Senator from Florida (Mr. Rubio). Mr. DURBIN.

I move to lay that motion on the table. The motion to lay on the table was agreed to. Amendment No. 15 The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there is 2 minutes of debate equally divided prior to a vote in relation to amendment No. 15, offered by the Senator from Texas, Mr. Cruz. The Senator from Texas. Mr. CRUZ. Mr. President, this amendment would expedite the export of liquid natural gas and would provide countries that are members of the WTO the same expedited process that is currently available to free- trade agreement countries. There are now in the Department of Energy some 28 applications pending to export liquid natural gas. This should be an amendment that would bring together Republicans and Democrats. A recent study showed that allowing us to export LNG could create as many as 450,000 new jobs by 2035 that could produce GDP growth of up to an additional $73.6 billion and produce 76,000 more manufacturing jobs. It would aid our allies such as Ukraine, the Baltics, and Europe, and would weaken countries such as Russia that would use natural gas for economic blackmail. I would urge all Senators to support this amendment. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts. Mr. MARKEY. The amendment offered by the Senator from Texas is [[Page S569]] drafted so broadly that it allows just about every nation which is a member of the World Trade Organization to automatically receive natural gas exported from the United States of America. The process is just eliminated--automatic. What will that do? No. 1, it will increase prices to American consumers. The Energy Information Agency has already determined that the LNG export facilities already approved are going to lead to a 50- percent increase in the price of natural gas here in America. It would jeopardize American manufacturing which has seen 700,000 new jobs created in the last 5 years in America largely because of low-priced natural gas. It is going to increase carbon pollution because it is going to slow the pace of change from coal over to natural gas in the generation of electricity. It is going to undermine our trade negotiations because it is all going to be given away here on the Senate floor. And, finally, it is going to harm our national security, because if we converted one-third of our trucks and buses, it backs out all the oil that we import from the Persian Gulf by using natural gas in American vehicles. We are going to ship jobs along with that gas going overseas. I urge a ``no'' vote on the Cruz amendment. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.

Under the previous order, there will now be 2 minutes of debate equally divided prior to a vote in relation to amendment No. 125, offered by the Senator from Oregon, Mr. Merkley. The Senator from Washington. Amendment No. 125 Withdrawn Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Merkley amendment No. 125 be withdrawn. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is so ordered. The amendment is withdrawn. Amendment No. 73 The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there will be 2 minutes of debate equally divided prior to a vote in relation to amendment No. 73, offered by the Senator from Kansas, Mr. Moran. The Senator from Kansas. Mr. MORAN. Mr. President, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service has determined that the lesser prairie chicken should be listed in a number of States, including Kansas, as a threatened species. The lesser prairie chicken has had a significant history in our State and a significant population of birds, but as a result of a drought, the habitat for the lesser prairie chicken and other wildlife has been diminished and the number of birds has decreased. The consequences of listing the lesser prairie chicken that results from a drought is so dramatic and so damaging to the Kansas economy and to the farmers and ranchers and the use of their lands, to the oil and gas industry and the exploration of oil and gas, and to the utility industry in regard to the production and transmission of electricity that this amendment is necessary to set aside that listing as a threatened species and to allow interest holders in Kansas to come together and find a commonsense solution based upon sound science to protect the habitat of this bird. This is not just a Kansas issue, and in fact, this species is only the precursor to problems others will have in their States. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired. The Senator from New Mexico. Mr. UDALL. Mr. President, I rise today to oppose the Moran amendment, which would delist the lesser prairie chicken as a threatened species. To be clear, I appreciate some of the concerns about this listing by farmers, ranchers, and industry. I am concerned about any unintended consequences this listing may have on rural New Mexicans. I strongly support and I assume the Senator from Kansas supports the bipartisan five-State effort for a thorough review. The Fish and Wildlife Service took numerous steps in this process to respond to all stakeholders and to enable habitat conservation and economic growth. New Mexico has been and continues to be a leader in cooperative conservation in places where the prairie chicken is found. Ranchers and oil and gas industries deserve their praise for their efforts. So it is working and the sky is not falling, but we should not take this top-down political approach. Listing and delisting of the species by Congress goes against the intent of the law, which requires the government to make these decisions based on science, not politics. I urge my colleagues to vote no. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired. The question is on agreeing to the Moran amendment. Mr. McCONNELL.

Amendment No. 148 Under the previous order, there is now 2 minutes of debate equally divided prior to a vote in relation to amendment No. 148, offered by the Senator from Rhode Island, Mr. Whitehouse. The Senator from Rhode Island. Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, the underlying measure benefits specific investors, specific corporations, and pushes regulatory approval of a specific project. In that sense, it has all the earmarks of the biggest earmark ever. We have learned from other history with earmarks that when you have a project that benefits specific investors and specific corporations and specific entities, there is a valuable premium on having the public know about the campaign contributions relative to that project. This bill requires the disclosure of over $10,000 in campaign contributions from entities that will make more than $1 million off this project. It is the type of transparency that many of my Republican colleagues had been for before they were against it. I urge an ``aye'' vote. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired. The Senator from Alaska. Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, this amendment is virtually identical to the text of what we saw last year. It was tabled by a vote of 52 to 43. This amendment is not relevant to this debate. It is as unnecessary now as it was the first time we voted on it. To the extent it is legal for a person or a company to make a campaign contribution, Federal and State election laws require public disclosure of those campaign contributions. Any other more general political activities a company or a person may choose to engage in are governed by existing laws and regulations as well. For that reason, I am going to be opposing this amendment for a second time and would encourage my colleagues to do as well. The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the previous order, there is now 2 minutes of debate equally divided prior to a vote in relation to amendment No. 132, offered by the Senator from Montana, Mr. Daines. The Senator from Montana. Mr. DAINES. Mr. President, my amendment simply expresses the sense of Congress that all future national monument designations should be subject to consultation with local governments and the approval of the Governor and legislature of the States in which such designation would occur. This amendment ensures that the people affected most by these designations have a seat at the table and their voices are heard. The current administration, as well as past administrations--both Republican and Democratic--have made efforts to stretch the intent of the Antiquities Act, threatening Montanans' ability to manage our State's resources. It is a trend we are seeing. Any bill designation that impacts land management should be locally driven, not spearheaded in Washington. I urge my colleagues to support this amendment. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington. Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, speaking in opposition to this amendment, there is a reason why they call it a national monument. That is because it is a national process, and it is a national decision. Yes, Presidents of the United States consult with Governors and consult with State legislators, but they are not required to have a bill or the authority of the Governor before they make a national monument. Nearly half of our national parks, including the Grand Canyon and Olympic National Park, were designated under this Antiquities Act. Sixteen Presidents--eight Republicans and eight Democrats--have designated over 130 national monuments since Teddy Roosevelt signed this act in 1906. I think it has worked well for the United States of America. Please turn down this amendment. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to amendment No. 132, the Daines amendment.

Under the previous order, there is now 2 minutes of debate equally divided prior to a vote in relation to amendment No. 115, offered by the Senator from Delaware, Mr. Coons. The Senator from Delaware. Mr. COONS. Mr. President, we need to take steps now to prepare for the coming impact of climate change on our Nation's infrastructure. The Federal Government plays a crucial role in protecting our infrastructure and partnering with State and Federal, tribal, and local governments to prepare. The Federal Government, including our Pentagon and the highway administration, is already planning and preparing for these impacts. Many States are as well. From my home State of Delaware to Alaska to Florida, all are already planning responsibly for the future impacts of climate change. Preparing now is only responsible, because every dollar invested in planning and preparing is projected to save us up to $4 in future disaster relief. This amendment is supported by a number of organizations--the American Society of Civil Engineers, the National Wildlife Federation, the Union of Concerned Scientists, and others. This amendment does not speak to the human role in climate change or emissions. It simply acknowledges that climate change is having an impact on our infrastructure and suggests that planning is responsible. I urge my colleagues to support this amendment. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska. Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I had a conversation with our colleague from Delaware, and I told him I think this is an area where we might be able to work together. I had actually introduced an amendment that deals with the adaptation that helps to assist those communities that have been affected by climate. We see that up in the coastline of Alaska. Senator Merkley has an amendment that also deals with adaptation. This is about resilience. I am going to oppose the sense-of-the-Senate at this time because of some of the language. I get a little confused or am not certain we are stating it in the right manner. But I do think this process has been healthy in the sense that by having an opportunity to have amendments come forward, we find out where there might be areas where we can work to develop future initiatives that we all might be able to support on a bipartisan basis. I look forward to working with the Senator from Delaware. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment. Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.

Under the previous order, there will now be 2 minutes of debate equally divided prior to a vote in relation to amendment No. 35, offered by the Senator from Maine, Ms. Collins. The Senator from Maine. Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, the Senator from Virginia, Mr. Warner, and I are offering an amendment that would help school officials to learn about existing Federal programs to improve energy efficiency in order to reduce school energy costs. It would not authorize any new programs or any new funding. It would simply require a review of existing Federal programs and require the Department of Energy to establish a coordinating structure so that schools can more easily navigate the many programs that are scattered across the Federal Government. I know of no opposition to the amendment. To try to make life easier for my colleagues, if it is acceptable to the managers, I would be happy to accept a voice vote. I don't know if my colleague from Virginia has any comments he would like to make. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia. Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I agree with the Senator from Maine, and I would urge a voice vote as well. Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I thank both Senators, and I ask unanimous consent that the 60-vote affirmative threshold on the Collins amendment be vitiated, and I urge its adoption by voice vote. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is so ordered. Is there any further debate on the Collins amendment No. 35? If not, the question is on agreeing to the amendment. The amendment (No. 35) was agreed to. Amendment No. 120 The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there is now 2 minutes of debate equally divided prior to a vote in relation to amendment No. 120, offered by the Senator from Delaware, Mr. Carper. The Senator from Washington. Amendment No. 120 Withdrawn Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Carper amendment No. 120 be withdrawn. [[Page S572]] The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is so ordered. The amendment is withdrawn. Amendment No. 166 The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there will now be 2 minutes of debate equally divided prior to a vote in relation to amendment No. 166, offered by the Senator from Alaska, Ms. Murkowski. The Senator from Alaska. Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I have had an opportunity to speak on this amendment several different times. Effectively, what we are doing is releasing wilderness study areas if within 1 year of receiving the recommendation Congress has not yet designated the study area as wilderness. Effectively, what is happening is designations will come from the administration. Congress is the entity that is to approve them. But in the interim these areas are managed as de facto wilderness. In fact, many areas have been managed as de facto wilderness for decades because the Congress has not acted. So simply, what we do in this amendment is to put a time period. Until the Congress makes a final determination on the wilderness study area, these areas will be determined not to be wilderness and not managed as such. But they are putting a time parameter on that so that they are not managed as wilderness areas indefinitely. I would urge a ``yes'' vote from my colleagues. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington. Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, this is a sweeping attack on millions of acres of land recommended for wilderness. This would nullify much of the Obama administration's plan for the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge and would also immediately abolish wilderness studies on BLM lands in 12 Western States. It would also abolish protection for 2.3 million acres in national wildlife refuges. These lands have been refuges, and they should be managed accordingly. So I would ask my colleagues to oppose this amendment. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the Murkowski Amendment No. 166. Ms. MURKOWSKI. I ask for the yeas and nays. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There appears to be a sufficient second. The clerk will call the roll. The assistant bill clerk called the roll. Mr. CORNYN. The following Senator is necessarily absent: the Senator from Florida (Mr. Rubio). Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the Senator from Nevada (Mr. Reid) is necessarily absent. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Are there any other Senators in the Chamber desiring to vote? The result was announced--yeas 50, nays 48, as follows: [Rollcall Vote No. 39 Leg.] YEAS--50 Barrasso Blunt Boozman Burr Capito Cassidy Coats Cochran Corker Cornyn Cotton Crapo Cruz Daines Enzi Ernst Fischer Flake Graham Grassley Hatch Heller Hoeven Inhofe Isakson Johnson Kirk Lankford Lee Manchin McCain McConnell Moran Murkowski Paul Perdue Portman Risch Roberts Rounds Sasse Scott Sessions Shelby Sullivan Thune Tillis Toomey Vitter Wicker NAYS--48 Alexander Ayotte Baldwin Bennet Blumenthal Booker Boxer Brown Cantwell Cardin Carper Casey Collins Coons Donnelly Durbin Feinstein Franken Gardner Gillibrand Heinrich Heitkamp Hirono Kaine King Klobuchar Leahy Markey McCaskill Menendez Merkley Mikulski Murphy Murray Nelson Peters Reed Sanders Schatz Schumer Shaheen Stabenow Tester Udall Warner Warren Whitehouse Wyden NOT VOTING--2 Reid Rubio The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order requiring 60 votes for the adoption of this amendment, the amendment is rejected. Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote. Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I move to lay that motion on the table. The motion to lay on the table was agreed to. Amendment No. 133 The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there will now be 2 minutes of debate equally divided prior to a vote in relation to amendment No. 133, offered by the Senator from North Dakota, Ms. Heitkamp. The Senator from North Dakota. Ms. HEITKAMP. Mr. President, this amendment will provide a sense of the Senate that we will provide some certainty to the American wind and other renewable industries by taking a look at the production tax credits and actually having a forward progress report so that they know exactly what the rules will be in the future, however short or long that may be. Every year, as we do the tax extenders, there are people waiting to find out if they still have a job. People in my State are waiting to know whether they are going to be put to work the next day or even the next week based on what this Congress does. It is so critical that we actually have predictability in this industry. This is a jobs bill, and it is an energy bill. I can't imagine anything more germane to the Keystone XL Pipeline than a bill that provides both jobs and certainty to an ``all of the above'' essential, which is wind. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? The Senator from Arizona. Mr. FLAKE. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to this amendment. I believe we do need more certainty, and the certainty ought to be that it is time for this tax credit--particularly the wind PTC--to expire. This was enacted 23 years ago as a temporary tax measure. There has been a lot of wind that has blown since that time, and we have a mature industry. In fact, the other day the President said we are No. 1 in the world in wind power. We ought to have more certainty, and the certainty that needs to be there is that the tax credit is going to end and that we stop picking winners and losers in the energy economy. With that, I yield the floor. Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I would like to speak on Amendment No. 133, offered by Senator Heitkamp of North Dakota. The amendment is a sense of Congress that the renewable electricity tax credit should be extended for 5 years. While I supported the amendment, I would like to express my concerns regarding the consideration of this amendment at this time. I have been an outspoken supporter of renewable energy for many years. In fact, I first authored the wind production tax credit in 1992 to drive this renewable energy technology. I have worked for many years to provide as much certainty as possible to grow the domestic wind industry. Iowa has seen an enormous investment in wind energy manufacturing and wind farm development. I know firsthand the boom-and- bust cycle that exists for renewable energy producers when Congress fails to extend these critically important tax incentives. But I also know this credit won't go on forever. It was never meant to, and it shouldn't. In 2012 the wind industry was the only industry to put forward a phaseout plan. A number of my colleagues here in the Senate have been working to construct a responsible, multiyear phaseout of the wind tax credit. That is why I am somewhat puzzled by an amendment that suggests a 5-year extension of this credit. It seems disconnected with reality. I would remind my colleagues on the other side that in November of 2014, the House offer on tax extenders included a multiyear extension of the wind production tax credit that would have provided the certainty and soft landing that most of us and the industry support, but President Obama issued a veto threat before the ink was dry, and as a result the wind incentive expired. Again, I strongly support wind energy, but I support a prudent way forward on an extension of the production tax credit. This amendment fails terribly in that regard. That is why I am disappointed that the Senator from North Dakota insisted on going forward with a 5-year extension on this bill. This is not a real effort to extend the wind incentive. I am afraid this was simply a politically motivated effort designed to score political points. [[Page S573]] It is unfortunate that in this case, politicking has trumped efforts to achieve sound, responsible policy. Rather than offer ``gotcha'' amendments on an unrelated bill, we should be working together to craft an extension of these important tax incentives that work for the wind industry, that are realistic politically, and that make sense for the American taxpayer. That effort requires regular order, working through the Finance Committee, to determine the most prudent path forward. It should be done in the context of comprehensive tax reform, where all energy tax provisions are on the table, rather than as a sense of the Congress on the unrelated Keystone XL bill. I hope that with this political exercise behind us, those of us who seek to ensure a responsible transition for the wind production tax credit can get to work and achieve a sensible policy for those who depend on it. It is too bad that this ill-timed, ill-conceived amendment may have actually harmed those efforts. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment. Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There appears to be a sufficient second. The clerk will call the roll. The bill clerk called the roll. Mr. CORNYN. The following Senator is necessarily absent: the Senator from Florida (Mr. Rubio). Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the Senator from Nevada (Mr. Reid) is necessarily absent. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Perdue). Are there any other Senators in the Chamber desiring to vote? The result was announced--yeas 47, nays 51, as follows: [Rollcall Vote No. 40 Leg.] YEAS--47 Baldwin Bennet Blumenthal Booker Boxer Brown Cantwell Cardin Carper Casey Collins Coons Donnelly Durbin Feinstein Franken Gillibrand Grassley Heinrich Heitkamp Hirono Kaine King Kirk Klobuchar Leahy Markey McCaskill Menendez Merkley Mikulski Murphy Murray Nelson Peters Reed Sanders Schatz Schumer Shaheen Stabenow Tester Udall Warner Warren Whitehouse Wyden NAYS--51 Alexander Ayotte Barrasso Blunt Boozman Burr Capito Cassidy Coats Cochran Corker Cornyn Cotton Crapo Cruz Daines Enzi Ernst Fischer Flake Gardner Graham Hatch Heller Hoeven Inhofe Isakson Johnson Lankford Lee Manchin McCain McConnell Moran Murkowski Paul Perdue Portman Risch Roberts Rounds Sasse Scott Sessions Shelby Sullivan Thune Tillis Toomey Vitter Wicker NOT VOTING--2 Reid Rubio The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order requiring 60 votes for the adoption of this amendment, the amendment is rejected. Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote. Mr. HATCH. I move to lay that motion on the table. The motion to lay on the table was agreed to. Amendment No. 48 The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there is now 2 minutes of debate equally divided prior to a vote in relation to amendment No. 48 offered by the Senator from New York, Mrs. Gillibrand. The Senator from New York. Mrs. GILLIBRAND. Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of the Keystone XL Pipeline Act. As it stands now, gas companies in this country do not have to comply with the Safe Drinking Water Act-- the law that keeps our tapwater clear, safe, and clean. For decades now, this loophole has exempted hydrofracking and gas storage companies from this law, even though every other energy industry, including oil and coal industries, is legally obligated to comply. If big coal can comply with this law, so can gas companies. This special exemption is unfair, it is unnecessary, and it is unsafe. My amendment would finally remove it from the law. I urge my colleagues not to let this chance pass us by. I ask for the yeas and nays. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There appears to be a sufficient second. The yeas and nays were ordered. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska. Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, claiming the 1 minute in opposition. As the Senator from New York has described, this would apply to the requirements of the Safe Drinking Water Act to underground ejection of natural gas. Currently the Safe Drinking Water Act expressly prohibits this application. This amendment to add the requirements to the Safe Drinking Water Act is beyond the scope of the immediate Keystone debate. We are debating the approval of a pipeline that is going to carry oil, not gas. If the Senator from New York wants to debate the issues of fracking--most certainly those issues are before the Energy and Natural Resources Committee, and the Safe Drinking Water Act--I would welcome a stand- alone bill. We will have those discussions, but on this measure I would oppose and encourage Members to vote against the Gillibrand amendment. I would remind Members we are so close to wrapping up this series of amendments. If we can ask the folks to stick around for these final few and keep to the 10-minute line. I know Senator Feinstein is looking to encourage the women of the Senate to gather for a meal later on, and that would be important for us. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to Gillibrand amendment No. 48. The yeas and nays have been previously ordered. The clerk will call the roll. The bill clerk called the roll. Mr. CORNYN. The following Senator is necessarily absent: the Senator from Florida (Mr. Rubio). Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the Senator from Nevada (Mr. Reid) is necessarily absent. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Are there any other Senators in the Chamber desiring to vote? The result was announced--yeas 35, nays 63, as follows: [Rollcall Vote No. 41 Leg.] YEAS--35 Baldwin Blumenthal Booker Boxer Brown Cantwell Cardin Carper Casey Coons Durbin Feinstein Franken Gillibrand Hirono King Klobuchar Leahy Markey Menendez Merkley Mikulski Murphy Murray Nelson Peters Reed Sanders Schatz Schumer Shaheen Stabenow Warren Whitehouse Wyden NAYS--63 Alexander Ayotte Barrasso Bennet Blunt Boozman Burr Capito Cassidy Coats Cochran Collins Corker Cornyn Cotton Crapo Cruz Daines Donnelly Enzi Ernst Fischer Flake Gardner Graham Grassley Hatch Heinrich Heitkamp Heller Hoeven Inhofe Isakson Johnson Kaine Kirk Lankford Lee Manchin McCain McCaskill McConnell Moran Murkowski Paul Perdue Portman Risch Roberts Rounds Sasse Scott Sessions Shelby Sullivan Tester Thune Tillis Toomey Udall Vitter Warner Wicker NOT VOTING--2 Reid Rubio The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order requiring 60 votes for the adoption of this amendment, the amendment is rejected. Ms. MURKOWSKI. I move to reconsider the vote. Ms. CANTWELL. I move to lay that motion on the table. The motion to lay on the table was agreed to. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska. Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending Murkowski substitute, as amended, be considered original text for the purposes of further amendment. I ask unanimous consent that when the Senate resumes consideration of S. 1 tomorrow, Thursday, January 29, [[Page S574]] there be 15 minutes equally divided in the usual form and the Senate proceed to vote on the following amendments in the order listed: Barrasso No. 245; Cardin No. 124; Burr No. 92, as modified; Daines No. 246; Vitter No. 80, as further modified with the changes at the desk; Udall No. 77; further, that all amendments on this list be subject to a 60-vote affirmative threshold for adoption and that no second-degrees be in order to any of the pending amendments to this bill. I ask unanimous consent that there be 2 minutes of debate equally divided between each vote and that all votes after the first in this series be 10-minute votes. I further ask that once these amendments have been disposed of, the Senate agree to proceed to the motion to reconsider the failed cloture vote on S. 1; that the motion to reconsider be agreed to and the Senate proceed to vote on the motion to invoke cloture on the bill, upon reconsideration. I ask consent that if cloture is invoked on the bill, as amended, all time postcloture be considered expired at 2:30 p.m. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is so ordered. The amendment (No. 80), as further modified, is as follows: At the end, add the following: TITLE _--OUTER CONTINENTAL SHELF OIL AND GAS LEASING REVENUE SEC. _01. REVENUE SHARING FROM OUTER CONTINENTAL SHELF WIND ENERGY PRODUCTION FACILITIES. The first sentence of section 8(p)(2)(B) of the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act (43 U.S.C. 1337(p)(2)(B)) is amended by inserting after ``27 percent'' the following: ``, or, beginning in fiscal year 2016, in the case of projects for offshore wind energy production facilities, 37.5 percent''. SEC. _02. OUTER CONTINENTAL SHELF LEASING PROGRAM REFORMS. Section 18(a) of the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act (43 U.S.C. 1344(a)) is amended by adding at the end the following: ``(5)(A) In each oil and gas leasing program under this section, the Secretary shall make available for leasing and conduct lease sales including at least 50 percent of the available unleased acreage within each outer Continental Shelf planning area (other than the North Aleutian Basin planning area or the North Atlantic planning area) considered to have the largest undiscovered, technically recoverable oil and gas resources (on a total btu basis) based on the most recent national geologic assessment of the outer Continental Shelf, with an emphasis on offering the most geologically prospective parts of the planning area. ``(B) The Secretary shall include in each proposed oil and gas leasing program under this section any State subdivision of an outer Continental Shelf planning area (other than the North Aleutian Basin planning area or the North Atlantic planning area) that the Governor of the State that represents that subdivision requests be made available for leasing.

The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska. Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I think Members have been given the outline for tomorrow morning that will take us through a final vote on cloture so that we can get to final passage of the Keystone XL Pipeline. I appreciate the consideration and the courtesy of all Members. It has been a long day. We have worked through about a dozen additional amendments, if my count is correct, and we have done it in pretty good order. We have done it while there have been a number of committee meetings going on, which can be very disruptive, but I think with the level of cooperation we have had, we will be able to conclude our business at a relatively civilized hour this evening. I appreciate the good work of my partner and ranking member Senator Cantwell in getting us to this place. I am hopeful that with the number of amendments we have outlined for the morning and then the handful of germane amendments we will have in the afternoon, we will be able to move on to other business before the Senate. But I thank my colleagues for all of the effort and cooperation we have had to this point. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington. Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I wish to thank my colleague from Alaska for her hard work in getting us through this process. I think our colleagues can see the daylight to finishing this up tomorrow, hopefully. I know Members have worked across the aisle on some of these remaining issues, and we are still trying to work a few of them out. So hopefully tomorrow will go as smoothly as today has. I would like to turn now to my colleague from New Mexico to call up his amendment. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico. Amendment No. 77 (Purpose: To establish a renewable electricity standard, and for other purposes) Mr. UDALL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to set aside the pending amendment so that I may call up my amendment No. 77. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk will report. The bill clerk read as follows: The Senator from New Mexico [Mr. Udall], for himself, Mr. Markey, and Mr. Bennet, proposes an amendment numbered 77. Mr. UDALL. I ask unanimous consent that the reading of the amendment be dispensed with. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. (The amendment is printed in the Record of January 20, 2015, under ``Text of Amendments.'') Mr. UDALL. Mr. President, let me just say to the two leaders on the floor who have participated in this open amendment process that I really appreciate the way Chairwoman Murkowski and Ranking Member Cantwell have worked through this bill. I really appreciate all their help. I have heard, at least on our side of the aisle, over and over that this is the way the Senate should be moving, this is the way we should be working. So I think all of us are very appreciative of how the two managers of the bill have worked together. I thank my colleagues, and I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska. Ms. MURKOWSKI. I thank our colleague for his kind comments. We do have one more consent request here very briefly. I ask unanimous consent that the order of votes on the Burr and the Daines amendments be reversed. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Ms. MURKOWSKI. With that, Mr. President, I again thank Members for their cooperation today and look forward to yet another productive day tomorrow. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota. Mr. HOEVEN. Mr. President, I want to express my appreciation to the bill managers for their hard work today and for their efforts in the work that was done in a bipartisan way on this legislation. I know both the bill managers have spent an awful lot of time putting together these amendments, and I think they have really bent over backward to make sure Members on both sides of the aisle have had an opportunity to file their amendments, to make those amendments pending, and to get votes on the amendments. So I would like to express my appreciation to both of them for all the work they have done and for the process today in voting on amendments. With that, I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona. The Economy Mr. FLAKE. Mr. President, yesterday the Congressional Budget Office-- the CBO--released its budget and economic outlook showing the forecast through 2025. It should strike fear in the heart of anybody who is concerned about this country's financial future. The very short-term news is good. The deficit is projected to fall-- but only for another 2 years. In 2017 the deficit is projected to start rising again to $1.1 trillion in 10 years. That is the annual deficit. By 2025 the deficit will be 4 percent of our overall economy. Right now the country's debt in cumulative deficits over the years-- the cumulative debt--is $18 trillion. This year we will pay about $277 billion just servicing that debt. That amount might seem low, but it is because of artificially low interest rates. In 10 years we will pay about $827 billion a year just to service the debt. That is 3 percent of our economy just to pay interest on the debt. That is unsustainable. Don't take my word for it, though. You can take CBO's. They said: Such large and growing Federal debt would have serious negative consequences, including increasing Federal spending for interest payments; restraining economic growth in the long term; giving policymakers less flexibility to respond to unexpected challenges; and eventually heightening the risk of a financial crisis. I have been working on these issues--this issue in particular--for a long time, and I have to admit that sometimes it is tough to get people to focus on this topic. But we shouldn't be fooled and patting ourselves on the back just because we have done things such as getting rid of earmarks. That is a good thing, but it is certainly insufficient to address our spending. The culture in Washington is still the culture of runaway spending, not just in earmarks, as I said, not just in wasteful spending. For example, spending on Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid will nearly double over the next decade alone. This is not a revenue problem that we are having. Projected revenues will exceed their 50-year historical average of 17 percent of GDP this year and will grow to over 18 percent of the economy in this decade. The culture of spending in Washington is something that defies logic, defies math and an honest assessment of who we are as a country. As a result, the United States is fast becoming a once-prosperous nation. We don't want that designation. It is truly a frightening distinction. Yet too few in Washington are motivated to get this country's fiscal house in order. One has to wonder how bad it is going to have to get to prod those who are not yet motivated. Some will argue that we need to take baby steps to address our fiscal crisis. I think we are well past that time, but whatever kinds of steps we take, we need to take them now. We need to turn this culture of spending in Washington to one that will fully repair our economy. That will give the private sector the stability and confidence to create jobs. We also need to reform our cumbersome Tax Code. Most of all, we need to relieve future generations of the burden of our financial mess. In short, it is well past time to start climbing our way out of this fiscal hole we are in. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island. Climate Change Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I am here now for the 87th consecutive week the Senate has been in session to urge action on climate change. We have had an interesting couple of weeks on the Keystone Pipeline, but from a climate change and carbon pollution point of view, this would obviously not be helpful. Indeed, it would [[Page S576]] be a disaster leading to as much as 27 million--27 million--metric tons of additional carbon dioxide emitted per year. To put that number into some perspective, that is the equivalent of adding 6 million cars and trucks to our roads for 50 years. So it is a very considerable carbon price to pay. We have seen a poster used on the Senate Floor that says it will have no environmental effect. That is not precisely true. Indeed, precisely the opposite is true. This is the environmental effect it will have, and it is considerable. The report referred to went on to say that it would be offset by the fact that this fuel would go out by rail anyway. But that offset was conditioned on a fuel price above $75 per barrel of oil, and we are at $50. So there is no way that conclusion can stand, and the underlying fact is what prevails--27 million metric tons of additional carbon dioxide. It is obviously very bad from an environmental perspective. It is a lot of ``not much'' from a jobs perspective. Every 4 days we add more jobs than the construction of this pipeline just through the economic recovery that is taking place. This is a little bit hard to explain, particularly when you think that this bill is going to be dead on arrival at the White House. We have known from the beginning that this is going to be vetoed. But it has allowed the oil and the fossil fuel industry to show their hands. This is all being done on behalf of a foreign oil company and on behalf of the fossil fuel industry. When we look at what we have been through in the past couple of days, there are some interesting choices the Senate has made if you are a foreign oil company. If you are a foreign oil company, we will let you use eminent domain to extinguish the property rights of farmers and ranchers and take their farms and ranches away. If you are a foreign oil company, we will exempt you from the oilspill recovery fund--the Federal excise tax on petroleum--so you don't have to pay the taxes American companies have to pay. If you are a foreign oil company, we will not require you to use American steel in a pipeline being built across America being touted as a source of American jobs. If you are a foreign oil company, we won't require you to sell it in the American market even though it is touted as a product that will help balance America's energy portfolio. So, so far, not much good to show for all of this but one thing, and that is that this exercise has at last brought the issue of climate change to the floor of the Senate. We have not had much debate about climate change since the Citizens United decision back in 2010 allowed the fossil fuel industry to cast a very long shadow of intimidation across this body. They spend a huge amount of the money that has been freed up by Citizens United. They spend a huge amount of dark money that flows post Citizens United. And since then, the Republican Party has been virtually muzzled on that subject. So having Republicans talk about climate change on the Senate floor was something of a revelation, and I don't think we should underestimate the importance of that or undervalue what was said. The senior Senator from North Carolina came to the floor and said this: The concept that climate change is real, I completely understand and accept. To the point of how much man is contributing, I don't know, but it does make sense that man- made emissions are contributing. . . . the greenhouse gas effect seems to me scientifically sound. The problem is that how you fix this globally is going to require more than just the U.S. being involved. Which I think we all agree with. The senior Senator from Alaska, who is our chairman of the Energy and Natural Resources Committee and the floor manager on this very bill, agreed, stating that she hopes we can all, quoting her, get beyond the discussion as to whether or not climate change is real and talk about what do we do. I look forward to that discussion about what do we do. It is not enough just to say, OK, we finally concede that climate change is really happening. We really do have to get on to what do we do. Even if you disagree with me that climate change is real and very significant and consequential for our country, if you will spot me that there is just a 10-percent chance that I am right--even just a 2- percent chance that I am right--when we consider the possible harms, it is something that grownup adults and responsible people ought to take a look at and come together and decide what to do. We have been through some very notable benchmarks. We hit for the first time last year 400 parts per million of carbon dioxide in our atmosphere for more than 3 months. They have been tracking this in Hawaii, at the top of the mountain at the Mauna Loa laboratory for decades now, and 400 parts per million for more than 3 months is a new record. To put that in context: For as long as human beings have been on this planet, all the way back to when we were living in caves, the range of carbon in the atmosphere has been 170 to 300 parts per million. So we are well outside the range that has been our comfortable safe range for human habitation of this planet during our entire human experience, and 400 is a big move when our entire range is only 130 points and now we are 100 parts per million out of that. Some of this lands in the oceans. The oceans have absorbed about a quarter of all our carbon emissions. We can measure their pH level. This isn't complicated. This isn't something we have to do with elaborate computer models. What we see is that the pH level of the oceans is changing rapidly. The oceans are acidifying rapidly. When I say rapidly, they are acidifying at a rate that we have not seen in 25 to perhaps 30 or 50 million years. Indeed, some studies say nothing like this has been seen on the face of the Earth for as long as 300 million years. When we consider that our species has been around for about 200,000 years, that is a pretty long window to be launching new and dramatic changes in our oceans. There is nothing new about the science that supports this. John Tyndall wrote the first report about the greenhouse gas effect to the British Academy of Sciences in 1861. The pages who are here and have studied history will know that 1861 was the year President Lincoln took office. So the scientific community has been aware of the greenhouse gas phenomenon since Abraham Lincoln was driving up and down Pennsylvania Avenue in a carriage with his top hat on. There is not much new that is there, and the latest data is clearer and clearer that we just continue apace to warm the planet. Professor Jonathan Overpeck is at the University of Arizona, and Arizona is certainly feeling the heat. Professor Overpeck said: The global warmth of 2014 is just another reminder that the planet is warming and warming fast. . . . Humans, and their burning of fossil fuels, are dominating the Earth's climate system like never before. It is equally clear, when we look at the oceans, they not only absorb a lot of the carbon dioxide and acidify as a result--they absorb most of the heat. In fact, they absorb 90 percent of the excess heat that has been trapped by the greenhouse gases that we have flooded our atmosphere with. I certainly see that in Rhode Island, where Narragansett Bay's mean winter water temperature is up 3 to 4 degrees Fahrenheit since we had our big hurricane of 1938. That is significant, because it means more likely storms. It is associated with sea level rise. We have 10 more inches of sea level at the Newport Naval Station. So if the 1938 hurricane were to repeat itself now, it would have 10 more inches of sea to hammer against our shores. And that is not a complicated measure, either. We do that with thermometers. So since the Industrial Revolution, human beings have dumped 2 trillion metric tons of carbon dioxide into the air and into the atmosphere. Said another way, that is 2,000 billion metric tons of carbon dioxide. The notion that has no effect, when we have known since Abraham Lincoln's day that carbon dioxide is a greenhouse gas, and when we put that much in and when we can measure that it is at 400 for the first time in human history--connect the dots. How much does it take? It is really pretty obvious. Folks who remain skeptical--well, I know, I am not a scientist. I get that. So ask one. That is all I request. And I don't think that is too much to ask of colleagues. And, by the way, do me one favor. You can ask the scientist that you please, but please don't ask a scientist who is in the pay of the fossil [[Page S577]] fuel and the denial industry. There are a bunch of them who are out there. They turn up at all the usual denial conferences. They write in the denial journals. They take money from the denial organizations that all have fossil fuel industry funding behind them. Go to someplace neutral. For instance, go to your own State university, like the University of Arizona or the University of Oklahoma. The dean of the relevant department at the University of Oklahoma signed the IPCC report and started Climate Central. Ask your own university. Ask any major scientific organization. All the major recognized scientific organizations in the United States of America are on board, agree that this is real, agree that this is important, agree that it is vital, and believe that we are actually near the tipping point that may make the damage irrecoverable. If you don't want to go to your home State university and if you don't want to go to America's major scientific societies, try NOAA and NASA. Think about NASA for a moment. As I give this speech, there is a Rover that is the size of an SUV being driven around on the surface of Mars. We built a Rover, shot it to Mars, landed it safely, and are now driving it around. Do we think those scientists might actually know something? Do we think they might know what they are talking about? Do we think they might merit our confidence? So ask them and see what they say. Or, if you want, ask some of America's leading corporations. If you are from Arkansas, go and ask Walmart. They will tell you. If you are from Georgia, go and ask Coca-Cola. They will tell you. This is not hard to discover once you get away from that little stable of denial scientists who are so closely affiliated with the fossil fuel industry. I do this every week because we have the arrogance so often here to think how much our laws--the laws that we pass--matter. But the laws that we pass are passing things. They come and they go. They have their time. They are repealed, they are replaced, they fall into desuetude. But some laws last, and those are the laws that God laid down upon this Earth that guide its operations. Those are the laws of physics, the laws of chemistry, the laws of biology, the law of gravity. We cannot repeal those laws. We must face their consequences. And we know the consequences of continuing to emit gigatons of carbon dioxide into our planet is going to launch us into an environment in which the habitability of Earth as we have known it will be put into question. History makes its judgments about every generation. If we do not take calm and reasonable and sensible precautions about this obvious known and admitted risk, then when that risk comes home to roost, we will be duly shamed. So let us avoid that. Let us get to work. Let us take advantage of the opening that the distinguished senior Senator from Alaska and the distinguished senior Senator from South Carolina have opened for us, and let us do what is right by our country and by the judgment that we can anticipate from history.

The Senator from Alaska. Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I am ready to go this morning. I have comfortable shoes on. I am ready for a good, long day and to process a bunch of amendments. I see the Senate doing its work. I know we have important business before the Senate. I know the Judiciary Committee is holding the hearing to listen to the comments from Loretta Lynch, who has been nominated to be Attorney General. Obviously these are very important issues the committee is discussing today. Interspersed with all of that, we are going to be having a relatively long series of votes this afternoon, which makes it a little bit choppy and a little bit chaotic, but we have business to do in the Senate. I am pleased we are at this point where I think we can honestly say we are looking at the final stretch in this discussion on the bipartisan, 60-sponsored bill to approve the Keystone XL Pipeline after more than 2,320 days of delay. At this point we are past that last call for amendments on the bill. We have spent a lot of time over the past couple of days negotiating which of the roughly 200 first-degree amendments that have been filed would come up for votes. We have a pretty good list. Again, we have 18 of them that will be before us beginning this afternoon. There will be more we will be dealing with at a later point. But I do think this is significant. I was reading the newspaper this morning, and there is no shortage of critics out there, folks who would say the Senate is broken and can't possibly be fixed. There was an article from an opinion writer which stated: Within the midst of the Keystone debate, McConnell has had to retreat ``on his promise to allow freewheeling amendments.'' The article then goes on to state that yesterday not much of anything happened on the Senate floor where the pipeline debate had stalled. In fairness, maybe the debate, in terms of processing amendments on the floor, had stalled out yesterday, but that did not mean there were not significant and serious negotiations going on between the majority and the minority about how we would proceed. Sometimes when someone tunes in and the Senate is in a quorum call, they think nothing is happening. They think the business of the Senate is not being conducted. I need to assure not only colleagues but those who watch this process on C-SPAN that in fact there is still good business being done. I think that is what has resulted in our opportunity this afternoon to take up some 18 different amendments. There are amendments that are all across the board; 10 of the 18 pending amendments are from colleagues on the other side of the aisle. I think we are certainly being very generous in terms of what is out there. We are trying to ensure that Members who want a vote can have them. Again, keep in mind, with a couple hundred amendments that come forward, we are going to have a lot of duplication. We are going to have issues people may want to make a statement about but might not necessarily want to ask for a vote on. But those that we have in front of us today--everything from issues relating to solar energy to LNG exports, to further discussion about climate change, wilderness, wind tax credits, the Land and Water Conservation Fund--are truly all over the map. When it is suggested that somehow or other Senator McConnell as the majority leader is moving back from his commitment to allow for an open amendment process, so-called freewheeling amendments, I don't think a whole picture of what is happening on the Senate floor is being painted. In fact it is a very open and considerable process. I made mention last week that we broke the records. We blew the top off in terms of the number of amendments we were actually able to process on the Senate floor. We moved through 24 amendments on this bill since the time we started it. Twenty-four amendments is pretty considerable, considering that in all of 2014 there were just 15 amendments that were considered the entire year. In fact, on Thursday alone we processed 15. If we do 18, as is on the roster today, that is pretty significant. I feel good about the point we are at. It is not just because we are churning through amendments, it is because of what the ranking member and I have been able to do as the floor managers on this bill, kind of working back and forth. Yes, sometimes it is tedious. Yes, sometimes it is frustrating. Yes, sometimes Members wish they had more time to talk or there were more hours in our day to process all of this, [[Page S557]] but at some point in time I think we have to recognize when we spend 3 weeks on a bill, that is pretty considerable. When we are able to move 50 amendments--close to 50 amendments is where we may be at the end of this legislation and processing--that is of note. What I appreciate is we are here this morning getting ready to kick off a long afternoon of votes and go back and forth with Members and disruption of their schedules and committee meetings and the inconvenience that causes. But again this is part of what happens around here. It is not a very tightly scheduled environment because we just have so much that is going on. But being able to move forward on this important legislation is good and necessary. I think we are setting the stage for the balance of this Congress-- under the leadership of the Senator from Kentucky, the majority leader, a commitment to have wholesome debate--to have the opportunity for a process that is not only good for Republicans, it is good for Democrats. It is good for the Senate and for the United States. Amendment No. 166 I want to quickly mention an amendment I will have up later this afternoon. This is amendment No. 166. I spoke very briefly to it yesterday when I called it up. But it would require wilderness study areas to be released if Congress has not officially designated them as wilderness within one calendar year. Right now what happens is that when a wilderness study area is designated, it can sit out there on the books almost indefinitely. There have been areas that have been sitting out there without congressional action for a couple of decades. I don't think this was the point of the process. But I would suggest the amendment I have advanced is a critical one to our Western States, certainly to my State of Alaska. Again, the news on Sunday of the President moving toward a wilderness designation of all of ANWR--with the exception of a very small slice but all of ANWR--all 19 million acres in addition to the 1002 area, the 1.57 million acres that have been specifically designated by Congress for further review and study. Right now there are 528 wilderness study areas throughout Alaska and the other 11 Western States. Again, these designations have been made by over time by one administration or another. The next step forward in this process is that Congress needs to act, but Congress hasn't acted. We have had some of these that have been pending since the 1980s. Again, as I suggested yesterday, if we have had something pending for 20, 30 years, I think that is plenty of time to say that Congress has had to review those areas. Even though we have not turned these into wilderness--in other words, even though Congress has not acted to designate these areas as wilderness, what happens to them? They are treated and managed as if they are wilderness. Effectively, we have de facto wilderness. The law requires that only Congress determines whether an area is designated as wilderness. But what has happened is just kind of a lag, a lull, if you will, so they don't even need the congressional designation if in fact it is already being managed as wilderness. We look at the intent behind this. It is clear it was never intended to be this way. We were never supposed to have millions of acres of de facto Agency-decided wilderness around the Western United States. We routinely pass public lands legislation into law. I would like to know we could do it a little more often. As recently as last month, it actually has included new wilderness. So we are not saying that in other areas these wilderness study areas don't get officially designated. There is that process, and we demonstrated that just during the lameduck here. But in the instances where Congress has decided not to act on wilderness study areas, agencies need to start looking at what that broader array of options is for managing the land, whatever that multiple use designation might be. They need to be looking at this critically with the local people in the area and with the other stakeholders who are involved in the planning process, but clearly they are not doing that on their own. So what my amendment would do is essentially provide a 1-year timeframe for wilderness designations to be made. I think, again, that is more than enough time for Congress to consider debate and approve legislation for any area with wide support for a wilderness designation, so we will see that amendment this afternoon. I know the Senator from Washington was on her way, coming from a committee meeting this morning, and had intended to speak. I see Senator Udall is also on the floor. I yield to the Senator from New Mexico if he wishes to speak at this time before Senator Cantwell comes to the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sullivan). The clerk will call the roll. The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. PETERS. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Amendment No. 55 Mr. PETERS. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss my amendment that was made pending by my friend and the ranking member of the Energy and Natural Resources Committee, the Senator from Washington, Ms. Cantwell. The amendment I have offered, amendment No. 55, is a simple, commonsense amendment. It requires the Environmental Protection Agency to complete a study on the potential environmental and health impact of byproducts from tar sands oil that would be transported across our country by the Keystone XL Pipeline. One of these byproducts of tar sands oil is a black, powdery substance known as petroleum coke or petcoke. It is a residual from this tar sands oil and large amounts of it are produced in the refining process. In fact, it is estimated basically for every barrel of oil we get from tar sands, one-third of the material is this dark substance called petcoke. If we are transporting an awful lot of oil through the Keystone Pipeline, it naturally follows that we are going to get massive amounts of this petcoke. I have had an experience with this petcoke in my previous House district in the city of Detroit, where we had petcoke from the refining process of this tar sands oil being piled up along the Detroit River. We had a pile there that was at some times several stories high, a city block long. It was stored along the river in an uncontained fashion. It was blowing into people's homes, it was blowing into businesses, and it was also draining into the Great Lakes watershed. It caused all sorts of problems. I had complaints from constituents who talked about this substance going into their homes. I had businesses talking about--for example, restaurants in the area--their wait staff getting respiratory problems as a result of breathing this in. In fact, we had a video to explain how problematic it can be. I had a video taken by a Canadian resident across the Detroit River that showed the petcoke piles. With some wind blowing, a massive black dust cloud was blowing off of these petcoke piles. In the distance you could see the Ambassador Bridge, which is the bridge that connects Canada to the United States. The dust was so thick and so black it obscured the bridge as it was blowing into the neighborhoods, into the river, and then into Canada. It is a completely unacceptable situation, which is why I believe it is important as we move forward with this legislation that we have a couple of studies. One, we need to understand what are those environmental and health risks associated with petcoke. It is clear this is particulate matter, and if it is not contained, it gets into people's lungs and creates a dust layer throughout communities. It is very important as well in the study not only to study the environmental and health impacts, but what are the best practices to handle this material. With the massive amount of tar sands oil that will come through the Keystone, we will also get massive amounts of petcoke, a substance that has been problematic not only in Detroit, but it has been problematic in the city of Chicago and other places across the country. [[Page S558]] So I believe it is very important that we get these kinds of information as this project moves forward, and it is certainly my hope that we can assure that what happened in Detroit, what is happening in Chicago and other places across this country doesn't happen, that we understand what this substance is, and we understand what those best practices are to handle and to transport this material safely. I urge my colleagues to support amendment No. 55. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll. Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Amendment No. 166 Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I am glad the junior Senator from Alaska is in the Chair because I am going to be discussing things that are of great concern to Alaskans and really to those who care about the rule of law here and how it applies throughout all 50 States fairly and evenly. As I mentioned just a bit ago, I have offered an amendment that would deal with how wilderness study areas are treated. My proposal is one that would put a time limitation on these study areas. I mentioned the amendment was precipitated by the President's announcement this weekend about additional areas of wilderness to be designated in Alaska. I have cited two. The 1980 lands bill, ANILCA--I think it is good for us to have a little bit of a refresher on what ANILCA actually did. In one fell swoop ANILCA designated nearly 60 million acres of wilderness in the State of Alaska. That is pretty substantial. It was more than any other President had ever designated at any other time prior to that. What we have seen since then, with the designation of wilderness, is there has been this fight going back and forth. There have been areas that have been requested for wilderness study areas. But this administration has really taken it a major step forward. On Sunday the President recommended that an additional 12.3 million acres within the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge be designated as wilderness--so an additional 12.3 million acres on top of the 60 million acres that we already have as wilderness in Alaska after ANILCA. This action by the President means that these 12.3 million acres will immediately be managed as wilderness. As I have mentioned, right now there is no deadline or expiration for this designation. Even if Congress fails to act--and I am going to make darn certain we do not act on this wilderness proposal the President has advanced--these acres are being managed as wilderness. Let me just show colleagues what it means for us right now. The small map of Alaska is up there in the corner. It is kind of unfair because it needs to be a much bigger map to get the context. Effectively, what the President is proposing is that in addition to the 7.16 million acres of wilderness that currently exist in the ANWR area--and the ANWR area is a big refuge, a big designation. A little over 7 million acres have already been designated as wilderness. That was done back in 1980. But what he is proposing now is effectively taking the whole balance of the refuge area and making wilderness out of that as well--so 12.3 million acres. Now, keep in mind this also includes the 1002 area up on the northern part of ANWR. That is the area right, which was specifically designated by Congress for further study of its oil and gas potential. Back in 1980, when the wilderness designation was made for the one area--7 million acres of it--it was determined that refuge status would be afforded the balance of the area, and then the 1002 would be reserved-- reserved deliberately for study of its oil and gas potential. That 1980 act was pretty clear in terms of the bargain that had taken place. I am going to read for the record the provision in the law that we refer to as the ``no more'' clause. It states: This Act provides sufficient protection for the national interest in the scenic, natural, cultural and environmental values on the public lands in Alaska, and at the same time provides adequate opportunity for satisfaction of the economic and social needs of the State of Alaska and its people; accordingly, the designation and disposition of the public lands in Alaska pursuant to this Act are found to represent a proper balance between the reservation of national conservation system units and those public lands necessary and appropriate for more intensive use and disposition, and thus Congress believes that the need for future legislation designating new conservation system units, new national conservation areas, or new national recreation areas, has been obviated thereby. The act goes on to state that ``no further studies of Federal lands in the State of Alaska for the single purpose of considering the establishment of a conservation system unit, national recreation area, national conservation area, or for related or similar purposes shall be conducted unless authorized by the Congress.'' So the President is basically choosing to ignore the law as set out in ANILCA--the agreement that Alaska has contributed mightily with its share of wilderness. I remind my colleagues that more than one-half of the wilderness in the entire United States of America is in the State of Alaska. Thus we wrote the law back in 1980 that says no more out of Alaska. They found that balance. Well, this President is tipping that balance. The coastal plain holds an estimated 10.4 billion barrels of oil. I mentioned yesterday that if we can tap into these resources, we could see 1 million barrels a day coming down our Trans-Alaska Pipeline for nearly 30 years. Think about what that would mean, Mr. President--1 million barrels a day filling up that Trans-Alaska Pipeline that is now less than half full, an additional 1 million barrels a day coming into this country. Right now, Americans are enjoying the lower prices of oil. But the President said: Don't get used to these low prices because they may go up. Well, they do not have to go up if we can provide more. If we can increase production in this country, we can theoretically decrease that cost. But we have to be allowed to access that. Think about the source of good-paying jobs, energy security, billions of dollars in new Federal revenues. The energy security part of it is keenly important, but let us also think about the positive national security implications of energy produced in the United States. When we are producing more energy in this country and relying less on others, we are less vulnerable. We have greater ability to deal with hostile nations. Sanctions work better when we don't need to rely on that same oil that some of these nations would like to free up for other countries. From a national security perspective, this is huge. This is where the intersection with the Keystone Pipeline is so interesting: that at the same time this administration has issued this wilderness study it is also fighting so hard to keep us from building the Keystone XL Pipeline, which would allow us to get crude from our friend and neighbor to the north and utilize it to our benefit. The President is saying: No, I don't want to do that. I guess he would much rather receive it from Venezuela or wherever. He says he wants Brazil to be our big trading partner when it comes to oil. Hello. Canada--they share a border. They are our friend. They are our closest friend, our strongest trading partner. Are we going to shut down such an opportunity as that? And: Oh, by the way, that same week let's just go ahead and take off the table permanently one of the greatest reservoirs of crude we have here in the United States next. Let's just take that off the table, too. What does that say? What does that say to other countries? That we don't care about our own energy security? I care about our energy security, and I care about our national security. Again, it stuns me to think that what the President is proposing here is a measure that would take off limits permanently our ability as a nation to access the 1002 area to safely develop this enormous potential. Keep in mind, we are not talking about accessing the full 1.5 million acres in the 1002. The legislation that has been before this Senate, back in 1995 and 2005, asked to open up 2,000 acres--2,000 acres--out of 19.5 million acres in the whole refuge. The Presiding Officer knows Alaskans can do this safely. We have set and met the highest environmental standards in the world. We do it every [[Page S559]] day. Our pipeline, our amazing 800-mile pipeline, has a decades-long record of responsible production. It has carried nearly 17 billion barrels of oil safely across our State, over 2 mountain ranges, multiple rivers, in areas where we are known to have a few earthquakes. It is an engineering marvel. It has served our State and our country well. But instead of recognizing this unparalleled opportunity that we have, we are now facing a mounting lockdown of our resource potential. And the Presiding Officer knows the worst part is, it is not just ANWR we are talking about. Our offshore oil reserves are now also going to be restricted. Just yesterday the President announced he was indefinitely withdrawing 9.8 million acres in the Beaufort and the Chukchi Seas from leasing. So now ANWR is going to be locked up, as well as the Beaufort and Chukchi seas. I don't have a map of these areas that have been taken off limits, but I can tell you that it is an area of roughly 9.8 million acres. There is some real question that I have in my mind. After reading the Interior's press release, I don't have any real comfort that the two sales that are being proposed--one in the Beaufort and one in the Chukchi--will actually stay on schedule. The Secretary of the Interior is quoted saying that: Interior will continue to consider oil and gas exploration in the Arctic. It is not a very firm commitment, as far as I can see. But when we look at it altogether--between the ANWR wilderness designation and the Arctic offshore withdrawal--Alaska has lost more than 22 million acres of land and water where energy could be produced for the good of this country, and it has happened in less than 1 week. It has happened over a span of 3 days--22 million acres. So what is 22 million acres? It is an area about 563 times larger than where we are here in the District of Columbia. It is about 28 Rhode Islands. I know Rhode Island is a small State by comparison, but 28 of them adds up. It is about 4.5 times the size of the State of Massachusetts. Again, this is just to give you an idea of what was taken off limits, indefinitely, by this administration since Sunday. My reaction to all this has been pretty strong. I think it is pretty obvious to anybody who would take a moment to think about it, but I am amazed our President can look at Alaska and think, this is what we need most right now. We are facing a pretty significant budget shortfall. I know our Governor has spoken to the President and the Secretary of Interior about Alaska's situation. Then this is what he gets as a ``we will work with you''? I don't think so. This is not an indication of a Federal Government that wants to work with the State to develop its resources. The Governor asked the Secretary of the Interior for an address, because he said he needed to send an invoice for the lack of any economy Alaska would be able to generate with these actions. The one thing--the one thing more than anything else that could help our State--is to be able to access our Federal lands and our waters so that we can fill up the Trans-Alaska Pipeline, so that we can not only help Alaska but we can help the rest of the country. But that seems to be the one thing this President is intent on denying, whether it is in ANWR, whether it is in our offshore, or whether it is in our National Petroleum Reserve, where this President basically unilaterally took off about half of that in terms of availability of access. I noted that when the President made his announcement on Sunday, the video that went out showed beautiful pictures of the refuge area. Again, this is a big area. This whole refuge is about the size of the State of South Carolina. It is big and there are some amazing spaces--I am the first one to admit it, amazing spaces--just as there are all over Alaska. But I watched that video as he was flying in his airplane to go to India, and I thought to myself: The President hasn't been to Alaska, even though he says he only has three States left to see and Alaska is not included. So I actually asked my staff to find out. By my count, the President has been to Alaska three times during his administration. And he told me, before he was President, he had never been to Alaska. So three times during his administration. All three times were basically to get fuel. And granted, to give him credit, on one of those times he did meet with the troops at Elmendorf, but he never went off the base. The other two times were in the middle of the night for as long as it took to get fuel. In my mind, that is not visiting Alaska. That is not trying to understand who we are. We have some pretty beautiful, wide-open skies. But when you are flying at 35,000, 45,000 feet looking down, that is not how you get a view of Alaska. So outside of this short meet-and-greet, outside of a bargaining chip to gain support from national constituencies, he is basically viewing Alaska as a refueling stop--which is no shortage of irony here in the fact that he is happy to refuel Air Force One in Alaska, but he doesn't seem to want fuel produced in Alaska. I can get pretty frustrated and upset about this. Part of it is because so much of this comes without consultation with us, without listening to the vast majority of Alaskans--as if, once again, we are nothing but a territory and the promises that were made to us at statehood mean nothing. I was born in the territory. It was not that long ago that Alaskans knew what it meant to be kind of kicked around by folks on the outside. We didn't have a voice. We thought statehood was going to change that. We thought that statehood compact--the promises made that Alaska would be able to deliver to its citizens based on the amazing resource wealth that we had--we thought that was going to count for something. Apparently, not enough. I was a little bit surprised to read that the White House counselor, Mr. Podesta, thinks I have overreacted to these announcements and to others that I have been told may be coming--more to come--and he suggested my reaction is not warranted. I would ask any one of the other 99 Senators here: Think about how you would respond if the citizens of your State woke up to a message that we are going to take 12 million acres away from you and your potential to develop in your State; and then on Tuesday, we are going to take away 9.8 million acres. But don't worry, we are the Federal Government, we are here to help. Alaskans want to help themselves. We want to be able to exercise that independence, that free spirit that so many of us in Alaska identify with. We want to help our neighbors, help our families. But this kind of help we don't need. Don't lock us up. Don't shut us out. It was suggested in Mr. Podesta's comments, and I saw it in other press reports, that somehow or other the Interior Department felt compelled to move forward with the timing of these announcements because we were ratcheting up on ANWR. They suggested I had introduced a bill. I haven't introduced a bill. I do intend to introduce a bill. But to somehow suggest this was precipitated because the delegation is making a charge on ANWR is, at this time, unwarranted. It did kind of make me wonder, maybe the White House isn't aware of how Alaskans feel about this. So in the few minutes I want to take this morning I want to read a few of the quotes from our State leaders who have come out against this decision since they were announced, particularly as they relate to ANWR. We have a new, Independent Governor. As I mentioned, he has already had the opportunity to meet with the President and talk about Alaska's issues. Again, he has also met with the Secretary of Interior to talk similarly. Governor Walker says he is ``angry, very angry, that this is happening.'' Our State senate president, Kevin Meyer, said the following: The impact of this decision, if allowed to stand, will harm the future of our Great State and will deal a devastating blow to our economy. I spoke with our house speaker, a gentleman by the name of Mike Chenault from the Kenai Peninsula, an area where we have oil and gas potential in the Cook Inlet. They know about oil and gas. The speaker said: The president just doesn't get it, or he does get it and doesn't care about the will and voice of Alaskans. That's beyond offensive. [[Page S560]] In response to the President's ANWR announcement, Speaker Chenault also had some pretty choice words. He said: Alaska's not a territory anymore and it's high time our federal overlords stopped trying to treat us like one. The Arctic Slope Regional Corporation, whose shareholders, people who actually live on the North Slope, issued a press release stating that: We are staunchly opposed to this relentless and coordinated effort to designate the Coastal Plain of ANWR as Wilderness. This administration has deliberately ignored the input provided by the most affected people within ANWR. Colleagues, remember that when this President is suggesting that this area needs to be named or designated as wilderness, the 1002 area, people live there. People live their lives there--children go to school and people work there. They fly in and out. They have a little grocery store. They try to make an honest living there. They subsist, absolutely; but people live there. To quote from the Arctic Slope Regional Corporation, the corporation's shareholders who live there say, ``this administration has deliberately ignored the input provided by the most affected people within ANWR.'' I think the reason they have ignored it is because they forget people actually live there. How can people live in a wilderness? Democratic State Representative Ben Nageak of Barrow, who is an Inupiat and born in Kaktovik, who lives in the affected area, wrote this: President Barack Obama and his lieutenants at the Interior Department will permanently harm our people and all Alaskans with his colonial attitude and decision making . . . It's terrifying to see the extent by which our pleas for time and a fair hearing of our views fall on deaf ears 5,000 miles away. That is a State representative born and raised in this area, an Inupiat, who is saying 5,000 miles from here you are making decisions without listening to us, without listening to our people. Our North Slope Borough Mayor Charlotte Brower didn't mince any words, either. She said that ``these types of paternalistic, executive fiats seem to be more appropriate for Andrew Jackson's administration than Barack Obama's.'' Pretty tough words. I am starting to think my words were pretty mild based on what I read from the mayor of the North Slope Borough and the Democratic State representative from Barrow. Mayor Brower has invited President Obama and Secretary Jewell to visit the North Slope, and she asked them to meet with the people who actually live there before proposing these types of sweeping land designations. If the President and the Secretary actually accept that invitation, Mayor Brower concluded: They might learn that the Inupiat people who have lived on and cared for these lands for millennia have no interest in living like relics in a giant open air museum. Rather, they hope to have the same rights and privileges enjoyed by people across the rest of the country. That seems like a pretty fair request to me. Even the New York Times interviewed a few Alaskans who didn't hide their feelings. One woman who said she had voted for the President twice said, ``He has just alienated an entire state.'' She described herself as being ``on the fence'' about ANWR before the proposal, but she added, ``without talking to any of us, just doing it by fiat-- that's not how you lead.'' I think she summed it up pretty well. What the President has done, the way he has done it--it is unfair, uncalled for, and it is unwarranted. So for it to be suggested by the counselor from the White House that my response is somehow overreacting or unwarranted, I think they should start listening to all of the people of Alaska. The presiding officer and myself were sent here to represent them and I think we are expressing pretty clearly where Alaskans are coming from on this. This is wrong. It should not be tolerated. And we will not just sit back while this administration locks up our State and the potential of our people. We have a lot more we will be discussing about this. Again, I mentioned on Monday that there was a trifecta with what we see coming out of this administration. I have been told by the Secretary that we would see his ANWR designation and that we would then see the 5-year lease sale that would take areas that had been in deferred status and completely withdraw them for an indefinite period of time, and that there would be a third announcement coming relating to the National Petroleum Reserve--the area where folks who said don't go to ANWR, go to NPRA, go to the National Petroleum Reserve. So the first company that tried to do so is trying to make it happen. What this administration is doing with the mitigation costs they are laying in front of them, the company will determine whether it is going to be economic. But my fear is that will be the third kick to Alaska. So it has been a bad week, a bad week for Alaska. But you know what, we are not people who are deterred by bad news, by bad weather. We have a way to roll with it. I was looking at the front page of the Fairbanks Daily News-Miner yesterday. They had a little recap of what is going on with the weather. It is about 52 below zero in Fort Yukon and 51 below in Fort Greely where we base our ground-based missile defense system. We are pretty proud of what we do. We can still provide for the defense and protection of this country and do it in some pretty cold weather. In Fairbanks, where I went to high school, I think the weather this morning was 47 degrees below zero, but the kids still go to school in this kind of weather. We are doing what we do up north. It is not easy, but it is an amazing place and the people there are pretty resilient. We have been kicked this week, but that doesn't mean we are down. It means we are just getting started. With that, I will have more to say about the process in front of us this afternoon, where we are with Keystone; but again, I am pleased that we have a good series of votes to keep us busy this afternoon, and I appreciate the indulgence of colleagues as we go through a process that can be very disruptive as they are trying to meet with constituents and pursue committee business. But I think we recognize that we want to be on a path toward completion of this bill, and I thank them for their cooperation. With that, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mrs. FISCHER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sasse). Without objection, it is so ordered. Unfunded Mandates Information and Transparency Act Mrs. FISCHER. Mr. President, last week my colleague Senator Lankford and I introduced the Unfunded Mandates Information and Transparency Act--a bill to enhance transparency about the true costs of burdensome Federal regulations affecting our States and localities. Twenty years ago the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act, otherwise known as UMRA, was signed into law to reduce the burden of Federal mandates on State and local governments, as well as the private sector. The statute was intended to fix a simple problem while promoting informed decisions by this Congress. But since UMRA's enactment in 1995, many remain concerned that the law has fallen short. In Nebraska and all across America, our constituents continue to face a growing mountain of redtape that stifles economic growth and holds back progress on a number of fronts. In 2011 alone the Government Accountability Office identified 14 different loopholes that would allow government agencies to avoid conducting the UMRA analysis. In other words, redtape has survived and prospered. By their very nature, Federal mandates are both complex and vague, which is why I have introduced a new bill to fix these shortcomings and increase accountability. My bill, known as the Unfunded Mandates and Information Transparency Act, would address UMRA's loopholes by mandating stricter agency requirements, enhance stakeholder input, and strengthen enforcement mechanisms. Furthermore, this bill has the power to get the job done. It would allow judges to place a stay on a regulation or invalidate a rule if a Federal agency fails to complete the required UMRA [[Page S561]] analysis. It would also close a glaring loophole used by agencies to skirt UMRA requirements. Last but not least, my bill would expand the scope of reporting requirements to include regulations imposed by independent regulatory agencies, such as the EPA. I know many Nebraskans are deeply concerned about the effects of new EPA requirements, such as the proposed water rule--a rule I have forcefully fought since it was first proposed. Nebraskans already go to great lengths to protect and preserve water resources within our State, but now the EPA is going overboard with this new proposal--one that represents a massive Federal power grab and clear disconnect with Main Street America. I share the belief of many Nebraskans that the Federal Government should be held responsible for the rules it puts into place. By clearly notifying taxpayers of the costs of each mandate, which the bill I introduced would require, we can better hold the Federal Government accountable for the economic impact of its costly regulations. I hope my colleagues on both sides of the aisle will join me in supporting this simple, commonsense legislation to help bring greater accountability and transparency to Washington. I thank the Presiding Officer and suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. HOEVEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. HOEVEN. Mr. President, I return to the floor today to discuss the legislation under consideration. As I did yesterday, I wish to begin by again thanking both the Senator from Alaska on our side of the aisle and the Senator from Washington on the other side of the aisle, who are the bill managers--the legislation managers in this case--of the Keystone XL Pipeline approval legislation that I put forward along with Senator Manchin. I wish to begin by thanking both of the managers for their diligence and for their bipartisanship and for working together to advance this legislation, but I also want to make sure all of the Members of this body get a chance to bring their amendments forward, debate those amendments, and have a vote. This afternoon we have scheduled 18 votes, and that is great. Some of those amendments I support; some I oppose. But we are going to do what this body is supposed to do and what the American people elected us to do, and that is to have this discussion and then vote. We are working to advance energy policy for this country that can not only truly help create more energy, jobs, and economic growth but also really address the national security implications of making our country energy secure. By that, I mean producing more energy than we consume and working with Canada, our friend and ally, to do that so that we don't have to depend on OPEC to do that and on parts of the world where there is great instability and where our interests are not aligned with the interests of some of those countries. Also, it enables us to actually weaken some of our opponents that are petro-dependent, countries such as Iran, which is now trying to build a nuclear weapon, as well as, right now, Russia, which is invading its neighbor Ukraine, one of our allies, where we are trying to stop the adventurism of President Putin. By truly becoming energy secure, by providing more supply of energy, we not only benefit every American at the pump--Americans are saving billions of dollars when they pull up to the pump. That is not only good for American consumers, it is good for our small businesses. Energy is a foundational industry that strengthens every other industry out there. It makes us more competitive in the global economy across the board. As I say, it weakens some of our opponents. So that is really the debate in which we are engaged. Yesterday I started to respond to some of the critics who oppose this legislation on the basis of saying this is a project for Canada and not for the United States, and that is not true at all. This pipeline would not only move crude from Canada to our refineries, it would also move crude from production in the United States, including in my State of North Dakota, which now produces 1.2 million barrels of oil a day-- second only to Texas--as well as Montana. So it also moves domestic crude to our refineries as well. Furthermore, it really is about making our Nation energy secure, working with Canada to become energy secure so we don't have to depend on OPEC. That is very much a national interest issue for this country, for this Nation, and for all Americans. I spoke about that a little bit yesterday. The second issue I would like to address is some of the environmental issues. I started to do that yesterday, but I deferred at that time because anytime we can get people to come to the floor to offer their amendments and make them pending, that is what we want to do. At that point we started getting people to come offer their amendments, and the bill managers, through their hard work, were able to get agreement, and we now have 18 amendments pending on a precloture basis. So we have made real progress in getting everyone involved and hopefully building more bipartisan consensus and getting on the energy debate the American people want and getting to a result where we can actually produce legislation that will help our Nation. So I started to get into the second point I wanted to discuss, which is some of the environmental aspects of the oil sands development and how technology is being deployed, with hundreds of millions of private dollars invested in new technologies that are not only producing more energy but doing it with a smaller environmental footprint. That helps to reduce the greenhouse gas emissions of oil that is produced in the oil sands. There are two projects I wish to speak about to give examples of how, if we continue to work to empower this kind of investment in new technologies, we get not only more energy more cost-effectively and more dependably but we also get it with environmental stewardship. The first project I will speak about is a project that has been undertaken in the oil sands in Alberta, Canada. Going back to this earlier chart, we can see that it is up in the Hardisty area, and this second chart is a picture of the project. It is one that is undertaken by the Shell Oil Company. It is called their Quest project. I will read a little bit about the project. Shell Canada will this year complete the world's first oil sands carbon capture and storage project. This is CCS--carbon capture and storage--something we have been working to develop in this country and apply to fossil fuels, not only things such as oil and gas but also coal. This is the new carbon capture technology. They will complete the world's first project. Continuing: The project, called Quest, will begin permanently storing CO 2 by the end of the year and will permanently store more than 1 million tons per year. Let me read that again. The project, called Quest, will begin permanently storing CO 2 by the end of the year and will permanently store more than 1 million tons per year. Quest reduces the emissions from Shell's upgrader by 35 percent--that's the equivalent of taking 175,000 cars off the road each year. Shell will transport the CO 2 50 miles north via pipeline and permanently store it more than a mile below ground under impermeable rock formations. My point is that here is an example of where a private company is working with the Province of Alberta on this project to invest hundreds of millions of dollars in carbon capture and storage technology that will not only apply to the oil sands, but--think about it--this is also technology that is not only being developed but deployed on a commercial scale in production that we can now take advantage of and use in this country to produce more energy from multiple sources-- again, smaller footprint, lower greenhouse gas. Isn't that the solution to better environmental stewardship where we get more energy that we produce here with our closest friends and allies, with better stewardship through investment by private companies in these new technologies and, in this case, working with Alberta? Alberta is also investing in this technology, but this is the innovation of our country, of our companies. This is the kind of ingenuity and [[Page S562]] innovation that helps us build the kind of future we want. In this case, it is a secure energy future by deploying these new technologies. The other point I will make as we look at this chart is that under the old system of oil sand production--remember, it is excavation, so they would be digging up this area and then extracting the oil from the oil sands. But under this new system of development, which is called in situ, they are actually drilling wells, and then they put steam down the hole to bring the oil up, and then they capture the CO 2 and store it underground, so smaller environmental footprint and lower greenhouse gas emissions. Since 1990 the greenhouse gas emissions on a per-barrel basis for oil sands production has gone down by 28 percent. So they have reduced it by almost a third. These new technologies will reduce it further going forward. This is about finding good solutions to create jobs and economic activity and energy security and take us into the future. That is why I wanted to discuss that project for just a minute. A second project I will reference is Exxon's Kearl project, spelled K-E-A-R-L. Just by way of preface, Exxon currently produces over 100,000 barrels of oil a day in the Canadian oil sands. They are going to increase that amount this year to 345,000 barrels a day. Their objective is to get to half a million barrels a day of oil produced in the Canadian oil sands. They are investing $10 billion in this project. That is their investment in this project and these new, better drilling techniques. Let me tell my colleagues a little bit about their project. Exxon is doing it differently than Shell and Quest. They are employing different technologies but investing $10 billion to reduce the environmental footprint, to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, but produce a lot of energy for Canada and for our country. Exxon's Kearl project will use cogeneration for steam, which a low- energy extraction process to recover oil, and heat integration between the extraction and treatment facilities to minimize energy consumption. As a result, oil produced from Kearl will have about the same life- cycle greenhouse gas emissions as many other crude oils refined in the United States as a result of technologies which significantly enhance environmental performance--again, smaller environmental footprint, lower greenhouse gas emissions. This is how we work to address the challenges we face, whether it is producing energy or anything else. We deploy these new technologies that enable us to do it better. Other environmental innovations for Kearl include onsite water storage to eliminate river withdrawals in low-flow periods and progressive land reclamation, which will return the land to the boreal forest. I wish to emphasize that for a minute. What we see around this site, which is actually the Shell site--this is the boreal forest. I have been to Hardisty, and I have seen the oil sands production. I was also taken out to areas where they had reclaimed land that had been formerly used to produce oil sands. Now we can't tell the difference between the land that has been reclaimed and the land that hadn't ever been used in terms of oil production. I was there and I looked at both and I couldn't tell the difference. Of course, that is subjective. You want to return it to the state it was in before it was tapped. With this newer production, there is a much smaller area that we would ultimately have to return to its original state. I wanted to touch on those two projects for a few minutes as well as point out that the Alberta Government actually requires that all land used in the development of oil sands has to be returned to the same or equivalent condition when it is no longer in use. The final point I wish to touch on for just a minute or two is another issue that has been brought up, which is pipeline safety. There have been some references to recent pipeline spills--one in Poplar, MT, actually not too far from where I live in western North Dakota. But the spill is from what is called the Poplar Pipeline, which I believe is owned by the Bridger Company. It is a pipeline that goes underneath the Yellowstone River. It was built in the 1950s, so we are talking about a pipeline that is over 50 years old. Isn't that just the point, that whether it is roads or bridges or buildings or pipelines or transmission lines or anything else, we have to make the investment in new facilities rather than just continuing to rely on old facilities? That is what I want to emphasize about the Keystone XL Pipeline project. This is an investment of $8 billion, not a penny of government investment but $8 billion in private investment in new steel and new technologies. Also, the Department of Transportation's Pipeline and Hazardous Material Safety Administration--PHMSA--the division of the Department of Transportation that oversees pipeline safety, has required 57 special conditions for this pipeline to make sure it is as safe as possible. I am going to touch on some of those to give a sense of what they are. The whole point is that here we are trying to create a business climate, a business environment where companies can put billions of dollars into these new technologies and this new infrastructure so that we can have energy as safely as possible, with the best stewardship possible, so we aren't relying on pipelines or other infrastructure that is more than 50 years old. We are trying to get that upgrade. We are not doing it at taxpayer expense. We are getting tax revenues. We will get hundreds of millions of tax revenues that will come back in from private sector projects where we are trying to empower that investment. At the same time, the PHMSA, the Department of Transportation Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration, has all these requirements that they are making part of the approval process--57 different special safety conditions for the Keystone XL Pipeline. They are conditions such as puncture resistance. For example, TransCanada is required by PHMSA in the environmental impact statement to ensure that the steel used in the pipeline can withstand impact from a 65-ton excavator with 3\1/2\-inch teeth. There is corrosion resistance coating, making sure it has a coating on it that is resistant to corrosion. There is cathodic protection. Cathodic protection is applied to a pipe so where it connects to other--it could be structures such as a bridge. It could be any place where the pipes are connected to make sure those other connections don't rust through into the pipe. For maintenance, TransCanada must submit certification that demonstrates compliance with all 57 conditions before they commence operation of the pipe. Airplanes will patrol the right of away at least 26 times a year. They will send cleaning and inspection tools through the pipeline once a year to collect and analyze basic sediment and water. Compare all of this to a pipeline that was built 50 years ago and laid on the floor of a river--versus a pipeline now, where if they have to cross a river, they use directional drilling. So they go down 25 feet below the river and put the pipe 25 feet down in the rock below the river, versus older pipelines that were just laid in there. Again, this is the new technology--the new safeguards. In horizontal drilling and directional drilling the pipe will be buried approximately 25 feet below riverbeds. So if there any riverbeds that cross, that is 25 feet below using directional drilling. There are automatic shutoff valves. So they will have automatic shutoff valves and they will be placed every 20 miles along the pipeline route. Extra miles will also be placed where there are protected water crossing and other areas of higher consequence. They can be closed remotely on either side of the line, isolating a damaged area within minutes of detection. Again, it is about making sure if there is an issue of any kind, that you can minimize and mitigate any kind of spill. With 100 percent weld inspections, there is a requirement that 100 percent of welds are inspected rather than just some of the welds under a test basis. With satellite monitoring and leak detection, Keystone XL will have more than 13,500 sensors feeding constant and detailed information about flow rates to the control center 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. That is so that if any kind of a leak is detected, it is immediately shut down so you minimize the amount of product that would leak. [[Page S563]] Those are the kinds of safety features--and there are 57 of them-- required by the administration's Pipeline and Hazardous Material Safety Administration. When we talk about pipeline safety and somebody comes in and says there is this pipe that broke so we should never have another pipe, we need to talk about that and address that in a sensible way. We have over 2 million miles of pipe in this country. The point is we do need to build new pipelines and upgrade them and take other steps to make sure the system is safe. But you don't do that by blocking investment in the new technologies and the new pipeline that will help us move product more safely, more cost-effectively, and more dependably. Those are the three issues I wanted to address. Again, I covered some of them yesterday, but I wanted to make sure that any time we had somebody coming down to offer amendments, we deferred to those individuals. I am pleased now we have 18 amendments pending on a whole gamut of issues related to this project, to this energy discussion, and to our efforts to advance a better energy future for our country. Again, I look forward to the debate this afternoon, to voting on these amendments, and to continuing to advance this legislation on behalf of the American people. I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mrs. MURRAY. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Perdue). Without objection, it is so ordered. Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in morning business. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Department of Homeland Security Funding Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I wish to take a few minutes to talk about the latest attempt by the Republicans in the House of Representatives--and a few Republicans in the Senate as well--to hold hostage the basic operation of our government, once again, over politics. While I have several issues with the Department of Homeland Security funding bill that the House has sent to us, I will first discuss this strategy we are seeing from Republicans, as the former chair of the Budget Committee and as someone who has worked across the aisle to break through gridlock in Congress. Two years ago our country was moving constantly from one manufactured crisis to the next. We had debt limit scares that were rattling our businesses and the markets, we were headed toward an absurd and unnecessary government shutdown, and people across the country were losing faith that their elected officials could get anything done when it came to the budget and to our economy. But by working together, Congressman Paul Ryan and I were able to reach a budget deal that prevented another government shutdown and showed the American people that Congress could work together to get things done. Because of that deal we were able to then pass bipartisan spending bills for the past 2 fiscal years, including 11 of the 12 appropriations bills from last year. Although we have a lot of work to do, it is clear that stability in the Federal budget makes a difference for our economy. We have to work together to build on that growth, to continue that certainty, and to make sure our economy is working for all families, not only the wealthiest few. Across the country, businesses have added more than 11 million new jobs--over 58 straight months of job growth. The unemployment rate is now under 6 percent and trending downward, and we have reduced the Federal budget deficit by over two-thirds since 2009. So when I look at the Homeland Security funding bill that the House of Representatives has now sent to us, I see a few things. I see a bill--the way it is drafted and was sent to us will tear apart families who are working hard to make it in America. I see a bill that will put our security at risk, and I see a bill that seriously threatens all of the work we have done recently, Republicans and Democrats, to keep our government functioning because the bill the House has sent over is simply unacceptable. It will not pass the Senate. Republicans know that. Let's be clear about what this bill is, it is a calculated, political gamble from our Republican colleagues. This looming showdown over funding the Department of Homeland Security is no accident. In fact, it is actually a risk they have been planning since last year all because of political pressure from the extreme anti-immigration right wing of their party. If Republicans are willing to risk funding for the Department of Homeland Security for political reasons, I believe the American people deserve to know exactly what that does mean because funding the Department of Homeland Security doesn't only keep the lights on the DHS headquarters, that funding protects our country from terrorist attacks at a time when the world is as dangerous and volatile as ever. It protects our country and American businesses from cyber attacks, a threat that is all too real as we have now seen in recent months. It supports basic security measures at our airports, at our seaports, and along the border. It even supports our Federal emergency management resources that are on call for every community in America. In my home State of Washington, this funding supports the Coast Guard, which protects shippers and sailors throughout Puget Sound, and Customs and Border Protection, which helps facilitate billions in international trade moving through my State, the most trade-dependent State in the country. Not funding these programs is a risk we cannot afford to take. It is reckless and irresponsible and, more than anything else, simply counterproductive for Republicans to put all of this on the line just to score some political points with the tea party and the far right. Unfortunately that appears exactly to be what they are doing. Once again Speaker Boehner and the House Republicans have decided they are willing to break up millions of families and deport millions of DREAMers who are victims themselves of a broken system. They have decided they are willing to stop the President's policy of focusing our law enforcement on national security threats, gang members, and violent criminals. Once again they have decided they are willing to make bipartisan, comprehensive immigration reform that much more difficult to achieve. This is much more than only an annual funding bill. This legislation is a message which has been sent to us loud and clear from House Republicans and Speaker Boehner that they are willing to continue pushing us from crisis to crisis. They are willing to play politics with our national security, and they are willing to turn their backs on millions and millions of children and families. For years now we have seen that strategy doesn't work--it doesn't work. It holds us back. But I have to say I was encouraged when Majority Leader McConnell said that at the end of the day the Senate will fund the Department of Homeland Security. It is clear the House bill will not pass the Senate, so I truly believe it is time for the majority leader to show, as he has promised, that he will let the Senate and Congress work efficiently. It is time for the majority leader to bring a clean DHS appropriations bill to the floor. Let's get it done, passed, and move on to the work that is so important to us. I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. SCHUMER. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I rise to urge my Republican colleagues to pass a clean bill to fund the Department of Homeland Security for the remainder of the fiscal year. We are now only 1 month away from a shutdown of the principal Federal agency charged with keeping Americans safe from terrorism and prepared for natural disasters. [[Page S564]] The President has said he will veto any funding bill that repeals or rolls back his Executive order on immigration, so anything but a clean bill to fund DHS means one thing and one thing alone. Republicans are unilaterally shutting down the agency. No matter what your grievance is, we shouldn't be playing politics with national security. It is alarming that even as we can now count the days, 30, until a Republican security shutdown, so many on the hard right are ready to just dismiss the consequences. Compared to their obsession with President Obama's immigration action and their desire to appease the tea party with radical and practical ideas that would not fix our system, to Republicans shutting down DHS is ``not the end of the world.'' So I will use my time to spell out what a DHS shutdown would mean for our country in the hopes that our Republican colleagues will be jolted back to reality and to common sense. Since this isn't the first time Republicans have put us through a shutdown, we actually have a very good idea as to what a DHS shutdown would look like. Here are just some of the functions that would cease if Republicans failed to put a clean bill on the floor: The bulk of DHS management and headquarter administrative support activities would cease, including much of the homeland security infrastructure that was built during the 9/11 terrorist attacks to improve command, control, and coordination of disparate frontline activities. Securing the Cities, a critical post-9/ 11 funding program that helps pay for nuclear detection capabilities in New York City, Los Angeles, and Washington, DC, could not be awarded in fiscal year 2015. The DHS Nuclear Detection Office, which since 9/11 coordinates on a daily or weekly basis with local law enforcement, will stop operating. FEMA's disaster preparedness unit would cease coordinating regular training activities for law enforcement for weapons of mass destruction events. FEMA employees in Washington and across the country who provide critical preparedness resources to local first responders would be sent home. Twenty-five percent of FEMA's headquarters and regional staff would be furloughed. FEMA personnel working on grants programs, such as funds for intelligence analysts or firefighter needs, would be furloughed, and even those personnel deemed essential would be denied paychecks until a funding bill is passed. This means we are not paying the Coast Guard, we are not paying the TSA, we are not paying the Border Patrol, the Secret Service or FEMA aid workers. So make no mistake, a DHS shutdown would hamstring our ability to combat threats to the homeland and to keep our citizens safe. The irony of course is that one of the programs that shutdown would close completely is E-Verify, which stops unscrupulous employers from hiring undocumented workers and cutting everyone's wages. So in order to make a point on immigration, our Republican colleagues are actually going to stop the program which prevents employers from hiring undocumented workers. Essentially to make a point about needing more immigration enforcement, Republicans are willing to shut down immigration enforcement. In short, I am perplexed as to why Republicans are playing this game of chicken with DHS funding because the only possible outcome that could come from withholding of a clean DHS bill is the shutdown of several critical post- 9/11 programs within the DHS and the furlough of thousands of workers paramount to our Nation's security and disaster preparedness. At a time when we need all hands on deck to keep America safe, Republican efforts to politicize our security would tie DHS's hands behind their back. So I urge my Republican colleagues in the House and Senate to drop this fool's errand and put a clean DHS funding bill on the floor as soon as possible. I yield the floor. Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mrs. SHAHEEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Mrs. SHAHEEN. Mr. President, I am here this afternoon to discuss the two concerns I have about the bill currently before the Senate--the regulation that would grant immediate approval of the Presidential permit necessary to construct and operate the Keystone XL Pipeline. First and foremost, I believe a thorough regulatory review process is critical for any major infrastructure project, particularly one that will cross our country's border. Regulatory review enables the identification of economic impacts from a major project and, more importantly, environmental impacts that infrastructure projects such as the Keystone Pipeline may bring. We shouldn't trade transparency for expediency when it comes to the construction of an international project that has such scope. I can't support a bill that sacrifices these important protections. That is why I voted in the past against legislation to allow the Keystone XL Pipeline to circumvent the normal review process, and that is why I intend to again vote against this bill. I also have a number of concerns about the impact of the Keystone Pipeline on our environment. In the past 2 weeks, we have had a spirited debate on this floor, and a number of my colleagues have come to the floor to talk about the pipeline oilspills we have seen in this country. Just a few days ago, an oil pipeline burst, leaking 50,000 gallons of crude oil into the Yellowstone River in Montana. Yet this spill pales in comparison to the 2010 Kalamazoo River oil spill where over 1 million gallons of oil sands poured into Talmadge Creek in Michigan. The cleanup has already cost more than $1 billion and taken over 4 years to complete. In fact, to date there has been no authoritative study on how the spills of oil sands crude may differ from those of conventional crude oil. This means we have no idea about the spill's long-term effects on the health of wildlife in that river. The other issue that has been raced onto the floor is the fact that right now, because of the way we define crude oil, TransCanada-- supporting and planning to build the Keystone Pipeline--is not required to pay into the federal oil spill liability trust fund, which would ensure taxpayers against any spills. So we have this out-of-state, out- of-country foreign company that is coming in to build this pipeline, and yet they are not required to pay, as any American company would be, into the oil spill liability trust fund. That, to me, doesn't make sense. Circumventing the regulatory process for Keystone prevents us from understanding the health hazards that we would face should another spill occur. I am also concerned that construction of the Keystone Pipeline will increase carbon emissions and undermine some of the most critical climate policies that we have in place. The pipeline poses threats to our environment that have already been identified. Tar sands greenhouse gas emissions are 81 percent greater than those of conventional oil. That is because the production of oil sands crude is more energy intensive, or more greenhouse gas intensive, than conventional crude production. Additional processes are required to extract the oil, remove the sand, and dilute the oil so that it can flow in a pipeline. In addition, if the pipeline is approved, much of the boreal wetlands in Alberta, Canada, which act as a carbon sink, would be destroyed, releasing 11 million to 47 million metric tons of CO 2 into the atmosphere. One of the reasons I am concerned about circumventing the regulatory process is because I believe this could set a precedent for a rushed approval of infrastructure projects currently under consideration in New Hampshire. In New Hampshire, we have two projects that really merit careful consideration and thorough review that could be affected by a precedent that says we should ignore the regulatory process. In New Hampshire, the Northern Pass transmission proposal, which proposes to deliver hydropower from Quebec into the New England energy markets and goes through northern New Hampshire, would bring power to southern New England, but New Hampshire wouldn't benefit. And any suggestion that we would circumvent the [[Page S565]] process is a real concern to people in New Hampshire who would be affected by that project. The other project is the potential reversal of the Portland-Montreal pipeline, which, if the determination were made to do this, would send oil sands through many New Hampshire communities, and that oil would then be shipped to foreign countries. So if we set the precedent of trading transparency for expediency with Keystone, without requiring the completion of a comprehensive approval process, local communities in New Hampshire may not have a meaningful voice in the process that deals with Northern Pass or reversing the Portland-Montreal pipeline. I think that is unacceptable. These three projects--Keystone, Northern Pass, and Portland- Montreal--have one important thing in common: They should undergo the comprehensive environmental and safety approval process required by existing law, and that should be done independent of politics. Circumventing the Presidential permitting process for cross-border pipelines and electric transmission facilities avoids the due process that is needed to determine whether these projects are in the best interests of the country. In New Hampshire, Northern Pass and the Portland-Montreal pipeline have raised serious concerns for people who live in areas impacted by these projects. That is why I worked with the entire New Hampshire congressional delegation in a bipartisan way to ensure that both projects undergo a transparent, thorough, and comprehensive review process. That allows the input of local communities who will be affected by these projects. Like people in New Hampshire and across the country, I share concerns about our Nation's energy future. Throughout my career I have fought for smart policies that will reduce energy costs in New Hampshire and across the country, that will help create jobs, and will protect our air and water from pollution. But I don't believe mandating a project that bypasses the approval process is a smart policy. We need to be smart and thoughtful about our energy future. I think it would set a dangerous precedent for other projects that could have serious consequences in New Hampshire and in other States around the country. I appreciate the debate we have had here on the Senate floor about the Keystone Pipeline, but I will be opposing this bill. I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. NELSON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Ukraine and Syria Mr. NELSON. Mr. President, I want to speak to the Senate about Ukraine and also about Syria. These are two parts of the world that are of particular critical importance to the United States foreign policy today because of what they portend for the future. The fact that our relationship is so rocky with the President of Russia, President Putin, who right up to just a few days after the Olympics suddenly shows his true colors when he invades Crimea, a part of Ukraine, despite all of the agreements when the Soviet Union broke up in the late eighties, early nineties, the agreements that in exchange for moving all of the nuclear weapons out of Ukraine back into Russia, that Russia would forever recognize and respect the sovereignty of Ukraine--well, that went out the window right after the Olympics, and Mr. Putin showed his true colors. He could couch it in all kinds of terms, that there is a Russian naval base that was there, but the fact is the whole world knows what he did, and no one could do anything about it. Then he started to move on the eastern part of Ukraine, and that, of course, is going on as we speak. The so-called rebels aren't really rebels. They are a front for the Russian military propped up with actual troops of the Russian military, sometimes disguised as being free and independent players simply because they don't have on their Russian uniforms; but in fact they have taken them off and put on uniforms that are not Russian uniforms to say that they are part of the rebel force. It is a ruse and everybody knows it is a ruse. I went last August to Ukraine, spoke with almost all of the top-level members of the government and asked what it was they needed. To my surprise, at the time they did not say they needed lethal equipment. They needed up-to-date, up-to-the-minute intelligence, and they needed training. I have urged the U.S. Government to provide that, and we are providing a number of things. This Senator thinks it is clearly in the interest of the United States that we provide more assistance to the Government of Ukraine so their military can have the equipment, including lethal assistance, to hold off Putin's aggression in Eastern Ukraine. This is a particularly critical time. I was there last summer, but what has happened in the meantime is over the course of the past year oil has gone from $100 to $46 a barrel. I remember asking someone when I was there and in the Baltic States what did oil need to get to and below in order for Mr. Putin to start really feeling the pinch, and they said anything under $85 a barrel. It is now around $46 a barrel. Although Russia has significant reserves as of a few months ago, about $450 billion of cash in reserves, that is lower now. Those reserves will hold them for a while because of the price they are getting for their oil. They don't have high production costs in Russia, but because the price is so much lower--half of what they were getting--their revenue is significantly down and therefore all of the money that was being supplied by the Russian Government for so many things, a plethora of different social programs--guess who is feeling the pinch. The people of Russia. So the aggressiveness of Mr. Putin internationally is an attempt to try to take his people's eye off of their own financial depravity and, in fact, get it on the international scene where the President of Russia is quite adept at pounding his chest and banging his fist. The Ukrainians are once again fighting right now as we speak for their territory. The Ukrainian Government took back the Donetsk airport in Eastern Ukraine. Then the rebels came back. And I say ``rebels'' with a wry smile. I mean this is the Russian Army. They came back and they took it again. Last week those Russian-backed rebels broke a shaky ceasefire agreement and they renewed the fighting with the Ukrainian Government military. This Senator feels that we have got to do more to help these people who are trying to protect their independence. If you recall, last year we passed the Ukraine Freedom Support Act which provides further sanctions and lethal aid such as antitank and anti- armor weapons, counterartillery radars, secure communications equipment, and tactical surveillance drones. All of that was needed. The fighting that is following appears to be a steady buildup of Russian support for the rebels. General Hodges, the U.S. Army commander in Europe, said last week that since December Russia had doubled its support for the rebels. General Breedlove, the NATO Supreme Commander, said that Russian electronic warfare and defense systems have been detected in the conflict areas. So let's not fool ourselves, the Russian Army is in there and we have to do more to help them. On Syria, this Senator feels where we are having success right now in Iraq against ISIS with the multiple strikes from the air, with training up the Iraqi Army as the boots on the ground, including some American boots on the ground that are advisers and trainers--at the end of the day we are going to have to do this in Syria if we are going to be successful. It is a lot more complicated in Syria because of the Assad government. The Free Syrian Army we are now starting to train--it is almost an impossible task. We train them, they go in, they try to attack ISIS. ISIS attacks them, but so does the Assad regime. That is not a recipe for success. We are working with the vetted opposition fighters to go after ISIS in Syria. We have to supply support. We have to supply lethal support in addition to the training and equipment in [[Page S566]] order for them to be successful. And for them to be successful, it is absolutely in the interest of the United States. Congress has approved the training and equipping of vetted elements of the Syrian opposition, and the Department of Defense recently announced it will deploy 400 personnel in that effort. We are going to have to do a lot more. The American people are tired of war, and yet we have a new kind of enemy, and we are going to have to take it right to them where they are. Mr. President, I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah. (The remarks of Mr. Hatch pertaining to the introduction of S. 295 are printed in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced Bills and Joint Resolutions.'') Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I wish to say a few words about some of the amendments we will be voting on later this afternoon--three of them in particular. The amendments I am referring to are the Merkley amendment No. 125, the Carper amendment No. 120, and the Heitkamp amendment No. 133. All three of these amendments address sensitive tax issues that fall squarely into the jurisdiction of the Senate Finance Committee, and all of them address issues that are likely to be litigated as the Finance Committee continues its efforts toward comprehensive tax reform. The Finance Committee is going to be very active in this Congress. We had our first bipartisan markup this morning. We already had two hearings, with more scheduled for next week, and perhaps more importantly--at least in the context of these three votes we will be having today--we have taken concrete steps in a process we believe will end in the introduction of bipartisan tax reform legislation. We have appointed five tax reform working groups to address the various areas of reform. Our hope is that over the next few months these working groups will study the issues and provide ideas we can use as we develop a comprehensive tax reform proposal. Ranking Member Wyden is on board with this effort. We are working together every step of the way. If we start singling out individual tax issues here on the floor--even issues Members may feel passionately about--we are going to undermine this bipartisan process. Virtually everyone in both parties agrees that we need to fix our broken, inefficient Tax Code. Sure, there are disagreements on what the substance of tax reform should look like, but there is a growing consensus on the need for reform, which is encouraging. If we are going to be successful in tax reform, we need to make sure these issues are addressed in the tax-writing committees. I think it is safe to say that all of the issues my colleagues are trying to address with their amendments are going to be litigated one way or another in the Finance Committee's efforts this year. That being the case, raising these issues as floor amendments on an unrelated bill is, in my view, very counterproductive. Finally, I would like to note that these amendments would all be subject to a constitutional point of order as they all deal with revenue and would need to be passed first by the House of Representatives. I am not going to raise that point of order at this time; I just want to make note of it for the record. Given all of these concerns, I hope my colleagues--Senators Merkley, Carper, and Heitkamp--will withdraw these amendments so these issues can be addressed in the proper forum. If they do not withdraw their amendments, I plan to vote against all three of them and urge all of my colleagues--particularly those who have an interest in a successful tax reform effort--to do the same. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cruz). The Senator from Colorado. Mr. BENNET. I congratulate the Presiding Officer, and I also congratulate Chairman Hatch for the unanimous vote he got in today's markup in the Finance Committee. It was a great bipartisan start to our work, as he said. I hope we will continue to have these discussions in that manner. Amendment No. 92, as Modified Mr. BENNET. Mr. President, I wish to speak today about the Burr- Bennet amendment No. 92, which we are slated to vote on later today. I will be brief because it is pretty straightforward. The amendment simply reauthorizes the Land and Water Conservation Fund and ensures that a dedicated portion of LWCF funds go to provide new access for our Nation's sports men and women. As many in this body know, the Land and Water Conservation Fund is one of the country's best and most important conservation programs. It is authorized to provide $900 million annually for efforts to preserve and increase access to our public lands and waterways. These resources historically have been used for projects that range from building city parks, to purchasing small parcels of isolated land from willing sellers, all the way to preserving the Nation's historic battlefields. This past summer in Colorado, we completed a huge LWCF project that retired several old mining claims on the San Juan National Forest near the town of Ophir. Over the Fourth of July weekend, the town invited me and my family to join them in a celebration of the accomplishment, and we took them up on that offer without a moment's hesitation. Ophir sits at 9,600 feet above sea level. It is the kind of place that has a sign on its main road--clearly painted by the kids who live in the town--indicating that their population totals 163 people, including, according to the sign, 55 kids, 30 dogs, and 15 cats. When we pulled in on the morning of the celebration, it seemed to me that the entire town was there. Over the course of that day--which included a hike, a picnic, and a formal program--it was amazing to hear from the community about the importance of this LWCF project and how many years so many people in the town devoted themselves to getting it done. Many of our mountain communities get huge portions of their revenue and business through recreation and tourism, and it is for some of these reasons that the town felt LWCF literally helped cement its economic future. I was an LWCF supporter before that visit, but that day really drove home the value of the program to me. That is only one of countless stories from Colorado. I know it can be replicated thousands of times across the country in all 50 States. Those stories and accomplishments alone make this amendment worth supporting. Let's also remember that when we are talking about LWCF, we are not talking about taxpayer dollars. When Congress crafted the measure back in 1965, they had a very innovative solution for how to pay for their concept. Instead of using taxpayer dollars from the Treasury, they decided to dedicate a portion of the revenue the government collects from offshore oil drilling to fund LWCF. This argument was very simple and elegant. As we deplete our natural resources--offshore reserves of oil and gas in this case--we ought to support the conservation of another natural resource: our lands and waterways. As I mentioned, Congress passed a law in 1965, and now it is time to reauthorize it. I thank Senator Burr, who has shown great leadership in crafting the amendment to do just that. This amendment is thoroughly bipartisan and enjoys cosponsors such as Senator Ayotte, Senator Alexander, and Senator Tillis, just to name a few. In fact, I am told there are 246 amendments that have been filed on this bill, and not one amendment has the number of cosponsors that this amendment does. This amendment has more cosponsors than any of the remaining 245 amendments. Before I close and urge my colleagues to vote yes, I want to paraphrase something I said on the floor last week about another amendment. Conservation policies such as LWCF are important to the American people. Protecting our land and water is mom-and-apple-pie stuff in Colorado, and I know our State is not the only one. Conserved lands and wide-open spaces are a huge economic driver across our country, and it is part of who we are in the West. We are not only talking about backcountry parcels, such as the one I visited in Ophir, we are talking about building new parks in inner cities and providing new access to hunters and anglers. The LWCF does all of these things and more. [[Page S567]] I say to my colleagues, if you are for city kids getting a new playground or making sure we protect gold medal trout streams or any number of benefits in between, then you need to be for amendment No. 92 from Senator Burr. I urge all of my colleagues to support the measure when it comes time for a vote later this evening. I think we would make a very meaningful statement about where the Senate is headed if we could supply the votes necessary to actually adopt this amendment. I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. CARDIN. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Flake). Without objection, it is so ordered. Amendment No. 75 Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, it is my understanding that in about a minute we are going to be voting on the first of a series of amendments. The first amendment is the amendment I have offered which I talked about before. I want to remind my colleagues what this amendment does. First, it would require a notification to Governors and to county officials of risks to their drinking water supplies that may be caused by the Keystone Pipeline. Second, the local officials would have the right to bring that information back to the Federal Government so that action could be taken in order to protect their drinking water supplies. Third, it provides a right of action for property owners for damages caused to their wells and drinking water as a direct result of the Keystone Pipeline construction. This is a pretty straightforward amendment. It provides States rights in knowing what is happening with regard to their drinking water, and it provides property owners rights for the damages that could be caused as a result of Keystone. I would urge my colleagues to support the amendment. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time in opposition? The Senator from Alaska. Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I would urge colleagues to oppose the Cardin amendment. In review, it appears that it is designed to halt the construction of this pipeline before it even begins. The amendment tells the President to provide this analysis of the potential risks to public health and environment from a leak or rupture and to provide that to every municipality and every county along the route, as well as to the Governors. Then the Governor can petition the President to effectively locate the pipeline somewhere else, at which point, again, construction could never commence. The Governors of Montana, South Dakota, and Nebraska have already approved the pipeline route through their States. So this amendment is an effort, I think, to build that opposition over contamination fears and in turn, pressure those Governors to reverse their positions and halt the pipeline's construction. I think it is important for colleagues to understand the risks to the water supplies along the pipeline path were examined by the State Department's final SEIS. They were found to be not significant. Again, I will vote no on this amendment and strongly encourage my colleagues to join me with this. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the question occurs on agreeing to amendment No. 75. Mr. CARDIN. I ask for the yeas and nays. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There appears to be a sufficient second. The clerk will call the roll. The legislative clerk called the roll. Mr. CORNYN. The following Senator is necessarily absent: the Senator from Florida (Mr. Rubio). Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the Senator from Nevada (Mr. Reid) is necessarily absent. The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the previous order requiring 60 votes for the adoption of this amendment, the amendment is rejected. Change of Vote Ms. HEITKAMP. Mr. President, on rollcall No. 31, I voted yea. It was my intention to vote nay. Therefore, I ask unanimous consent that I be permitted to change my vote, since it will not affect the outcome of the vote. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. (The foregoing tally has been changed to reflect the above order.) Ms. MURKOWSKI. I move to reconsider the vote. Mr. WICKER. I move to lay that motion on the table. The motion to lay on the table was agreed to. Amendment No. 70 The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there is now 2 minutes of debate prior to a vote in relation to amendment No. 70, offered by the Senator from Michigan, Mr. Peters. Who yields time? The Senator from Michigan. Mr. PETERS. Mr. President, as Michiganders, Senator Stabenow and I know firsthand how important the Great Lakes are. The lakes are a vital natural resource and an economic engine for our State, region, and the entire country. Unfortunately, Michiganders also know firsthand the environmental dangers and risks when it comes to pipeline leaks. We had the worst inland pipeline leak in our Nation's history near Kalamazoo, MI. Cleanup has taken over 4 years and has cost $1.2 billion. There is a 60-year-old pipeline under the Straits of Mackinac where Lake Michigan and Lake Huron come together. I cannot even fathom what would happen if there were an accident that contaminated the Great Lakes. The results would be catastrophic not only for the Great Lakes but also the entire country. That is why we need to act now and act quickly, and I urge my colleagues to support the Peters-Stabenow amendment. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska. Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I am not entirely certain I like this amendment. This is the first I have heard PHMSA may not have the resources to do its job. It does seem fair to have PHMSA come tell us if they do not have adequate resources. What I most strongly oppose with this amendment is its attempt to tie the construction of the Keystone XL Pipeline to an unrelated pipeline in a different State. There is no limit for the PHMSA study and certification included here, so we could be looking, in addition to the already 2,300-some-odd days this delay has been in place, at further delays. If my colleagues from Michigan are interested in a PHMSA study, I recommend they introduce their effort as a stand-alone bill so it can be considered by the committee of jurisdiction. If it is needed, we can move it through the regular order and certainly consider it in the future. I would ask my colleagues to oppose this amendment, and I remind colleagues that we are on 10-minute votes. [[Page S568]] The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the Peters amendment.

I move to lay that motion on the table. The motion to lay on the table was agreed to. Amendment No. 23 The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there is now 2 minutes of debate equally divided prior to a vote in relation to amendment No. 23, offered by the Senator from Vermont. The Senator from Vermont. Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, the scientific community tells us very clearly that if we are going to reverse climate change and the great dangers it poses for our country and the planet, we must move aggressively to transform our energy system away from fossil fuels to energy efficiency and sustainable energy. This amendment would provide a 15-percent rebate to homeowners so that we could install 10 million new solar rooftops across the country within 10 years. This would result in enough new electrical generation to retire nearly 20 percent of our dirty coal-fired plants and create a significant number of new jobs. So if we are interested in reversing the dangers of climate change and creating jobs, I would urge Senators to support this amendment. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska. Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, the sponsor of this bill knows that I, too, am a supporter of solar, and I think we all are, but it is important to recognize what this measure would do. When we are talking about the benefits to this country and how much it will cost, it is important to understand this. When this was first introduced in the 110th Congress, the goal of 10 million solar roofs legislation was too costly, but we have since seen decreased costs and growth in the solar industry that have made this Federal assistance unnecessary. We have seen the residential solar market grow, we have seen the costs drop. The cost of the solar systems have dropped about 60 percent in the last 4 years. Despite these trends, we are not close to reaching that 1 million mark let alone the 10 million installations. So the real question is, How much is this going to cost us to achieve? The proposed rebate per system is the lesser of 15 percent of the initial capital cost. This puts the Federal Government on the hook for up to $100 billion to pay for these installations. We can debate the merits of jobs and job creation, but I again urge my colleagues to oppose the Sanders amendment. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time has expired. The question is on agreeing to the Sanders amendment. Ms. STABENOW. I ask for the yeas and nays. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There is a sufficient second.

Under the previous order, there is 2 minutes of debate equally divided prior to a vote in relation to amendment No. 15, offered by the Senator from Texas, Mr. Cruz. The Senator from Texas. Mr. CRUZ. Mr. President, this amendment would expedite the export of liquid natural gas and would provide countries that are members of the WTO the same expedited process that is currently available to free- trade agreement countries. There are now in the Department of Energy some 28 applications pending to export liquid natural gas. This should be an amendment that would bring together Republicans and Democrats. A recent study showed that allowing us to export LNG could create as many as 450,000 new jobs by 2035 that could produce GDP growth of up to an additional $73.6 billion and produce 76,000 more manufacturing jobs. It would aid our allies such as Ukraine, the Baltics, and Europe, and would weaken countries such as Russia that would use natural gas for economic blackmail. I would urge all Senators to support this amendment. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts. Mr. MARKEY. The amendment offered by the Senator from Texas is [[Page S569]] drafted so broadly that it allows just about every nation which is a member of the World Trade Organization to automatically receive natural gas exported from the United States of America. The process is just eliminated--automatic. What will that do? No. 1, it will increase prices to American consumers. The Energy Information Agency has already determined that the LNG export facilities already approved are going to lead to a 50- percent increase in the price of natural gas here in America. It would jeopardize American manufacturing which has seen 700,000 new jobs created in the last 5 years in America largely because of low-priced natural gas. It is going to increase carbon pollution because it is going to slow the pace of change from coal over to natural gas in the generation of electricity. It is going to undermine our trade negotiations because it is all going to be given away here on the Senate floor. And, finally, it is going to harm our national security, because if we converted one-third of our trucks and buses, it backs out all the oil that we import from the Persian Gulf by using natural gas in American vehicles. We are going to ship jobs along with that gas going overseas. I urge a ``no'' vote on the Cruz amendment. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.

Under the previous order, there will now be 2 minutes of debate equally divided prior to a vote in relation to amendment No. 125, offered by the Senator from Oregon, Mr. Merkley. The Senator from Washington. Amendment No. 125 Withdrawn Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Merkley amendment No. 125 be withdrawn. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is so ordered. The amendment is withdrawn. Amendment No. 73 The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there will be 2 minutes of debate equally divided prior to a vote in relation to amendment No. 73, offered by the Senator from Kansas, Mr. Moran. The Senator from Kansas. Mr. MORAN. Mr. President, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service has determined that the lesser prairie chicken should be listed in a number of States, including Kansas, as a threatened species. The lesser prairie chicken has had a significant history in our State and a significant population of birds, but as a result of a drought, the habitat for the lesser prairie chicken and other wildlife has been diminished and the number of birds has decreased. The consequences of listing the lesser prairie chicken that results from a drought is so dramatic and so damaging to the Kansas economy and to the farmers and ranchers and the use of their lands, to the oil and gas industry and the exploration of oil and gas, and to the utility industry in regard to the production and transmission of electricity that this amendment is necessary to set aside that listing as a threatened species and to allow interest holders in Kansas to come together and find a commonsense solution based upon sound science to protect the habitat of this bird. This is not just a Kansas issue, and in fact, this species is only the precursor to problems others will have in their States. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired. The Senator from New Mexico. Mr. UDALL. Mr. President, I rise today to oppose the Moran amendment, which would delist the lesser prairie chicken as a threatened species. To be clear, I appreciate some of the concerns about this listing by farmers, ranchers, and industry. I am concerned about any unintended consequences this listing may have on rural New Mexicans. I strongly support and I assume the Senator from Kansas supports the bipartisan five-State effort for a thorough review. The Fish and Wildlife Service took numerous steps in this process to respond to all stakeholders and to enable habitat conservation and economic growth. New Mexico has been and continues to be a leader in cooperative conservation in places where the prairie chicken is found. Ranchers and oil and gas industries deserve their praise for their efforts. So it is working and the sky is not falling, but we should not take this top-down political approach. Listing and delisting of the species by Congress goes against the intent of the law, which requires the government to make these decisions based on science, not politics. I urge my colleagues to vote no. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired. The question is on agreeing to the Moran amendment. Mr. McCONNELL.

Amendment No. 148 Under the previous order, there is now 2 minutes of debate equally divided prior to a vote in relation to amendment No. 148, offered by the Senator from Rhode Island, Mr. Whitehouse. The Senator from Rhode Island. Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, the underlying measure benefits specific investors, specific corporations, and pushes regulatory approval of a specific project. In that sense, it has all the earmarks of the biggest earmark ever. We have learned from other history with earmarks that when you have a project that benefits specific investors and specific corporations and specific entities, there is a valuable premium on having the public know about the campaign contributions relative to that project. This bill requires the disclosure of over $10,000 in campaign contributions from entities that will make more than $1 million off this project. It is the type of transparency that many of my Republican colleagues had been for before they were against it. I urge an ``aye'' vote. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired. The Senator from Alaska. Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, this amendment is virtually identical to the text of what we saw last year. It was tabled by a vote of 52 to 43. This amendment is not relevant to this debate. It is as unnecessary now as it was the first time we voted on it. To the extent it is legal for a person or a company to make a campaign contribution, Federal and State election laws require public disclosure of those campaign contributions. Any other more general political activities a company or a person may choose to engage in are governed by existing laws and regulations as well. For that reason, I am going to be opposing this amendment for a second time and would encourage my colleagues to do as well. The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the previous order, there is now 2 minutes of debate equally divided prior to a vote in relation to amendment No. 132, offered by the Senator from Montana, Mr. Daines. The Senator from Montana. Mr. DAINES. Mr. President, my amendment simply expresses the sense of Congress that all future national monument designations should be subject to consultation with local governments and the approval of the Governor and legislature of the States in which such designation would occur. This amendment ensures that the people affected most by these designations have a seat at the table and their voices are heard. The current administration, as well as past administrations--both Republican and Democratic--have made efforts to stretch the intent of the Antiquities Act, threatening Montanans' ability to manage our State's resources. It is a trend we are seeing. Any bill designation that impacts land management should be locally driven, not spearheaded in Washington. I urge my colleagues to support this amendment. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington. Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, speaking in opposition to this amendment, there is a reason why they call it a national monument. That is because it is a national process, and it is a national decision. Yes, Presidents of the United States consult with Governors and consult with State legislators, but they are not required to have a bill or the authority of the Governor before they make a national monument. Nearly half of our national parks, including the Grand Canyon and Olympic National Park, were designated under this Antiquities Act. Sixteen Presidents--eight Republicans and eight Democrats--have designated over 130 national monuments since Teddy Roosevelt signed this act in 1906. I think it has worked well for the United States of America. Please turn down this amendment. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to amendment No. 132, the Daines amendment.

Under the previous order, there is now 2 minutes of debate equally divided prior to a vote in relation to amendment No. 115, offered by the Senator from Delaware, Mr. Coons. The Senator from Delaware. Mr. COONS. Mr. President, we need to take steps now to prepare for the coming impact of climate change on our Nation's infrastructure. The Federal Government plays a crucial role in protecting our infrastructure and partnering with State and Federal, tribal, and local governments to prepare. The Federal Government, including our Pentagon and the highway administration, is already planning and preparing for these impacts. Many States are as well. From my home State of Delaware to Alaska to Florida, all are already planning responsibly for the future impacts of climate change. Preparing now is only responsible, because every dollar invested in planning and preparing is projected to save us up to $4 in future disaster relief. This amendment is supported by a number of organizations--the American Society of Civil Engineers, the National Wildlife Federation, the Union of Concerned Scientists, and others. This amendment does not speak to the human role in climate change or emissions. It simply acknowledges that climate change is having an impact on our infrastructure and suggests that planning is responsible. I urge my colleagues to support this amendment. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska. Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I had a conversation with our colleague from Delaware, and I told him I think this is an area where we might be able to work together. I had actually introduced an amendment that deals with the adaptation that helps to assist those communities that have been affected by climate. We see that up in the coastline of Alaska. Senator Merkley has an amendment that also deals with adaptation. This is about resilience. I am going to oppose the sense-of-the-Senate at this time because of some of the language. I get a little confused or am not certain we are stating it in the right manner. But I do think this process has been healthy in the sense that by having an opportunity to have amendments come forward, we find out where there might be areas where we can work to develop future initiatives that we all might be able to support on a bipartisan basis. I look forward to working with the Senator from Delaware. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment. Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.

Under the previous order, there will now be 2 minutes of debate equally divided prior to a vote in relation to amendment No. 35, offered by the Senator from Maine, Ms. Collins. The Senator from Maine. Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, the Senator from Virginia, Mr. Warner, and I are offering an amendment that would help school officials to learn about existing Federal programs to improve energy efficiency in order to reduce school energy costs. It would not authorize any new programs or any new funding. It would simply require a review of existing Federal programs and require the Department of Energy to establish a coordinating structure so that schools can more easily navigate the many programs that are scattered across the Federal Government. I know of no opposition to the amendment. To try to make life easier for my colleagues, if it is acceptable to the managers, I would be happy to accept a voice vote. I don't know if my colleague from Virginia has any comments he would like to make. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia. Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I agree with the Senator from Maine, and I would urge a voice vote as well. Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I thank both Senators, and I ask unanimous consent that the 60-vote affirmative threshold on the Collins amendment be vitiated, and I urge its adoption by voice vote.

Under the previous order, there will now be 2 minutes of debate equally divided prior to a vote in relation to amendment No. 166, offered by the Senator from Alaska, Ms. Murkowski. The Senator from Alaska. Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I have had an opportunity to speak on this amendment several different times. Effectively, what we are doing is releasing wilderness study areas if within 1 year of receiving the recommendation Congress has not yet designated the study area as wilderness. Effectively, what is happening is designations will come from the administration. Congress is the entity that is to approve them. But in the interim these areas are managed as de facto wilderness. In fact, many areas have been managed as de facto wilderness for decades because the Congress has not acted. So simply, what we do in this amendment is to put a time period. Until the Congress makes a final determination on the wilderness study area, these areas will be determined not to be wilderness and not managed as such. But they are putting a time parameter on that so that they are not managed as wilderness areas indefinitely. I would urge a ``yes'' vote from my colleagues. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington. Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, this is a sweeping attack on millions of acres of land recommended for wilderness. This would nullify much of the Obama administration's plan for the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge and would also immediately abolish wilderness studies on BLM lands in 12 Western States. It would also abolish protection for 2.3 million acres in national wildlife refuges. These lands have been refuges, and they should be managed accordingly. So I would ask my colleagues to oppose this amendment. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the Murkowski Amendment No. 166. Ms. MURKOWSKI. I ask for the yeas and nays.

Mr. President, this amendment will provide a sense of the Senate that we will provide some certainty to the American wind and other renewable industries by taking a look at the production tax credits and actually having a forward progress report so that they know exactly what the rules will be in the future, however short or long that may be. Every year, as we do the tax extenders, there are people waiting to find out if they still have a job. People in my State are waiting to know whether they are going to be put to work the next day or even the next week based on what this Congress does. It is so critical that we actually have predictability in this industry. This is a jobs bill, and it is an energy bill. I can't imagine anything more germane to the Keystone XL Pipeline than a bill that provides both jobs and certainty to an ``all of the above'' essential, which is wind. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? The Senator from Arizona. Mr. FLAKE. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to this amendment. I believe we do need more certainty, and the certainty ought to be that it is time for this tax credit--particularly the wind PTC--to expire. This was enacted 23 years ago as a temporary tax measure. There has been a lot of wind that has blown since that time, and we have a mature industry. In fact, the other day the President said we are No. 1 in the world in wind power. We ought to have more certainty, and the certainty that needs to be there is that the tax credit is going to end and that we stop picking winners and losers in the energy economy. With that, I yield the floor. Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I would like to speak on Amendment No. 133, offered by Senator Heitkamp of North Dakota. The amendment is a sense of Congress that the renewable electricity tax credit should be extended for 5 years. While I supported the amendment, I would like to express my concerns regarding the consideration of this amendment at this time. I have been an outspoken supporter of renewable energy for many years. In fact, I first authored the wind production tax credit in 1992 to drive this renewable energy technology. I have worked for many years to provide as much certainty as possible to grow the domestic wind industry. Iowa has seen an enormous investment in wind energy manufacturing and wind farm development. I know firsthand the boom-and- bust cycle that exists for renewable energy producers when Congress fails to extend these critically important tax incentives. But I also know this credit won't go on forever. It was never meant to, and it shouldn't. In 2012 the wind industry was the only industry to put forward a phaseout plan. A number of my colleagues here in the Senate have been working to construct a responsible, multiyear phaseout of the wind tax credit. That is why I am somewhat puzzled by an amendment that suggests a 5-year extension of this credit. It seems disconnected with reality. I would remind my colleagues on the other side that in November of 2014, the House offer on tax extenders included a multiyear extension of the wind production tax credit that would have provided the certainty and soft landing that most of us and the industry support, but President Obama issued a veto threat before the ink was dry, and as a result the wind incentive expired. Again, I strongly support wind energy, but I support a prudent way forward on an extension of the production tax credit. This amendment fails terribly in that regard. That is why I am disappointed that the Senator from North Dakota insisted on going forward with a 5-year extension on this bill. This is not a real effort to extend the wind incentive. I am afraid this was simply a politically motivated effort designed to score political points. [[Page S573]] It is unfortunate that in this case, politicking has trumped efforts to achieve sound, responsible policy. Rather than offer ``gotcha'' amendments on an unrelated bill, we should be working together to craft an extension of these important tax incentives that work for the wind industry, that are realistic politically, and that make sense for the American taxpayer. That effort requires regular order, working through the Finance Committee, to determine the most prudent path forward. It should be done in the context of comprehensive tax reform, where all energy tax provisions are on the table, rather than as a sense of the Congress on the unrelated Keystone XL bill. I hope that with this political exercise behind us, those of us who seek to ensure a responsible transition for the wind production tax credit can get to work and achieve a sensible policy for those who depend on it. It is too bad that this ill-timed, ill-conceived amendment may have actually harmed those efforts. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment. Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There appears to be a sufficient second. The clerk will call the roll. The bill clerk called the roll. Mr. CORNYN. The following Senator is necessarily absent: the Senator from Florida (Mr. Rubio). Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the Senator from Nevada (Mr. Reid) is necessarily absent. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Perdue). Are there any other Senators in the Chamber desiring to vote? The result was announced--yeas 47, nays 51, as follows: [Rollcall Vote No. 40 Leg.] YEAS--47 Baldwin Bennet Blumenthal Booker Boxer Brown Cantwell Cardin Carper Casey Collins Coons Donnelly Durbin Feinstein Franken Gillibrand Grassley Heinrich Heitkamp Hirono Kaine King Kirk Klobuchar Leahy Markey McCaskill Menendez Merkley Mikulski Murphy Murray Nelson Peters Reed Sanders Schatz Schumer Shaheen Stabenow Tester Udall Warner Warren Whitehouse Wyden NAYS--51 Alexander Ayotte Barrasso Blunt Boozman Burr Capito Cassidy Coats Cochran Corker Cornyn Cotton Crapo Cruz Daines Enzi Ernst Fischer Flake Gardner Graham Hatch Heller Hoeven Inhofe Isakson Johnson Lankford Lee Manchin McCain McConnell Moran Murkowski Paul Perdue Portman Risch Roberts Rounds Sasse Scott Sessions Shelby Sullivan Thune Tillis Toomey Vitter Wicker NOT VOTING--2 Reid Rubio The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order requiring 60 votes for the adoption of this amendment, the amendment is rejected. Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote. Mr. HATCH. I move to lay that motion on the table. The motion to lay on the table was agreed to. Amendment No. 48 The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there is now 2 minutes of debate equally divided prior to a vote in relation to amendment No. 48 offered by the Senator from New York, Mrs. Gillibrand. The Senator from New York. Mrs. GILLIBRAND. Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of the Keystone XL Pipeline Act. As it stands now, gas companies in this country do not have to comply with the Safe Drinking Water Act-- the law that keeps our tapwater clear, safe, and clean. For decades now, this loophole has exempted hydrofracking and gas storage companies from this law, even though every other energy industry, including oil and coal industries, is legally obligated to comply. If big coal can comply with this law, so can gas companies. This special exemption is unfair, it is unnecessary, and it is unsafe. My amendment would finally remove it from the law. I urge my colleagues not to let this chance pass us by. I ask for the yeas and nays. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There appears to be a sufficient second. The yeas and nays were ordered. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska. Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, claiming the 1 minute in opposition. As the Senator from New York has described, this would apply to the requirements of the Safe Drinking Water Act to underground ejection of natural gas. Currently the Safe Drinking Water Act expressly prohibits this application. This amendment to add the requirements to the Safe Drinking Water Act is beyond the scope of the immediate Keystone debate. We are debating the approval of a pipeline that is going to carry oil, not gas. If the Senator from New York wants to debate the issues of fracking--most certainly those issues are before the Energy and Natural Resources Committee, and the Safe Drinking Water Act--I would welcome a stand- alone bill. We will have those discussions, but on this measure I would oppose and encourage Members to vote against the Gillibrand amendment. I would remind Members we are so close to wrapping up this series of amendments. If we can ask the folks to stick around for these final few and keep to the 10-minute line. I know Senator Feinstein is looking to encourage the women of the Senate to gather for a meal later on, and that would be important for us. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to Gillibrand amendment No. 48. The yeas and nays have been previously ordered. The clerk will call the roll. The bill clerk called the roll. Mr. CORNYN. The following Senator is necessarily absent: the Senator from Florida (Mr. Rubio). Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the Senator from Nevada (Mr. Reid) is necessarily absent. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Are there any other Senators in the Chamber desiring to vote? The result was announced--yeas 35, nays 63, as follows: [Rollcall Vote No. 41 Leg.] YEAS--35 Baldwin Blumenthal Booker Boxer Brown Cantwell Cardin Carper Casey Coons Durbin Feinstein Franken Gillibrand Hirono King Klobuchar Leahy Markey Menendez Merkley Mikulski Murphy Murray Nelson Peters Reed Sanders Schatz Schumer Shaheen Stabenow Warren Whitehouse Wyden NAYS--63 Alexander Ayotte Barrasso Bennet Blunt Boozman Burr Capito Cassidy Coats Cochran Collins Corker Cornyn Cotton Crapo Cruz Daines Donnelly Enzi Ernst Fischer Flake Gardner Graham Grassley Hatch Heinrich Heitkamp Heller Hoeven Inhofe Isakson Johnson Kaine Kirk Lankford Lee Manchin McCain McCaskill McConnell Moran Murkowski Paul Perdue Portman Risch Roberts Rounds Sasse Scott Sessions Shelby Sullivan Tester Thune Tillis Toomey Udall Vitter Warner Wicker NOT VOTING--2 Reid Rubio The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order requiring 60 votes for the adoption of this amendment, the amendment is rejected. Ms. MURKOWSKI. I move to reconsider the vote. Ms. CANTWELL. I move to lay that motion on the table. The motion to lay on the table was agreed to. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska. Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending Murkowski substitute, as amended, be considered original text for the purposes of further amendment. I ask unanimous consent that when the Senate resumes consideration of S. 1 tomorrow, Thursday, January 29, [[Page S574]] there be 15 minutes equally divided in the usual form and the Senate proceed to vote on the following amendments in the order listed: Barrasso No. 245; Cardin No. 124; Burr No. 92, as modified; Daines No. 246; Vitter No. 80, as further modified with the changes at the desk; Udall No. 77; further, that all amendments on this list be subject to a 60-vote affirmative threshold for adoption and that no second-degrees be in order to any of the pending amendments to this bill. I ask unanimous consent that there be 2 minutes of debate equally divided between each vote and that all votes after the first in this series be 10-minute votes. I further ask that once these amendments have been disposed of, the Senate agree to proceed to the motion to reconsider the failed cloture vote on S. 1; that the motion to reconsider be agreed to and the Senate proceed to vote on the motion to invoke cloture on the bill, upon reconsideration. I ask consent that if cloture is invoked on the bill, as amended, all time postcloture be considered expired at 2:30 p.m. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is so ordered. The amendment (No. 80), as further modified, is as follows: At the end, add the following: TITLE _--OUTER CONTINENTAL SHELF OIL AND GAS LEASING REVENUE SEC. _01. REVENUE SHARING FROM OUTER CONTINENTAL SHELF WIND ENERGY PRODUCTION FACILITIES. The first sentence of section 8(p)(2)(B) of the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act (43 U.S.C. 1337(p)(2)(B)) is amended by inserting after ``27 percent'' the following: ``, or, beginning in fiscal year 2016, in the case of projects for offshore wind energy production facilities, 37.5 percent''. SEC. _02. OUTER CONTINENTAL SHELF LEASING PROGRAM REFORMS.

The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska. Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I think Members have been given the outline for tomorrow morning that will take us through a final vote on cloture so that we can get to final passage of the Keystone XL Pipeline. I appreciate the consideration and the courtesy of all Members. It has been a long day. We have worked through about a dozen additional amendments, if my count is correct, and we have done it in pretty good order. We have done it while there have been a number of committee meetings going on, which can be very disruptive, but I think with the level of cooperation we have had, we will be able to conclude our business at a relatively civilized hour this evening. I appreciate the good work of my partner and ranking member Senator Cantwell in getting us to this place. I am hopeful that with the number of amendments we have outlined for the morning and then the handful of germane amendments we will have in the afternoon, we will be able to move on to other business before the Senate. But I thank my colleagues for all of the effort and cooperation we have had to this point. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington. Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I wish to thank my colleague from Alaska for her hard work in getting us through this process. I think our colleagues can see the daylight to finishing this up tomorrow, hopefully. I know Members have worked across the aisle on some of these remaining issues, and we are still trying to work a few of them out. So hopefully tomorrow will go as smoothly as today has. I would like to turn now to my colleague from New Mexico to call up his amendment. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico. Amendment No. 77 (Purpose: To establish a renewable electricity standard, and for other purposes) Mr. UDALL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to set aside the pending amendment so that I may call up my amendment No. 77. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk will report. The bill clerk read as follows: The Senator from New Mexico [Mr. Udall], for himself, Mr. Markey, and Mr. Bennet, proposes an amendment numbered 77. Mr. UDALL. I ask unanimous consent that the reading of the amendment be dispensed with. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. (The amendment is printed in the Record of January 20, 2015, under ``Text of Amendments.'') Mr. UDALL. Mr. President, let me just say to the two leaders on the floor who have participated in this open amendment process that I really appreciate the way Chairwoman Murkowski and Ranking Member Cantwell have worked through this bill. I really appreciate all their help. I have heard, at least on our side of the aisle, over and over that this is the way the Senate should be moving, this is the way we should be working. So I think all of us are very appreciative of how the two managers of the bill have worked together. I thank my colleagues, and I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska. Ms. MURKOWSKI. I thank our colleague for his kind comments. We do have one more consent request here very briefly. I ask unanimous consent that the order of votes on the Burr and the Daines amendments be reversed. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Ms. MURKOWSKI. With that, Mr. President, I again thank Members for their cooperation today and look forward to yet another productive day tomorrow. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota. Mr. HOEVEN. Mr. President, I want to express my appreciation to the bill managers for their hard work today and for their efforts in the work that was done in a bipartisan way on this legislation. I know both the bill managers have spent an awful lot of time putting together these amendments, and I think they have really bent over backward to make sure Members on both sides of the aisle have had an opportunity to file their amendments, to make those amendments pending, and to get votes on the amendments. So I would like to express my appreciation to both of them for all the work they have done and for the process today in voting on amendments. With that, I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona. The Economy Mr. FLAKE. Mr. President, yesterday the Congressional Budget Office-- the CBO--released its budget and economic outlook showing the forecast through 2025. It should strike fear in the heart of anybody who is concerned about this country's financial future. The very short-term news is good. The deficit is projected to fall-- but only for another 2 years. In 2017 the deficit is projected to start rising again to $1.1 trillion in 10 years. That is the annual deficit. By 2025 the deficit will be 4 percent of our overall economy. Right now the country's debt in cumulative deficits over the years-- the cumulative debt--is $18 trillion. This year we will pay about $277 billion just servicing that debt. That amount might seem low, but it is because of artificially low interest rates. In 10 years we will pay about $827 billion a year just to service the debt. That is 3 percent of our economy just to pay interest on the debt. That is unsustainable. Don't take my word for it, though. You can take CBO's. They said: Such large and growing Federal debt would have serious negative consequences, including increasing Federal spending for interest payments; restraining economic growth in the long term; giving policymakers less flexibility to respond to unexpected challenges; and eventually heightening the risk of a financial crisis. I have been working on these issues--this issue in particular--for a long time, and I have to admit that sometimes it is tough to get people to focus on this topic. But we shouldn't be fooled and patting ourselves on the back just because we have done things such as getting rid of earmarks. That is a good thing, but it is certainly insufficient to address our spending. The culture in Washington is still the culture of runaway spending, not just in earmarks, as I said, not just in wasteful spending. For example, spending on Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid will nearly double over the next decade alone. This is not a revenue problem that we are having. Projected revenues will exceed their 50-year historical average of 17 percent of GDP this year and will grow to over 18 percent of the economy in this decade. The culture of spending in Washington is something that defies logic, defies math and an honest assessment of who we are as a country. As a result, the United States is fast becoming a once-prosperous nation. We don't want that designation. It is truly a frightening distinction. Yet too few in Washington are motivated to get this country's fiscal house in order. One has to wonder how bad it is going to have to get to prod those who are not yet motivated. Some will argue that we need to take baby steps to address our fiscal crisis. I think we are well past that time, but whatever kinds of steps we take, we need to take them now. We need to turn this culture of spending in Washington to one that will fully repair our economy. That will give the private sector the stability and confidence to create jobs. We also need to reform our cumbersome Tax Code. Most of all, we need to relieve future generations of the burden of our financial mess. In short, it is well past time to start climbing our way out of this fiscal hole we are in. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island. Climate Change Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I am here now for the 87th consecutive week the Senate has been in session to urge action on climate change. We have had an interesting couple of weeks on the Keystone Pipeline, but from a climate change and carbon pollution point of view, this would obviously not be helpful. Indeed, it would [[Page S576]] be a disaster leading to as much as 27 million--27 million--metric tons of additional carbon dioxide emitted per year. To put that number into some perspective, that is the equivalent of adding 6 million cars and trucks to our roads for 50 years. So it is a very considerable carbon price to pay. We have seen a poster used on the Senate Floor that says it will have no environmental effect. That is not precisely true. Indeed, precisely the opposite is true. This is the environmental effect it will have, and it is considerable. The report referred to went on to say that it would be offset by the fact that this fuel would go out by rail anyway. But that offset was conditioned on a fuel price above $75 per barrel of oil, and we are at $50. So there is no way that conclusion can stand, and the underlying fact is what prevails--27 million metric tons of additional carbon dioxide. It is obviously very bad from an environmental perspective. It is a lot of ``not much'' from a jobs perspective. Every 4 days we add more jobs than the construction of this pipeline just through the economic recovery that is taking place. This is a little bit hard to explain, particularly when you think that this bill is going to be dead on arrival at the White House. We have known from the beginning that this is going to be vetoed. But it has allowed the oil and the fossil fuel industry to show their hands. This is all being done on behalf of a foreign oil company and on behalf of the fossil fuel industry. When we look at what we have been through in the past couple of days, there are some interesting choices the Senate has made if you are a foreign oil company. If you are a foreign oil company, we will let you use eminent domain to extinguish the property rights of farmers and ranchers and take their farms and ranches away. If you are a foreign oil company, we will exempt you from the oilspill recovery fund--the Federal excise tax on petroleum--so you don't have to pay the taxes American companies have to pay. If you are a foreign oil company, we will not require you to use American steel in a pipeline being built across America being touted as a source of American jobs. If you are a foreign oil company, we won't require you to sell it in the American market even though it is touted as a product that will help balance America's energy portfolio. So, so far, not much good to show for all of this but one thing, and that is that this exercise has at last brought the issue of climate change to the floor of the Senate. We have not had much debate about climate change since the Citizens United decision back in 2010 allowed the fossil fuel industry to cast a very long shadow of intimidation across this body. They spend a huge amount of the money that has been freed up by Citizens United. They spend a huge amount of dark money that flows post Citizens United. And since then, the Republican Party has been virtually muzzled on that subject. So having Republicans talk about climate change on the Senate floor was something of a revelation, and I don't think we should underestimate the importance of that or undervalue what was said. The senior Senator from North Carolina came to the floor and said this: The concept that climate change is real, I completely understand and accept. To the point of how much man is contributing, I don't know, but it does make sense that man- made emissions are contributing. . . . the greenhouse gas effect seems to me scientifically sound. The problem is that how you fix this globally is going to require more than just the U.S. being involved. Which I think we all agree with. The senior Senator from Alaska, who is our chairman of the Energy and Natural Resources Committee and the floor manager on this very bill, agreed, stating that she hopes we can all, quoting her, get beyond the discussion as to whether or not climate change is real and talk about what do we do. I look forward to that discussion about what do we do. It is not enough just to say, OK, we finally concede that climate change is really happening. We really do have to get on to what do we do. Even if you disagree with me that climate change is real and very significant and consequential for our country, if you will spot me that there is just a 10-percent chance that I am right--even just a 2- percent chance that I am right--when we consider the possible harms, it is something that grownup adults and responsible people ought to take a look at and come together and decide what to do. We have been through some very notable benchmarks. We hit for the first time last year 400 parts per million of carbon dioxide in our atmosphere for more than 3 months. They have been tracking this in Hawaii, at the top of the mountain at the Mauna Loa laboratory for decades now, and 400 parts per million for more than 3 months is a new record. To put that in context: For as long as human beings have been on this planet, all the way back to when we were living in caves, the range of carbon in the atmosphere has been 170 to 300 parts per million. So we are well outside the range that has been our comfortable safe range for human habitation of this planet during our entire human experience, and 400 is a big move when our entire range is only 130 points and now we are 100 parts per million out of that. Some of this lands in the oceans. The oceans have absorbed about a quarter of all our carbon emissions. We can measure their pH level. This isn't complicated. This isn't something we have to do with elaborate computer models. What we see is that the pH level of the oceans is changing rapidly. The oceans are acidifying rapidly. When I say rapidly, they are acidifying at a rate that we have not seen in 25 to perhaps 30 or 50 million years. Indeed, some studies say nothing like this has been seen on the face of the Earth for as long as 300 million years. When we consider that our species has been around for about 200,000 years, that is a pretty long window to be launching new and dramatic changes in our oceans. There is nothing new about the science that supports this. John Tyndall wrote the first report about the greenhouse gas effect to the British Academy of Sciences in 1861. The pages who are here and have studied history will know that 1861 was the year President Lincoln took office. So the scientific community has been aware of the greenhouse gas phenomenon since Abraham Lincoln was driving up and down Pennsylvania Avenue in a carriage with his top hat on. There is not much new that is there, and the latest data is clearer and clearer that we just continue apace to warm the planet. Professor Jonathan Overpeck is at the University of Arizona, and Arizona is certainly feeling the heat. Professor Overpeck said: The global warmth of 2014 is just another reminder that the planet is warming and warming fast. . . . Humans, and their burning of fossil fuels, are dominating the Earth's climate system like never before. It is equally clear, when we look at the oceans, they not only absorb a lot of the carbon dioxide and acidify as a result--they absorb most of the heat. In fact, they absorb 90 percent of the excess heat that has been trapped by the greenhouse gases that we have flooded our atmosphere with. I certainly see that in Rhode Island, where Narragansett Bay's mean winter water temperature is up 3 to 4 degrees Fahrenheit since we had our big hurricane of 1938. That is significant, because it means more likely storms. It is associated with sea level rise. We have 10 more inches of sea level at the Newport Naval Station. So if the 1938 hurricane were to repeat itself now, it would have 10 more inches of sea to hammer against our shores. And that is not a complicated measure, either. We do that with thermometers. So since the Industrial Revolution, human beings have dumped 2 trillion metric tons of carbon dioxide into the air and into the atmosphere. Said another way, that is 2,000 billion metric tons of carbon dioxide. The notion that has no effect, when we have known since Abraham Lincoln's day that carbon dioxide is a greenhouse gas, and when we put that much in and when we can measure that it is at 400 for the first time in human history--connect the dots. How much does it take? It is really pretty obvious. Folks who remain skeptical--well, I know, I am not a scientist. I get that. So ask one. That is all I request. And I don't think that is too much to ask of colleagues. And, by the way, do me one favor. You can ask the scientist that you please, but please don't ask a scientist who is in the pay of the fossil [[Page S577]] fuel and the denial industry. There are a bunch of them who are out there. They turn up at all the usual denial conferences. They write in the denial journals. They take money from the denial organizations that all have fossil fuel industry funding behind them. Go to someplace neutral. For instance, go to your own State university, like the University of Arizona or the University of Oklahoma. The dean of the relevant department at the University of Oklahoma signed the IPCC report and started Climate Central. Ask your own university. Ask any major scientific organization. All the major recognized scientific organizations in the United States of America are on board, agree that this is real, agree that this is important, agree that it is vital, and believe that we are actually near the tipping point that may make the damage irrecoverable. If you don't want to go to your home State university and if you don't want to go to America's major scientific societies, try NOAA and NASA. Think about NASA for a moment. As I give this speech, there is a Rover that is the size of an SUV being driven around on the surface of Mars. We built a Rover, shot it to Mars, landed it safely, and are now driving it around. Do we think those scientists might actually know something? Do we think they might know what they are talking about? Do we think they might merit our confidence? So ask them and see what they say. Or, if you want, ask some of America's leading corporations. If you are from Arkansas, go and ask Walmart. They will tell you. If you are from Georgia, go and ask Coca-Cola. They will tell you. This is not hard to discover once you get away from that little stable of denial scientists who are so closely affiliated with the fossil fuel industry. I do this every week because we have the arrogance so often here to think how much our laws--the laws that we pass--matter. But the laws that we pass are passing things. They come and they go. They have their time. They are repealed, they are replaced, they fall into desuetude. But some laws last, and those are the laws that God laid down upon this Earth that guide its operations. Those are the laws of physics, the laws of chemistry, the laws of biology, the law of gravity. We cannot repeal those laws. We must face their consequences. And we know the consequences of continuing to emit gigatons of carbon dioxide into our planet is going to launch us into an environment in which the habitability of Earth as we have known it will be put into question. History makes its judgments about every generation. If we do not take calm and reasonable and sensible precautions about this obvious known and admitted risk, then when that risk comes home to roost, we will be duly shamed. So let us avoid that. Let us get to work. Let us take advantage of the opening that the distinguished senior Senator from Alaska and the distinguished senior Senator from South Carolina have opened for us, and let us do what is right by our country and by the judgment that we can anticipate from history.

The Senator from Alaska. Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I am ready to go this morning. I have comfortable shoes on. I am ready for a good, long day and to process a bunch of amendments. I see the Senate doing its work. I know we have important business before the Senate. I know the Judiciary Committee is holding the hearing to listen to the comments from Loretta Lynch, who has been nominated to be Attorney General. Obviously these are very important issues the committee is discussing today. Interspersed with all of that, we are going to be having a relatively long series of votes this afternoon, which makes it a little bit choppy and a little bit chaotic, but we have business to do in the Senate. I am pleased we are at this point where I think we can honestly say we are looking at the final stretch in this discussion on the bipartisan, 60-sponsored bill to approve the Keystone XL Pipeline after more than 2,320 days of delay. At this point we are past that last call for amendments on the bill. We have spent a lot of time over the past couple of days negotiating which of the roughly 200 first-degree amendments that have been filed would come up for votes. We have a pretty good list. Again, we have 18 of them that will be before us beginning this afternoon. There will be more we will be dealing with at a later point. But I do think this is significant. I was reading the newspaper this morning, and there is no shortage of critics out there, folks who would say the Senate is broken and can't possibly be fixed. There was an article from an opinion writer which stated: Within the midst of the Keystone debate, McConnell has had to retreat ``on his promise to allow freewheeling amendments.'' The article then goes on to state that yesterday not much of anything happened on the Senate floor where the pipeline debate had stalled. In fairness, maybe the debate, in terms of processing amendments on the floor, had stalled out yesterday, but that did not mean there were not significant and serious negotiations going on between the majority and the minority about how we would proceed. Sometimes when someone tunes in and the Senate is in a quorum call, they think nothing is happening. They think the business of the Senate is not being conducted. I need to assure not only colleagues but those who watch this process on C-SPAN that in fact there is still good business being done. I think that is what has resulted in our opportunity this afternoon to take up some 18 different amendments. There are amendments that are all across the board; 10 of the 18 pending amendments are from colleagues on the other side of the aisle. I think we are certainly being very generous in terms of what is out there. We are trying to ensure that Members who want a vote can have them. Again, keep in mind, with a couple hundred amendments that come forward, we are going to have a lot of duplication. We are going to have issues people may want to make a statement about but might not necessarily want to ask for a vote on. But those that we have in front of us today--everything from issues relating to solar energy to LNG exports, to further discussion about climate change, wilderness, wind tax credits, the Land and Water Conservation Fund--are truly all over the map. When it is suggested that somehow or other Senator McConnell as the majority leader is moving back from his commitment to allow for an open amendment process, so-called freewheeling amendments, I don't think a whole picture of what is happening on the Senate floor is being painted. In fact it is a very open and considerable process. I made mention last week that we broke the records. We blew the top off in terms of the number of amendments we were actually able to process on the Senate floor. We moved through 24 amendments on this bill since the time we started it. Twenty-four amendments is pretty considerable, considering that in all of 2014 there were just 15 amendments that were considered the entire year. In fact, on Thursday alone we processed 15. If we do 18, as is on the roster today, that is pretty significant. I feel good about the point we are at. It is not just because we are churning through amendments, it is because of what the ranking member and I have been able to do as the floor managers on this bill, kind of working back and forth. Yes, sometimes it is tedious. Yes, sometimes it is frustrating. Yes, sometimes Members wish they had more time to talk or there were more hours in our day to process all of this, [[Page S557]] but at some point in time I think we have to recognize when we spend 3 weeks on a bill, that is pretty considerable. When we are able to move 50 amendments--close to 50 amendments is where we may be at the end of this legislation and processing--that is of note. What I appreciate is we are here this morning getting ready to kick off a long afternoon of votes and go back and forth with Members and disruption of their schedules and committee meetings and the inconvenience that causes. But again this is part of what happens around here. It is not a very tightly scheduled environment because we just have so much that is going on. But being able to move forward on this important legislation is good and necessary. I think we are setting the stage for the balance of this Congress-- under the leadership of the Senator from Kentucky, the majority leader, a commitment to have wholesome debate--to have the opportunity for a process that is not only good for Republicans, it is good for Democrats. It is good for the Senate and for the United States. Amendment No. 166 I want to quickly mention an amendment I will have up later this afternoon. This is amendment No. 166. I spoke very briefly to it yesterday when I called it up. But it would require wilderness study areas to be released if Congress has not officially designated them as wilderness within one calendar year. Right now what happens is that when a wilderness study area is designated, it can sit out there on the books almost indefinitely. There have been areas that have been sitting out there without congressional action for a couple of decades. I don't think this was the point of the process. But I would suggest the amendment I have advanced is a critical one to our Western States, certainly to my State of Alaska. Again, the news on Sunday of the President moving toward a wilderness designation of all of ANWR--with the exception of a very small slice but all of ANWR--all 19 million acres in addition to the 1002 area, the 1.57 million acres that have been specifically designated by Congress for further review and study. Right now there are 528 wilderness study areas throughout Alaska and the other 11 Western States. Again, these designations have been made by over time by one administration or another. The next step forward in this process is that Congress needs to act, but Congress hasn't acted. We have had some of these that have been pending since the 1980s. Again, as I suggested yesterday, if we have had something pending for 20, 30 years, I think that is plenty of time to say that Congress has had to review those areas. Even though we have not turned these into wilderness--in other words, even though Congress has not acted to designate these areas as wilderness, what happens to them? They are treated and managed as if they are wilderness. Effectively, we have de facto wilderness. The law requires that only Congress determines whether an area is designated as wilderness. But what has happened is just kind of a lag, a lull, if you will, so they don't even need the congressional designation if in fact it is already being managed as wilderness. We look at the intent behind this. It is clear it was never intended to be this way. We were never supposed to have millions of acres of de facto Agency-decided wilderness around the Western United States. We routinely pass public lands legislation into law. I would like to know we could do it a little more often. As recently as last month, it actually has included new wilderness. So we are not saying that in other areas these wilderness study areas don't get officially designated. There is that process, and we demonstrated that just during the lameduck here. But in the instances where Congress has decided not to act on wilderness study areas, agencies need to start looking at what that broader array of options is for managing the land, whatever that multiple use designation might be. They need to be looking at this critically with the local people in the area and with the other stakeholders who are involved in the planning process, but clearly they are not doing that on their own. So what my amendment would do is essentially provide a 1-year timeframe for wilderness designations to be made. I think, again, that is more than enough time for Congress to consider debate and approve legislation for any area with wide support for a wilderness designation, so we will see that amendment this afternoon. I know the Senator from Washington was on her way, coming from a committee meeting this morning, and had intended to speak. I see Senator Udall is also on the floor. I yield to the Senator from New Mexico if he wishes to speak at this time before Senator Cantwell comes to the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sullivan). The clerk will call the roll. The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. PETERS. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Amendment No. 55 Mr. PETERS. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss my amendment that was made pending by my friend and the ranking member of the Energy and Natural Resources Committee, the Senator from Washington, Ms. Cantwell. The amendment I have offered, amendment No. 55, is a simple, commonsense amendment. It requires the Environmental Protection Agency to complete a study on the potential environmental and health impact of byproducts from tar sands oil that would be transported across our country by the Keystone XL Pipeline. One of these byproducts of tar sands oil is a black, powdery substance known as petroleum coke or petcoke. It is a residual from this tar sands oil and large amounts of it are produced in the refining process. In fact, it is estimated basically for every barrel of oil we get from tar sands, one-third of the material is this dark substance called petcoke. If we are transporting an awful lot of oil through the Keystone Pipeline, it naturally follows that we are going to get massive amounts of this petcoke. I have had an experience with this petcoke in my previous House district in the city of Detroit, where we had petcoke from the refining process of this tar sands oil being piled up along the Detroit River. We had a pile there that was at some times several stories high, a city block long. It was stored along the river in an uncontained fashion. It was blowing into people's homes, it was blowing into businesses, and it was also draining into the Great Lakes watershed. It caused all sorts of problems. I had complaints from constituents who talked about this substance going into their homes. I had businesses talking about--for example, restaurants in the area--their wait staff getting respiratory problems as a result of breathing this in. In fact, we had a video to explain how problematic it can be. I had a video taken by a Canadian resident across the Detroit River that showed the petcoke piles. With some wind blowing, a massive black dust cloud was blowing off of these petcoke piles. In the distance you could see the Ambassador Bridge, which is the bridge that connects Canada to the United States. The dust was so thick and so black it obscured the bridge as it was blowing into the neighborhoods, into the river, and then into Canada. It is a completely unacceptable situation, which is why I believe it is important as we move forward with this legislation that we have a couple of studies. One, we need to understand what are those environmental and health risks associated with petcoke. It is clear this is particulate matter, and if it is not contained, it gets into people's lungs and creates a dust layer throughout communities. It is very important as well in the study not only to study the environmental and health impacts, but what are the best practices to handle this material. With the massive amount of tar sands oil that will come through the Keystone, we will also get massive amounts of petcoke, a substance that has been problematic not only in Detroit, but it has been problematic in the city of Chicago and other places across the country. [[Page S558]] So I believe it is very important that we get these kinds of information as this project moves forward, and it is certainly my hope that we can assure that what happened in Detroit, what is happening in Chicago and other places across this country doesn't happen, that we understand what this substance is, and we understand what those best practices are to handle and to transport this material safely. I urge my colleagues to support amendment No. 55. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll. Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Amendment No. 166 Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I am glad the junior Senator from Alaska is in the Chair because I am going to be discussing things that are of great concern to Alaskans and really to those who care about the rule of law here and how it applies throughout all 50 States fairly and evenly. As I mentioned just a bit ago, I have offered an amendment that would deal with how wilderness study areas are treated. My proposal is one that would put a time limitation on these study areas. I mentioned the amendment was precipitated by the President's announcement this weekend about additional areas of wilderness to be designated in Alaska. I have cited two. The 1980 lands bill, ANILCA--I think it is good for us to have a little bit of a refresher on what ANILCA actually did. In one fell swoop ANILCA designated nearly 60 million acres of wilderness in the State of Alaska. That is pretty substantial. It was more than any other President had ever designated at any other time prior to that. What we have seen since then, with the designation of wilderness, is there has been this fight going back and forth. There have been areas that have been requested for wilderness study areas. But this administration has really taken it a major step forward. On Sunday the President recommended that an additional 12.3 million acres within the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge be designated as wilderness--so an additional 12.3 million acres on top of the 60 million acres that we already have as wilderness in Alaska after ANILCA. This action by the President means that these 12.3 million acres will immediately be managed as wilderness. As I have mentioned, right now there is no deadline or expiration for this designation. Even if Congress fails to act--and I am going to make darn certain we do not act on this wilderness proposal the President has advanced--these acres are being managed as wilderness. Let me just show colleagues what it means for us right now. The small map of Alaska is up there in the corner. It is kind of unfair because it needs to be a much bigger map to get the context. Effectively, what the President is proposing is that in addition to the 7.16 million acres of wilderness that currently exist in the ANWR area--and the ANWR area is a big refuge, a big designation. A little over 7 million acres have already been designated as wilderness. That was done back in 1980. But what he is proposing now is effectively taking the whole balance of the refuge area and making wilderness out of that as well--so 12.3 million acres. Now, keep in mind this also includes the 1002 area up on the northern part of ANWR. That is the area right, which was specifically designated by Congress for further study of its oil and gas potential. Back in 1980, when the wilderness designation was made for the one area--7 million acres of it--it was determined that refuge status would be afforded the balance of the area, and then the 1002 would be reserved-- reserved deliberately for study of its oil and gas potential. That 1980 act was pretty clear in terms of the bargain that had taken place. I am going to read for the record the provision in the law that we refer to as the ``no more'' clause. It states: This Act provides sufficient protection for the national interest in the scenic, natural, cultural and environmental values on the public lands in Alaska, and at the same time provides adequate opportunity for satisfaction of the economic and social needs of the State of Alaska and its people; accordingly, the designation and disposition of the public lands in Alaska pursuant to this Act are found to represent a proper balance between the reservation of national conservation system units and those public lands necessary and appropriate for more intensive use and disposition, and thus Congress believes that the need for future legislation designating new conservation system units, new national conservation areas, or new national recreation areas, has been obviated thereby. The act goes on to state that ``no further studies of Federal lands in the State of Alaska for the single purpose of considering the establishment of a conservation system unit, national recreation area, national conservation area, or for related or similar purposes shall be conducted unless authorized by the Congress.'' So the President is basically choosing to ignore the law as set out in ANILCA--the agreement that Alaska has contributed mightily with its share of wilderness. I remind my colleagues that more than one-half of the wilderness in the entire United States of America is in the State of Alaska. Thus we wrote the law back in 1980 that says no more out of Alaska. They found that balance. Well, this President is tipping that balance. The coastal plain holds an estimated 10.4 billion barrels of oil. I mentioned yesterday that if we can tap into these resources, we could see 1 million barrels a day coming down our Trans-Alaska Pipeline for nearly 30 years. Think about what that would mean, Mr. President--1 million barrels a day filling up that Trans-Alaska Pipeline that is now less than half full, an additional 1 million barrels a day coming into this country. Right now, Americans are enjoying the lower prices of oil. But the President said: Don't get used to these low prices because they may go up. Well, they do not have to go up if we can provide more. If we can increase production in this country, we can theoretically decrease that cost. But we have to be allowed to access that. Think about the source of good-paying jobs, energy security, billions of dollars in new Federal revenues. The energy security part of it is keenly important, but let us also think about the positive national security implications of energy produced in the United States. When we are producing more energy in this country and relying less on others, we are less vulnerable. We have greater ability to deal with hostile nations. Sanctions work better when we don't need to rely on that same oil that some of these nations would like to free up for other countries. From a national security perspective, this is huge. This is where the intersection with the Keystone Pipeline is so interesting: that at the same time this administration has issued this wilderness study it is also fighting so hard to keep us from building the Keystone XL Pipeline, which would allow us to get crude from our friend and neighbor to the north and utilize it to our benefit. The President is saying: No, I don't want to do that. I guess he would much rather receive it from Venezuela or wherever. He says he wants Brazil to be our big trading partner when it comes to oil. Hello. Canada--they share a border. They are our friend. They are our closest friend, our strongest trading partner. Are we going to shut down such an opportunity as that? And: Oh, by the way, that same week let's just go ahead and take off the table permanently one of the greatest reservoirs of crude we have here in the United States next. Let's just take that off the table, too. What does that say? What does that say to other countries? That we don't care about our own energy security? I care about our energy security, and I care about our national security. Again, it stuns me to think that what the President is proposing here is a measure that would take off limits permanently our ability as a nation to access the 1002 area to safely develop this enormous potential. Keep in mind, we are not talking about accessing the full 1.5 million acres in the 1002. The legislation that has been before this Senate, back in 1995 and 2005, asked to open up 2,000 acres--2,000 acres--out of 19.5 million acres in the whole refuge. The Presiding Officer knows Alaskans can do this safely. We have set and met the highest environmental standards in the world. We do it every [[Page S559]] day. Our pipeline, our amazing 800-mile pipeline, has a decades-long record of responsible production. It has carried nearly 17 billion barrels of oil safely across our State, over 2 mountain ranges, multiple rivers, in areas where we are known to have a few earthquakes. It is an engineering marvel. It has served our State and our country well. But instead of recognizing this unparalleled opportunity that we have, we are now facing a mounting lockdown of our resource potential. And the Presiding Officer knows the worst part is, it is not just ANWR we are talking about. Our offshore oil reserves are now also going to be restricted. Just yesterday the President announced he was indefinitely withdrawing 9.8 million acres in the Beaufort and the Chukchi Seas from leasing. So now ANWR is going to be locked up, as well as the Beaufort and Chukchi seas. I don't have a map of these areas that have been taken off limits, but I can tell you that it is an area of roughly 9.8 million acres. There is some real question that I have in my mind. After reading the Interior's press release, I don't have any real comfort that the two sales that are being proposed--one in the Beaufort and one in the Chukchi--will actually stay on schedule. The Secretary of the Interior is quoted saying that: Interior will continue to consider oil and gas exploration in the Arctic. It is not a very firm commitment, as far as I can see. But when we look at it altogether--between the ANWR wilderness designation and the Arctic offshore withdrawal--Alaska has lost more than 22 million acres of land and water where energy could be produced for the good of this country, and it has happened in less than 1 week. It has happened over a span of 3 days--22 million acres. So what is 22 million acres? It is an area about 563 times larger than where we are here in the District of Columbia. It is about 28 Rhode Islands. I know Rhode Island is a small State by comparison, but 28 of them adds up. It is about 4.5 times the size of the State of Massachusetts. Again, this is just to give you an idea of what was taken off limits, indefinitely, by this administration since Sunday. My reaction to all this has been pretty strong. I think it is pretty obvious to anybody who would take a moment to think about it, but I am amazed our President can look at Alaska and think, this is what we need most right now. We are facing a pretty significant budget shortfall. I know our Governor has spoken to the President and the Secretary of Interior about Alaska's situation. Then this is what he gets as a ``we will work with you''? I don't think so. This is not an indication of a Federal Government that wants to work with the State to develop its resources. The Governor asked the Secretary of the Interior for an address, because he said he needed to send an invoice for the lack of any economy Alaska would be able to generate with these actions. The one thing--the one thing more than anything else that could help our State--is to be able to access our Federal lands and our waters so that we can fill up the Trans-Alaska Pipeline, so that we can not only help Alaska but we can help the rest of the country. But that seems to be the one thing this President is intent on denying, whether it is in ANWR, whether it is in our offshore, or whether it is in our National Petroleum Reserve, where this President basically unilaterally took off about half of that in terms of availability of access. I noted that when the President made his announcement on Sunday, the video that went out showed beautiful pictures of the refuge area. Again, this is a big area. This whole refuge is about the size of the State of South Carolina. It is big and there are some amazing spaces--I am the first one to admit it, amazing spaces--just as there are all over Alaska. But I watched that video as he was flying in his airplane to go to India, and I thought to myself: The President hasn't been to Alaska, even though he says he only has three States left to see and Alaska is not included. So I actually asked my staff to find out. By my count, the President has been to Alaska three times during his administration. And he told me, before he was President, he had never been to Alaska. So three times during his administration. All three times were basically to get fuel. And granted, to give him credit, on one of those times he did meet with the troops at Elmendorf, but he never went off the base. The other two times were in the middle of the night for as long as it took to get fuel. In my mind, that is not visiting Alaska. That is not trying to understand who we are. We have some pretty beautiful, wide-open skies. But when you are flying at 35,000, 45,000 feet looking down, that is not how you get a view of Alaska. So outside of this short meet-and-greet, outside of a bargaining chip to gain support from national constituencies, he is basically viewing Alaska as a refueling stop--which is no shortage of irony here in the fact that he is happy to refuel Air Force One in Alaska, but he doesn't seem to want fuel produced in Alaska. I can get pretty frustrated and upset about this. Part of it is because so much of this comes without consultation with us, without listening to the vast majority of Alaskans--as if, once again, we are nothing but a territory and the promises that were made to us at statehood mean nothing. I was born in the territory. It was not that long ago that Alaskans knew what it meant to be kind of kicked around by folks on the outside. We didn't have a voice. We thought statehood was going to change that. We thought that statehood compact--the promises made that Alaska would be able to deliver to its citizens based on the amazing resource wealth that we had--we thought that was going to count for something. Apparently, not enough. I was a little bit surprised to read that the White House counselor, Mr. Podesta, thinks I have overreacted to these announcements and to others that I have been told may be coming--more to come--and he suggested my reaction is not warranted. I would ask any one of the other 99 Senators here: Think about how you would respond if the citizens of your State woke up to a message that we are going to take 12 million acres away from you and your potential to develop in your State; and then on Tuesday, we are going to take away 9.8 million acres. But don't worry, we are the Federal Government, we are here to help. Alaskans want to help themselves. We want to be able to exercise that independence, that free spirit that so many of us in Alaska identify with. We want to help our neighbors, help our families. But this kind of help we don't need. Don't lock us up. Don't shut us out. It was suggested in Mr. Podesta's comments, and I saw it in other press reports, that somehow or other the Interior Department felt compelled to move forward with the timing of these announcements because we were ratcheting up on ANWR. They suggested I had introduced a bill. I haven't introduced a bill. I do intend to introduce a bill. But to somehow suggest this was precipitated because the delegation is making a charge on ANWR is, at this time, unwarranted. It did kind of make me wonder, maybe the White House isn't aware of how Alaskans feel about this. So in the few minutes I want to take this morning I want to read a few of the quotes from our State leaders who have come out against this decision since they were announced, particularly as they relate to ANWR. We have a new, Independent Governor. As I mentioned, he has already had the opportunity to meet with the President and talk about Alaska's issues. Again, he has also met with the Secretary of Interior to talk similarly. Governor Walker says he is ``angry, very angry, that this is happening.'' Our State senate president, Kevin Meyer, said the following: The impact of this decision, if allowed to stand, will harm the future of our Great State and will deal a devastating blow to our economy. I spoke with our house speaker, a gentleman by the name of Mike Chenault from the Kenai Peninsula, an area where we have oil and gas potential in the Cook Inlet. They know about oil and gas. The speaker said: The president just doesn't get it, or he does get it and doesn't care about the will and voice of Alaskans. That's beyond offensive. [[Page S560]] In response to the President's ANWR announcement, Speaker Chenault also had some pretty choice words. He said: Alaska's not a territory anymore and it's high time our federal overlords stopped trying to treat us like one. The Arctic Slope Regional Corporation, whose shareholders, people who actually live on the North Slope, issued a press release stating that: We are staunchly opposed to this relentless and coordinated effort to designate the Coastal Plain of ANWR as Wilderness. This administration has deliberately ignored the input provided by the most affected people within ANWR. Colleagues, remember that when this President is suggesting that this area needs to be named or designated as wilderness, the 1002 area, people live there. People live their lives there--children go to school and people work there. They fly in and out. They have a little grocery store. They try to make an honest living there. They subsist, absolutely; but people live there. To quote from the Arctic Slope Regional Corporation, the corporation's shareholders who live there say, ``this administration has deliberately ignored the input provided by the most affected people within ANWR.'' I think the reason they have ignored it is because they forget people actually live there. How can people live in a wilderness? Democratic State Representative Ben Nageak of Barrow, who is an Inupiat and born in Kaktovik, who lives in the affected area, wrote this: President Barack Obama and his lieutenants at the Interior Department will permanently harm our people and all Alaskans with his colonial attitude and decision making . . . It's terrifying to see the extent by which our pleas for time and a fair hearing of our views fall on deaf ears 5,000 miles away. That is a State representative born and raised in this area, an Inupiat, who is saying 5,000 miles from here you are making decisions without listening to us, without listening to our people. Our North Slope Borough Mayor Charlotte Brower didn't mince any words, either. She said that ``these types of paternalistic, executive fiats seem to be more appropriate for Andrew Jackson's administration than Barack Obama's.'' Pretty tough words. I am starting to think my words were pretty mild based on what I read from the mayor of the North Slope Borough and the Democratic State representative from Barrow. Mayor Brower has invited President Obama and Secretary Jewell to visit the North Slope, and she asked them to meet with the people who actually live there before proposing these types of sweeping land designations. If the President and the Secretary actually accept that invitation, Mayor Brower concluded: They might learn that the Inupiat people who have lived on and cared for these lands for millennia have no interest in living like relics in a giant open air museum. Rather, they hope to have the same rights and privileges enjoyed by people across the rest of the country. That seems like a pretty fair request to me. Even the New York Times interviewed a few Alaskans who didn't hide their feelings. One woman who said she had voted for the President twice said, ``He has just alienated an entire state.'' She described herself as being ``on the fence'' about ANWR before the proposal, but she added, ``without talking to any of us, just doing it by fiat-- that's not how you lead.'' I think she summed it up pretty well. What the President has done, the way he has done it--it is unfair, uncalled for, and it is unwarranted. So for it to be suggested by the counselor from the White House that my response is somehow overreacting or unwarranted, I think they should start listening to all of the people of Alaska. The presiding officer and myself were sent here to represent them and I think we are expressing pretty clearly where Alaskans are coming from on this. This is wrong. It should not be tolerated. And we will not just sit back while this administration locks up our State and the potential of our people. We have a lot more we will be discussing about this. Again, I mentioned on Monday that there was a trifecta with what we see coming out of this administration. I have been told by the Secretary that we would see his ANWR designation and that we would then see the 5-year lease sale that would take areas that had been in deferred status and completely withdraw them for an indefinite period of time, and that there would be a third announcement coming relating to the National Petroleum Reserve--the area where folks who said don't go to ANWR, go to NPRA, go to the National Petroleum Reserve. So the first company that tried to do so is trying to make it happen. What this administration is doing with the mitigation costs they are laying in front of them, the company will determine whether it is going to be economic. But my fear is that will be the third kick to Alaska. So it has been a bad week, a bad week for Alaska. But you know what, we are not people who are deterred by bad news, by bad weather. We have a way to roll with it. I was looking at the front page of the Fairbanks Daily News-Miner yesterday. They had a little recap of what is going on with the weather. It is about 52 below zero in Fort Yukon and 51 below in Fort Greely where we base our ground-based missile defense system. We are pretty proud of what we do. We can still provide for the defense and protection of this country and do it in some pretty cold weather. In Fairbanks, where I went to high school, I think the weather this morning was 47 degrees below zero, but the kids still go to school in this kind of weather. We are doing what we do up north. It is not easy, but it is an amazing place and the people there are pretty resilient. We have been kicked this week, but that doesn't mean we are down. It means we are just getting started. With that, I will have more to say about the process in front of us this afternoon, where we are with Keystone; but again, I am pleased that we have a good series of votes to keep us busy this afternoon, and I appreciate the indulgence of colleagues as we go through a process that can be very disruptive as they are trying to meet with constituents and pursue committee business. But I think we recognize that we want to be on a path toward completion of this bill, and I thank them for their cooperation. With that, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mrs. FISCHER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sasse). Without objection, it is so ordered. Unfunded Mandates Information and Transparency Act Mrs. FISCHER. Mr. President, last week my colleague Senator Lankford and I introduced the Unfunded Mandates Information and Transparency Act--a bill to enhance transparency about the true costs of burdensome Federal regulations affecting our States and localities. Twenty years ago the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act, otherwise known as UMRA, was signed into law to reduce the burden of Federal mandates on State and local governments, as well as the private sector. The statute was intended to fix a simple problem while promoting informed decisions by this Congress. But since UMRA's enactment in 1995, many remain concerned that the law has fallen short. In Nebraska and all across America, our constituents continue to face a growing mountain of redtape that stifles economic growth and holds back progress on a number of fronts. In 2011 alone the Government Accountability Office identified 14 different loopholes that would allow government agencies to avoid conducting the UMRA analysis. In other words, redtape has survived and prospered. By their very nature, Federal mandates are both complex and vague, which is why I have introduced a new bill to fix these shortcomings and increase accountability. My bill, known as the Unfunded Mandates and Information Transparency Act, would address UMRA's loopholes by mandating stricter agency requirements, enhance stakeholder input, and strengthen enforcement mechanisms. Furthermore, this bill has the power to get the job done. It would allow judges to place a stay on a regulation or invalidate a rule if a Federal agency fails to complete the required UMRA [[Page S561]] analysis. It would also close a glaring loophole used by agencies to skirt UMRA requirements. Last but not least, my bill would expand the scope of reporting requirements to include regulations imposed by independent regulatory agencies, such as the EPA. I know many Nebraskans are deeply concerned about the effects of new EPA requirements, such as the proposed water rule--a rule I have forcefully fought since it was first proposed. Nebraskans already go to great lengths to protect and preserve water resources within our State, but now the EPA is going overboard with this new proposal--one that represents a massive Federal power grab and clear disconnect with Main Street America. I share the belief of many Nebraskans that the Federal Government should be held responsible for the rules it puts into place. By clearly notifying taxpayers of the costs of each mandate, which the bill I introduced would require, we can better hold the Federal Government accountable for the economic impact of its costly regulations. I hope my colleagues on both sides of the aisle will join me in supporting this simple, commonsense legislation to help bring greater accountability and transparency to Washington. I thank the Presiding Officer and suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. HOEVEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. HOEVEN. Mr. President, I return to the floor today to discuss the legislation under consideration. As I did yesterday, I wish to begin by again thanking both the Senator from Alaska on our side of the aisle and the Senator from Washington on the other side of the aisle, who are the bill managers--the legislation managers in this case--of the Keystone XL Pipeline approval legislation that I put forward along with Senator Manchin. I wish to begin by thanking both of the managers for their diligence and for their bipartisanship and for working together to advance this legislation, but I also want to make sure all of the Members of this body get a chance to bring their amendments forward, debate those amendments, and have a vote. This afternoon we have scheduled 18 votes, and that is great. Some of those amendments I support; some I oppose. But we are going to do what this body is supposed to do and what the American people elected us to do, and that is to have this discussion and then vote. We are working to advance energy policy for this country that can not only truly help create more energy, jobs, and economic growth but also really address the national security implications of making our country energy secure. By that, I mean producing more energy than we consume and working with Canada, our friend and ally, to do that so that we don't have to depend on OPEC to do that and on parts of the world where there is great instability and where our interests are not aligned with the interests of some of those countries. Also, it enables us to actually weaken some of our opponents that are petro-dependent, countries such as Iran, which is now trying to build a nuclear weapon, as well as, right now, Russia, which is invading its neighbor Ukraine, one of our allies, where we are trying to stop the adventurism of President Putin. By truly becoming energy secure, by providing more supply of energy, we not only benefit every American at the pump--Americans are saving billions of dollars when they pull up to the pump. That is not only good for American consumers, it is good for our small businesses. Energy is a foundational industry that strengthens every other industry out there. It makes us more competitive in the global economy across the board. As I say, it weakens some of our opponents. So that is really the debate in which we are engaged. Yesterday I started to respond to some of the critics who oppose this legislation on the basis of saying this is a project for Canada and not for the United States, and that is not true at all. This pipeline would not only move crude from Canada to our refineries, it would also move crude from production in the United States, including in my State of North Dakota, which now produces 1.2 million barrels of oil a day-- second only to Texas--as well as Montana. So it also moves domestic crude to our refineries as well. Furthermore, it really is about making our Nation energy secure, working with Canada to become energy secure so we don't have to depend on OPEC. That is very much a national interest issue for this country, for this Nation, and for all Americans. I spoke about that a little bit yesterday. The second issue I would like to address is some of the environmental issues. I started to do that yesterday, but I deferred at that time because anytime we can get people to come to the floor to offer their amendments and make them pending, that is what we want to do. At that point we started getting people to come offer their amendments, and the bill managers, through their hard work, were able to get agreement, and we now have 18 amendments pending on a precloture basis. So we have made real progress in getting everyone involved and hopefully building more bipartisan consensus and getting on the energy debate the American people want and getting to a result where we can actually produce legislation that will help our Nation. So I started to get into the second point I wanted to discuss, which is some of the environmental aspects of the oil sands development and how technology is being deployed, with hundreds of millions of private dollars invested in new technologies that are not only producing more energy but doing it with a smaller environmental footprint. That helps to reduce the greenhouse gas emissions of oil that is produced in the oil sands. There are two projects I wish to speak about to give examples of how, if we continue to work to empower this kind of investment in new technologies, we get not only more energy more cost-effectively and more dependably but we also get it with environmental stewardship. The first project I will speak about is a project that has been undertaken in the oil sands in Alberta, Canada. Going back to this earlier chart, we can see that it is up in the Hardisty area, and this second chart is a picture of the project. It is one that is undertaken by the Shell Oil Company. It is called their Quest project. I will read a little bit about the project. Shell Canada will this year complete the world's first oil sands carbon capture and storage project. This is CCS--carbon capture and storage--something we have been working to develop in this country and apply to fossil fuels, not only things such as oil and gas but also coal. This is the new carbon capture technology. They will complete the world's first project. Continuing: The project, called Quest, will begin permanently storing CO 2 by the end of the year and will permanently store more than 1 million tons per year. Let me read that again. The project, called Quest, will begin permanently storing CO 2 by the end of the year and will permanently store more than 1 million tons per year. Quest reduces the emissions from Shell's upgrader by 35 percent--that's the equivalent of taking 175,000 cars off the road each year. Shell will transport the CO 2 50 miles north via pipeline and permanently store it more than a mile below ground under impermeable rock formations. My point is that here is an example of where a private company is working with the Province of Alberta on this project to invest hundreds of millions of dollars in carbon capture and storage technology that will not only apply to the oil sands, but--think about it--this is also technology that is not only being developed but deployed on a commercial scale in production that we can now take advantage of and use in this country to produce more energy from multiple sources-- again, smaller footprint, lower greenhouse gas. Isn't that the solution to better environmental stewardship where we get more energy that we produce here with our closest friends and allies, with better stewardship through investment by private companies in these new technologies and, in this case, working with Alberta? Alberta is also investing in this technology, but this is the innovation of our country, of our companies. This is the kind of ingenuity and [[Page S562]] innovation that helps us build the kind of future we want. In this case, it is a secure energy future by deploying these new technologies. The other point I will make as we look at this chart is that under the old system of oil sand production--remember, it is excavation, so they would be digging up this area and then extracting the oil from the oil sands. But under this new system of development, which is called in situ, they are actually drilling wells, and then they put steam down the hole to bring the oil up, and then they capture the CO 2 and store it underground, so smaller environmental footprint and lower greenhouse gas emissions. Since 1990 the greenhouse gas emissions on a per-barrel basis for oil sands production has gone down by 28 percent. So they have reduced it by almost a third. These new technologies will reduce it further going forward. This is about finding good solutions to create jobs and economic activity and energy security and take us into the future. That is why I wanted to discuss that project for just a minute. A second project I will reference is Exxon's Kearl project, spelled K-E-A-R-L. Just by way of preface, Exxon currently produces over 100,000 barrels of oil a day in the Canadian oil sands. They are going to increase that amount this year to 345,000 barrels a day. Their objective is to get to half a million barrels a day of oil produced in the Canadian oil sands. They are investing $10 billion in this project. That is their investment in this project and these new, better drilling techniques. Let me tell my colleagues a little bit about their project. Exxon is doing it differently than Shell and Quest. They are employing different technologies but investing $10 billion to reduce the environmental footprint, to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, but produce a lot of energy for Canada and for our country. Exxon's Kearl project will use cogeneration for steam, which a low- energy extraction process to recover oil, and heat integration between the extraction and treatment facilities to minimize energy consumption. As a result, oil produced from Kearl will have about the same life- cycle greenhouse gas emissions as many other crude oils refined in the United States as a result of technologies which significantly enhance environmental performance--again, smaller environmental footprint, lower greenhouse gas emissions. This is how we work to address the challenges we face, whether it is producing energy or anything else. We deploy these new technologies that enable us to do it better. Other environmental innovations for Kearl include onsite water storage to eliminate river withdrawals in low-flow periods and progressive land reclamation, which will return the land to the boreal forest. I wish to emphasize that for a minute. What we see around this site, which is actually the Shell site--this is the boreal forest. I have been to Hardisty, and I have seen the oil sands production. I was also taken out to areas where they had reclaimed land that had been formerly used to produce oil sands. Now we can't tell the difference between the land that has been reclaimed and the land that hadn't ever been used in terms of oil production. I was there and I looked at both and I couldn't tell the difference. Of course, that is subjective. You want to return it to the state it was in before it was tapped. With this newer production, there is a much smaller area that we would ultimately have to return to its original state. I wanted to touch on those two projects for a few minutes as well as point out that the Alberta Government actually requires that all land used in the development of oil sands has to be returned to the same or equivalent condition when it is no longer in use. The final point I wish to touch on for just a minute or two is another issue that has been brought up, which is pipeline safety. There have been some references to recent pipeline spills--one in Poplar, MT, actually not too far from where I live in western North Dakota. But the spill is from what is called the Poplar Pipeline, which I believe is owned by the Bridger Company. It is a pipeline that goes underneath the Yellowstone River. It was built in the 1950s, so we are talking about a pipeline that is over 50 years old. Isn't that just the point, that whether it is roads or bridges or buildings or pipelines or transmission lines or anything else, we have to make the investment in new facilities rather than just continuing to rely on old facilities? That is what I want to emphasize about the Keystone XL Pipeline project. This is an investment of $8 billion, not a penny of government investment but $8 billion in private investment in new steel and new technologies. Also, the Department of Transportation's Pipeline and Hazardous Material Safety Administration--PHMSA--the division of the Department of Transportation that oversees pipeline safety, has required 57 special conditions for this pipeline to make sure it is as safe as possible. I am going to touch on some of those to give a sense of what they are. The whole point is that here we are trying to create a business climate, a business environment where companies can put billions of dollars into these new technologies and this new infrastructure so that we can have energy as safely as possible, with the best stewardship possible, so we aren't relying on pipelines or other infrastructure that is more than 50 years old. We are trying to get that upgrade. We are not doing it at taxpayer expense. We are getting tax revenues. We will get hundreds of millions of tax revenues that will come back in from private sector projects where we are trying to empower that investment. At the same time, the PHMSA, the Department of Transportation Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration, has all these requirements that they are making part of the approval process--57 different special safety conditions for the Keystone XL Pipeline. They are conditions such as puncture resistance. For example, TransCanada is required by PHMSA in the environmental impact statement to ensure that the steel used in the pipeline can withstand impact from a 65-ton excavator with 3\1/2\-inch teeth. There is corrosion resistance coating, making sure it has a coating on it that is resistant to corrosion. There is cathodic protection. Cathodic protection is applied to a pipe so where it connects to other--it could be structures such as a bridge. It could be any place where the pipes are connected to make sure those other connections don't rust through into the pipe. For maintenance, TransCanada must submit certification that demonstrates compliance with all 57 conditions before they commence operation of the pipe. Airplanes will patrol the right of away at least 26 times a year. They will send cleaning and inspection tools through the pipeline once a year to collect and analyze basic sediment and water. Compare all of this to a pipeline that was built 50 years ago and laid on the floor of a river--versus a pipeline now, where if they have to cross a river, they use directional drilling. So they go down 25 feet below the river and put the pipe 25 feet down in the rock below the river, versus older pipelines that were just laid in there. Again, this is the new technology--the new safeguards. In horizontal drilling and directional drilling the pipe will be buried approximately 25 feet below riverbeds. So if there any riverbeds that cross, that is 25 feet below using directional drilling. There are automatic shutoff valves. So they will have automatic shutoff valves and they will be placed every 20 miles along the pipeline route. Extra miles will also be placed where there are protected water crossing and other areas of higher consequence. They can be closed remotely on either side of the line, isolating a damaged area within minutes of detection. Again, it is about making sure if there is an issue of any kind, that you can minimize and mitigate any kind of spill. With 100 percent weld inspections, there is a requirement that 100 percent of welds are inspected rather than just some of the welds under a test basis. With satellite monitoring and leak detection, Keystone XL will have more than 13,500 sensors feeding constant and detailed information about flow rates to the control center 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. That is so that if any kind of a leak is detected, it is immediately shut down so you minimize the amount of product that would leak. [[Page S563]] Those are the kinds of safety features--and there are 57 of them-- required by the administration's Pipeline and Hazardous Material Safety Administration. When we talk about pipeline safety and somebody comes in and says there is this pipe that broke so we should never have another pipe, we need to talk about that and address that in a sensible way. We have over 2 million miles of pipe in this country. The point is we do need to build new pipelines and upgrade them and take other steps to make sure the system is safe. But you don't do that by blocking investment in the new technologies and the new pipeline that will help us move product more safely, more cost-effectively, and more dependably. Those are the three issues I wanted to address. Again, I covered some of them yesterday, but I wanted to make sure that any time we had somebody coming down to offer amendments, we deferred to those individuals. I am pleased now we have 18 amendments pending on a whole gamut of issues related to this project, to this energy discussion, and to our efforts to advance a better energy future for our country. Again, I look forward to the debate this afternoon, to voting on these amendments, and to continuing to advance this legislation on behalf of the American people. I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mrs. MURRAY. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Perdue). Without objection, it is so ordered. Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in morning business. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Department of Homeland Security Funding Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I wish to take a few minutes to talk about the latest attempt by the Republicans in the House of Representatives--and a few Republicans in the Senate as well--to hold hostage the basic operation of our government, once again, over politics. While I have several issues with the Department of Homeland Security funding bill that the House has sent to us, I will first discuss this strategy we are seeing from Republicans, as the former chair of the Budget Committee and as someone who has worked across the aisle to break through gridlock in Congress. Two years ago our country was moving constantly from one manufactured crisis to the next. We had debt limit scares that were rattling our businesses and the markets, we were headed toward an absurd and unnecessary government shutdown, and people across the country were losing faith that their elected officials could get anything done when it came to the budget and to our economy. But by working together, Congressman Paul Ryan and I were able to reach a budget deal that prevented another government shutdown and showed the American people that Congress could work together to get things done. Because of that deal we were able to then pass bipartisan spending bills for the past 2 fiscal years, including 11 of the 12 appropriations bills from last year. Although we have a lot of work to do, it is clear that stability in the Federal budget makes a difference for our economy. We have to work together to build on that growth, to continue that certainty, and to make sure our economy is working for all families, not only the wealthiest few. Across the country, businesses have added more than 11 million new jobs--over 58 straight months of job growth. The unemployment rate is now under 6 percent and trending downward, and we have reduced the Federal budget deficit by over two-thirds since 2009. So when I look at the Homeland Security funding bill that the House of Representatives has now sent to us, I see a few things. I see a bill--the way it is drafted and was sent to us will tear apart families who are working hard to make it in America. I see a bill that will put our security at risk, and I see a bill that seriously threatens all of the work we have done recently, Republicans and Democrats, to keep our government functioning because the bill the House has sent over is simply unacceptable. It will not pass the Senate. Republicans know that. Let's be clear about what this bill is, it is a calculated, political gamble from our Republican colleagues. This looming showdown over funding the Department of Homeland Security is no accident. In fact, it is actually a risk they have been planning since last year all because of political pressure from the extreme anti-immigration right wing of their party. If Republicans are willing to risk funding for the Department of Homeland Security for political reasons, I believe the American people deserve to know exactly what that does mean because funding the Department of Homeland Security doesn't only keep the lights on the DHS headquarters, that funding protects our country from terrorist attacks at a time when the world is as dangerous and volatile as ever. It protects our country and American businesses from cyber attacks, a threat that is all too real as we have now seen in recent months. It supports basic security measures at our airports, at our seaports, and along the border. It even supports our Federal emergency management resources that are on call for every community in America. In my home State of Washington, this funding supports the Coast Guard, which protects shippers and sailors throughout Puget Sound, and Customs and Border Protection, which helps facilitate billions in international trade moving through my State, the most trade-dependent State in the country. Not funding these programs is a risk we cannot afford to take. It is reckless and irresponsible and, more than anything else, simply counterproductive for Republicans to put all of this on the line just to score some political points with the tea party and the far right. Unfortunately that appears exactly to be what they are doing. Once again Speaker Boehner and the House Republicans have decided they are willing to break up millions of families and deport millions of DREAMers who are victims themselves of a broken system. They have decided they are willing to stop the President's policy of focusing our law enforcement on national security threats, gang members, and violent criminals. Once again they have decided they are willing to make bipartisan, comprehensive immigration reform that much more difficult to achieve. This is much more than only an annual funding bill. This legislation is a message which has been sent to us loud and clear from House Republicans and Speaker Boehner that they are willing to continue pushing us from crisis to crisis. They are willing to play politics with our national security, and they are willing to turn their backs on millions and millions of children and families. For years now we have seen that strategy doesn't work--it doesn't work. It holds us back. But I have to say I was encouraged when Majority Leader McConnell said that at the end of the day the Senate will fund the Department of Homeland Security. It is clear the House bill will not pass the Senate, so I truly believe it is time for the majority leader to show, as he has promised, that he will let the Senate and Congress work efficiently. It is time for the majority leader to bring a clean DHS appropriations bill to the floor. Let's get it done, passed, and move on to the work that is so important to us. I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. SCHUMER. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I rise to urge my Republican colleagues to pass a clean bill to fund the Department of Homeland Security for the remainder of the fiscal year. We are now only 1 month away from a shutdown of the principal Federal agency charged with keeping Americans safe from terrorism and prepared for natural disasters. [[Page S564]] The President has said he will veto any funding bill that repeals or rolls back his Executive order on immigration, so anything but a clean bill to fund DHS means one thing and one thing alone. Republicans are unilaterally shutting down the agency. No matter what your grievance is, we shouldn't be playing politics with national security. It is alarming that even as we can now count the days, 30, until a Republican security shutdown, so many on the hard right are ready to just dismiss the consequences. Compared to their obsession with President Obama's immigration action and their desire to appease the tea party with radical and practical ideas that would not fix our system, to Republicans shutting down DHS is ``not the end of the world.'' So I will use my time to spell out what a DHS shutdown would mean for our country in the hopes that our Republican colleagues will be jolted back to reality and to common sense. Since this isn't the first time Republicans have put us through a shutdown, we actually have a very good idea as to what a DHS shutdown would look like. Here are just some of the functions that would cease if Republicans failed to put a clean bill on the floor: The bulk of DHS management and headquarter administrative support activities would cease, including much of the homeland security infrastructure that was built during the 9/11 terrorist attacks to improve command, control, and coordination of disparate frontline activities. Securing the Cities, a critical post-9/ 11 funding program that helps pay for nuclear detection capabilities in New York City, Los Angeles, and Washington, DC, could not be awarded in fiscal year 2015. The DHS Nuclear Detection Office, which since 9/11 coordinates on a daily or weekly basis with local law enforcement, will stop operating. FEMA's disaster preparedness unit would cease coordinating regular training activities for law enforcement for weapons of mass destruction events. FEMA employees in Washington and across the country who provide critical preparedness resources to local first responders would be sent home. Twenty-five percent of FEMA's headquarters and regional staff would be furloughed. FEMA personnel working on grants programs, such as funds for intelligence analysts or firefighter needs, would be furloughed, and even those personnel deemed essential would be denied paychecks until a funding bill is passed. This means we are not paying the Coast Guard, we are not paying the TSA, we are not paying the Border Patrol, the Secret Service or FEMA aid workers. So make no mistake, a DHS shutdown would hamstring our ability to combat threats to the homeland and to keep our citizens safe. The irony of course is that one of the programs that shutdown would close completely is E-Verify, which stops unscrupulous employers from hiring undocumented workers and cutting everyone's wages. So in order to make a point on immigration, our Republican colleagues are actually going to stop the program which prevents employers from hiring undocumented workers. Essentially to make a point about needing more immigration enforcement, Republicans are willing to shut down immigration enforcement. In short, I am perplexed as to why Republicans are playing this game of chicken with DHS funding because the only possible outcome that could come from withholding of a clean DHS bill is the shutdown of several critical post- 9/11 programs within the DHS and the furlough of thousands of workers paramount to our Nation's security and disaster preparedness. At a time when we need all hands on deck to keep America safe, Republican efforts to politicize our security would tie DHS's hands behind their back. So I urge my Republican colleagues in the House and Senate to drop this fool's errand and put a clean DHS funding bill on the floor as soon as possible. I yield the floor. Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mrs. SHAHEEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Mrs. SHAHEEN. Mr. President, I am here this afternoon to discuss the two concerns I have about the bill currently before the Senate--the regulation that would grant immediate approval of the Presidential permit necessary to construct and operate the Keystone XL Pipeline. First and foremost, I believe a thorough regulatory review process is critical for any major infrastructure project, particularly one that will cross our country's border. Regulatory review enables the identification of economic impacts from a major project and, more importantly, environmental impacts that infrastructure projects such as the Keystone Pipeline may bring. We shouldn't trade transparency for expediency when it comes to the construction of an international project that has such scope. I can't support a bill that sacrifices these important protections. That is why I voted in the past against legislation to allow the Keystone XL Pipeline to circumvent the normal review process, and that is why I intend to again vote against this bill. I also have a number of concerns about the impact of the Keystone Pipeline on our environment. In the past 2 weeks, we have had a spirited debate on this floor, and a number of my colleagues have come to the floor to talk about the pipeline oilspills we have seen in this country. Just a few days ago, an oil pipeline burst, leaking 50,000 gallons of crude oil into the Yellowstone River in Montana. Yet this spill pales in comparison to the 2010 Kalamazoo River oil spill where over 1 million gallons of oil sands poured into Talmadge Creek in Michigan. The cleanup has already cost more than $1 billion and taken over 4 years to complete. In fact, to date there has been no authoritative study on how the spills of oil sands crude may differ from those of conventional crude oil. This means we have no idea about the spill's long-term effects on the health of wildlife in that river. The other issue that has been raced onto the floor is the fact that right now, because of the way we define crude oil, TransCanada-- supporting and planning to build the Keystone Pipeline--is not required to pay into the federal oil spill liability trust fund, which would ensure taxpayers against any spills. So we have this out-of-state, out- of-country foreign company that is coming in to build this pipeline, and yet they are not required to pay, as any American company would be, into the oil spill liability trust fund. That, to me, doesn't make sense. Circumventing the regulatory process for Keystone prevents us from understanding the health hazards that we would face should another spill occur. I am also concerned that construction of the Keystone Pipeline will increase carbon emissions and undermine some of the most critical climate policies that we have in place. The pipeline poses threats to our environment that have already been identified. Tar sands greenhouse gas emissions are 81 percent greater than those of conventional oil. That is because the production of oil sands crude is more energy intensive, or more greenhouse gas intensive, than conventional crude production. Additional processes are required to extract the oil, remove the sand, and dilute the oil so that it can flow in a pipeline. In addition, if the pipeline is approved, much of the boreal wetlands in Alberta, Canada, which act as a carbon sink, would be destroyed, releasing 11 million to 47 million metric tons of CO 2 into the atmosphere. One of the reasons I am concerned about circumventing the regulatory process is because I believe this could set a precedent for a rushed approval of infrastructure projects currently under consideration in New Hampshire. In New Hampshire, we have two projects that really merit careful consideration and thorough review that could be affected by a precedent that says we should ignore the regulatory process. In New Hampshire, the Northern Pass transmission proposal, which proposes to deliver hydropower from Quebec into the New England energy markets and goes through northern New Hampshire, would bring power to southern New England, but New Hampshire wouldn't benefit. And any suggestion that we would circumvent the [[Page S565]] process is a real concern to people in New Hampshire who would be affected by that project. The other project is the potential reversal of the Portland-Montreal pipeline, which, if the determination were made to do this, would send oil sands through many New Hampshire communities, and that oil would then be shipped to foreign countries. So if we set the precedent of trading transparency for expediency with Keystone, without requiring the completion of a comprehensive approval process, local communities in New Hampshire may not have a meaningful voice in the process that deals with Northern Pass or reversing the Portland-Montreal pipeline. I think that is unacceptable. These three projects--Keystone, Northern Pass, and Portland- Montreal--have one important thing in common: They should undergo the comprehensive environmental and safety approval process required by existing law, and that should be done independent of politics. Circumventing the Presidential permitting process for cross-border pipelines and electric transmission facilities avoids the due process that is needed to determine whether these projects are in the best interests of the country. In New Hampshire, Northern Pass and the Portland-Montreal pipeline have raised serious concerns for people who live in areas impacted by these projects. That is why I worked with the entire New Hampshire congressional delegation in a bipartisan way to ensure that both projects undergo a transparent, thorough, and comprehensive review process. That allows the input of local communities who will be affected by these projects. Like people in New Hampshire and across the country, I share concerns about our Nation's energy future. Throughout my career I have fought for smart policies that will reduce energy costs in New Hampshire and across the country, that will help create jobs, and will protect our air and water from pollution. But I don't believe mandating a project that bypasses the approval process is a smart policy. We need to be smart and thoughtful about our energy future. I think it would set a dangerous precedent for other projects that could have serious consequences in New Hampshire and in other States around the country. I appreciate the debate we have had here on the Senate floor about the Keystone Pipeline, but I will be opposing this bill. I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. NELSON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Ukraine and Syria Mr. NELSON. Mr. President, I want to speak to the Senate about Ukraine and also about Syria. These are two parts of the world that are of particular critical importance to the United States foreign policy today because of what they portend for the future. The fact that our relationship is so rocky with the President of Russia, President Putin, who right up to just a few days after the Olympics suddenly shows his true colors when he invades Crimea, a part of Ukraine, despite all of the agreements when the Soviet Union broke up in the late eighties, early nineties, the agreements that in exchange for moving all of the nuclear weapons out of Ukraine back into Russia, that Russia would forever recognize and respect the sovereignty of Ukraine--well, that went out the window right after the Olympics, and Mr. Putin showed his true colors. He could couch it in all kinds of terms, that there is a Russian naval base that was there, but the fact is the whole world knows what he did, and no one could do anything about it. Then he started to move on the eastern part of Ukraine, and that, of course, is going on as we speak. The so-called rebels aren't really rebels. They are a front for the Russian military propped up with actual troops of the Russian military, sometimes disguised as being free and independent players simply because they don't have on their Russian uniforms; but in fact they have taken them off and put on uniforms that are not Russian uniforms to say that they are part of the rebel force. It is a ruse and everybody knows it is a ruse. I went last August to Ukraine, spoke with almost all of the top-level members of the government and asked what it was they needed. To my surprise, at the time they did not say they needed lethal equipment. They needed up-to-date, up-to-the-minute intelligence, and they needed training. I have urged the U.S. Government to provide that, and we are providing a number of things. This Senator thinks it is clearly in the interest of the United States that we provide more assistance to the Government of Ukraine so their military can have the equipment, including lethal assistance, to hold off Putin's aggression in Eastern Ukraine. This is a particularly critical time. I was there last summer, but what has happened in the meantime is over the course of the past year oil has gone from $100 to $46 a barrel. I remember asking someone when I was there and in the Baltic States what did oil need to get to and below in order for Mr. Putin to start really feeling the pinch, and they said anything under $85 a barrel. It is now around $46 a barrel. Although Russia has significant reserves as of a few months ago, about $450 billion of cash in reserves, that is lower now. Those reserves will hold them for a while because of the price they are getting for their oil. They don't have high production costs in Russia, but because the price is so much lower--half of what they were getting--their revenue is significantly down and therefore all of the money that was being supplied by the Russian Government for so many things, a plethora of different social programs--guess who is feeling the pinch. The people of Russia. So the aggressiveness of Mr. Putin internationally is an attempt to try to take his people's eye off of their own financial depravity and, in fact, get it on the international scene where the President of Russia is quite adept at pounding his chest and banging his fist. The Ukrainians are once again fighting right now as we speak for their territory. The Ukrainian Government took back the Donetsk airport in Eastern Ukraine. Then the rebels came back. And I say ``rebels'' with a wry smile. I mean this is the Russian Army. They came back and they took it again. Last week those Russian-backed rebels broke a shaky ceasefire agreement and they renewed the fighting with the Ukrainian Government military. This Senator feels that we have got to do more to help these people who are trying to protect their independence. If you recall, last year we passed the Ukraine Freedom Support Act which provides further sanctions and lethal aid such as antitank and anti- armor weapons, counterartillery radars, secure communications equipment, and tactical surveillance drones. All of that was needed. The fighting that is following appears to be a steady buildup of Russian support for the rebels. General Hodges, the U.S. Army commander in Europe, said last week that since December Russia had doubled its support for the rebels. General Breedlove, the NATO Supreme Commander, said that Russian electronic warfare and defense systems have been detected in the conflict areas. So let's not fool ourselves, the Russian Army is in there and we have to do more to help them. On Syria, this Senator feels where we are having success right now in Iraq against ISIS with the multiple strikes from the air, with training up the Iraqi Army as the boots on the ground, including some American boots on the ground that are advisers and trainers--at the end of the day we are going to have to do this in Syria if we are going to be successful. It is a lot more complicated in Syria because of the Assad government. The Free Syrian Army we are now starting to train--it is almost an impossible task. We train them, they go in, they try to attack ISIS. ISIS attacks them, but so does the Assad regime. That is not a recipe for success. We are working with the vetted opposition fighters to go after ISIS in Syria. We have to supply support. We have to supply lethal support in addition to the training and equipment in [[Page S566]] order for them to be successful. And for them to be successful, it is absolutely in the interest of the United States. Congress has approved the training and equipping of vetted elements of the Syrian opposition, and the Department of Defense recently announced it will deploy 400 personnel in that effort. We are going to have to do a lot more. The American people are tired of war, and yet we have a new kind of enemy, and we are going to have to take it right to them where they are. Mr. President, I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah. (The remarks of Mr. Hatch pertaining to the introduction of S. 295 are printed in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced Bills and Joint Resolutions.'') Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I wish to say a few words about some of the amendments we will be voting on later this afternoon--three of them in particular. The amendments I am referring to are the Merkley amendment No. 125, the Carper amendment No. 120, and the Heitkamp amendment No. 133. All three of these amendments address sensitive tax issues that fall squarely into the jurisdiction of the Senate Finance Committee, and all of them address issues that are likely to be litigated as the Finance Committee continues its efforts toward comprehensive tax reform. The Finance Committee is going to be very active in this Congress. We had our first bipartisan markup this morning. We already had two hearings, with more scheduled for next week, and perhaps more importantly--at least in the context of these three votes we will be having today--we have taken concrete steps in a process we believe will end in the introduction of bipartisan tax reform legislation. We have appointed five tax reform working groups to address the various areas of reform. Our hope is that over the next few months these working groups will study the issues and provide ideas we can use as we develop a comprehensive tax reform proposal. Ranking Member Wyden is on board with this effort. We are working together every step of the way. If we start singling out individual tax issues here on the floor--even issues Members may feel passionately about--we are going to undermine this bipartisan process. Virtually everyone in both parties agrees that we need to fix our broken, inefficient Tax Code. Sure, there are disagreements on what the substance of tax reform should look like, but there is a growing consensus on the need for reform, which is encouraging. If we are going to be successful in tax reform, we need to make sure these issues are addressed in the tax-writing committees. I think it is safe to say that all of the issues my colleagues are trying to address with their amendments are going to be litigated one way or another in the Finance Committee's efforts this year. That being the case, raising these issues as floor amendments on an unrelated bill is, in my view, very counterproductive. Finally, I would like to note that these amendments would all be subject to a constitutional point of order as they all deal with revenue and would need to be passed first by the House of Representatives. I am not going to raise that point of order at this time; I just want to make note of it for the record. Given all of these concerns, I hope my colleagues--Senators Merkley, Carper, and Heitkamp--will withdraw these amendments so these issues can be addressed in the proper forum. If they do not withdraw their amendments, I plan to vote against all three of them and urge all of my colleagues--particularly those who have an interest in a successful tax reform effort--to do the same. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cruz). The Senator from Colorado. Mr. BENNET. I congratulate the Presiding Officer, and I also congratulate Chairman Hatch for the unanimous vote he got in today's markup in the Finance Committee. It was a great bipartisan start to our work, as he said. I hope we will continue to have these discussions in that manner. Amendment No. 92, as Modified Mr. BENNET. Mr. President, I wish to speak today about the Burr- Bennet amendment No. 92, which we are slated to vote on later today. I will be brief because it is pretty straightforward. The amendment simply reauthorizes the Land and Water Conservation Fund and ensures that a dedicated portion of LWCF funds go to provide new access for our Nation's sports men and women. As many in this body know, the Land and Water Conservation Fund is one of the country's best and most important conservation programs. It is authorized to provide $900 million annually for efforts to preserve and increase access to our public lands and waterways. These resources historically have been used for projects that range from building city parks, to purchasing small parcels of isolated land from willing sellers, all the way to preserving the Nation's historic battlefields. This past summer in Colorado, we completed a huge LWCF project that retired several old mining claims on the San Juan National Forest near the town of Ophir. Over the Fourth of July weekend, the town invited me and my family to join them in a celebration of the accomplishment, and we took them up on that offer without a moment's hesitation. Ophir sits at 9,600 feet above sea level. It is the kind of place that has a sign on its main road--clearly painted by the kids who live in the town--indicating that their population totals 163 people, including, according to the sign, 55 kids, 30 dogs, and 15 cats. When we pulled in on the morning of the celebration, it seemed to me that the entire town was there. Over the course of that day--which included a hike, a picnic, and a formal program--it was amazing to hear from the community about the importance of this LWCF project and how many years so many people in the town devoted themselves to getting it done. Many of our mountain communities get huge portions of their revenue and business through recreation and tourism, and it is for some of these reasons that the town felt LWCF literally helped cement its economic future. I was an LWCF supporter before that visit, but that day really drove home the value of the program to me. That is only one of countless stories from Colorado. I know it can be replicated thousands of times across the country in all 50 States. Those stories and accomplishments alone make this amendment worth supporting. Let's also remember that when we are talking about LWCF, we are not talking about taxpayer dollars. When Congress crafted the measure back in 1965, they had a very innovative solution for how to pay for their concept. Instead of using taxpayer dollars from the Treasury, they decided to dedicate a portion of the revenue the government collects from offshore oil drilling to fund LWCF. This argument was very simple and elegant. As we deplete our natural resources--offshore reserves of oil and gas in this case--we ought to support the conservation of another natural resource: our lands and waterways. As I mentioned, Congress passed a law in 1965, and now it is time to reauthorize it. I thank Senator Burr, who has shown great leadership in crafting the amendment to do just that. This amendment is thoroughly bipartisan and enjoys cosponsors such as Senator Ayotte, Senator Alexander, and Senator Tillis, just to name a few. In fact, I am told there are 246 amendments that have been filed on this bill, and not one amendment has the number of cosponsors that this amendment does. This amendment has more cosponsors than any of the remaining 245 amendments. Before I close and urge my colleagues to vote yes, I want to paraphrase something I said on the floor last week about another amendment. Conservation policies such as LWCF are important to the American people. Protecting our land and water is mom-and-apple-pie stuff in Colorado, and I know our State is not the only one. Conserved lands and wide-open spaces are a huge economic driver across our country, and it is part of who we are in the West. We are not only talking about backcountry parcels, such as the one I visited in Ophir, we are talking about building new parks in inner cities and providing new access to hunters and anglers. The LWCF does all of these things and more. [[Page S567]] I say to my colleagues, if you are for city kids getting a new playground or making sure we protect gold medal trout streams or any number of benefits in between, then you need to be for amendment No. 92 from Senator Burr. I urge all of my colleagues to support the measure when it comes time for a vote later this evening. I think we would make a very meaningful statement about where the Senate is headed if we could supply the votes necessary to actually adopt this amendment. I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. CARDIN. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Flake). Without objection, it is so ordered. Amendment No. 75 Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, it is my understanding that in about a minute we are going to be voting on the first of a series of amendments. The first amendment is the amendment I have offered which I talked about before. I want to remind my colleagues what this amendment does. First, it would require a notification to Governors and to county officials of risks to their drinking water supplies that may be caused by the Keystone Pipeline. Second, the local officials would have the right to bring that information back to the Federal Government so that action could be taken in order to protect their drinking water supplies. Third, it provides a right of action for property owners for damages caused to their wells and drinking water as a direct result of the Keystone Pipeline construction. This is a pretty straightforward amendment. It provides States rights in knowing what is happening with regard to their drinking water, and it provides property owners rights for the damages that could be caused as a result of Keystone. I would urge my colleagues to support the amendment. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time in opposition? The Senator from Alaska. Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I would urge colleagues to oppose the Cardin amendment. In review, it appears that it is designed to halt the construction of this pipeline before it even begins. The amendment tells the President to provide this analysis of the potential risks to public health and environment from a leak or rupture and to provide that to every municipality and every county along the route, as well as to the Governors. Then the Governor can petition the President to effectively locate the pipeline somewhere else, at which point, again, construction could never commence. The Governors of Montana, South Dakota, and Nebraska have already approved the pipeline route through their States. So this amendment is an effort, I think, to build that opposition over contamination fears and in turn, pressure those Governors to reverse their positions and halt the pipeline's construction. I think it is important for colleagues to understand the risks to the water supplies along the pipeline path were examined by the State Department's final SEIS. They were found to be not significant. Again, I will vote no on this amendment and strongly encourage my colleagues to join me with this. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the question occurs on agreeing to amendment No. 75. Mr. CARDIN. I ask for the yeas and nays. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There appears to be a sufficient second. The clerk will call the roll. The legislative clerk called the roll. Mr. CORNYN. The following Senator is necessarily absent: the Senator from Florida (Mr. Rubio). Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the Senator from Nevada (Mr. Reid) is necessarily absent. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Are there any other Senators in the Chamber desiring to vote?

Under the previous order requiring 60 votes for the adoption of this amendment, the amendment is rejected. Change of Vote Ms. HEITKAMP. Mr. President, on rollcall No. 31, I voted yea. It was my intention to vote nay. Therefore, I ask unanimous consent that I be permitted to change my vote, since it will not affect the outcome of the vote. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. (The foregoing tally has been changed to reflect the above order.) Ms. MURKOWSKI. I move to reconsider the vote. Mr. WICKER. I move to lay that motion on the table. The motion to lay on the table was agreed to. Amendment No. 70 The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there is now 2 minutes of debate prior to a vote in relation to amendment No. 70, offered by the Senator from Michigan, Mr. Peters. Who yields time? The Senator from Michigan. Mr. PETERS. Mr. President, as Michiganders, Senator Stabenow and I know firsthand how important the Great Lakes are. The lakes are a vital natural resource and an economic engine for our State, region, and the entire country. Unfortunately, Michiganders also know firsthand the environmental dangers and risks when it comes to pipeline leaks. We had the worst inland pipeline leak in our Nation's history near Kalamazoo, MI. Cleanup has taken over 4 years and has cost $1.2 billion. There is a 60-year-old pipeline under the Straits of Mackinac where Lake Michigan and Lake Huron come together. I cannot even fathom what would happen if there were an accident that contaminated the Great Lakes. The results would be catastrophic not only for the Great Lakes but also the entire country. That is why we need to act now and act quickly, and I urge my colleagues to support the Peters-Stabenow amendment. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska. Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I am not entirely certain I like this amendment. This is the first I have heard PHMSA may not have the resources to do its job. It does seem fair to have PHMSA come tell us if they do not have adequate resources. What I most strongly oppose with this amendment is its attempt to tie the construction of the Keystone XL Pipeline to an unrelated pipeline in a different State. There is no limit for the PHMSA study and certification included here, so we could be looking, in addition to the already 2,300-some-odd days this delay has been in place, at further delays. If my colleagues from Michigan are interested in a PHMSA study, I recommend they introduce their effort as a stand-alone bill so it can be considered by the committee of jurisdiction. If it is needed, we can move it through the regular order and certainly consider it in the future. I would ask my colleagues to oppose this amendment, and I remind colleagues that we are on 10-minute votes. [[Page S568]] The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the Peters amendment.

Under the previous order, there is now 2 minutes of debate equally divided prior to a vote in relation to amendment No. 23, offered by the Senator from Vermont. The Senator from Vermont. Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, the scientific community tells us very clearly that if we are going to reverse climate change and the great dangers it poses for our country and the planet, we must move aggressively to transform our energy system away from fossil fuels to energy efficiency and sustainable energy. This amendment would provide a 15-percent rebate to homeowners so that we could install 10 million new solar rooftops across the country within 10 years. This would result in enough new electrical generation to retire nearly 20 percent of our dirty coal-fired plants and create a significant number of new jobs. So if we are interested in reversing the dangers of climate change and creating jobs, I would urge Senators to support this amendment. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska. Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, the sponsor of this bill knows that I, too, am a supporter of solar, and I think we all are, but it is important to recognize what this measure would do. When we are talking about the benefits to this country and how much it will cost, it is important to understand this. When this was first introduced in the 110th Congress, the goal of 10 million solar roofs legislation was too costly, but we have since seen decreased costs and growth in the solar industry that have made this Federal assistance unnecessary. We have seen the residential solar market grow, we have seen the costs drop. The cost of the solar systems have dropped about 60 percent in the last 4 years. Despite these trends, we are not close to reaching that 1 million mark let alone the 10 million installations. So the real question is, How much is this going to cost us to achieve? The proposed rebate per system is the lesser of 15 percent of the initial capital cost. This puts the Federal Government on the hook for up to $100 billion to pay for these installations. We can debate the merits of jobs and job creation, but I again urge my colleagues to oppose the Sanders amendment. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time has expired.

Under the previous order, there is 2 minutes of debate equally divided prior to a vote in relation to amendment No. 15, offered by the Senator from Texas, Mr. Cruz. The Senator from Texas. Mr. CRUZ. Mr. President, this amendment would expedite the export of liquid natural gas and would provide countries that are members of the WTO the same expedited process that is currently available to free- trade agreement countries. There are now in the Department of Energy some 28 applications pending to export liquid natural gas. This should be an amendment that would bring together Republicans and Democrats. A recent study showed that allowing us to export LNG could create as many as 450,000 new jobs by 2035 that could produce GDP growth of up to an additional $73.6 billion and produce 76,000 more manufacturing jobs. It would aid our allies such as Ukraine, the Baltics, and Europe, and would weaken countries such as Russia that would use natural gas for economic blackmail. I would urge all Senators to support this amendment. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts. Mr. MARKEY. The amendment offered by the Senator from Texas is [[Page S569]] drafted so broadly that it allows just about every nation which is a member of the World Trade Organization to automatically receive natural gas exported from the United States of America. The process is just eliminated--automatic. What will that do? No. 1, it will increase prices to American consumers. The Energy Information Agency has already determined that the LNG export facilities already approved are going to lead to a 50- percent increase in the price of natural gas here in America. It would jeopardize American manufacturing which has seen 700,000 new jobs created in the last 5 years in America largely because of low-priced natural gas. It is going to increase carbon pollution because it is going to slow the pace of change from coal over to natural gas in the generation of electricity. It is going to undermine our trade negotiations because it is all going to be given away here on the Senate floor. And, finally, it is going to harm our national security, because if we converted one-third of our trucks and buses, it backs out all the oil that we import from the Persian Gulf by using natural gas in American vehicles. We are going to ship jobs along with that gas going overseas. I urge a ``no'' vote on the Cruz amendment. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.

Under the previous order, there will be 2 minutes of debate equally divided prior to a vote in relation to amendment No. 73, offered by the Senator from Kansas, Mr. Moran. The Senator from Kansas. Mr. MORAN. Mr. President, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service has determined that the lesser prairie chicken should be listed in a number of States, including Kansas, as a threatened species. The lesser prairie chicken has had a significant history in our State and a significant population of birds, but as a result of a drought, the habitat for the lesser prairie chicken and other wildlife has been diminished and the number of birds has decreased. The consequences of listing the lesser prairie chicken that results from a drought is so dramatic and so damaging to the Kansas economy and to the farmers and ranchers and the use of their lands, to the oil and gas industry and the exploration of oil and gas, and to the utility industry in regard to the production and transmission of electricity that this amendment is necessary to set aside that listing as a threatened species and to allow interest holders in Kansas to come together and find a commonsense solution based upon sound science to protect the habitat of this bird. This is not just a Kansas issue, and in fact, this species is only the precursor to problems others will have in their States. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired. The Senator from New Mexico. Mr. UDALL. Mr. President, I rise today to oppose the Moran amendment, which would delist the lesser prairie chicken as a threatened species. To be clear, I appreciate some of the concerns about this listing by farmers, ranchers, and industry. I am concerned about any unintended consequences this listing may have on rural New Mexicans. I strongly support and I assume the Senator from Kansas supports the bipartisan five-State effort for a thorough review. The Fish and Wildlife Service took numerous steps in this process to respond to all stakeholders and to enable habitat conservation and economic growth. New Mexico has been and continues to be a leader in cooperative conservation in places where the prairie chicken is found. Ranchers and oil and gas industries deserve their praise for their efforts. So it is working and the sky is not falling, but we should not take this top-down political approach. Listing and delisting of the species by Congress goes against the intent of the law, which requires the government to make these decisions based on science, not politics. I urge my colleagues to vote no. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired. The question is on agreeing to the Moran amendment. Mr. McCONNELL.

Amendment No. 148 Under the previous order, there is now 2 minutes of debate equally divided prior to a vote in relation to amendment No. 148, offered by the Senator from Rhode Island, Mr. Whitehouse. The Senator from Rhode Island. Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, the underlying measure benefits specific investors, specific corporations, and pushes regulatory approval of a specific project. In that sense, it has all the earmarks of the biggest earmark ever. We have learned from other history with earmarks that when you have a project that benefits specific investors and specific corporations and specific entities, there is a valuable premium on having the public know about the campaign contributions relative to that project. This bill requires the disclosure of over $10,000 in campaign contributions from entities that will make more than $1 million off this project. It is the type of transparency that many of my Republican colleagues had been for before they were against it. I urge an ``aye'' vote. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired. The Senator from Alaska. Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, this amendment is virtually identical to the text of what we saw last year. It was tabled by a vote of 52 to 43. This amendment is not relevant to this debate. It is as unnecessary now as it was the first time we voted on it. To the extent it is legal for a person or a company to make a campaign contribution, Federal and State election laws require public disclosure of those campaign contributions. Any other more general political activities a company or a person may choose to engage in are governed by existing laws and regulations as well. For that reason, I am going to be opposing this amendment for a second time and would encourage my colleagues to do as well. The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the previous order, there is now 2 minutes of debate equally divided prior to a vote in relation to amendment No. 132, offered by the Senator from Montana, Mr. Daines. The Senator from Montana. Mr. DAINES. Mr. President, my amendment simply expresses the sense of Congress that all future national monument designations should be subject to consultation with local governments and the approval of the Governor and legislature of the States in which such designation would occur. This amendment ensures that the people affected most by these designations have a seat at the table and their voices are heard. The current administration, as well as past administrations--both Republican and Democratic--have made efforts to stretch the intent of the Antiquities Act, threatening Montanans' ability to manage our State's resources. It is a trend we are seeing. Any bill designation that impacts land management should be locally driven, not spearheaded in Washington. I urge my colleagues to support this amendment. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington. Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, speaking in opposition to this amendment, there is a reason why they call it a national monument. That is because it is a national process, and it is a national decision. Yes, Presidents of the United States consult with Governors and consult with State legislators, but they are not required to have a bill or the authority of the Governor before they make a national monument. Nearly half of our national parks, including the Grand Canyon and Olympic National Park, were designated under this Antiquities Act. Sixteen Presidents--eight Republicans and eight Democrats--have designated over 130 national monuments since Teddy Roosevelt signed this act in 1906. I think it has worked well for the United States of America. Please turn down this amendment. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to amendment No. 132, the Daines amendment.

Under the previous order, there is now 2 minutes of debate equally divided prior to a vote in relation to amendment No. 115, offered by the Senator from Delaware, Mr. Coons. The Senator from Delaware. Mr. COONS. Mr. President, we need to take steps now to prepare for the coming impact of climate change on our Nation's infrastructure. The Federal Government plays a crucial role in protecting our infrastructure and partnering with State and Federal, tribal, and local governments to prepare. The Federal Government, including our Pentagon and the highway administration, is already planning and preparing for these impacts. Many States are as well. From my home State of Delaware to Alaska to Florida, all are already planning responsibly for the future impacts of climate change. Preparing now is only responsible, because every dollar invested in planning and preparing is projected to save us up to $4 in future disaster relief. This amendment is supported by a number of organizations--the American Society of Civil Engineers, the National Wildlife Federation, the Union of Concerned Scientists, and others. This amendment does not speak to the human role in climate change or emissions. It simply acknowledges that climate change is having an impact on our infrastructure and suggests that planning is responsible. I urge my colleagues to support this amendment. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska. Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I had a conversation with our colleague from Delaware, and I told him I think this is an area where we might be able to work together. I had actually introduced an amendment that deals with the adaptation that helps to assist those communities that have been affected by climate. We see that up in the coastline of Alaska. Senator Merkley has an amendment that also deals with adaptation. This is about resilience. I am going to oppose the sense-of-the-Senate at this time because of some of the language. I get a little confused or am not certain we are stating it in the right manner. But I do think this process has been healthy in the sense that by having an opportunity to have amendments come forward, we find out where there might be areas where we can work to develop future initiatives that we all might be able to support on a bipartisan basis. I look forward to working with the Senator from Delaware. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment. Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.

Under the previous order, there will now be 2 minutes of debate equally divided prior to a vote in relation to amendment No. 35, offered by the Senator from Maine, Ms. Collins. The Senator from Maine. Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, the Senator from Virginia, Mr. Warner, and I are offering an amendment that would help school officials to learn about existing Federal programs to improve energy efficiency in order to reduce school energy costs. It would not authorize any new programs or any new funding. It would simply require a review of existing Federal programs and require the Department of Energy to establish a coordinating structure so that schools can more easily navigate the many programs that are scattered across the Federal Government. I know of no opposition to the amendment. To try to make life easier for my colleagues, if it is acceptable to the managers, I would be happy to accept a voice vote. I don't know if my colleague from Virginia has any comments he would like to make. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia. Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I agree with the Senator from Maine, and I would urge a voice vote as well. Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I thank both Senators, and I ask unanimous consent that the 60-vote affirmative threshold on the Collins amendment be vitiated, and I urge its adoption by voice vote.

Under the previous order, there will now be 2 minutes of debate equally divided prior to a vote in relation to amendment No. 166, offered by the Senator from Alaska, Ms. Murkowski. The Senator from Alaska. Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I have had an opportunity to speak on this amendment several different times. Effectively, what we are doing is releasing wilderness study areas if within 1 year of receiving the recommendation Congress has not yet designated the study area as wilderness. Effectively, what is happening is designations will come from the administration. Congress is the entity that is to approve them. But in the interim these areas are managed as de facto wilderness. In fact, many areas have been managed as de facto wilderness for decades because the Congress has not acted. So simply, what we do in this amendment is to put a time period. Until the Congress makes a final determination on the wilderness study area, these areas will be determined not to be wilderness and not managed as such. But they are putting a time parameter on that so that they are not managed as wilderness areas indefinitely. I would urge a ``yes'' vote from my colleagues. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington. Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, this is a sweeping attack on millions of acres of land recommended for wilderness. This would nullify much of the Obama administration's plan for the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge and would also immediately abolish wilderness studies on BLM lands in 12 Western States. It would also abolish protection for 2.3 million acres in national wildlife refuges. These lands have been refuges, and they should be managed accordingly. So I would ask my colleagues to oppose this amendment. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the Murkowski Amendment No. 166. Ms. MURKOWSKI. I ask for the yeas and nays.

Under the previous order, there will now be 2 minutes of debate equally divided prior to a vote in relation to amendment No. 133, offered by the Senator from North Dakota, Ms. Heitkamp. The Senator from North Dakota. Ms. HEITKAMP. Mr. President, this amendment will provide a sense of the Senate that we will provide some certainty to the American wind and other renewable industries by taking a look at the production tax credits and actually having a forward progress report so that they know exactly what the rules will be in the future, however short or long that may be. Every year, as we do the tax extenders, there are people waiting to find out if they still have a job. People in my State are waiting to know whether they are going to be put to work the next day or even the next week based on what this Congress does. It is so critical that we actually have predictability in this industry. This is a jobs bill, and it is an energy bill. I can't imagine anything more germane to the Keystone XL Pipeline than a bill that provides both jobs and certainty to an ``all of the above'' essential, which is wind. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? The Senator from Arizona. Mr. FLAKE. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to this amendment. I believe we do need more certainty, and the certainty ought to be that it is time for this tax credit--particularly the wind PTC--to expire. This was enacted 23 years ago as a temporary tax measure. There has been a lot of wind that has blown since that time, and we have a mature industry. In fact, the other day the President said we are No. 1 in the world in wind power. We ought to have more certainty, and the certainty that needs to be there is that the tax credit is going to end and that we stop picking winners and losers in the energy economy. With that, I yield the floor. Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I would like to speak on Amendment No. 133, offered by Senator Heitkamp of North Dakota. The amendment is a sense of Congress that the renewable electricity tax credit should be extended for 5 years. While I supported the amendment, I would like to express my concerns regarding the consideration of this amendment at this time. I have been an outspoken supporter of renewable energy for many years. In fact, I first authored the wind production tax credit in 1992 to drive this renewable energy technology. I have worked for many years to provide as much certainty as possible to grow the domestic wind industry. Iowa has seen an enormous investment in wind energy manufacturing and wind farm development. I know firsthand the boom-and- bust cycle that exists for renewable energy producers when Congress fails to extend these critically important tax incentives. But I also know this credit won't go on forever. It was never meant to, and it shouldn't. In 2012 the wind industry was the only industry to put forward a phaseout plan. A number of my colleagues here in the Senate have been working to construct a responsible, multiyear phaseout of the wind tax credit. That is why I am somewhat puzzled by an amendment that suggests a 5-year extension of this credit. It seems disconnected with reality. I would remind my colleagues on the other side that in November of 2014, the House offer on tax extenders included a multiyear extension of the wind production tax credit that would have provided the certainty and soft landing that most of us and the industry support, but President Obama issued a veto threat before the ink was dry, and as a result the wind incentive expired. Again, I strongly support wind energy, but I support a prudent way forward on an extension of the production tax credit. This amendment fails terribly in that regard. That is why I am disappointed that the Senator from North Dakota insisted on going forward with a 5-year extension on this bill. This is not a real effort to extend the wind incentive. I am afraid this was simply a politically motivated effort designed to score political points. [[Page S573]] It is unfortunate that in this case, politicking has trumped efforts to achieve sound, responsible policy. Rather than offer ``gotcha'' amendments on an unrelated bill, we should be working together to craft an extension of these important tax incentives that work for the wind industry, that are realistic politically, and that make sense for the American taxpayer. That effort requires regular order, working through the Finance Committee, to determine the most prudent path forward. It should be done in the context of comprehensive tax reform, where all energy tax provisions are on the table, rather than as a sense of the Congress on the unrelated Keystone XL bill. I hope that with this political exercise behind us, those of us who seek to ensure a responsible transition for the wind production tax credit can get to work and achieve a sensible policy for those who depend on it. It is too bad that this ill-timed, ill-conceived amendment may have actually harmed those efforts. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment. Mr. COATS.

The result was announced--yeas 47, nays 51, as follows: [Rollcall Vote No. 40 Leg.] YEAS--47 Baldwin Bennet Blumenthal Booker Boxer Brown Cantwell Cardin Carper Casey Collins Coons Donnelly Durbin Feinstein Franken Gillibrand Grassley Heinrich Heitkamp Hirono Kaine King Kirk Klobuchar Leahy Markey McCaskill Menendez Merkley Mikulski Murphy Murray Nelson Peters Reed Sanders Schatz Schumer Shaheen Stabenow Tester Udall Warner Warren Whitehouse Wyden NAYS--51 Alexander Ayotte Barrasso Blunt Boozman Burr Capito Cassidy Coats Cochran Corker Cornyn Cotton Crapo Cruz Daines Enzi Ernst Fischer Flake Gardner Graham Hatch Heller Hoeven Inhofe Isakson Johnson Lankford Lee Manchin McCain McConnell Moran Murkowski Paul Perdue Portman Risch Roberts Rounds Sasse Scott Sessions Shelby Sullivan Thune Tillis Toomey Vitter Wicker NOT VOTING--2 Reid Rubio The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order requiring 60 votes for the adoption of this amendment, the amendment is rejected. Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote. Mr. HATCH. I move to lay that motion on the table. The motion to lay on the table was agreed to. Amendment No. 48 The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there is now 2 minutes of debate equally divided prior to a vote in relation to amendment No. 48 offered by the Senator from New York, Mrs. Gillibrand. The Senator from New York. Mrs. GILLIBRAND. Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of the Keystone XL Pipeline Act. As it stands now, gas companies in this country do not have to comply with the Safe Drinking Water Act-- the law that keeps our tapwater clear, safe, and clean. For decades now, this loophole has exempted hydrofracking and gas storage companies from this law, even though every other energy industry, including oil and coal industries, is legally obligated to comply. If big coal can comply with this law, so can gas companies. This special exemption is unfair, it is unnecessary, and it is unsafe. My amendment would finally remove it from the law. I urge my colleagues not to let this chance pass us by. I ask for the yeas and nays. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There appears to be a sufficient second. The yeas and nays were ordered. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska. Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, claiming the 1 minute in opposition. As the Senator from New York has described, this would apply to the requirements of the Safe Drinking Water Act to underground ejection of natural gas. Currently the Safe Drinking Water Act expressly prohibits this application. This amendment to add the requirements to the Safe Drinking Water Act is beyond the scope of the immediate Keystone debate. We are debating the approval of a pipeline that is going to carry oil, not gas. If the Senator from New York wants to debate the issues of fracking--most certainly those issues are before the Energy and Natural Resources Committee, and the Safe Drinking Water Act--I would welcome a stand- alone bill. We will have those discussions, but on this measure I would oppose and encourage Members to vote against the Gillibrand amendment. I would remind Members we are so close to wrapping up this series of amendments. If we can ask the folks to stick around for these final few and keep to the 10-minute line. I know Senator Feinstein is looking to encourage the women of the Senate to gather for a meal later on, and that would be important for us. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to Gillibrand amendment No. 48. The yeas and nays have been previously ordered. The clerk will call the roll. The bill clerk called the roll. Mr. CORNYN. The following Senator is necessarily absent: the Senator from Florida (Mr. Rubio). Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the Senator from Nevada (Mr. Reid) is necessarily absent. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Are there any other Senators in the Chamber desiring to vote? The result was announced--yeas 35, nays 63, as follows: [Rollcall Vote No. 41 Leg.] YEAS--35 Baldwin Blumenthal Booker Boxer Brown Cantwell Cardin Carper Casey Coons Durbin Feinstein Franken Gillibrand Hirono King Klobuchar Leahy Markey Menendez Merkley Mikulski Murphy Murray Nelson Peters Reed Sanders Schatz Schumer Shaheen Stabenow Warren Whitehouse Wyden NAYS--63 Alexander Ayotte Barrasso Bennet Blunt Boozman Burr Capito Cassidy Coats Cochran Collins Corker Cornyn Cotton Crapo Cruz Daines Donnelly Enzi Ernst Fischer Flake Gardner Graham Grassley Hatch Heinrich Heitkamp Heller Hoeven Inhofe Isakson Johnson Kaine Kirk Lankford Lee Manchin McCain McCaskill McConnell Moran Murkowski Paul Perdue Portman Risch Roberts Rounds Sasse Scott Sessions Shelby Sullivan Tester Thune Tillis Toomey Udall Vitter Warner Wicker NOT VOTING--2 Reid Rubio The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order requiring 60 votes for the adoption of this amendment, the amendment is rejected. Ms. MURKOWSKI. I move to reconsider the vote. Ms. CANTWELL. I move to lay that motion on the table. The motion to lay on the table was agreed to. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska. Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending Murkowski substitute, as amended, be considered original text for the purposes of further amendment. I ask unanimous consent that when the Senate resumes consideration of S. 1 tomorrow, Thursday, January 29, [[Page S574]] there be 15 minutes equally divided in the usual form and the Senate proceed to vote on the following amendments in the order listed: Barrasso No. 245; Cardin No. 124; Burr No. 92, as modified; Daines No. 246; Vitter No. 80, as further modified with the changes at the desk; Udall No. 77; further, that all amendments on this list be subject to a 60-vote affirmative threshold for adoption and that no second-degrees be in order to any of the pending amendments to this bill. I ask unanimous consent that there be 2 minutes of debate equally divided between each vote and that all votes after the first in this series be 10-minute votes. I further ask that once these amendments have been disposed of, the Senate agree to proceed to the motion to reconsider the failed cloture vote on S. 1; that the motion to reconsider be agreed to and the Senate proceed to vote on the motion to invoke cloture on the bill, upon reconsideration. I ask consent that if cloture is invoked on the bill, as amended, all time postcloture be considered expired at 2:30 p.m. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is so ordered. The amendment (No. 80), as further modified, is as follows: At the end, add the following: TITLE _--OUTER CONTINENTAL SHELF OIL AND GAS LEASING REVENUE SEC. _01. REVENUE SHARING FROM OUTER CONTINENTAL SHELF WIND ENERGY PRODUCTION FACILITIES. The first sentence of section 8(p)(2)(B) of the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act (43 U.S.C. 1337(p)(2)(B)) is amended by inserting after ``27 percent'' the following: ``, or, beginning in fiscal year 2016, in the case of projects for offshore wind energy production facilities, 37.5 percent''. SEC. _02. OUTER CONTINENTAL SHELF LEASING PROGRAM REFORMS.

The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska. Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I think Members have been given the outline for tomorrow morning that will take us through a final vote on cloture so that we can get to final passage of the Keystone XL Pipeline. I appreciate the consideration and the courtesy of all Members. It has been a long day. We have worked through about a dozen additional amendments, if my count is correct, and we have done it in pretty good order. We have done it while there have been a number of committee meetings going on, which can be very disruptive, but I think with the level of cooperation we have had, we will be able to conclude our business at a relatively civilized hour this evening. I appreciate the good work of my partner and ranking member Senator Cantwell in getting us to this place. I am hopeful that with the number of amendments we have outlined for the morning and then the handful of germane amendments we will have in the afternoon, we will be able to move on to other business before the Senate. But I thank my colleagues for all of the effort and cooperation we have had to this point. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington. Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I wish to thank my colleague from Alaska for her hard work in getting us through this process. I think our colleagues can see the daylight to finishing this up tomorrow, hopefully. I know Members have worked across the aisle on some of these remaining issues, and we are still trying to work a few of them out. So hopefully tomorrow will go as smoothly as today has. I would like to turn now to my colleague from New Mexico to call up his amendment. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico. Amendment No. 77 (Purpose: To establish a renewable electricity standard, and for other purposes) Mr. UDALL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to set aside the pending amendment so that I may call up my amendment No. 77. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk will report. The bill clerk read as follows: The Senator from New Mexico [Mr. Udall], for himself, Mr. Markey, and Mr. Bennet, proposes an amendment numbered 77. Mr. UDALL. I ask unanimous consent that the reading of the amendment be dispensed with. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. (The amendment is printed in the Record of January 20, 2015, under ``Text of Amendments.'') Mr. UDALL. Mr. President, let me just say to the two leaders on the floor who have participated in this open amendment process that I really appreciate the way Chairwoman Murkowski and Ranking Member Cantwell have worked through this bill. I really appreciate all their help. I have heard, at least on our side of the aisle, over and over that this is the way the Senate should be moving, this is the way we should be working. So I think all of us are very appreciative of how the two managers of the bill have worked together. I thank my colleagues, and I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska. Ms. MURKOWSKI. I thank our colleague for his kind comments. We do have one more consent request here very briefly. I ask unanimous consent that the order of votes on the Burr and the Daines amendments be reversed. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Ms. MURKOWSKI. With that, Mr. President, I again thank Members for their cooperation today and look forward to yet another productive day tomorrow. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota. Mr. HOEVEN. Mr. President, I want to express my appreciation to the bill managers for their hard work today and for their efforts in the work that was done in a bipartisan way on this legislation. I know both the bill managers have spent an awful lot of time putting together these amendments, and I think they have really bent over backward to make sure Members on both sides of the aisle have had an opportunity to file their amendments, to make those amendments pending, and to get votes on the amendments. So I would like to express my appreciation to both of them for all the work they have done and for the process today in voting on amendments. With that, I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona. The Economy Mr. FLAKE. Mr. President, yesterday the Congressional Budget Office-- the CBO--released its budget and economic outlook showing the forecast through 2025. It should strike fear in the heart of anybody who is concerned about this country's financial future. The very short-term news is good. The deficit is projected to fall-- but only for another 2 years. In 2017 the deficit is projected to start rising again to $1.1 trillion in 10 years. That is the annual deficit. By 2025 the deficit will be 4 percent of our overall economy. Right now the country's debt in cumulative deficits over the years-- the cumulative debt--is $18 trillion. This year we will pay about $277 billion just servicing that debt. That amount might seem low, but it is because of artificially low interest rates. In 10 years we will pay about $827 billion a year just to service the debt. That is 3 percent of our economy just to pay interest on the debt. That is unsustainable. Don't take my word for it, though. You can take CBO's. They said: Such large and growing Federal debt would have serious negative consequences, including increasing Federal spending for interest payments; restraining economic growth in the long term; giving policymakers less flexibility to respond to unexpected challenges; and eventually heightening the risk of a financial crisis. I have been working on these issues--this issue in particular--for a long time, and I have to admit that sometimes it is tough to get people to focus on this topic. But we shouldn't be fooled and patting ourselves on the back just because we have done things such as getting rid of earmarks. That is a good thing, but it is certainly insufficient to address our spending. The culture in Washington is still the culture of runaway spending, not just in earmarks, as I said, not just in wasteful spending. For example, spending on Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid will nearly double over the next decade alone. This is not a revenue problem that we are having. Projected revenues will exceed their 50-year historical average of 17 percent of GDP this year and will grow to over 18 percent of the economy in this decade. The culture of spending in Washington is something that defies logic, defies math and an honest assessment of who we are as a country. As a result, the United States is fast becoming a once-prosperous nation. We don't want that designation. It is truly a frightening distinction. Yet too few in Washington are motivated to get this country's fiscal house in order. One has to wonder how bad it is going to have to get to prod those who are not yet motivated. Some will argue that we need to take baby steps to address our fiscal crisis. I think we are well past that time, but whatever kinds of steps we take, we need to take them now. We need to turn this culture of spending in Washington to one that will fully repair our economy. That will give the private sector the stability and confidence to create jobs. We also need to reform our cumbersome Tax Code. Most of all, we need to relieve future generations of the burden of our financial mess. In short, it is well past time to start climbing our way out of this fiscal hole we are in. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island. Climate Change Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I am here now for the 87th consecutive week the Senate has been in session to urge action on climate change. We have had an interesting couple of weeks on the Keystone Pipeline, but from a climate change and carbon pollution point of view, this would obviously not be helpful. Indeed, it would [[Page S576]] be a disaster leading to as much as 27 million--27 million--metric tons of additional carbon dioxide emitted per year. To put that number into some perspective, that is the equivalent of adding 6 million cars and trucks to our roads for 50 years. So it is a very considerable carbon price to pay. We have seen a poster used on the Senate Floor that says it will have no environmental effect. That is not precisely true. Indeed, precisely the opposite is true. This is the environmental effect it will have, and it is considerable. The report referred to went on to say that it would be offset by the fact that this fuel would go out by rail anyway. But that offset was conditioned on a fuel price above $75 per barrel of oil, and we are at $50. So there is no way that conclusion can stand, and the underlying fact is what prevails--27 million metric tons of additional carbon dioxide. It is obviously very bad from an environmental perspective. It is a lot of ``not much'' from a jobs perspective. Every 4 days we add more jobs than the construction of this pipeline just through the economic recovery that is taking place. This is a little bit hard to explain, particularly when you think that this bill is going to be dead on arrival at the White House. We have known from the beginning that this is going to be vetoed. But it has allowed the oil and the fossil fuel industry to show their hands. This is all being done on behalf of a foreign oil company and on behalf of the fossil fuel industry. When we look at what we have been through in the past couple of days, there are some interesting choices the Senate has made if you are a foreign oil company. If you are a foreign oil company, we will let you use eminent domain to extinguish the property rights of farmers and ranchers and take their farms and ranches away. If you are a foreign oil company, we will exempt you from the oilspill recovery fund--the Federal excise tax on petroleum--so you don't have to pay the taxes American companies have to pay. If you are a foreign oil company, we will not require you to use American steel in a pipeline being built across America being touted as a source of American jobs. If you are a foreign oil company, we won't require you to sell it in the American market even though it is touted as a product that will help balance America's energy portfolio. So, so far, not much good to show for all of this but one thing, and that is that this exercise has at last brought the issue of climate change to the floor of the Senate. We have not had much debate about climate change since the Citizens United decision back in 2010 allowed the fossil fuel industry to cast a very long shadow of intimidation across this body. They spend a huge amount of the money that has been freed up by Citizens United. They spend a huge amount of dark money that flows post Citizens United. And since then, the Republican Party has been virtually muzzled on that subject. So having Republicans talk about climate change on the Senate floor was something of a revelation, and I don't think we should underestimate the importance of that or undervalue what was said. The senior Senator from North Carolina came to the floor and said this: The concept that climate change is real, I completely understand and accept. To the point of how much man is contributing, I don't know, but it does make sense that man- made emissions are contributing. . . . the greenhouse gas effect seems to me scientifically sound. The problem is that how you fix this globally is going to require more than just the U.S. being involved. Which I think we all agree with. The senior Senator from Alaska, who is our chairman of the Energy and Natural Resources Committee and the floor manager on this very bill, agreed, stating that she hopes we can all, quoting her, get beyond the discussion as to whether or not climate change is real and talk about what do we do. I look forward to that discussion about what do we do. It is not enough just to say, OK, we finally concede that climate change is really happening. We really do have to get on to what do we do. Even if you disagree with me that climate change is real and very significant and consequential for our country, if you will spot me that there is just a 10-percent chance that I am right--even just a 2- percent chance that I am right--when we consider the possible harms, it is something that grownup adults and responsible people ought to take a look at and come together and decide what to do. We have been through some very notable benchmarks. We hit for the first time last year 400 parts per million of carbon dioxide in our atmosphere for more than 3 months. They have been tracking this in Hawaii, at the top of the mountain at the Mauna Loa laboratory for decades now, and 400 parts per million for more than 3 months is a new record. To put that in context: For as long as human beings have been on this planet, all the way back to when we were living in caves, the range of carbon in the atmosphere has been 170 to 300 parts per million. So we are well outside the range that has been our comfortable safe range for human habitation of this planet during our entire human experience, and 400 is a big move when our entire range is only 130 points and now we are 100 parts per million out of that. Some of this lands in the oceans. The oceans have absorbed about a quarter of all our carbon emissions. We can measure their pH level. This isn't complicated. This isn't something we have to do with elaborate computer models. What we see is that the pH level of the oceans is changing rapidly. The oceans are acidifying rapidly. When I say rapidly, they are acidifying at a rate that we have not seen in 25 to perhaps 30 or 50 million years. Indeed, some studies say nothing like this has been seen on the face of the Earth for as long as 300 million years. When we consider that our species has been around for about 200,000 years, that is a pretty long window to be launching new and dramatic changes in our oceans. There is nothing new about the science that supports this. John Tyndall wrote the first report about the greenhouse gas effect to the British Academy of Sciences in 1861. The pages who are here and have studied history will know that 1861 was the year President Lincoln took office. So the scientific community has been aware of the greenhouse gas phenomenon since Abraham Lincoln was driving up and down Pennsylvania Avenue in a carriage with his top hat on. There is not much new that is there, and the latest data is clearer and clearer that we just continue apace to warm the planet. Professor Jonathan Overpeck is at the University of Arizona, and Arizona is certainly feeling the heat. Professor Overpeck said: The global warmth of 2014 is just another reminder that the planet is warming and warming fast. . . . Humans, and their burning of fossil fuels, are dominating the Earth's climate system like never before. It is equally clear, when we look at the oceans, they not only absorb a lot of the carbon dioxide and acidify as a result--they absorb most of the heat. In fact, they absorb 90 percent of the excess heat that has been trapped by the greenhouse gases that we have flooded our atmosphere with. I certainly see that in Rhode Island, where Narragansett Bay's mean winter water temperature is up 3 to 4 degrees Fahrenheit since we had our big hurricane of 1938. That is significant, because it means more likely storms. It is associated with sea level rise. We have 10 more inches of sea level at the Newport Naval Station. So if the 1938 hurricane were to repeat itself now, it would have 10 more inches of sea to hammer against our shores. And that is not a complicated measure, either. We do that with thermometers. So since the Industrial Revolution, human beings have dumped 2 trillion metric tons of carbon dioxide into the air and into the atmosphere. Said another way, that is 2,000 billion metric tons of carbon dioxide. The notion that has no effect, when we have known since Abraham Lincoln's day that carbon dioxide is a greenhouse gas, and when we put that much in and when we can measure that it is at 400 for the first time in human history--connect the dots. How much does it take? It is really pretty obvious. Folks who remain skeptical--well, I know, I am not a scientist. I get that. So ask one. That is all I request. And I don't think that is too much to ask of colleagues. And, by the way, do me one favor. You can ask the scientist that you please, but please don't ask a scientist who is in the pay of the fossil [[Page S577]] fuel and the denial industry. There are a bunch of them who are out there. They turn up at all the usual denial conferences. They write in the denial journals. They take money from the denial organizations that all have fossil fuel industry funding behind them. Go to someplace neutral. For instance, go to your own State university, like the University of Arizona or the University of Oklahoma. The dean of the relevant department at the University of Oklahoma signed the IPCC report and started Climate Central. Ask your own university. Ask any major scientific organization. All the major recognized scientific organizations in the United States of America are on board, agree that this is real, agree that this is important, agree that it is vital, and believe that we are actually near the tipping point that may make the damage irrecoverable. If you don't want to go to your home State university and if you don't want to go to America's major scientific societies, try NOAA and NASA. Think about NASA for a moment. As I give this speech, there is a Rover that is the size of an SUV being driven around on the surface of Mars. We built a Rover, shot it to Mars, landed it safely, and are now driving it around. Do we think those scientists might actually know something? Do we think they might know what they are talking about? Do we think they might merit our confidence? So ask them and see what they say. Or, if you want, ask some of America's leading corporations. If you are from Arkansas, go and ask Walmart. They will tell you. If you are from Georgia, go and ask Coca-Cola. They will tell you. This is not hard to discover once you get away from that little stable of denial scientists who are so closely affiliated with the fossil fuel industry. I do this every week because we have the arrogance so often here to think how much our laws--the laws that we pass--matter. But the laws that we pass are passing things. They come and they go. They have their time. They are repealed, they are replaced, they fall into desuetude. But some laws last, and those are the laws that God laid down upon this Earth that guide its operations. Those are the laws of physics, the laws of chemistry, the laws of biology, the law of gravity. We cannot repeal those laws. We must face their consequences. And we know the consequences of continuing to emit gigatons of carbon dioxide into our planet is going to launch us into an environment in which the habitability of Earth as we have known it will be put into question. History makes its judgments about every generation. If we do not take calm and reasonable and sensible precautions about this obvious known and admitted risk, then when that risk comes home to roost, we will be duly shamed. So let us avoid that. Let us get to work. Let us take advantage of the opening that the distinguished senior Senator from Alaska and the distinguished senior Senator from South Carolina have opened for us, and let us do what is right by our country and by the judgment that we can anticipate from history. I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. HOEVEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. ____________________",package_114_121.csv,173119,173119,173191,"[congressional record volume 161, number 14 (wednesday, january 28, 2015)] [senate] [pages

am ready for a good, long day and to process a bunch of amendments. i see the senate doing its work. i know we have important business before the senate. i know the judiciary committee is holding the hearing to listen to the comments from loretta lynch, who has been nominated to be attorney general. obviously these are very important issues the committee is discussing today. interspersed with all of that, we are going to be having a relatively long series of votes this afternoon, which makes it a little bit choppy and a little bit chaotic, but we have business to do in the senate. i am pleased we are at this point where i think we can honestly say we are looking at the final stretch in this discussion on the bipartisan, 60-sponsored bill to approve the keystone xl pipeline after more than 2,320 days of delay. at this point we are past that last call for amendments on the bill. we have spent a lot of time over the past couple of days negotiating which of the roughly 200 first-degree amendments that have been filed would come up for votes. we have a pretty good list. again, we have 18 of them that will be before us beginning this afternoon. there will be more we will be dealing with at a later point. but i do think this is significant. i was reading the newspaper this morning, and there is no shortage of critics out there, folks who would say the senate is broken and can't possibly be fixed. there was an article from an opinion writer which stated: within the midst of the keystone debate, mcconnell has had to retreat ``on his promise to allow freewheeling amendments.'' the article then goes on to state that yesterday not much of anything happened on the senate floor where the pipeline debate had stalled. in fairness, maybe the debate, in terms of processing amendments on the floor, had stalled out yesterday, but that did not mean there were not significant and serious negotiations going on between the majority and the minority about how we would proceed. sometimes when someone tunes in and the senate is in a quorum call, they think nothing is happening. they think the business of the senate is not being conducted. i need to assure not only colleagues but those who watch this process on c-span that in fact there is still good business being done. i think that is what has resulted in our opportunity this afternoon to take up some 18 different amendments. there are amendments that are all across the board; 10 of the 18 pending amendments are from colleagues on the other side of the aisle. i think we are certainly being very generous in terms of what is out there. we are trying to ensure that members who want a vote can have them. again, keep in mind, with a couple hundred amendments that come forward, we are going to have a lot of duplication. we are going to have issues people may want to make a statement about but might not necessarily want to ask for a vote on. but those that we have in front of us today--everything from issues relating to solar energy to lng exports, to further discussion about climate change, wilderness, wind tax credits, the land and water conservation fund--are truly all over the map. when it is suggested that somehow or other senator mcconnell as the majority leader is moving back from his commitment to allow for an open amendment process, so-called freewheeling amendments, i don't think a whole picture of what is happening on the senate floor is being painted. in fact it is a very open and considerable process. i made mention last week that we broke the records. we blew the top off in terms of the number of amendments we were actually able to process on the senate floor. we moved through 24 amendments on this bill since the time we started it. twenty-four amendments is pretty considerable, considering that in all of 2014 there were just 15 amendments that were considered the entire year. in fact, on thursday alone we processed 15. if we do 18, as is on the roster today, that is pretty significant. i feel good about the point we are at. it is not just because we are churning through amendments, it is because of what the ranking member and i have been able to do as the floor managers on this bill, kind of working back and forth. yes, sometimes it is tedious. yes, sometimes it is frustrating. yes, sometimes members wish they had more time to talk or there were more hours in our day to process all of this, [[page s557]] but at some point in time i think we have to recognize when we spend 3 weeks on a bill, that is pretty considerable. when we are able to move 50 amendments--close to 50 amendments is where we may be at the end of this legislation and processing--that is of note. what i appreciate is we are here this morning getting ready to kick off a long afternoon of votes and go back and forth with members and disruption of their schedules and committee meetings and the inconvenience that causes. but again this is part of what happens around here. it is not a very tightly scheduled environment because we just have so much that is going on. but being able to move forward on this important legislation is good and necessary. i think we are setting the stage for the balance of this congress-- under the leadership of the senator from kentucky, the majority leader, a commitment to have wholesome debate--to have the opportunity for a process that is not only good for republicans, it is good for democrats. it is good for the senate and for the united states. amendment no. 166 i want to quickly mention an amendment i will have up later this afternoon. this is amendment no. 166. i spoke very briefly to it yesterday when i called it up. but it would require wilderness study areas to be released if congress has not officially designated them as wilderness within one calendar year. right now what happens is that when a wilderness study area is designated, it can sit out there on the books almost indefinitely. there have been areas that have been sitting out there without congressional action for a couple of decades. i don't think this was the point of the process. but i would suggest the amendment i have advanced is a critical one to our western states, certainly to my state of alaska. again, the news on sunday of the president moving toward a wilderness designation of all of anwr--with the exception of a very small slice but all of anwr--all 19 million acres in addition to the 1002 area, the 1.57 million acres that have been specifically designated by congress for further review and study. right now there are 528 wilderness study areas throughout alaska and the other 11 western states. again, these designations have been made by over time by one administration or another. the next step forward in this process is that congress needs to act, but congress hasn't acted. we have had some of these that have been pending since the 1980s. again, as i suggested yesterday, if we have had something pending for 20, 30 years, i think that is plenty of time to say that congress has had to review those areas. even though we have not turned these into wilderness--in other words, even though congress has not acted to designate these areas as wilderness, what happens to them? they are treated and managed as if they are wilderness. effectively, we have de facto wilderness. the law requires that only congress determines whether an area is designated as wilderness. but what has happened is just kind of a lag, a lull, if you will, so they don't even need the congressional designation if in fact it is already being managed as wilderness. we look at the intent behind this. it is clear it was never intended to be this way. we were never supposed to have millions of acres of de facto agency-decided wilderness around the western united states. we routinely pass public lands legislation into law. i would like to know we could do it a little more often. as recently as last month, it actually has included new wilderness. so we are not saying that in other areas these wilderness study areas don't get officially designated. there is that process, and we demonstrated that just during the lameduck here. but in the instances where congress has decided not to act on wilderness study areas, agencies need to start looking at what that broader array of options is for managing the land, whatever that multiple use designation might be. they need to be looking at this critically with the local people in the area and with the other stakeholders who are involved in the planning process, but clearly they are not doing that on their own. so what my amendment would do is essentially provide a 1-year timeframe for wilderness designations to be made. i think, again, that is more than enough time for congress to consider debate and approve legislation for any area with wide support for a wilderness designation, so we will see that amendment this afternoon. i know the senator from washington was on her way, coming from a committee meeting this morning, and had intended to speak. i see senator udall is also on the floor. i yield to the senator from new mexico if he wishes to speak at this time before senator cantwell comes to the floor. i suggest the absence of a quorum. the presiding officer (mr. sullivan). the clerk will call the roll. the bill clerk proceeded to call the roll. mr. peters. i ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. the presiding officer. without objection, it is so ordered. amendment no. 55 mr. peters. mr. president, i rise today to discuss my amendment that was made pending by my friend and the ranking member of the energy and natural resources committee, the senator from washington, ms. cantwell. the amendment i have offered, amendment no. 55, is a simple, commonsense amendment. it requires the environmental protection agency to complete a study on the potential environmental and health impact of byproducts from tar sands oil that would be transported across our country by the keystone xl pipeline. one of these byproducts of tar sands oil is a black, powdery substance known as petroleum coke or petcoke. it is a residual from this tar sands oil and large amounts of it are produced in the refining process. in fact, it is estimated basically for every barrel of oil we get from tar sands, one-third of the material is this dark substance called petcoke. if we are transporting an awful lot of oil through the keystone pipeline, it naturally follows that we are going to get massive amounts of this petcoke. i have had an experience with this petcoke in my previous house district in the city of detroit, where we had petcoke from the refining process of this tar sands oil being piled up along the detroit river. we had a pile there that was at some times several stories high, a city block long. it was stored along the river in an uncontained fashion. it was blowing into people's homes, it was blowing into businesses, and it was also draining into the great lakes watershed. it caused all sorts of problems. i had complaints from constituents who talked about this substance going into their homes. i had businesses talking about--for example, restaurants in the area--their wait staff getting respiratory problems as a result of breathing this in. in fact, we had a video to explain how problematic it can be. i had a video taken by a canadian resident across the detroit river that showed the petcoke piles. with some wind blowing, a massive black dust cloud was blowing off of these petcoke piles. in the distance you could see the ambassador bridge, which is the bridge that connects canada to the united states. the dust was so thick and so black it obscured the bridge as it was blowing into the neighborhoods, into the river, and then into canada. it is a completely unacceptable situation, which is why i believe it is important as we move forward with this legislation that we have a couple of studies. one, we need to understand what are those environmental and health risks associated with petcoke. it is clear this is particulate matter, and if it is not contained, it gets into people's lungs and creates a dust layer throughout communities. it is very important as well in the study not only to study the environmental and health impacts, but what are the best practices to handle this material. with the massive amount of tar sands oil that will come through the keystone, we will also get massive amounts of petcoke, a substance that has been problematic not only in detroit, but it has been problematic in the city of chicago and other places across the country. [[page s558]] so i believe it is very important that we get these kinds of information as this project moves forward, and it is certainly my hope that we can assure that what happened in detroit, what is happening in chicago and other places across this country doesn't happen, that we understand what this substance is, and we understand what those best practices are to handle and to transport this material safely. i urge my colleagues to support amendment no. 55. i suggest the absence of a quorum. the presiding officer. the clerk will call the roll. the bill clerk proceeded to call the roll. ms. murkowski. mr. president, i ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. the presiding officer. without objection, it is so ordered. amendment no. 166 ms. murkowski. mr. president, i am glad the junior senator from alaska is in the chair because i am going to be discussing things that are of great concern to alaskans and really to those who care about the rule of law here and how it applies throughout all 50 states fairly and evenly. as i mentioned just a bit ago, i have offered an amendment that would deal with how wilderness study areas are treated. my proposal is one that would put a time limitation on these study areas. i mentioned the amendment was precipitated by the president's announcement this weekend about additional areas of wilderness to be designated in alaska. i have cited two. the 1980 lands bill, anilca--i think it is good for us to have a little bit of a refresher on what anilca actually did. in one fell swoop anilca designated nearly 60 million acres of wilderness in the state of alaska. that is pretty substantial. it was more than any other president had ever designated at any other time prior to that. what we have seen since then, with the designation of wilderness, is there has been this fight going back and forth. there have been areas that have been requested for wilderness study areas. but this administration has really taken it a major step forward. on sunday the president recommended that an additional 12.3 million acres within the arctic national wildlife refuge be designated as wilderness--so an additional 12.3 million acres on top of the 60 million acres that we already have as wilderness in alaska after anilca. this action by the president means that these 12.3 million acres will immediately be managed as wilderness. as i have mentioned, right now there is no deadline or expiration for this designation. even if congress fails to act--and i am going to make darn certain we do not act on this wilderness proposal the president has advanced--these acres are being managed as wilderness. let me just show colleagues what it means for us right now. the small map of alaska is up there in the corner. it is kind of unfair because it needs to be a much bigger map to get the context. effectively, what the president is proposing is that in addition to the 7.16 million acres of wilderness that currently exist in the anwr area--and the anwr area is a big refuge, a big designation. a little over 7 million acres have already been designated as wilderness. that was done back in 1980. but what he is proposing now is effectively taking the whole balance of the refuge area and making wilderness out of that as well--so 12.3 million acres. now, keep in mind this also includes the 1002 area up on the northern part of anwr. that is the area right, which was specifically designated by congress for further study of its oil and gas potential. back in 1980, when the wilderness designation was made for the one area--7 million acres of it--it was determined that refuge status would be afforded the balance of the area, and then the 1002 would be reserved-- reserved deliberately for study of its oil and gas potential. that 1980 act was pretty clear in terms of the bargain that had taken place. i am going to read for the record the provision in the law that we refer to as the ``no more'' clause. it states: this act provides sufficient protection for the national interest in the scenic, natural, cultural and environmental values on the public lands in alaska, and at the same time provides adequate opportunity for satisfaction of the economic and social needs of the state of alaska and its people; accordingly, the designation and disposition of the public lands in alaska pursuant to this act are found to represent a proper balance between the reservation of national conservation system units and those public lands necessary and appropriate for more intensive use and disposition, and thus congress believes that the need for future legislation designating new conservation system units, new national conservation areas, or new national recreation areas, has been obviated thereby. the act goes on to state that ``no further studies of federal lands in the state of alaska for the single purpose of considering the establishment of a conservation system unit, national recreation area, national conservation area, or for related or similar purposes shall be conducted unless authorized by the congress.'' so the president is basically choosing to ignore the law as set out in anilca--the agreement that alaska has contributed mightily with its share of wilderness. i remind my colleagues that more than one-half of the wilderness in the entire united states of america is in the state of alaska. thus we wrote the law back in 1980 that says no more out of alaska. they found that balance. well, this president is tipping that balance. the coastal plain holds an estimated 10.4 billion barrels of oil. i mentioned yesterday that if we can tap into these resources, we could see 1 million barrels a day coming down our trans-alaska pipeline for nearly 30 years. think about what that would mean, mr. president--1 million barrels a day filling up that trans-alaska pipeline that is now less than half full, an additional 1 million barrels a day coming into this country. right now, americans are enjoying the lower prices of oil. but the president said: don't get used to these low prices because they may go up. well, they do not have to go up if we can provide more. if we can increase production in this country, we can theoretically decrease that cost. but we have to be allowed to access that. think about the source of good-paying jobs, energy security, billions of dollars in new federal revenues. the energy security part of it is keenly important, but let us also think about the positive national security implications of energy produced in the united states. when we are producing more energy in this country and relying less on others, we are less vulnerable. we have greater ability to deal with hostile nations. sanctions work better when we don't need to rely on that same oil that some of these nations would like to free up for other countries. from a national security perspective, this is huge. this is where the intersection with the keystone pipeline is so interesting: that at the same time this administration has issued this wilderness study it is also fighting so hard to keep us from building the keystone xl pipeline, which would allow us to get crude from our friend and neighbor to the north and utilize it to our benefit. the president is saying: no, i don't want to do that. i guess he would much rather receive it from venezuela or wherever. he says he wants brazil to be our big trading partner when it comes to oil. hello. canada--they share a border. they are our friend. they are our closest friend, our strongest trading partner. are we going to shut down such an opportunity as that? and: oh, by the way, that same week let's just go ahead and take off the table permanently one of the greatest reservoirs of crude we have here in the united states next. let's just take that off the table, too. what does that say? what does that say to other countries? that we don't care about our own energy security? i care about our energy security, and i care about our national security. again, it stuns me to think that what the president is proposing here is a measure that would take off limits permanently our ability as a nation to access the 1002 area to safely develop this enormous potential. keep in mind, we are not talking about accessing the full 1.5 million acres in the 1002. the legislation that has been before this senate, back in 1995 and 2005, asked to open up 2,000 acres--2,000 acres--out of 19.5 million acres in the whole refuge. the presiding officer knows alaskans can do this safely. we have set and met the highest environmental standards in the world. we do it every [[page s559]] day. our pipeline, our amazing 800-mile pipeline, has a decades-long record of responsible production. it has carried nearly 17 billion barrels of oil safely across our state, over 2 mountain ranges, multiple rivers, in areas where we are known to have a few earthquakes. it is an engineering marvel. it has served our state and our country well. but instead of recognizing this unparalleled opportunity that we have, we are now facing a mounting lockdown of our resource potential. and the presiding officer knows the worst part is, it is not just anwr we are talking about. our offshore oil reserves are now also going to be restricted. just yesterday the president announced he was indefinitely withdrawing 9.8 million acres in the beaufort and the chukchi seas from leasing. so now anwr is going to be locked up, as well as the beaufort and chukchi seas. i don't have a map of these areas that have been taken off limits, but i can tell you that it is an area of roughly 9.8 million acres. there is some real question that i have in my mind. after reading the interior's press release, i don't have any real comfort that the two sales that are being proposed--one in the beaufort and one in the chukchi--will actually stay on schedule. the secretary of the interior is quoted saying that: interior will continue to consider oil and gas exploration in the arctic. it is not a very firm commitment, as far as i can see. but when we look at it altogether--between the anwr wilderness designation and the arctic offshore withdrawal--alaska has lost more than 22 million acres of land and water where energy could be produced for the good of this country, and it has happened in less than 1 week. it has happened over a span of 3 days--22 million acres. so what is 22 million acres? it is an area about 563 times larger than where we are here in the district of columbia. it is about 28 rhode islands. i know rhode island is a small state by comparison, but 28 of them adds up. it is about 4.5 times the size of the state of massachusetts. again, this is just to give you an idea of what was taken off limits, indefinitely, by this administration since sunday. my reaction to all this has been pretty strong. i think it is pretty obvious to anybody who would take a moment to think about it, but i am amazed our president can look at alaska and think, this is what we need most right now. we are facing a pretty significant budget shortfall. i know our governor has spoken to the president and the secretary of interior about alaska's situation. then this is what he gets as a ``we will work with you''? i don't think so. this is not an indication of a federal government that wants to work with the state to develop its resources. the governor asked the secretary of the interior for an address, because he said he needed to send an invoice for the lack of any economy alaska would be able to generate with these actions. the one thing--the one thing more than anything else that could help our state--is to be able to access our federal lands and our waters so that we can fill up the trans-alaska pipeline, so that we can not only help alaska but we can help the rest of the country. but that seems to be the one thing this president is intent on denying, whether it is in anwr, whether it is in our offshore, or whether it is in our national petroleum reserve, where this president basically unilaterally took off about half of that in terms of availability of access. i noted that when the president made his announcement on sunday, the video that went out showed beautiful pictures of the refuge area. again, this is a big area. this whole refuge is about the size of the state of south carolina. it is big and there are some amazing spaces--i am the first one to admit it, amazing spaces--just as there are all over alaska. but i watched that video as he was flying in his airplane to go to india, and i thought to myself: the president hasn't been to alaska, even though he says he only has three states left to see and alaska is not included. so i actually asked my staff to find out. by my count, the president has been to alaska three times during his administration. and he told me, before he was president, he had never been to alaska. so three times during his administration. all three times were basically to get fuel. and granted, to give him credit, on one of those times he did meet with the troops at elmendorf, but he never went off the base. the other two times were in the middle of the night for as long as it took to get fuel. in my mind, that is not visiting alaska. that is not trying to understand who we are. we have some pretty beautiful, wide-open skies. but when you are flying at 35,000, 45,000 feet looking down, that is not how you get a view of alaska. so outside of this short meet-and-greet, outside of a bargaining chip to gain support from national constituencies, he is basically viewing alaska as a refueling stop--which is no shortage of irony here in the fact that he is happy to refuel air force one in alaska, but he doesn't seem to want fuel produced in alaska. i can get pretty frustrated and upset about this. part of it is because so much of this comes without consultation with us, without listening to the vast majority of alaskans--as if, once again, we are nothing but a territory and the promises that were made to us at statehood mean nothing. i was born in the territory. it was not that long ago that alaskans knew what it meant to be kind of kicked around by folks on the outside. we didn't have a voice. we thought statehood was going to change that. we thought that statehood compact--the promises made that alaska would be able to deliver to its citizens based on the amazing resource wealth that we had--we thought that was going to count for something. apparently, not enough. i was a little bit surprised to read that the white house counselor, mr. podesta, thinks i have overreacted to these announcements and to others that i have been told may be coming--more to come--and he suggested my reaction is not warranted. i would ask any one of the other 99 senators here: think about how you would respond if the citizens of your state woke up to a message that we are going to take 12 million acres away from you and your potential to develop in your state; and then on tuesday, we are going to take away 9.8 million acres. but don't worry, we are the federal government, we are here to help. alaskans want to help themselves. we want to be able to exercise that independence, that free spirit that so many of us in alaska identify with. we want to help our neighbors, help our families. but this kind of help we don't need. don't lock us up. don't shut us out. it was suggested in mr. podesta's comments, and i saw it in other press reports, that somehow or other the interior department felt compelled to move forward with the timing of these announcements because we were ratcheting up on anwr. they suggested i had introduced a bill. i haven't introduced a bill. i do intend to introduce a bill. but to somehow suggest this was precipitated because the delegation is making a charge on anwr is, at this time, unwarranted. it did kind of make me wonder, maybe the white house isn't aware of how alaskans feel about this. so in the few minutes i want to take this morning i want to read a few of the quotes from our state leaders who have come out against this decision since they were announced, particularly as they relate to anwr. we have a new, independent governor. as i mentioned, he has already had the opportunity to meet with the president and talk about alaska's issues. again, he has also met with the secretary of interior to talk similarly. governor walker says he is ``angry, very angry, that this is happening.'' our state senate president, kevin meyer, said the following: the impact of this decision, if allowed to stand, will harm the future of our great state and will deal a devastating blow to our economy. i spoke with our house speaker, a gentleman by the name of mike chenault from the kenai peninsula, an area where we have oil and gas potential in the cook inlet. they know about oil and gas. the speaker said: the president just doesn't get it, or he does get it and doesn't care about the will and voice of alaskans. that's beyond offensive. [[page s560]] in response to the president's anwr announcement, speaker chenault also had some pretty choice words. he said: alaska's not a territory anymore and it's high time our federal overlords stopped trying to treat us like one. the arctic slope regional corporation, whose shareholders, people who actually live on the north slope, issued a press release stating that: we are staunchly opposed to this relentless and coordinated effort to designate the coastal plain of anwr as wilderness. this administration has deliberately ignored the input provided by the most affected people within anwr. colleagues, remember that when this president is suggesting that this area needs to be named or designated as wilderness, the 1002 area, people live there. people live their lives there--children go to school and people work there. they fly in and out. they have a little grocery store. they try to make an honest living there. they subsist, absolutely; but people live there. to quote from the arctic slope regional corporation, the corporation's shareholders who live there say, ``this administration has deliberately ignored the input provided by the most affected people within anwr.'' i think the reason they have ignored it is because they forget people actually live there. how can people live in a wilderness? democratic state representative ben nageak of barrow, who is an inupiat and born in kaktovik, who lives in the affected area, wrote this: president barack obama and his lieutenants at the interior department will permanently harm our people and all alaskans with his colonial attitude and decision making . . . it's terrifying to see the extent by which our pleas for time and a fair hearing of our views fall on deaf ears 5,000 miles away. that is a state representative born and raised in this area, an inupiat, who is saying 5,000 miles from here you are making decisions without listening to us, without listening to our people. our north slope borough mayor charlotte brower didn't mince any words, either. she said that ``these types of paternalistic, executive fiats seem to be more appropriate for andrew jackson's administration than barack obama's.'' pretty tough words. i am starting to think my words were pretty mild based on what i read from the mayor of the north slope borough and the democratic state representative from barrow. mayor brower has invited president obama and secretary jewell to visit the north slope, and she asked them to meet with the people who actually live there before proposing these types of sweeping land designations. if the president and the secretary actually accept that invitation, mayor brower concluded: they might learn that the inupiat people who have lived on and cared for these lands for millennia have no interest in living like relics in a giant open air museum. rather, they hope to have the same rights and privileges enjoyed by people across the rest of the country. that seems like a pretty fair request to me. even the new york times interviewed a few alaskans who didn't hide their feelings. one woman who said she had voted for the president twice said, ``he has just alienated an entire state.'' she described herself as being ``on the fence'' about anwr before the proposal, but she added, ``without talking to any of us, just doing it by fiat-- that's not how you lead.'' i think she summed it up pretty well. what the president has done, the way he has done it--it is unfair, uncalled for, and it is unwarranted. so for it to be suggested by the counselor from the white house that my response is somehow overreacting or unwarranted, i think they should start listening to all of the people of alaska. the presiding officer and myself were sent here to represent them and i think we are expressing pretty clearly where alaskans are coming from on this. this is wrong. it should not be tolerated. and we will not just sit back while this administration locks up our state and the potential of our people. we have a lot more we will be discussing about this. again, i mentioned on monday that there was a trifecta with what we see coming out of this administration. i have been told by the secretary that we would see his anwr designation and that we would then see the 5-year lease sale that would take areas that had been in deferred status and completely withdraw them for an indefinite period of time, and that there would be a third announcement coming relating to the national petroleum reserve--the area where folks who said don't go to anwr, go to npra, go to the national petroleum reserve. so the first company that tried to do so is trying to make it happen. what this administration is doing with the mitigation costs they are laying in front of them, the company will determine whether it is going to be economic. but my fear is that will be the third kick to alaska. so it has been a bad week, a bad week for alaska. but you know what, we are not people who are deterred by bad news, by bad weather. we have a way to roll with it. i was looking at the front page of the fairbanks daily news-miner yesterday. they had a little recap of what is going on with the weather. it is about 52 below zero in fort yukon and 51 below in fort greely where we base our ground-based missile defense system. we are pretty proud of what we do. we can still provide for the defense and protection of this country and do it in some pretty cold weather. in fairbanks, where i went to high school, i think the weather this morning was 47 degrees below zero, but the kids still go to school in this kind of weather. we are doing what we do up north. it is not easy, but it is an amazing place and the people there are pretty resilient. we have been kicked this week, but that doesn't mean we are down. it means we are just getting started. with that, i will have more to say about the process in front of us this afternoon, where we are with keystone; but again, i am pleased that we have a good series of votes to keep us busy this afternoon, and i appreciate the indulgence of colleagues as we go through a process that can be very disruptive as they are trying to meet with constituents and pursue committee business. but i think we recognize that we want to be on a path toward completion of this bill, and i thank them for their cooperation. with that, i yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum. the presiding officer. the clerk will call the roll. the bill clerk proceeded to call the roll. mrs. fischer. mr. president, i ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. the presiding officer (mr. sasse). without objection, it is so ordered. unfunded mandates information and transparency act mrs. fischer. mr. president, last week my colleague senator lankford and i introduced the unfunded mandates information and transparency act--a bill to enhance transparency about the true costs of burdensome federal regulations affecting our states and localities. twenty years ago the unfunded mandates reform act, otherwise known as umra, was signed into law to reduce the burden of federal mandates on state and local governments, as well as the private sector. the statute was intended to fix a simple problem while promoting informed decisions by this congress. but since umra's enactment in 1995, many remain concerned that the law has fallen short. in nebraska and all across america, our constituents continue to face a growing mountain of redtape that stifles economic growth and holds back progress on a number of fronts. in 2011 alone the government accountability office identified 14 different loopholes that would allow government agencies to avoid conducting the umra analysis. in other words, redtape has survived and prospered. by their very nature, federal mandates are both complex and vague, which is why i have introduced a new bill to fix these shortcomings and increase accountability. my bill, known as the unfunded mandates and information transparency act, would address umra's loopholes by mandating stricter agency requirements, enhance stakeholder input, and strengthen enforcement mechanisms. furthermore, this bill has the power to get the job done. it would allow judges to place a stay on a regulation or invalidate a rule if a federal agency fails to complete the required umra [[page s561]] analysis. it would also close a glaring loophole used by agencies to skirt umra requirements. last but not least, my bill would expand the scope of reporting requirements to include regulations imposed by independent regulatory agencies, such as the epa. i know many nebraskans are deeply concerned about the effects of new epa requirements, such as the proposed water rule--a rule i have forcefully fought since it was first proposed. nebraskans already go to great lengths to protect and preserve water resources within our state, but now the epa is going overboard with this new proposal--one that represents a massive federal power grab and clear disconnect with main street america. i share the belief of many nebraskans that the federal government should be held responsible for the rules it puts into place. by clearly notifying taxpayers of the costs of each mandate, which the bill i introduced would require, we can better hold the federal government accountable for the economic impact of its costly regulations. i hope my colleagues on both sides of the aisle will join me in supporting this simple, commonsense legislation to help bring greater accountability and transparency to washington. i thank the presiding officer and suggest the absence of a quorum. the presiding officer. the clerk will call the roll. the bill clerk proceeded to call the roll. mr. hoeven. mr. president, i ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. the presiding officer. without objection, it is so ordered. mr. hoeven. mr. president, i return to the floor today to discuss the legislation under consideration. as i did yesterday, i wish to begin by again thanking both the senator from alaska on our side of the aisle and the senator from washington on the other side of the aisle, who are the bill managers--the legislation managers in this case--of the keystone xl pipeline approval legislation that i put forward along with senator manchin. i wish to begin by thanking both of the managers for their diligence and for their bipartisanship and for working together to advance this legislation, but i also want to make sure all of the members of this body get a chance to bring their amendments forward, debate those amendments, and have a vote. this afternoon we have scheduled 18 votes, and that is great. some of those amendments i support; some i oppose. but we are going to do what this body is supposed to do and what the american people elected us to do, and that is to have this discussion and then vote. we are working to advance energy policy for this country that can not only truly help create more energy, jobs, and economic growth but also really address the national security implications of making our country energy secure. by that, i mean producing more energy than we consume and working with canada, our friend and ally, to do that so that we don't have to depend on opec to do that and on parts of the world where there is great instability and where our interests are not aligned with the interests of some of those countries. also, it enables us to actually weaken some of our opponents that are petro-dependent, countries such as iran, which is now trying to build a nuclear weapon, as well as, right now, russia, which is invading its neighbor ukraine, one of our allies, where we are trying to stop the adventurism of president putin. by truly becoming energy secure, by providing more supply of energy, we not only benefit every american at the pump--americans are saving billions of dollars when they pull up to the pump. that is not only good for american consumers, it is good for our small businesses. energy is a foundational industry that strengthens every other industry out there. it makes us more competitive in the global economy across the board. as i say, it weakens some of our opponents. so that is really the debate in which we are engaged. yesterday i started to respond to some of the critics who oppose this legislation on the basis of saying this is a project for canada and not for the united states, and that is not true at all. this pipeline would not only move crude from canada to our refineries, it would also move crude from production in the united states, including in my state of north dakota, which now produces 1.2 million barrels of oil a day-- second only to texas--as well as montana. so it also moves domestic crude to our refineries as well. furthermore, it really is about making our nation energy secure, working with canada to become energy secure so we don't have to depend on opec. that is very much a national interest issue for this country, for this nation, and for all americans. i spoke about that a little bit yesterday. the second issue i would like to address is some of the environmental issues. i started to do that yesterday, but i deferred at that time because anytime we can get people to come to the floor to offer their amendments and make them pending, that is what we want to do. at that point we started getting people to come offer their amendments, and the bill managers, through their hard work, were able to get agreement, and we now have 18 amendments pending on a precloture basis. so we have made real progress in getting everyone involved and hopefully building more bipartisan consensus and getting on the energy debate the american people want and getting to a result where we can actually produce legislation that will help our nation. so i started to get into the second point i wanted to discuss, which is some of the environmental aspects of the oil sands development and how technology is being deployed, with hundreds of millions of private dollars invested in new technologies that are not only producing more energy but doing it with a smaller environmental footprint. that helps to reduce the greenhouse gas emissions of oil that is produced in the oil sands. there are two projects i wish to speak about to give examples of how, if we continue to work to empower this kind of investment in new technologies, we get not only more energy more cost-effectively and more dependably but we also get it with environmental stewardship. the first project i will speak about is a project that has been undertaken in the oil sands in alberta, canada. going back to this earlier chart, we can see that it is up in the hardisty area, and this second chart is a picture of the project. it is one that is undertaken by the shell oil company. it is called their quest project. i will read a little bit about the project. shell canada will this year complete the world's first oil sands carbon capture and storage project. this is ccs--carbon capture and storage--something we have been working to develop in this country and apply to fossil fuels, not only things such as oil and gas but also coal. this is the new carbon capture technology. they will complete the world's first project. continuing: the project, called quest, will begin permanently storing co 2 by the end of the year and will permanently store more than 1 million tons per year. let me read that again. the project, called quest, will begin permanently storing co 2 by the end of the year and will permanently store more than 1 million tons per year. quest reduces the emissions from shell's upgrader by 35 percent--that's the equivalent of taking 175,000 cars off the road each year. shell will transport the co 2 50 miles north via pipeline and permanently store it more than a mile below ground under impermeable rock formations. my point is that here is an example of where a private company is working with the province of alberta on this project to invest hundreds of millions of dollars in carbon capture and storage technology that will not only apply to the oil sands, but--think about it--this is also technology that is not only being developed but deployed on a commercial scale in production that we can now take advantage of and use in this country to produce more energy from multiple sources-- again, smaller footprint, lower greenhouse gas. isn't that the solution to better environmental stewardship where we get more energy that we produce here with our closest friends and allies, with better stewardship through investment by private companies in these new technologies and, in this case, working with alberta? alberta is also investing in this technology, but this is the innovation of our country, of our companies. this is the kind of ingenuity and [[page s562]] innovation that helps us build the kind of future we want. in this case, it is a secure energy future by deploying these new technologies. the other point i will make as we look at this chart is that under the old system of oil sand production--remember, it is excavation, so they would be digging up this area and then extracting the oil from the oil sands. but under this new system of development, which is called in situ, they are actually drilling wells, and then they put steam down the hole to bring the oil up, and then they capture the co 2 and store it underground, so smaller environmental footprint and lower greenhouse gas emissions. since 1990 the greenhouse gas emissions on a per-barrel basis for oil sands production has gone down by 28 percent. so they have reduced it by almost a third. these new technologies will reduce it further going forward. this is about finding good solutions to create jobs and economic activity and energy security and take us into the future. that is why i wanted to discuss that project for just a minute. a second project i will reference is exxon's kearl project, spelled k-e-a-r-l. just by way of preface, exxon currently produces over 100,000 barrels of oil a day in the canadian oil sands. they are going to increase that amount this year to 345,000 barrels a day. their objective is to get to half a million barrels a day of oil produced in the canadian oil sands. they are investing $10 billion in this project. that is their investment in this project and these new, better drilling techniques. let me tell my colleagues a little bit about their project. exxon is doing it differently than shell and quest. they are employing different technologies but investing $10 billion to reduce the environmental footprint, to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, but produce a lot of energy for canada and for our country. exxon's kearl project will use cogeneration for steam, which a low- energy extraction process to recover oil, and heat integration between the extraction and treatment facilities to minimize energy consumption. as a result, oil produced from kearl will have about the same life- cycle greenhouse gas emissions as many other crude oils refined in the united states as a result of technologies which significantly enhance environmental performance--again, smaller environmental footprint, lower greenhouse gas emissions. this is how we work to address the challenges we face, whether it is producing energy or anything else. we deploy these new technologies that enable us to do it better. other environmental innovations for kearl include onsite water storage to eliminate river withdrawals in low-flow periods and progressive land reclamation, which will return the land to the boreal forest. i wish to emphasize that for a minute. what we see around this site, which is actually the shell site--this is the boreal forest. i have been to hardisty, and i have seen the oil sands production. i was also taken out to areas where they had reclaimed land that had been formerly used to produce oil sands. now we can't tell the difference between the land that has been reclaimed and the land that hadn't ever been used in terms of oil production. i was there and i looked at both and i couldn't tell the difference. of course, that is subjective. you want to return it to the state it was in before it was tapped. with this newer production, there is a much smaller area that we would ultimately have to return to its original state. i wanted to touch on those two projects for a few minutes as well as point out that the alberta government actually requires that all land used in the development of oil sands has to be returned to the same or equivalent condition when it is no longer in use. the final point i wish to touch on for just a minute or two is another issue that has been brought up, which is pipeline safety. there have been some references to recent pipeline spills--one in poplar, mt, actually not too far from where i live in western north dakota. but the spill is from what is called the poplar pipeline, which i believe is owned by the bridger company. it is a pipeline that goes underneath the yellowstone river. it was built in the 1950s, so we are talking about a pipeline that is over 50 years old. isn't that just the point, that whether it is roads or bridges or buildings or pipelines or transmission lines or anything else, we have to make the investment in new facilities rather than just continuing to rely on old facilities? that is what i want to emphasize about the keystone xl pipeline project. this is an investment of $8 billion, not a penny of government investment but $8 billion in private investment in new steel and new technologies. also, the department of transportation's pipeline and hazardous material safety administration--phmsa--the division of the department of transportation that oversees pipeline safety, has required 57 special conditions for this pipeline to make sure it is as safe as possible. i am going to touch on some of those to give a sense of what they are. the whole point is that here we are trying to create a business climate, a business environment where companies can put billions of dollars into these new technologies and this new infrastructure so that we can have energy as safely as possible, with the best stewardship possible, so we aren't relying on pipelines or other infrastructure that is more than 50 years old. we are trying to get that upgrade. we are not doing it at taxpayer expense. we are getting tax revenues. we will get hundreds of millions of tax revenues that will come back in from private sector projects where we are trying to empower that investment. at the same time, the phmsa, the department of transportation pipeline and hazardous materials safety administration, has all these requirements that they are making part of the approval process--57 different special safety conditions for the keystone xl pipeline. they are conditions such as puncture resistance. for example, transcanada is required by phmsa in the environmental impact statement to ensure that the steel used in the pipeline can withstand impact from a 65-ton excavator with 3\1/2\-inch teeth. there is corrosion resistance coating, making sure it has a coating on it that is resistant to corrosion. there is cathodic protection. cathodic protection is applied to a pipe so where it connects to other--it could be structures such as a bridge. it could be any place where the pipes are connected to make sure those other connections don't rust through into the pipe. for maintenance, transcanada must submit certification that demonstrates compliance with all 57 conditions before they commence operation of the pipe. airplanes will patrol the right of away at least 26 times a year. they will send cleaning and inspection tools through the pipeline once a year to collect and analyze basic sediment and water. compare all of this to a pipeline that was built 50 years ago and laid on the floor of a river--versus a pipeline now, where if they have to cross a river, they use directional drilling. so they go down 25 feet below the river and put the pipe 25 feet down in the rock below the river, versus older pipelines that were just laid in there. again, this is the new technology--the new safeguards. in horizontal drilling and directional drilling the pipe will be buried approximately 25 feet below riverbeds. so if there any riverbeds that cross, that is 25 feet below using directional drilling. there are automatic shutoff valves. so they will have automatic shutoff valves and they will be placed every 20 miles along the pipeline route. extra miles will also be placed where there are protected water crossing and other areas of higher consequence. they can be closed remotely on either side of the line, isolating a damaged area within minutes of detection. again, it is about making sure if there is an issue of any kind, that you can minimize and mitigate any kind of spill. with 100 percent weld inspections, there is a requirement that 100 percent of welds are inspected rather than just some of the welds under a test basis. with satellite monitoring and leak detection, keystone xl will have more than 13,500 sensors feeding constant and detailed information about flow rates to the control center 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. that is so that if any kind of a leak is detected, it is immediately shut down so you minimize the amount of product that would leak. [[page s563]] those are the kinds of safety features--and there are 57 of them-- required by the administration's pipeline and hazardous material safety administration. when we talk about pipeline safety and somebody comes in and says there is this pipe that broke so we should never have another pipe, we need to talk about that and address that in a sensible way. we have over 2 million miles of pipe in this country. the point is we do need to build new pipelines and upgrade them and take other steps to make sure the system is safe. but you don't do that by blocking investment in the new technologies and the new pipeline that will help us move product more safely, more cost-effectively, and more dependably. those are the three issues i wanted to address. again, i covered some of them yesterday, but i wanted to make sure that any time we had somebody coming down to offer amendments, we deferred to those individuals. i am pleased now we have 18 amendments pending on a whole gamut of issues related to this project, to this energy discussion, and to our efforts to advance a better energy future for our country. again, i look forward to the debate this afternoon, to voting on these amendments, and to continuing to advance this legislation on behalf of the american people. i yield the floor, and i suggest the absence of a quorum. the presiding officer. the clerk will call the roll. the bill clerk proceeded to call the roll. mrs. murray. i ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. the presiding officer (mr. perdue). without objection, it is so ordered. mrs. murray. mr. president, i ask unanimous consent to speak as in morning business. the presiding officer. without objection, it is so ordered. department of homeland security funding mrs. murray. mr. president, i wish to take a few minutes to talk about the latest attempt by the republicans in the house of representatives--and a few republicans in the senate as well--to hold hostage the basic operation of our government, once again, over politics. while i have several issues with the department of homeland security funding bill that the house has sent to us, i will first discuss this strategy we are seeing from republicans, as the former chair of the budget committee and as someone who has worked across the aisle to break through gridlock in congress. two years ago our country was moving constantly from one manufactured crisis to the next. we had debt limit scares that were rattling our businesses and the markets, we were headed toward an absurd and unnecessary government shutdown, and people across the country were losing faith that their elected officials could get anything done when it came to the budget and to our economy. but by working together, congressman paul ryan and i were able to reach a budget deal that prevented another government shutdown and showed the american people that congress could work together to get things done. because of that deal we were able to then pass bipartisan spending bills for the past 2 fiscal years, including 11 of the 12 appropriations bills from last year. although we have a lot of work to do, it is clear that stability in the federal budget makes a difference for our economy. we have to work together to build on that growth, to continue that certainty, and to make sure our economy is working for all families, not only the wealthiest few. across the country, businesses have added more than 11 million new jobs--over 58 straight months of job growth. the unemployment rate is now under 6 percent and trending downward, and we have reduced the federal budget deficit by over two-thirds since 2009. so when i look at the homeland security funding bill that the house of representatives has now sent to us, i see a few things. i see a bill--the way it is drafted and was sent to us will tear apart families who are working hard to make it in america. i see a bill that will put our security at risk, and i see a bill that seriously threatens all of the work we have done recently, republicans and democrats, to keep our government functioning because the bill the house has sent over is simply unacceptable. it will not pass the senate. republicans know that. let's be clear about what this bill is, it is a calculated, political gamble from our republican colleagues. this looming showdown over funding the department of homeland security is no accident. in fact, it is actually a risk they have been planning since last year all because of political pressure from the extreme anti-immigration right wing of their party. if republicans are willing to risk funding for the department of homeland security for political reasons, i believe the american people deserve to know exactly what that does mean because funding the department of homeland security doesn't only keep the lights on the dhs headquarters, that funding protects our country from terrorist attacks at a time when the world is as dangerous and volatile as ever. it protects our country and american businesses from cyber attacks, a threat that is all too real as we have now seen in recent months. it supports basic security measures at our airports, at our seaports, and along the border. it even supports our federal emergency management resources that are on call for every community in america. in my home state of washington, this funding supports the coast guard, which protects shippers and sailors throughout puget sound, and customs and border protection, which helps facilitate billions in international trade moving through my state, the most trade-dependent state in the country. not funding these programs is a risk we cannot afford to take. it is reckless and irresponsible and, more than anything else, simply counterproductive for republicans to put all of this on the line just to score some political points with the tea party and the far right. unfortunately that appears exactly to be what they are doing. once again speaker boehner and the house republicans have decided they are willing to break up millions of families and deport millions of dreamers who are victims themselves of a broken system. they have decided they are willing to stop the president's policy of focusing our law enforcement on national security threats, gang members, and violent criminals. once again they have decided they are willing to make bipartisan, comprehensive immigration reform that much more difficult to achieve. this is much more than only an annual funding bill. this legislation is a message which has been sent to us loud and clear from house republicans and speaker boehner that they are willing to continue pushing us from crisis to crisis. they are willing to play politics with our national security, and they are willing to turn their backs on millions and millions of children and families. for years now we have seen that strategy doesn't work--it doesn't work. it holds us back. but i have to say i was encouraged when majority leader mcconnell said that at the end of the day the senate will fund the department of homeland security. it is clear the house bill will not pass the senate, so i truly believe it is time for the majority leader to show, as he has promised, that he will let the senate and congress work efficiently. it is time for the majority leader to bring a clean dhs appropriations bill to the floor. let's get it done, passed, and move on to the work that is so important to us. i yield the floor, and i suggest the absence of a quorum. the presiding officer. the clerk will call the roll. the assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. mr. schumer. i ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. the presiding officer. without objection, it is so ordered. mr. schumer. mr. president, i rise to urge my republican colleagues to pass a clean bill to fund the department of homeland security for the remainder of the fiscal year. we are now only 1 month away from a shutdown of the principal federal agency charged with keeping americans safe from terrorism and prepared for natural disasters. [[page s564]] the president has said he will veto any funding bill that repeals or rolls back his executive order on immigration, so anything but a clean bill to fund dhs means one thing and one thing alone. republicans are unilaterally shutting down the agency. no matter what your grievance is, we shouldn't be playing politics with national security. it is alarming that even as we can now count the days, 30, until a republican security shutdown, so many on the hard right are ready to just dismiss the consequences. compared to their obsession with president obama's immigration action and their desire to appease the tea party with radical and practical ideas that would not fix our system, to republicans shutting down dhs is ``not the end of the world.'' so i will use my time to spell out what a dhs shutdown would mean for our country in the hopes that our republican colleagues will be jolted back to reality and to common sense. since this isn't the first time republicans have put us through a shutdown, we actually have a very good idea as to what a dhs shutdown would look like. here are just some of the functions that would cease if republicans failed to put a clean bill on the floor: the bulk of dhs management and headquarter administrative support activities would cease, including much of the homeland security infrastructure that was built during the 9/11 terrorist attacks to improve command, control, and coordination of disparate frontline activities. securing the cities, a critical post-9/ 11 funding program that helps pay for nuclear detection capabilities in new york city, los angeles, and washington, dc, could not be awarded in fiscal year 2015. the dhs nuclear detection office, which since 9/11 coordinates on a daily or weekly basis with local law enforcement, will stop operating. fema's disaster preparedness unit would cease coordinating regular training activities for law enforcement for weapons of mass destruction events. fema employees in washington and across the country who provide critical preparedness resources to local first responders would be sent home. twenty-five percent of fema's headquarters and regional staff would be furloughed. fema personnel working on grants programs, such as funds for intelligence analysts or firefighter needs, would be furloughed, and even those personnel deemed essential would be denied paychecks until a funding bill is passed. this means we are not paying the coast guard, we are not paying the tsa, we are not paying the border patrol, the secret service or fema aid workers. so make no mistake, a dhs shutdown would hamstring our ability to combat threats to the homeland and to keep our citizens safe. the irony of course is that one of the programs that shutdown would close completely is e-verify, which stops unscrupulous employers from hiring undocumented workers and cutting everyone's wages. so in order to make a point on immigration, our republican colleagues are actually going to stop the program which prevents employers from hiring undocumented workers. essentially to make a point about needing more immigration enforcement, republicans are willing to shut down immigration enforcement. in short, i am perplexed as to why republicans are playing this game of chicken with dhs funding because the only possible outcome that could come from withholding of a clean dhs bill is the shutdown of several critical post- 9/11 programs within the dhs and the furlough of thousands of workers paramount to our nation's security and disaster preparedness. at a time when we need all hands on deck to keep america safe, republican efforts to politicize our security would tie dhs's hands behind their back. so i urge my republican colleagues in the house and senate to drop this fool's errand and put a clean dhs funding bill on the floor as soon as possible. i yield the floor. mr. barrasso. mr. president, i suggest the absence of a quorum. the presiding officer. the clerk will call the roll. the assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. mrs. shaheen. mr. president, i ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. the presiding officer. without objection, it is so ordered. mrs. shaheen. mr. president, i am here this afternoon to discuss the two concerns i have about the bill currently before the senate--the regulation that would grant immediate approval of the presidential permit necessary to construct and operate the keystone xl pipeline. first and foremost, i believe a thorough regulatory review process is critical for any major infrastructure project, particularly one that will cross our country's border. regulatory review enables the identification of economic impacts from a major project and, more importantly, environmental impacts that infrastructure projects such as the keystone pipeline may bring. we shouldn't trade transparency for expediency when it comes to the construction of an international project that has such scope. i can't support a bill that sacrifices these important protections. that is why i voted in the past against legislation to allow the keystone xl pipeline to circumvent the normal review process, and that is why i intend to again vote against this bill. i also have a number of concerns about the impact of the keystone pipeline on our environment. in the past 2 weeks, we have had a spirited debate on this floor, and a number of my colleagues have come to the floor to talk about the pipeline oilspills we have seen in this country. just a few days ago, an oil pipeline burst, leaking 50,000 gallons of crude oil into the yellowstone river in montana. yet this spill pales in comparison to the 2010 kalamazoo river oil spill where over 1 million gallons of oil sands poured into talmadge creek in michigan. the cleanup has already cost more than $1 billion and taken over 4 years to complete. in fact, to date there has been no authoritative study on how the spills of oil sands crude may differ from those of conventional crude oil. this means we have no idea about the spill's long-term effects on the health of wildlife in that river. the other issue that has been raced onto the floor is the fact that right now, because of the way we define crude oil, transcanada-- supporting and planning to build the keystone pipeline--is not required to pay into the federal oil spill liability trust fund, which would ensure taxpayers against any spills. so we have this out-of-state, out- of-country foreign company that is coming in to build this pipeline, and yet they are not required to pay, as any american company would be, into the oil spill liability trust fund. that, to me, doesn't make sense. circumventing the regulatory process for keystone prevents us from understanding the health hazards that we would face should another spill occur. i am also concerned that construction of the keystone pipeline will increase carbon emissions and undermine some of the most critical climate policies that we have in place. the pipeline poses threats to our environment that have already been identified. tar sands greenhouse gas emissions are 81 percent greater than those of conventional oil. that is because the production of oil sands crude is more energy intensive, or more greenhouse gas intensive, than conventional crude production. additional processes are required to extract the oil, remove the sand, and dilute the oil so that it can flow in a pipeline. in addition, if the pipeline is approved, much of the boreal wetlands in alberta, canada, which act as a carbon sink, would be destroyed, releasing 11 million to 47 million metric tons of co 2 into the atmosphere. one of the reasons i am concerned about circumventing the regulatory process is because i believe this could set a precedent for a rushed approval of infrastructure projects currently under consideration in new hampshire. in new hampshire, we have two projects that really merit careful consideration and thorough review that could be affected by a precedent that says we should ignore the regulatory process. in new hampshire, the northern pass transmission proposal, which proposes to deliver hydropower from quebec into the new england energy markets and goes through northern new hampshire, would bring power to southern new england, but new hampshire wouldn't benefit. and any suggestion that we would circumvent the [[page s565]] process is a real concern to people in new hampshire who would be affected by that project. the other project is the potential reversal of the portland-montreal pipeline, which, if the determination were made to do this, would send oil sands through many new hampshire communities, and that oil would then be shipped to foreign countries. so if we set the precedent of trading transparency for expediency with keystone, without requiring the completion of a comprehensive approval process, local communities in new hampshire may not have a meaningful voice in the process that deals with northern pass or reversing the portland-montreal pipeline. i think that is unacceptable. these three projects--keystone, northern pass, and portland- montreal--have one important thing in common: they should undergo the comprehensive environmental and safety approval process required by existing law, and that should be done independent of politics. circumventing the presidential permitting process for cross-border pipelines and electric transmission facilities avoids the due process that is needed to determine whether these projects are in the best interests of the country. in new hampshire, northern pass and the portland-montreal pipeline have raised serious concerns for people who live in areas impacted by these projects. that is why i worked with the entire new hampshire congressional delegation in a bipartisan way to ensure that both projects undergo a transparent, thorough, and comprehensive review process. that allows the input of local communities who will be affected by these projects. like people in new hampshire and across the country, i share concerns about our nation's energy future. throughout my career i have fought for smart policies that will reduce energy costs in new hampshire and across the country, that will help create jobs, and will protect our air and water from pollution. but i don't believe mandating a project that bypasses the approval process is a smart policy. we need to be smart and thoughtful about our energy future. i think it would set a dangerous precedent for other projects that could have serious consequences in new hampshire and in other states around the country. i appreciate the debate we have had here on the senate floor about the keystone pipeline, but i will be opposing this bill. i yield the floor, and i suggest the absence of a quorum. the presiding officer. the clerk will call the roll. the assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. mr. nelson. mr. president, i ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. the presiding officer. without objection, it is so ordered. ukraine and syria mr. nelson. mr. president, i want to speak to the senate about ukraine and also about syria. these are two parts of the world that are of particular critical importance to the united states foreign policy today because of what they portend for the future. the fact that our relationship is so rocky with the president of russia, president putin, who right up to just a few days after the olympics suddenly shows his true colors when he invades crimea, a part of ukraine, despite all of the agreements when the soviet union broke up in the late eighties, early nineties, the agreements that in exchange for moving all of the nuclear weapons out of ukraine back into russia, that russia would forever recognize and respect the sovereignty of ukraine--well, that went out the window right after the olympics, and mr. putin showed his true colors. he could couch it in all kinds of terms, that there is a russian naval base that was there, but the fact is the whole world knows what he did, and no one could do anything about it. then he started to move on the eastern part of ukraine, and that, of course, is going on as we speak. the so-called rebels aren't really rebels. they are a front for the russian military propped up with actual troops of the russian military, sometimes disguised as being free and independent players simply because they don't have on their russian uniforms; but in fact they have taken them off and put on uniforms that are not russian uniforms to say that they are part of the rebel force. it is a ruse and everybody knows it is a ruse. i went last august to ukraine, spoke with almost all of the top-level members of the government and asked what it was they needed. to my surprise, at the time they did not say they needed lethal equipment. they needed up-to-date, up-to-the-minute intelligence, and they needed training. i have urged the u.s. government to provide that, and we are providing a number of things. this senator thinks it is clearly in the interest of the united states that we provide more assistance to the government of ukraine so their military can have the equipment, including lethal assistance, to hold off putin's aggression in eastern ukraine. this is a particularly critical time. i was there last summer, but what has happened in the meantime is over the course of the past year oil has gone from $100 to $46 a barrel. i remember asking someone when i was there and in the baltic states what did oil need to get to and below in order for mr. putin to start really feeling the pinch, and they said anything under $85 a barrel. it is now around $46 a barrel. although russia has significant reserves as of a few months ago, about $450 billion of cash in reserves, that is lower now. those reserves will hold them for a while because of the price they are getting for their oil. they don't have high production costs in russia, but because the price is so much lower--half of what they were getting--their revenue is significantly down and therefore all of the money that was being supplied by the russian government for so many things, a plethora of different social programs--guess who is feeling the pinch. the people of russia. so the aggressiveness of mr. putin internationally is an attempt to try to take his people's eye off of their own financial depravity and, in fact, get it on the international scene where the president of russia is quite adept at pounding his chest and banging his fist. the ukrainians are once again fighting right now as we speak for their territory. the ukrainian government took back the donetsk airport in eastern ukraine. then the rebels came back. and i say ``rebels'' with a wry smile. i mean this is the russian army. they came back and they took it again. last week those russian-backed rebels broke a shaky ceasefire agreement and they renewed the fighting with the ukrainian government military. this senator feels that we have got to do more to help these people who are trying to protect their independence. if you recall, last year we passed the ukraine freedom support act which provides further sanctions and lethal aid such as antitank and anti- armor weapons, counterartillery radars, secure communications equipment, and tactical surveillance drones. all of that was needed. the fighting that is following appears to be a steady buildup of russian support for the rebels. general hodges, the u.s. army commander in europe, said last week that since december russia had doubled its support for the rebels. general breedlove, the nato supreme commander, said that russian electronic warfare and defense systems have been detected in the conflict areas. so let's not fool ourselves, the russian army is in there and we have to do more to help them. on syria, this senator feels where we are having success right now in iraq against isis with the multiple strikes from the air, with training up the iraqi army as the boots on the ground, including some american boots on the ground that are advisers and trainers--at the end of the day we are going to have to do this in syria if we are going to be successful. it is a lot more complicated in syria because of the assad government. the free syrian army we are now starting to train--it is almost an impossible task. we train them, they go in, they try to attack isis. isis attacks them, but so does the assad regime. that is not a recipe for success. we are working with the vetted opposition fighters to go after isis in syria. we have to supply support. we have to supply lethal support in addition to the training and equipment in [[page s566]] order for them to be successful. and for them to be successful, it is absolutely in the interest of the united states. congress has approved the training and equipping of vetted elements of the syrian opposition, and the department of defense recently announced it will deploy 400 personnel in that effort. we are going to have to do a lot more. the american people are tired of war, and yet we have a new kind of enemy, and we are going to have to take it right to them where they are. mr. president, i yield the floor. the presiding officer. the senator from utah. (the remarks of mr. hatch pertaining to the introduction of s. 295 are printed in today's record under ``statements on introduced bills and joint resolutions.'') mr. hatch. mr. president, i wish to say a few words about some of the amendments we will be voting on later this afternoon--three of them in particular. the amendments i am referring to are the merkley amendment no. 125, the carper amendment no. 120, and the heitkamp amendment no. 133. all three of these amendments address sensitive tax issues that fall squarely into the jurisdiction of the senate finance committee, and all of them address issues that are likely to be litigated as the finance committee continues its efforts toward comprehensive tax reform. the finance committee is going to be very active in this congress. we had our first bipartisan markup this morning. we already had two hearings, with more scheduled for next week, and perhaps more importantly--at least in the context of these three votes we will be having today--we have taken concrete steps in a process we believe will end in the introduction of bipartisan tax reform legislation. we have appointed five tax reform working groups to address the various areas of reform. our hope is that over the next few months these working groups will study the issues and provide ideas we can use as we develop a comprehensive tax reform proposal. ranking member wyden is on board with this effort. we are working together every step of the way. if we start singling out individual tax issues here on the floor--even issues members may feel passionately about--we are going to undermine this bipartisan process. virtually everyone in both parties agrees that we need to fix our broken, inefficient tax code. sure, there are disagreements on what the substance of tax reform should look like, but there is a growing consensus on the need for reform, which is encouraging. if we are going to be successful in tax reform, we need to make sure these issues are addressed in the tax-writing committees. i think it is safe to say that all of the issues my colleagues are trying to address with their amendments are going to be litigated one way or another in the finance committee's efforts this year. that being the case, raising these issues as floor amendments on an unrelated bill is, in my view, very counterproductive. finally, i would like to note that these amendments would all be subject to a constitutional point of order as they all deal with revenue and would need to be passed first by the house of representatives. i am not going to raise that point of order at this time; i just want to make note of it for the record. given all of these concerns, i hope my colleagues--senators merkley, carper, and heitkamp--will withdraw these amendments so these issues can be addressed in the proper forum. if they do not withdraw their amendments, i plan to vote against all three of them and urge all of my colleagues--particularly those who have an interest in a successful tax reform effort--to do the same. i yield the floor. the presiding officer (mr. cruz). the senator from colorado. mr. bennet. i congratulate the presiding officer, and i also congratulate chairman hatch for the unanimous vote he got in today's markup in the finance committee. it was a great bipartisan start to our work, as he said. i hope we will continue to have these discussions in that manner. amendment no. 92, as modified mr. bennet. mr. president, i wish to speak today about the burr- bennet amendment no. 92, which we are slated to vote on later today. i will be brief because it is pretty straightforward. the amendment simply reauthorizes the land and water conservation fund and ensures that a dedicated portion of lwcf funds go to provide new access for our nation's sports men and women. as many in this body know, the land and water conservation fund is one of the country's best and most important conservation programs. it is authorized to provide $900 million annually for efforts to preserve and increase access to our public lands and waterways. these resources historically have been used for projects that range from building city parks, to purchasing small parcels of isolated land from willing sellers, all the way to preserving the nation's historic battlefields. this past summer in colorado, we completed a huge lwcf project that retired several old mining claims on the san juan national forest near the town of ophir. over the fourth of july weekend, the town invited me and my family to join them in a celebration of the accomplishment, and we took them up on that offer without a moment's hesitation. ophir sits at 9,600 feet above sea level. it is the kind of place that has a sign on its main road--clearly painted by the kids who live in the town--indicating that their population totals 163 people, including, according to the sign, 55 kids, 30 dogs, and 15 cats. when we pulled in on the morning of the celebration, it seemed to me that the entire town was there. over the course of that day--which included a hike, a picnic, and a formal program--it was amazing to hear from the community about the importance of this lwcf project and how many years so many people in the town devoted themselves to getting it done. many of our mountain communities get huge portions of their revenue and business through recreation and tourism, and it is for some of these reasons that the town felt lwcf literally helped cement its economic future. i was an lwcf supporter before that visit, but that day really drove home the value of the program to me. that is only one of countless stories from colorado. i know it can be replicated thousands of times across the country in all 50 states. those stories and accomplishments alone make this amendment worth supporting. let's also remember that when we are talking about lwcf, we are not talking about taxpayer dollars. when congress crafted the measure back in 1965, they had a very innovative solution for how to pay for their concept. instead of using taxpayer dollars from the treasury, they decided to dedicate a portion of the revenue the government collects from offshore oil drilling to fund lwcf. this argument was very simple and elegant. as we deplete our natural resources--offshore reserves of oil and gas in this case--we ought to support the conservation of another natural resource: our lands and waterways. as i mentioned, congress passed a law in 1965, and now it is time to reauthorize it. i thank senator burr, who has shown great leadership in crafting the amendment to do just that. this amendment is thoroughly bipartisan and enjoys cosponsors such as senator ayotte, senator alexander, and senator tillis, just to name a few. in fact, i am told there are 246 amendments that have been filed on this bill, and not one amendment has the number of cosponsors that this amendment does. this amendment has more cosponsors than any of the remaining 245 amendments. before i close and urge my colleagues to vote yes, i want to paraphrase something i said on the floor last week about another amendment. conservation policies such as lwcf are important to the american people. protecting our land and water is mom-and-apple-pie stuff in colorado, and i know our state is not the only one. conserved lands and wide-open spaces are a huge economic driver across our country, and it is part of who we are in the west. we are not only talking about backcountry parcels, such as the one i visited in ophir, we are talking about building new parks in inner cities and providing new access to hunters and anglers. the lwcf does all of these things and more. [[page s567]] i say to my colleagues, if you are for city kids getting a new playground or making sure we protect gold medal trout streams or any number of benefits in between, then you need to be for amendment no. 92 from senator burr. i urge all of my colleagues to support the measure when it comes time for a vote later this evening. i think we would make a very meaningful statement about where the senate is headed if we could supply the votes necessary to actually adopt this amendment. i yield the floor. i suggest the absence of a quorum. the presiding officer. the clerk will call the roll. the legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. mr. cardin. i ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. the presiding officer (mr. flake). without objection, it is so ordered. amendment no. 75 mr. cardin. mr. president, it is my understanding that in about a minute we are going to be voting on the first of a series of amendments. the first amendment is the amendment i have offered which i talked about before. i want to remind my colleagues what this amendment does. first, it would require a notification to governors and to county officials of risks to their drinking water supplies that may be caused by the keystone pipeline. second, the local officials would have the right to bring that information back to the federal government so that action could be taken in order to protect their drinking water supplies. third, it provides a right of action for property owners for damages caused to their wells and drinking water as a direct result of the keystone pipeline construction. this is a pretty straightforward amendment. it provides states rights in knowing what is happening with regard to their drinking water, and it provides property owners rights for the damages that could be caused as a result of keystone. i would urge my colleagues to support the amendment. the presiding officer. who yields time in opposition? the senator from alaska. ms. murkowski. mr. president, i would urge colleagues to oppose the cardin amendment. in review, it appears that it is designed to halt the construction of this pipeline before it even begins. the amendment tells the president to provide this analysis of the potential risks to public health and environment from a leak or rupture and to provide that to every municipality and every county along the route, as well as to the governors. then the governor can petition the president to effectively locate the pipeline somewhere else, at which point, again, construction could never commence. the governors of montana, south dakota, and nebraska have already approved the pipeline route through their states. so this amendment is an effort, i think, to build that opposition over contamination fears and in turn, pressure those governors to reverse their positions and halt the pipeline's construction. i think it is important for colleagues to understand the risks to the water supplies along the pipeline path were examined by the state department's final seis. they were found to be not significant. again, i will vote no on this amendment and strongly encourage my colleagues to join me with this. the presiding officer. under the previous order, the question occurs on agreeing to amendment no. 75. mr. cardin. i ask for the yeas and nays. the presiding officer. is there a sufficient second?

(the foregoing tally has been changed to reflect the above order.) ms. murkowski. i move to reconsider the vote. mr. wicker. i move to lay that motion on the table. the motion to lay on the table was agreed to. amendment no. 70 the presiding officer. under the previous order, there is now 2 minutes of debate prior to a vote in relation to amendment no. 70, offered by the senator from michigan, mr. peters. who yields time? the senator from michigan. mr. peters. mr. president, as michiganders, senator stabenow and i know firsthand how important the great lakes are. the lakes are a vital natural resource and an economic engine for our state, region, and the entire country. unfortunately, michiganders also know firsthand the environmental dangers and risks when it comes to pipeline leaks. we had the worst inland pipeline leak in our nation's history near kalamazoo, mi. cleanup has taken over 4 years and has cost $1.2 billion. there is a 60-year-old pipeline under the straits of mackinac where lake michigan and lake huron come together. i cannot even fathom what would happen if there were an accident that contaminated the great lakes. the results would be catastrophic not only for the great lakes but also the entire country. that is why we need to act now and act quickly, and i urge my colleagues to support the peters-stabenow amendment. the presiding officer. the senator from alaska. ms. murkowski. mr. president, i am not entirely certain i like this amendment. this is the first i have heard phmsa may not have the resources to do its job. it does seem fair to have phmsa come tell us if they do not have adequate resources. what i most strongly oppose with this amendment is its attempt to tie the construction of the keystone xl pipeline to an unrelated pipeline in a different state. there is no limit for the phmsa study and certification included here, so we could be looking, in addition to the already 2,300-some-odd days this delay has been in place, at further delays. if my colleagues from michigan are interested in a phmsa study, i recommend they introduce their effort as a stand-alone bill so it can be considered by the committee of jurisdiction. if it is needed, we can move it through the regular order and certainly consider it in the future. i would ask my colleagues to oppose this amendment, and i remind colleagues that we are on 10-minute votes. [[page s568]] the presiding officer. the question is on agreeing to the peters amendment. ms. murkowski. i ask for the yeas and nays. the presiding officer. is there a sufficient second? there appears to be a sufficient second. the clerk will call the roll. the legislative clerk called the roll. mr. cornyn. the following senator is necessarily absent: the senator from florida (mr. rubio). mr. durbin. i announce that the senator from nevada (mr. reid) is necessarily absent. the presiding officer.

the proposed rebate per system is the lesser of 15 percent of the initial capital cost. this puts the federal government on the hook for up to $100 billion to pay for these installations. we can debate the merits of jobs and job creation, but i again urge my colleagues to oppose the sanders amendment. the presiding officer. the time has expired. the question is on agreeing to the sanders amendment. ms. stabenow. i ask for the yeas and nays. the presiding officer. is there a sufficient second?

no. 1, it will increase prices to american consumers. the energy information agency has already determined that the lng export facilities already approved are going to lead to a 50- percent increase in the price of natural gas here in america. it would jeopardize american manufacturing which has seen 700,000 new jobs created in the last 5 years in america largely because of low-priced natural gas. it is going to increase carbon pollution because it is going to slow the pace of change from coal over to natural gas in the generation of electricity. it is going to undermine our trade negotiations because it is all going to be given away here on the senate floor. and, finally, it is going to harm our national security, because if we converted one-third of our trucks and buses, it backs out all the oil that we import from the persian gulf by using natural gas in american vehicles. we are going to ship jobs along with that gas going overseas. i urge a ``no'' vote on the cruz amendment. the presiding officer. the senator's time has expired. under the previous order, the question is on agreeing to amendment no. 15 offered by the senator from texas, mr. cruz. ms. murkowski. i ask for the yeas and nays. the presiding officer. is there a sufficient second?

the senator from arizona. mr. flake. mr. president, i rise in opposition to this amendment. i believe we do need more certainty, and the certainty ought to be that it is time for this tax credit--particularly the wind ptc--to expire. this was enacted 23 years ago as a temporary tax measure. there has been a lot of wind that has blown since that time, and we have a mature industry. in fact, the other day the president said we are no. 1 in the world in wind power. we ought to have more certainty, and the certainty that needs to be there is that the tax credit is going to end and that we stop picking winners and losers in the energy economy. with that, i yield the floor. mr. grassley. mr. president, i would like to speak on amendment no. 133, offered by senator heitkamp of north dakota. the amendment is a sense of congress that the renewable electricity tax credit should be extended for 5 years. while i supported the amendment, i would like to express my concerns regarding the consideration of this amendment at this time. i have been an outspoken supporter of renewable energy for many years. in fact, i first authored the wind production tax credit in 1992 to drive this renewable energy technology. i have worked for many years to provide as much certainty as possible to grow the domestic wind industry. iowa has seen an enormous investment in wind energy manufacturing and wind farm development. i know firsthand the boom-and- bust cycle that exists for renewable energy producers when congress fails to extend these critically important tax incentives. but i also know this credit won't go on forever. it was never meant to, and it shouldn't. in 2012 the wind industry was the only industry to put forward a phaseout plan. a number of my colleagues here in the senate have been working to construct a responsible, multiyear phaseout of the wind tax credit. that is why i am somewhat puzzled by an amendment that suggests a 5-year extension of this credit. it seems disconnected with reality. i would remind my colleagues on the other side that in november of 2014, the house offer on tax extenders included a multiyear extension of the wind production tax credit that would have provided the certainty and soft landing that most of us and the industry support, but president obama issued a veto threat before the ink was dry, and as a result the wind incentive expired. again, i strongly support wind energy, but i support a prudent way forward on an extension of the production tax credit. this amendment fails terribly in that regard. that is why i am disappointed that the senator from north dakota insisted on going forward with a 5-year extension on this bill. this is not a real effort to extend the wind incentive. i am afraid this was simply a politically motivated effort designed to score political points. [[page s573]] it is unfortunate that in this case, politicking has trumped efforts to achieve sound, responsible policy. rather than offer ``gotcha'' amendments on an unrelated bill, we should be working together to craft an extension of these important tax incentives that work for the wind industry, that are realistic politically, and that make sense for the american taxpayer. that effort requires regular order, working through the finance committee, to determine the most prudent path forward. it should be done in the context of comprehensive tax reform, where all energy tax provisions are on the table, rather than as a sense of the congress on the unrelated keystone xl bill. i hope that with this political exercise behind us, those of us who seek to ensure a responsible transition for the wind production tax credit can get to work and achieve a sensible policy for those who depend on it. it is too bad that this ill-timed, ill-conceived amendment may have actually harmed those efforts. the presiding officer. the question is on agreeing to the amendment. mr. coats. mr. president, i ask for the yeas and nays. the presiding officer. is there a sufficient second?

there appears to be a sufficient second. the yeas and nays were ordered. the presiding officer. the senator from alaska. ms. murkowski. mr. president, claiming the 1 minute in opposition. as the senator from new york has described, this would apply to the requirements of the safe drinking water act to underground ejection of natural gas. currently the safe drinking water act expressly prohibits this application. this amendment to add the requirements to the safe drinking water act is beyond the scope of the immediate keystone debate. we are debating the approval of a pipeline that is going to carry oil, not gas. if the senator from new york wants to debate the issues of fracking--most certainly those issues are before the energy and natural resources committee, and the safe drinking water act--i would welcome a stand- alone bill. we will have those discussions, but on this measure i would oppose and encourage members to vote against the gillibrand amendment. i would remind members we are so close to wrapping up this series of amendments. if we can ask the folks to stick around for these final few and keep to the 10-minute line. i know senator feinstein is looking to encourage the women of the senate to gather for a meal later on, and that would be important for us. the presiding officer. the question is on agreeing to gillibrand amendment no. 48. the yeas and nays have been previously ordered. the clerk will call the roll. the bill clerk called the roll. mr. cornyn. the following senator is necessarily absent: the senator from florida (mr. rubio). mr. durbin. i announce that the senator from nevada (mr. reid) is necessarily absent. the presiding officer. are there any other senators in the chamber desiring to vote?

(the amendment is printed in the record of january 20, 2015, under ``text of amendments.'') mr. udall. mr. president, let me just say to the two leaders on the floor who have participated in this open amendment process that i really appreciate the way chairwoman murkowski and ranking member cantwell have worked through this bill. i really appreciate all their help. i have heard, at least on our side of the aisle, over and over that this is the way the senate should be moving, this is the way we should be working. so i think all of us are very appreciative of how the two managers of the bill have worked together. i thank my colleagues, and i yield the floor. the presiding officer. the senator from alaska. ms. murkowski. i thank our colleague for his kind comments. we do have one more consent request here very briefly. i ask unanimous consent that the order of votes on the burr and the daines amendments be reversed. the presiding officer. without objection, it is so ordered. ms. murkowski. with that, mr. president, i again thank members for their cooperation today and look forward to yet another productive day tomorrow. i yield the floor. the presiding officer. the senator from north dakota. mr. hoeven. mr. president, i want to express my appreciation to the bill managers for their hard work today and for their efforts in the work that was done in a bipartisan way on this legislation. i know both the bill managers have spent an awful lot of time putting together these amendments, and i think they have really bent over backward to make sure members on both sides of the aisle have had an opportunity to file their amendments, to make those amendments pending, and to get votes on the amendments. so i would like to express my appreciation to both of them for all the work they have done and for the process today in voting on amendments. with that, i yield the floor. the presiding officer. the senator from arizona. the economy mr. flake. mr. president, yesterday the congressional budget office-- the cbo--released its budget and economic outlook showing the forecast through 2025. it should strike fear in the heart of anybody who is concerned about this country's financial future. the very short-term news is good. the deficit is projected to fall-- but only for another 2 years. in 2017 the deficit is projected to start rising again to $1.1 trillion in 10 years. that is the annual deficit. by 2025 the deficit will be 4 percent of our overall economy. right now the country's debt in cumulative deficits over the years-- the cumulative debt--is $18 trillion. this year we will pay about $277 billion just servicing that debt. that amount might seem low, but it is because of artificially low interest rates. in 10 years we will pay about $827 billion a year just to service the debt. that is 3 percent of our economy just to pay interest on the debt. that is unsustainable. don't take my word for it, though. you can take cbo's. they said: such large and growing federal debt would have serious negative consequences, including increasing federal spending for interest payments; restraining economic growth in the long term; giving policymakers less flexibility to respond to unexpected challenges; and eventually heightening the risk of a financial crisis. i have been working on these issues--this issue in particular--for a long time, and i have to admit that sometimes it is tough to get people to focus on this topic. but we shouldn't be fooled and patting ourselves on the back just because we have done things such as getting rid of earmarks. that is a good thing, but it is certainly insufficient to address our spending. the culture in washington is still the culture of runaway spending, not just in earmarks, as i said, not just in wasteful spending. for example, spending on social security, medicare, and medicaid will nearly double over the next decade alone. this is not a revenue problem that we are having. projected revenues will exceed their 50-year historical average of 17 percent of gdp this year and will grow to over 18 percent of the economy in this decade. the culture of spending in washington is something that defies logic, defies math and an honest assessment of who we are as a country. as a result, the united states is fast becoming a once-prosperous nation. we don't want that designation. it is truly a frightening distinction. yet too few in washington are motivated to get this country's fiscal house in order. one has to wonder how bad it is going to have to get to prod those who are not yet motivated. some will argue that we need to take baby steps to address our fiscal crisis. i think we are well past that time, but whatever kinds of steps we take, we need to take them now. we need to turn this culture of spending in washington to one that will fully repair our economy. that will give the private sector the stability and confidence to create jobs. we also need to reform our cumbersome tax code. most of all, we need to relieve future generations of the burden of our financial mess. in short, it is well past time to start climbing our way out of this fiscal hole we are in. i yield the floor. the presiding officer. the senator from rhode island. climate change mr. whitehouse. mr. president, i am here now for the 87th consecutive week the senate has been in session to urge action on climate change. we have had an interesting couple of weeks on the keystone pipeline, but from a climate change and carbon pollution point of view, this would obviously not be helpful. indeed, it would [[page s576]] be a disaster leading to as much as 27 million--27 million--metric tons of additional carbon dioxide emitted per year. to put that number into some perspective, that is the equivalent of adding 6 million cars and trucks to our roads for 50 years. so it is a very considerable carbon price to pay. we have seen a poster used on the senate floor that says it will have no environmental effect. that is not precisely true. indeed, precisely the opposite is true. this is the environmental effect it will have, and it is considerable. the report referred to went on to say that it would be offset by the fact that this fuel would go out by rail anyway. but that offset was conditioned on a fuel price above $75 per barrel of oil, and we are at $50. so there is no way that conclusion can stand, and the underlying fact is what prevails--27 million metric tons of additional carbon dioxide. it is obviously very bad from an environmental perspective. it is a lot of ``not much'' from a jobs perspective. every 4 days we add more jobs than the construction of this pipeline just through the economic recovery that is taking place. this is a little bit hard to explain, particularly when you think that this bill is going to be dead on arrival at the white house. we have known from the beginning that this is going to be vetoed. but it has allowed the oil and the fossil fuel industry to show their hands. this is all being done on behalf of a foreign oil company and on behalf of the fossil fuel industry. when we look at what we have been through in the past couple of days, there are some interesting choices the senate has made if you are a foreign oil company. if you are a foreign oil company, we will let you use eminent domain to extinguish the property rights of farmers and ranchers and take their farms and ranches away. if you are a foreign oil company, we will exempt you from the oilspill recovery fund--the federal excise tax on petroleum--so you don't have to pay the taxes american companies have to pay. if you are a foreign oil company, we will not require you to use american steel in a pipeline being built across america being touted as a source of american jobs. if you are a foreign oil company, we won't require you to sell it in the american market even though it is touted as a product that will help balance america's energy portfolio. so, so far, not much good to show for all of this but one thing, and that is that this exercise has at last brought the issue of climate change to the floor of the senate. we have not had much debate about climate change since the citizens united decision back in 2010 allowed the fossil fuel industry to cast a very long shadow of intimidation across this body. they spend a huge amount of the money that has been freed up by citizens united. they spend a huge amount of dark money that flows post citizens united. and since then, the republican party has been virtually muzzled on that subject. so having republicans talk about climate change on the senate floor was something of a revelation, and i don't think we should underestimate the importance of that or undervalue what was said. the senior senator from north carolina came to the floor and said this: the concept that climate change is real, i completely understand and accept. to the point of how much man is contributing, i don't know, but it does make sense that man- made emissions are contributing. . . . the greenhouse gas effect seems to me scientifically sound. the problem is that how you fix this globally is going to require more than just the u.s. being involved. which i think we all agree with. the senior senator from alaska, who is our chairman of the energy and natural resources committee and the floor manager on this very bill, agreed, stating that she hopes we can all, quoting her, get beyond the discussion as to whether or not climate change is real and talk about what do we do. i look forward to that discussion about what do we do. it is not enough just to say, ok, we finally concede that climate change is really happening. we really do have to get on to what do we do. even if you disagree with me that climate change is real and very significant and consequential for our country, if you will spot me that there is just a 10-percent chance that i am right--even just a 2- percent chance that i am right--when we consider the possible harms, it is something that grownup adults and responsible people ought to take a look at and come together and decide what to do. we have been through some very notable benchmarks. we hit for the first time last year 400 parts per million of carbon dioxide in our atmosphere for more than 3 months. they have been tracking this in hawaii, at the top of the mountain at the mauna loa laboratory for decades now, and 400 parts per million for more than 3 months is a new record. to put that in context: for as long as human beings have been on this planet, all the way back to when we were living in caves, the range of carbon in the atmosphere has been 170 to 300 parts per million. so we are well outside the range that has been our comfortable safe range for human habitation of this planet during our entire human experience, and 400 is a big move when our entire range is only 130 points and now we are 100 parts per million out of that. some of this lands in the oceans. the oceans have absorbed about a quarter of all our carbon emissions. we can measure their ph level. this isn't complicated. this isn't something we have to do with elaborate computer models. what we see is that the ph level of the oceans is changing rapidly. the oceans are acidifying rapidly. when i say rapidly, they are acidifying at a rate that we have not seen in 25 to perhaps 30 or 50 million years. indeed, some studies say nothing like this has been seen on the face of the earth for as long as 300 million years. when we consider that our species has been around for about 200,000 years, that is a pretty long window to be launching new and dramatic changes in our oceans. there is nothing new about the science that supports this. john tyndall wrote the first report about the greenhouse gas effect to the british academy of sciences in 1861. the pages who are here and have studied history will know that 1861 was the year president lincoln took office. so the scientific community has been aware of the greenhouse gas phenomenon since abraham lincoln was driving up and down pennsylvania avenue in a carriage with his top hat on. there is not much new that is there, and the latest data is clearer and clearer that we just continue apace to warm the planet. professor jonathan overpeck is at the university of arizona, and arizona is certainly feeling the heat. professor overpeck said: the global warmth of 2014 is just another reminder that the planet is warming and warming fast. . . . humans, and their burning of fossil fuels, are dominating the earth's climate system like never before. it is equally clear, when we look at the oceans, they not only absorb a lot of the carbon dioxide and acidify as a result--they absorb most of the heat. in fact, they absorb 90 percent of the excess heat that has been trapped by the greenhouse gases that we have flooded our atmosphere with. i certainly see that in rhode island, where narragansett bay's mean winter water temperature is up 3 to 4 degrees fahrenheit since we had our big hurricane of 1938. that is significant, because it means more likely storms. it is associated with sea level rise. we have 10 more inches of sea level at the newport naval station. so if the 1938 hurricane were to repeat itself now, it would have 10 more inches of sea to hammer against our shores. and that is not a complicated measure, either. we do that with thermometers. so since the industrial revolution, human beings have dumped 2 trillion metric tons of carbon dioxide into the air and into the atmosphere. said another way, that is 2,000 billion metric tons of carbon dioxide. the notion that has no effect, when we have known since abraham lincoln's day that carbon dioxide is a greenhouse gas, and when we put that much in and when we can measure that it is at 400 for the first time in human history--connect the dots. how much does it take? it is really pretty obvious. folks who remain skeptical--well, i know, i am not a scientist. i get that. so ask one. that is all i request. and i don't think that is too much to ask of colleagues. and, by the way, do me one favor. you can ask the scientist that you please, but please don't ask a scientist who is in the pay of the fossil [[page s577]] fuel and the denial industry. there are a bunch of them who are out there. they turn up at all the usual denial conferences. they write in the denial journals. they take money from the denial organizations that all have fossil fuel industry funding behind them. go to someplace neutral. for instance, go to your own state university, like the university of arizona or the university of oklahoma. the dean of the relevant department at the university of oklahoma signed the ipcc report and started climate central. ask your own university. ask any major scientific organization. all the major recognized scientific organizations in the united states of america are on board, agree that this is real, agree that this is important, agree that it is vital, and believe that we are actually near the tipping point that may make the damage irrecoverable. if you don't want to go to your home state university and if you don't want to go to america's major scientific societies, try noaa and nasa. think about nasa for a moment. as i give this speech, there is a rover that is the size of an suv being driven around on the surface of mars. we built a rover, shot it to mars, landed it safely, and are now driving it around. do we think those scientists might actually know something? do we think they might know what they are talking about? do we think they might merit our confidence? so ask them and see what they say. or, if you want, ask some of america's leading corporations. if you are from arkansas, go and ask walmart. they will tell you. if you are from georgia, go and ask coca-cola. they will tell you. this is not hard to discover once you get away from that little stable of denial scientists who are so closely affiliated with the fossil fuel industry. i do this every week because we have the arrogance so often here to think how much our laws--the laws that we pass--matter. but the laws that we pass are passing things. they come and they go. they have their time. they are repealed, they are replaced, they fall into desuetude. but some laws last, and those are the laws that god laid down upon this earth that guide its operations. those are the laws of physics, the laws of chemistry, the laws of biology, the law of gravity. we cannot repeal those laws. we must face their consequences. and we know the consequences of continuing to emit gigatons of carbon dioxide into our planet is going to launch us into an environment in which the habitability of earth as we have known it will be put into question. history makes its judgments about every generation. if we do not take calm and reasonable and sensible precautions about this obvious known and admitted risk, then when that risk comes home to roost, we will be duly shamed. so let us avoid that. let us get to work. let us take advantage of the opening that the distinguished senior senator from alaska and the distinguished senior senator from south carolina have opened for us, and let us do what is right by our country and by the judgment that we can anticipate from history. i yield the floor. i suggest the absence of a quorum. the presiding officer. the clerk will call the roll. the assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. mr. hoeven. mr. president, i ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. the presiding officer. without objection, it is so ordered. ____________________",173119

The spirit of this requirement is to assure adequate notice to the public and other Members of the Senate as to the time and subject matter of proposed hearings. In the spirit of section 133A(a) and in order to assure that members of the committee are themselves fully informed and involved in the development of hearings: 1. Public notice of the date, place, and subject matter of each committee or subcommittee hearing should be inserted in the Congressional Record seven days prior to the commencement of such hearing. 2. At least seven days prior to public notice of each committee or subcommittee hearing, the majority should provide notice to the minority of the time, place and specific subject matter of such hearing. 3. At least three days prior to the date of such hearing, the committee or subcommittee should provide to each member a list of witnesses who have been or are proposed to be invited to appear. 4. The committee and its subcommittee should, to the maximum feasible extent, enforce the provisions of rule 9 of the committee rules as it relates to the submission of written statements of witnesses twenty-four hours in advance of a hearing. Witnesses will be urged to submit testimony even earlier whenever possible. When statements are received in advance of a hearing, the committee or subcommittee (as appropriate) should distribute copies of such statements to each of its members. Witness testimony may be submitted and distributed electronically. EXECUTIVE SESSIONS FOR THE PURPOSE OF MARKING UP BILLS In order to expedite the process of marking up bills and to assist each member of the committee so that there may be full and fair consideration of each bill which the committee or a subcommittee is marking up the following procedures should be followed: 1. Seven days prior to the proposed date for an executive session for the purpose of marking up bills the committee or subcommittee (as appropriate) should provide written notice to each of its members as to the time, place, and specific subject matter of such session, including an agenda listing each bill or other matters to be considered and including: (a) a copy of each bill, joint resolution, or other legislative matter (or committee print thereof) to be considered at such executive session; and (b) a copy of a summary of the provisions of each bill, joint resolution, or other legislative matter to be considered at such executive session including, whenever possible, an explanation of changes to existing law proposed to be made. 2. Insofar as practical, prior to the scheduled date for an executive session for the purpose of marking up bills, the committee or a subcommittee (as appropriate) should provide each member with a copy of the printed record or a summary of any hearings conducted by the committee or a subcommittee with respect to each bill, joint resolution, or other legislative matter to be considered at such executive session. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 14 (Wednesday, January 28, 2015)] [Senate] [Pages S579-S581] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] COMMITTEE ON HEALTH, EDUCATION, LABOR, AND PENSIONS ______ RULES OF PROCEDURE Mr. ALEXANDER.

There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows: RULES FOR THE U.S. SENATE COMMITTEE ON SMALL BUSINESS AND ENTREPRENEURSHIP FOR THE 114TH CONGRESS JURISDICTION (ESTABLISHED IN THE SENATE STANDING RULES) Per Rule XXV(1) of the Standing Rules of the Senate: (1) Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship to which committee shall be referred all proposed legislation, messages, petitions, memorials, and other matters relating to the Small Business Administration; (2) Any proposed legislation reported by such committee which relates to matters other than the functions of the Small Business Administration shall, at the request of the chairman of any standing committee having jurisdiction over the subject matter extraneous to the functions of the Small Business Administration, be considered and reported by such standing committee prior to its consideration by the Senate; and likewise measures reported by other committees directly relating to the Small Business Administration shall, at the request of the Chair of the Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, be referred to the Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship for its consideration of any portion of the measure dealing with the Small Business Administration and be reported by this committee prior to its consideration by the Senate. (3) Such committee shall also study and survey by means of research and investigation all problems of American small business enterprises, and report thereon from time to time. GENERAL SECTION All applicable provisions of the Standing Rules of the Senate, the Senate Resolutions, and the Legislative Reorganization Acts of 1946 and 1970 (as amended), shall govern the Committee. MEETINGS (a) The regular meeting day of the Committee shall be the first Thursday of each month unless otherwise directed by the Chair. All other meetings may be called by the Chair as he or she deems necessary, on 3 business days notice where practicable. If at least three Members of the Committee desire the Chair to call a special meeting, they may file in the office of the Committee a written request therefore, addressed to the Chair. Immediately thereafter, the Clerk of the Committee shall notify the Chair of such request. If, within 3 calendar days after the filing of such request, the Chair fails to call the requested special meeting, which is to be held within 7 calendar days after the filing of such request, a majority of the Committee Members may file in the Office of the Committee their written notice that a special Committee meeting will be held, specifying the date, hour and place thereof, and the Committee shall meet at that time and place. Immediately upon the filing of such notice, the Clerk of the Committee shall notify all Committee Members that such special meeting will be held and inform them of its date, hour and place. If the Chair is not present at any regular, additional or special meeting, such member of the Committee as the Chair shall designate shall preside. For any meeting or hearing of the Committee, the Ranking Member may delegate to any Minority Member the authority to serve as Ranking Member, and that Minority Member shall be afforded all the rights and responsibilities of the Ranking Member for the duration of that meeting or hearing. Notice of any designation shall be provided to the Chief Clerk as early as practicable. (b) It shall not be in order for the Committee to consider any amendment in the first degree proposed to any measure under consideration by the Committee unless thirty written copies and an electronic copy, with a summary page attached, of such amendment has been delivered to the Clerk of the Committee at least 24 hours prior to the meeting. Following receipt of all amendments, the Clerk shall disseminate the amendments to all Members of the Committee. This subsection may be waived by agreement of the Chair and Ranking Member or by a majority vote of the members of the Committee. QUORUMS (a)(1) A majority of the Members of the Committee shall constitute a quorum for reporting any legislative measure or nomination. (2) One-third of the Members of the Committee shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of routine business, provided that one Minority Member is present. The term ``routine business'' includes, but is not limited to, the consideration of legislation pending before the Committee and any amendments thereto, and voting on such amendments, and steps in an investigation including, but not limited to, authorizing the issuance of a subpoena. (3) In hearings, whether in public or closed session, a quorum for the asking of testimony, including sworn testimony, shall consist of one Member of the Committee. (b) Proxies will be permitted in voting upon the business of the Committee. A Member who is unable to attend a business meeting may submit a proxy vote on any matter, in writing, or through oral or written personal instructions to a Member of the Committee or staff. Proxies shall in no case be counted for establishing a quorum. NOMINATIONS In considering a nomination, the Committee shall conduct an investigation or review of the nominee's experience, qualifications, suitability, and integrity to serve in the position to which he or she has been nominated. In any hearings on the nomination, the nominee shall be called to testify under oath on all matters relating to his or her nomination for office. To aid in such investigation or review, each nominee may be required to submit a sworn detailed statement including biographical, financial, policy, and other information which the Committee may request. The Committee may specify which items in such statement are to be received on a confidential basis. HEARINGS (a)(1) The Chair of the Committee may initiate a hearing of the Committee on his or her authority or upon his or her approval of a request by any Member of the Committee. If such request is by the Ranking Member, a decision shall be communicated to the Ranking Member within 7 business days. Written notice of all hearings, including the title, a description of the hearing, and a tentative witness list shall be given at least 5 business days in advance, where practicable, to all Members of the Committee. (2) Hearings of the Committee shall not be scheduled outside the District of Columbia unless specifically authorized by the Chair and the Ranking Minority Member or by consent of a majority of the Committee. Such consent may be given informally, without a meeting, but must be in writing. [[Page S584]] (b)(1) Any Member of the Committee shall be empowered to administer the oath to any witness testifying as to fact. (2) The Chair and Ranking Member will negotiate the number of witnesses for each hearing, but in the absence of an agreement between the Chair and the Ranking Member the ratio between the majority and minority witnesses will be no less than 3-2 or 2-1 when a smaller panel is justified. Interrogation of witnesses at hearings shall be conducted on behalf of the Committee by Members of the Committee or such Committee staff as is authorized by the Chair or Ranking Minority Member. (3) Witnesses appearing before the Committee shall file with the Clerk of the Committee a written statement of the prepared testimony at least two business days in advance of the hearing at which the witness is to appear unless this requirement is waived by the Chair and the Ranking Minority Member. (c) Any witness summoned to a public or closed hearing may be accompanied by counsel of his or her own choosing, who shall be permitted while the witness is testifying to advise the witness of his or her legal rights. Failure to obtain counsel will not excuse the witness from appearing and testifying. (d) Subpoenas for the attendance of witnesses or the production of memoranda, documents, records, and other materials may be authorized by the Chair with the consent of the Ranking Minority Member or by the consent of a majority of the Members of the Committee. Such consent may be given informally, without a meeting, but must be in writing. The Chair may subpoena attendance or production without the consent of the Ranking Minority Member when the Chair has not received notification from the Ranking Minority Member of disapproval of the subpoena within 72 hours of being notified of the intended subpoena, excluding Saturdays, Sundays, and holidays. Subpoenas shall be issued by the Chair or by the Member of the Committee designated by him or her. A subpoena for the attendance of a witness shall state briefly the purpose of the hearing and the matter or matters to which the witness is expected to testify. A subpoena for the production of memoranda, documents, records, and other materials shall identify the papers or materials required to be produced with as much particularity as is practicable. (e) The Chair shall rule on any objections or assertions of privilege as to testimony or evidence in response to subpoenas or questions of Committee Members and staff in hearings. (f) Testimony may be submitted to the formal record for a period not less than two weeks following a hearing or roundtable, unless otherwise agreed to by Chair and Ranking Member. DEPOSITIONS At the direction of the Chair, with notification to the ranking minority member of not less than 72 hours, the staff is authorized to take depositions from witnesses. Such notices shall specify a time and place for examination, and the name of the Senator, staff officer or officers who will take the deposition. Any Committee member, or a member of the Committee staff designated by the Chair or ranking minority member, shall be given the opportunity to attend and participate in the taking of any deposition. Witnesses at depositions shall be examined under oath administered by an individual authorized by law to administer oaths, or administered by any member of the Committee if one is present. The transcript of a deposition shall be filed with the committee clerk. The transcript or any portion of the transcript shall only be made public either by vote of the majority or at the direction of the Chair after notifying the ranking minority member. CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION (a) No confidential testimony taken by, or confidential material presented to, the Committee in executive session, or any report of the proceedings of a closed hearing, or confidential testimony or material submitted pursuant to a subpoena, shall be made public, either in whole or in part or by way of summary, unless authorized by a majority of the Members. Other confidential material or testimony submitted to the Committee may be disclosed if authorized by the Chair with the consent of the Ranking Member. (b) Persons asserting confidentiality of documents or materials submitted to the Committee offices shall clearly designate them as such on their face. Designation of submissions as confidential does not prevent their use in furtherance of Committee business. MEDIA & BROADCASTING (a) At the discretion of the Chair, public meetings of the Committee may be televised, broadcasted, or recorded in whole or in part by a member of the Senate Press Gallery or an employee of the Senate. Any such person wishing to televise, broadcast, or record a Committee meeting must request approval of the Chair by submitting a written request to the Committee Office by 5 p.m. the day before the meeting. Notice of televised or broadcasted hearings shall be provided to the Ranking Minority Member as soon as practicable. (b) During public meetings of the Committee, any person using a camera, microphone, or other electronic equipment may not position or use the equipment in a way that interferes with the seating, vision, or hearing of Committee members or staff on the dais, or with the orderly process of the meeting. SUBCOMMITTEES The Committee shall not have standing subcommittees. AMENDMENT OF RULES The foregoing rules may be added to, modified or amended; provided, however, that not less than a majority of the entire Membership so determined at a regular meeting with due notice, or at a meeting specifically called for that purpose. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 14 (Wednesday, January 28, 2015)] [Senate] [Pages S583-S584] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] COMMITTEE ON SMALL BUSINESS AND ENTREPRENEURSHIP ______ RULES OF PROCEDURE Mr. VITTER.

Mr. President, today I honor the 100th anniversary of the U.S. Coast Guard, officially established on this day, January 28, 1915, when President Woodrow Wilson signed legislation merging the Revenue Cutter Service and the U.S. Life-Saving Service into one organization. The Coast Guard has a long and noble history, dating back to 1790, of defending the shores of our Nation. It remains a vital component of our national security infrastructure--performing law enforcement, lifesaving, and military duties. Whether it is intercepting drug smugglers in the Gulf of Mexico or rescuing stranded fishermen off the coast of Alaska, the Coast Guard always answers the call and performs its mission bravely. Our Nation is safer thanks to the work done by the brave men and women of the U.S. Coast Guard. I am honored that my home State of Alabama has a significant Coast Guard presence in the city of Mobile. U.S. Coast Guard Sector Mobile is home to over 200 Active-Duty military and civilian personnel who play a crucial role in enforcing our Nation's laws and providing maritime security along the gulf coast of Alabama, Mississippi, and Florida. Mobile is also home to one of the Coast Guard's largest units, the U.S. Coast Guard Aviation Training Center. The Aviation Training Center is home to roughly 600 Active-Duty military and civilian personnel, and it serves as the Coast Guard's aviation and capabilities development center--responsible for training Coast Guard pilots. It also serves as an operational Coast Guard air station, performing traditional Coast Guard aviation missions such as search and rescue, homeland security, and environmental protection in an area encompassing the Gulf of Mexico from the Louisiana-Texas border to the Florida panhandle. I am proud of what these Coast Guard installations do to protect the people of the gulf coast and the Nation as a whole. I would like to thank the U.S. Coast Guard for everything it does to enhance and ensure the national security of the United States, and I congratulate and honor the Coast Guard on its 100th anniversary. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 14 (Wednesday, January 28, 2015)] [Senate] [Page S585] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] RECOGNIZING THE U.S. COAST GUARD Mr. SESSIONS.

CREC-2015-01-28-pt1-PgS585-2,CREC-2015-01-28,114,SUPPORTING TEACHERS AND SCHOOL LEADERS,"[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 14 (Wednesday, January 28, 2015)] [Senate] [Pages S585-S586] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] SUPPORTING TEACHERS AND SCHOOL LEADERS Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a copy of my remarks at the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee hearing yesterday be printed in the Record. There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows: Supporting Teachers and School Leaders Today's hearing is all about better teaching--how we can create an environment so teachers, principals, and other leaders can succeed. Governors around the country are focused on one issue: better jobs for the citizens in their states. And it doesn't take very long for a governor, which I once was, to come to the conclusion that better schools mean better jobs and a better life. Since no one has figured out how to pass a better parents law, it doesn't take long to realize how important a great teacher is. I certainly came to that conclusion quickly in 1984, when I was governor of Tennessee and I considered the holy grail of K-12 education to be finding a fair way to encourage and reward outstanding teaching. I spent a year and a half, devoting 70 percent of my time, persuading the legislature to establish a career ladder--a master teacher program that 10,000 teachers voluntarily climbed. They were paid more and had the opportunity for 10- and 11-month contracts. Tennessee became the first state in the nation to pay teachers more for teaching well. Rarely a week goes by that a teacher doesn't stop me and say, ``Thank you for the master teacher program.'' It was not easy. A year before I'd been in a meeting of southern governors and one of them said, ``Who's gonna be brave enough to take on the teachers union?'' I had a year and a half brawl with the National Education Association before I could pass our teacher evaluation program. Since then, there's been an explosion of efforts to answer these questions a great number of states and school districts are tackling: How do we determine who is an effective teacher? How do we relate student achievement to teacher effectiveness? And, having decided that, how do we reward and support outstanding teaching so we don't lose our best teachers? In 1987, the National Board for Professional Teaching Standards began to strengthen standards in teaching and professionalize the teaching workforce. To date, more than 110,000 teachers in all 50 states and DC have achieved National Board Certification. In 2006, the Teacher Incentive Fund was created to help states and districts create performance-based compensation system for teachers based on evaluation results. According to the National Center on Teacher Quality, in 2014: 27 states required annual evaluations for all teachers 44 states required annual evaluations for new teachers 35 states required student achievement and/or student growth to be a significant or the most significant measure of teacher performance. So when I came to Washington as a United States Senator in 2003, everyone expected--since I thought rewarding outstanding teaching was the Holy Grail--that I would make [[Page S586]] everyone do it. To the surprise of some, my answer was no-- you can't do it from Washington. Nevertheless, over the last 10 years, Washington has tried. Here is how: No Child Left Behind told states that all teachers of core academic subjects needed to be ``Highly Qualified'' by 2006, and it prescribed that definition in a very bureaucratic manner. That hasn't worked. I don't know of many people who really want to keep that outdated definition--even Secretary Duncan waived the requirements related to highly qualified teachers when he granted waivers to 43 states, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico. Unfortunately, the Secretary replaced those requirements with a new mandate requiring teacher evaluation systems-- first in Race to the Top, which gave nearly $4.4 billion to states, and second, in the waivers. To get a waiver from No Child Left Behind, a state and each local school district must develop a teacher and principal evaluation system with seven required elements--such as that it will use at least three performance levels; and will use multiple measures, including student growth; and will include guidelines and supports for implementation--and each element must be approved by the U.S. Department of Education. The problem is that, after 30 years, we are still figuring out how to do this. Our research work on measuring growth in student achievement and relating it fairly to teacher effectiveness was started in 1984, but former Institute of Education Science Director Russ Whitehurst told the New York Times in 2012 that states ``are racing ahead based on promises made to Washington or local political imperatives that prioritize an unwavering commitment to unproven approaches. There's a lot we don't know about how to evaluate teachers reliably and how to use that information to improve instruction and learning.'' The second problem is that some states haven't been willing or able to implement the systems the way the U.S. Department of Education wants them to. California, Iowa, and Washington state had their waiver requests denied or revoked over the issue of teacher evaluations. In Iowa's case, it was because the state legislature wouldn't pass a law that satisfied the requirement that allowed for teachers and principals to be placed into at least three performance levels--not effective, effective, and highly effective. California simply ignored the Administration's conditions when they applied for a waiver, particularly the requirement that teacher evaluation systems be based significantly on the results of state standardized tests. In April, Washington state's waiver was revoked by Secretary Duncan because their state legislature would not pass legislation requiring standardized test results to be used in teacher and principal evaluation systems--instead the law in Washington allows local school districts to decide which tests they use. Whether or not this federal interference with state education law offends your sense of federalism, like it does mine, it has proved impractical. The federal government in its well-intentioned way, trying to say, ``We want better teachers, and we're going to tell you exactly how to do it, and you must do it now'' has created an enormous backlash. It's made even harder something that was already hard. Even in Tennessee, despite 30 years of experience and nearly $500 million in Race to the Top funding, the implementation of a new teacher evaluation system has been described in an article in my hometown newspaper as ``contentious.'' Given all of the great progress that states and local school districts have made on standards, accountability, tests, and teacher evaluation over the last 30 years--you'll get a lot more progress with a lot less opposition if you leave those decisions there. I think we should return to states and local school districts decisions for measuring the progress of our schools and for evaluating and measuring the effectiveness of teachers. I know it is tempting to try to improve teachers from Washington. I also hear from governors and school superintendents who say that if ``Washington doesn't make us do it, the teachers unions and opponents from the right will make it impossible to have good evaluation systems and better teachers.'' And I understand what they're saying. After I left office, the NEA watered down Tennessee's Master Teacher program. Nevertheless, the Chairman's Staff Discussion draft eliminates the Highly Qualified Teacher requirements and definition, and allows states to decide the licenses and credentials that they are going to require their teachers to have. And despite my personal support for teacher evaluation, the draft doesn't mandate teacher and principal evaluations. Rather, it enables States to use the more than $2.5 billion under Title II to develop, implement, or improve these evaluation systems. In a state like Tennessee, that would mean $39 million potentially available for continuing the work Tennessee has well underway for evaluating teachers, including linking performance and student achievement. In addition, it would expand one of the provisions in No Child Left behind--the Teacher Incentive Fund that Secretary Spellings recommended putting into law and that Secretary Duncan said, in testimony before the HELP Committee in January 2009, was ``One of the best things I think Secretary Spellings has done . . . the more we can reward excellence, the more we can incentivize excellence, the more we can get our best teachers to work in those hard-to-staff schools and communities, the better our students are going to do.'' And third, it would emphasize the idea of a Secretary's report card--calling considerable attention to the bully pulpit a secretary or president has to call attention to states that are succeeding or failing. For example, I remember President Reagan visited Farragut High School in Knoxville in 1984 to call attention to our Master Teacher program. It caused the Democratic speaker of our House of Representatives to say, ``This is the American way,'' and come up with an amendment to my proposal that was critical to its passage. President Reagan didn't order every other state to do what Tennessee was doing, but the president's bully pulpit made a real difference. Thomas Friedman recently told a group of senators that one of his two rules of life is that he's never met anyone who washed a rented car. In other words, people take care of what they own. My experience is that finding a way to fairly reward better teaching is the holy grail of K-12 education--but Washington will get the best long-term result by creating an environment in which states and communities are encouraged, not ordered, to evaluate teachers. Let's not mandate it from Washington if we want them to own it and make it work. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 14 (Wednesday, January 28, 2015)] [Senate] [Pages S585-S586] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] SUPPORTING TEACHERS AND SCHOOL LEADERS Mr. ALEXANDER.

whitehurst told the new york times in 2012 that states ``are racing ahead based on promises made to washington or local political imperatives that prioritize an unwavering commitment to unproven approaches. there's a lot we don't know about how to evaluate teachers reliably and how to use that information to improve instruction and learning.'' the second problem is that some states haven't been willing or able to implement the systems the way the u.s. department of education wants them to. california, iowa, and washington state had their waiver requests denied or revoked over the issue of teacher evaluations. in iowa's case, it was because the state legislature wouldn't pass a law that satisfied the requirement that allowed for teachers and principals to be placed into at least three performance levels--not effective, effective, and highly effective. california simply ignored the administration's conditions when they applied for a waiver, particularly the requirement that teacher evaluation systems be based significantly on the results of state standardized tests. in april, washington state's waiver was revoked by secretary duncan because their state legislature would not pass legislation requiring standardized test results to be used in teacher and principal evaluation systems--instead the law in washington allows local school districts to decide which tests they use. whether or not this federal interference with state education law offends your sense of federalism, like it does mine, it has proved impractical. the federal government in its well-intentioned way, trying to say, ``we want better teachers, and we're going to tell you exactly how to do it, and you must do it now'' has created an enormous backlash. it's made even harder something that was already hard. even in tennessee, despite 30 years of experience and nearly $500 million in race to the top funding, the implementation of a new teacher evaluation system has been described in an article in my hometown newspaper as ``contentious.'' given all of the great progress that states and local school districts have made on standards, accountability, tests, and teacher evaluation over the last 30 years--you'll get a lot more progress with a lot less opposition if you leave those decisions there. i think we should return to states and local school districts decisions for measuring the progress of our schools and for evaluating and measuring the effectiveness of teachers. i know it is tempting to try to improve teachers from washington. i also hear from governors and school superintendents who say that if ``washington doesn't make us do it, the teachers unions and opponents from the right will make it impossible to have good evaluation systems and better teachers.'' and i understand what they're saying. after i left office, the nea watered down tennessee's master teacher program. nevertheless, the chairman's staff discussion draft eliminates the highly qualified teacher requirements and definition, and allows states to decide the licenses and credentials that they are going to require their teachers to have. and despite my personal support for teacher evaluation, the draft doesn't mandate teacher and principal evaluations. rather, it enables states to use the more than $2.5 billion under title ii to develop, implement, or improve these evaluation systems. in a state like tennessee, that would mean $39 million potentially available for continuing the work tennessee has well underway for evaluating teachers, including linking performance and student achievement. in addition, it would expand one of the provisions in no child left behind--the teacher incentive fund that secretary spellings recommended putting into law and that secretary duncan said, in testimony before the help committee in january 2009, was ``one of the best things i think secretary spellings has done . . . the more we can reward excellence, the more we can incentivize excellence, the more we can get our best teachers to work in those hard-to-staff schools and communities, the better our students are going to do.'' and third, it would emphasize the idea of a secretary's report card--calling considerable attention to the bully pulpit a secretary or president has to call attention to states that are succeeding or failing. for example, i remember president reagan visited farragut high school in knoxville in 1984 to call attention to our master teacher program. it caused the democratic speaker of our house of representatives to say, ``this is the american way,'' and come up with an amendment to my proposal that was critical to its passage. president reagan didn't order every other state to do what tennessee was doing, but the president's bully pulpit made a real difference. thomas friedman recently told a group of senators that one of his two rules of life is that he's never met anyone who washed a rented car. in other words, people take care of what they own. my experience is that finding a way to fairly reward better teaching is the holy grail of k-12 education--but washington will get the best long-term result by creating an environment in which states and communities are encouraged, not ordered, to evaluate teachers. let's not mandate it from washington if we want them to own it and make it work.

CREC-2015-01-28-pt1-PgS591,CREC-2015-01-28,114,STATEMENTS ON INTRODUCED BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS,"[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 14 (Wednesday, January 28, 2015)] [Senate] [Pages S591-S603] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] STATEMENTS ON INTRODUCED BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS By Mr. BARRASSO (for himself, Mr. Tester, and Ms. Murkowski): S. 286. A bill to amend the Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act to provide further self-governance by Indian tribes, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Indian Affairs. Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation that would further advance the goals of Indian self-governance and self-determination. The legislation is entitled, the Department of the Interior Self-Governance Act of 2015. I thank my colleagues who have joined me as original cosponsors of this legislation, including Indian Affairs Committee Vice Chairman Senator Tester and Senator Murkowski. One of the cornerstones of Federal Indian policy is the concept of tribal self-determination and self-governance. In 1975, Congress passed the Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act. The Act, Public Law No. 93-638 authorizes Indian tribes to carry out certain Federal Indian programs, activities, and functions within the Department of the Interior and the Department of the Health and Human Services. Self-governance is both a policy and procedure whereby, pursuant to the Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act, Indian tribes administer Federal programs for Indians. Tribal administration of these programs promotes local control and decision-making for these important programs that affect the local tribal community. Tribal administration through these processes also serves to reduce Federal bureaucracy. This legislation promotes accountability by maintaining requirements that Indian tribes must demonstrate a higher level of responsible governance and administration. Good governance is vital for continuing this policy. The act gives authority to the Secretaries of the Interior and Health and Human Services to enter into 638 contracts and self-governance compacts with Indian tribes. Each 638 contact or self-governance compact identifies functions and activities to be carried out by the tribe, as well as any administrative, reporting, or other requirements that must be followed. Despite the increased flexibility in the tribal self-governance program, Indian tribes have stated to Congress that the Department of the Interior has, for many years, resisted the efforts by tribes to carry out Interior programs. Without additional reforms, the success of the Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act cannot reach its full potential. The bill intends to clarify and expand the provisions of the Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act. This legislation will give tribes a better opportunity to advance the policy of tribal self- governance by authorizing the Secretary of the Interior to select up to 50 new Indian tribes to participate in the tribal self-governance program. In addition, the bill clarifies that provisions of water settlements and their authorizing legislation will not be affected by the self-governance amendments. Furthermore, nothing in this will expand or limit programs eligible for self-governance compacts beyond those already authorized under current law. This bipartisan bill is supported by Indian tribes across the country. I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.

(a) Findings.--Congress finds that-- (1) the safety of the food supply of the United States is vital to the public health, to public confidence in the food supply, and to the success of the food sector of the Nation's economy; (2) lapses in the protection of the food supply and loss of public confidence in food safety are damaging to consumers and the food industry, and place a burden on interstate commerce; (3) the safety and security of the food supply requires an integrated, systemwide approach to preventing foodborne illness, a thorough and broad-based approach to basic and applied research, and intensive, effective, and efficient management of the Nation's food safety program; (4) the task of preserving the safety of the food supply of the United States faces tremendous pressures with regard to-- (A) emerging pathogens and other contaminants and the ability to detect all forms of contamination; (B) an aging and immune-compromised population, with a growing number of people at high risk for foodborne illnesses, including infants and children; (C) a concern regarding food fraud for economic gain, especially with mislabeling and intentionally misleading claims; (D) an increasing volume of imported food, without adequate monitoring and inspection; and (E) maintenance of rigorous inspection of the domestic food processing and food service industries; (5) Federal food safety standard setting, inspection, enforcement, and research efforts should be based on the best available science and public health considerations and food safety resources should be systematically deployed in ways that most effectively prevent foodborne illness; (6) the Federal food safety system is fragmented, with at least 15 Federal agencies sharing responsibility for food safety, and operates under laws that do not reflect current conditions in the food system or current scientific knowledge about the cause and prevention of foodborne illness; (7) the fragmented Federal food safety system and outdated laws preclude an integrated, systemwide approach to preventing foodborne illness, to the effective and efficient operation of the Nation's food safety program, and to the most beneficial deployment of food safety resources; (8) the National Academy of Sciences recommended in the report ``Ensuring Safe Food from Production to Consumption'' that Congress establish by statute a unified and central framework for managing Federal food safety programs, and recommended modifying Federal statutes so that inspection, enforcement, and research efforts are based on scientifically supportable assessments of risks to public health; and (9) the lack of a single focal point for food safety leadership in the United States undercuts the ability of the United States to exert food safety leadership internationally, which is detrimental to the public health and the international trade interests of the United States. (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are-- (1) to establish a single agency to be known as the ``Food Safety Administration'' to-- (A) regulate food safety and related labeling to strengthen the protection of the public health; (B) ensure that food facilities fulfill their responsibility to produce food in a manner that protects the public health of all people in the United States; (C) lead an integrated, systemwide approach to food safety and to make more effective and efficient use of resources to prevent foodborne illness; (D) provide a single focal point for food safety leadership, both nationally and internationally; and (E) provide an integrated food safety research capability, utilizing internally-generated, scientifically and statistically valid studies, in cooperation with academic institutions and other scientific entities of the Federal and State governments, to achieve the continuous improvement of research on foodborne illness and contaminants; (2) to transfer to the Food Safety Administration the food safety, labeling, inspection, and enforcement functions that, as of the day before the effective date of this Act, are performed by other Federal agencies; and (3) to modernize and strengthen the Federal food safety laws to achieve more effective application and efficient management of the laws for the protection and improvement of public health.

A bill to amend the National Labor Relations Act to reform the National Labor Relations Board, the Office of the General Counsel, and the process for appellate review, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions. Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, today I am reintroducing the NLRB Reform Act with Senator McConnell. Our legislation will change the National Labor Relations Board from an advocate to an umpire. The board was created 80 years ago to act as an impartial umpire in labor disputes that threaten the free flow of commerce. The board's decisions affect about 85 million private-sector workers and 5.7 million private-sector employers. But over time, the board has become an advocate for one interest group over the other--changing positions with each new administration. There are three significant problems the board faces today: First, the biggest problem is partisan advocacy. Today, the majority of the 5-member board is made up of appointees who follow the president's political leanings. President Obama has appointed 3 labor union lawyers to the board. Second, the board has a freewheeling advocate for a general counsel. The board's most recent general counsels have been exceeding their statutory authority and bringing questionable cases that threaten American jobs. Third, it is too slow to resolve disputes. Right now, 145 cases, that is 32 percent of the board's caseload, have been pending for more than a year. Our bill provides three fixes. First, it ends partisan advocacy. A 6-member board of 3 Republicans and 3 Democrats and a majority of 4 will require both sides to find a middle ground. Second, it reins in the general counsel. Businesses and unions would be able to challenge complaints filed by the General Counsel in Federal district court, and they will have greater transparency about the basis and legal reasoning of charges brought by the General Counsel. Third, it encourages timely decisions in two ways. First, either party in a case before the board may appeal to a Federal Court of Appeals if the board fails to reach a decision in their case within one year. Second, funding for the entire NLRB would be reduced by 20 percent if the board is not able to decide 90 percent of its cases within one year over the first 2-year period post-reform. Our bill would offer these solutions without taking away rights or remedies for any employee, business, or union. While the increasing partisanship at the board has occurred in Republican administrations as well as Democrat administrations, it has reached a climax in this administration. Three of President Obama's recent nominees came to the board from a major labor union's leadership. One labor law professor at a major university recently said that she can't even use the most recent textbook, instead she has to resort to handing out NLRB decisions. The decisions are coming out so rapidly and this NLRB is venturing into new territory with efforts at rulemaking. This is no way to maintain a national labor law policy. ______ By Mr. DURBIN (for himself, Mr. Brown, Ms. Klobuchar, Mrs. Boxer, Mr. Markey, Mr. Cardin, Mr. Franken, Mr. Casey, and Mr. Schumer): S. 289.

A bill to amend section 2259 of title 18, United States Code, and for other purposes; to the Committee on the Judiciary. Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation to help victims of child pornography, one of society's most heinous crimes. I am joined by 34 Senators on both sides of the aisle. I hope this legislation will soon become law. Sexually exploiting a child distorts her life and leaves scars long after the abuse itself ends and the abuser has been prosecuted. For this reason, the Violence Against Women Act includes a provision requiring that in such cases a defendant must pay restitution to cover all of the victim's losses. Those losses can include future lost income as well as medical care, mental health counseling, and therapy. Child pornography isn't merely the record of a child's sexual abuse, it is itself an instance of abuse. The ongoing trafficking and those images pile harm upon harm. As a result, it becomes even more difficult for a victim to put together a life that was shattered before it had barely begun. As the Supreme Court has recognized, ``every viewing of child pornography is a repetition of the victim's abuse.'' The current restitution statute was enacted in 1994, before the Internet became prime real estate for trafficking of child pornography. It puts victims in an impossible bind. In a case decided last spring, the Supreme Court said the current restitution statute requires the victim to prove how much of her losses were specifically caused by a single defendant's possession of her images. With a burden like that, it is no wonder that under this statute victims receive no restitution at all in more than three-quarters of child pornography cases. The cruel irony today is that the more individuals who participate in harming a victim, the less any of them is financially responsible, and the less timely help the victim will receive. Perpetrators are easily lost in a crowd. [[Page S603]] The bill I introduce today will amend the restitution statute so that it works for child pornography victims. It is named for Amy and Vicky, brave women who are the victims of two of the most widely viewed child pornography series in the world. Amy's case went before the Supreme Court last year, and my staff worked with the legal team for these women in developing this bill. I want to mention in particular James Marsh, whose legal practice in New York focuses exclusively on helping victims; Professor Paul Cassell at the University of Utah, who argued Amy's case before the Supreme Court; and Carol Hepburn, who practices law in Seattle on behalf of Vicky and many other victims. This bill changes the current restitution statute in three important ways so that it works for child pornography victims. First, it gives judges options for determining a victim's losses and calculating restitution. Second, it gives judges the ability to impose restitution on defendants in different kinds of cases to ensure that victims actually receive meaningful restitution. Third, it shifts the burden of chasing defendants all over the country from victims to defendants who can share the restitution costs with other defendants. Both Amy and Vicky personally support this bill. I am also pleased that many national victim advocacy groups support this bill, including the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, the National Organization for Victim Assistance, the National Crime Victim Law Institute, the National Center for Victims of Crime, and the National Task Force to End Sexual and Domestic Violence Against Women. Last October I received a letter endorsing this bill signed by the attorneys general of 43 States, 22 Republicans and 21 Democrats. I want to share with my colleagues the story of a young man, a Utah resident, who uses the name Andy. Between the ages of 7 and 12, he was sexually abused by a trusted adult and family friend. Dr. David Corwin, the University of Utah child psychologist who examined him, said that based on 30 years of experience with child sexual abuse victims, the images and videos of Andy's abuse were the most disturbing he had ever seen. According to the FBI, the images and videos created from Andy's abuse are one of the most widely distributed boy series in the country. The FBI says that as of last month Andy is a named victim in 726 cases. He has been granted restitution in 24 of the 101 cases in which he requested it and has collected anything at all in only 2 cases. Andy wrote to support the bill I am introducing today. He addresses letters to the Members of the Congress, which means that he is writing to each Member of this body. Andy says this legislation will prevent him from having to spend decades trying to recover minuscule amounts of restitution from hundreds, if not thousands of defendants all over the country. I want my colleagues to hear his words: My images may never be taken off the Internet and may always be circulating around the country. At least with this congressional change, I can start to heal, learn how to handle my circumstances, and re-build my life. There are many more Amys, Vickys, and Andys than any of us want to admit, and they need our help. In our system of government, we have the responsibility to pass or change legislation to address issues and problems Americans face. All the courts could do was confirm that the current restitution statute is no longer suited to help child pornography victims. It is now up to us to do our duty and enact a statute that will. Amy, Vicky, and Andy are counting on us, and we must not let them down. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 14 (Wednesday, January 28, 2015)] [Senate] [Pages S591-S603] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] STATEMENTS ON INTRODUCED BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS By Mr. BARRASSO (for himself, Mr. Tester, and Ms. Murkowski): S. 286. A bill to amend the Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act to provide further self-governance by Indian tribes, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Indian Affairs. Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation that would further advance the goals of Indian self-governance and self-determination. The legislation is entitled, the Department of the Interior Self-Governance Act of 2015. I thank my colleagues who have joined me as original cosponsors of this legislation, including Indian Affairs Committee Vice Chairman Senator Tester and Senator Murkowski. One of the cornerstones of Federal Indian policy is the concept of tribal self-determination and self-governance. In 1975, Congress passed the Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act. The Act, Public Law No. 93-638 authorizes Indian tribes to carry out certain Federal Indian programs, activities, and functions within the Department of the Interior and the Department of the Health and Human Services. Self-governance is both a policy and procedure whereby, pursuant to the Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act, Indian tribes administer Federal programs for Indians. Tribal administration of these programs promotes local control and decision-making for these important programs that affect the local tribal community. Tribal administration through these processes also serves to reduce Federal bureaucracy. This legislation promotes accountability by maintaining requirements that Indian tribes must demonstrate a higher level of responsible governance and administration. Good governance is vital for continuing this policy. The act gives authority to the Secretaries of the Interior and Health and Human Services to enter into 638 contracts and self-governance compacts with Indian tribes. Each 638 contact or self-governance compact identifies functions and activities to be carried out by the tribe, as well as any administrative, reporting, or other requirements that must be followed. Despite the increased flexibility in the tribal self-governance program, Indian tribes have stated to Congress that the Department of the Interior has, for many years, resisted the efforts by tribes to carry out Interior programs. Without additional reforms, the success of the Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act cannot reach its full potential. The bill intends to clarify and expand the provisions of the Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act. This legislation will give tribes a better opportunity to advance the policy of tribal self- governance by authorizing the Secretary of the Interior to select up to 50 new Indian tribes to participate in the tribal self-governance program. In addition, the bill clarifies that provisions of water settlements and their authorizing legislation will not be affected by the self-governance amendments. Furthermore, nothing in this will expand or limit programs eligible for self-governance compacts beyond those already authorized under current law. This bipartisan bill is supported by Indian tribes across the country. I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.

(a) Findings.--Congress finds that-- (1) the safety of the food supply of the United States is vital to the public health, to public confidence in the food supply, and to the success of the food sector of the Nation's economy; (2) lapses in the protection of the food supply and loss of public confidence in food safety are damaging to consumers and the food industry, and place a burden on interstate commerce; (3) the safety and security of the food supply requires an integrated, systemwide approach to preventing foodborne illness, a thorough and broad-based approach to basic and applied research, and intensive, effective, and efficient management of the Nation's food safety program; (4) the task of preserving the safety of the food supply of the United States faces tremendous pressures with regard to-- (A) emerging pathogens and other contaminants and the ability to detect all forms of contamination; (B) an aging and immune-compromised population, with a growing number of people at high risk for foodborne illnesses, including infants and children; (C) a concern regarding food fraud for economic gain, especially with mislabeling and intentionally misleading claims; (D) an increasing volume of imported food, without adequate monitoring and inspection; and (E) maintenance of rigorous inspection of the domestic food processing and food service industries; (5) Federal food safety standard setting, inspection, enforcement, and research efforts should be based on the best available science and public health considerations and food safety resources should be systematically deployed in ways that most effectively prevent foodborne illness; (6) the Federal food safety system is fragmented, with at least 15 Federal agencies sharing responsibility for food safety, and operates under laws that do not reflect current conditions in the food system or current scientific knowledge about the cause and prevention of foodborne illness; (7) the fragmented Federal food safety system and outdated laws preclude an integrated, systemwide approach to preventing foodborne illness, to the effective and efficient operation of the Nation's food safety program, and to the most beneficial deployment of food safety resources; (8) the National Academy of Sciences recommended in the report ``Ensuring Safe Food from Production to Consumption'' that Congress establish by statute a unified and central framework for managing Federal food safety programs, and recommended modifying Federal statutes so that inspection, enforcement, and research efforts are based on scientifically supportable assessments of risks to public health; and (9) the lack of a single focal point for food safety leadership in the United States undercuts the ability of the United States to exert food safety leadership internationally, which is detrimental to the public health and the international trade interests of the United States. (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are-- (1) to establish a single agency to be known as the ``Food Safety Administration'' to-- (A) regulate food safety and related labeling to strengthen the protection of the public health; (B) ensure that food facilities fulfill their responsibility to produce food in a manner that protects the public health of all people in the United States; (C) lead an integrated, systemwide approach to food safety and to make more effective and efficient use of resources to prevent foodborne illness; (D) provide a single focal point for food safety leadership, both nationally and internationally; and (E) provide an integrated food safety research capability, utilizing internally-generated, scientifically and statistically valid studies, in cooperation with academic institutions and other scientific entities of the Federal and State governments, to achieve the continuous improvement of research on foodborne illness and contaminants; (2) to transfer to the Food Safety Administration the food safety, labeling, inspection, and enforcement functions that, as of the day before the effective date of this Act, are performed by other Federal agencies; and (3) to modernize and strengthen the Federal food safety laws to achieve more effective application and efficient management of the laws for the protection and improvement of public health.

A bill to amend the National Labor Relations Act to reform the National Labor Relations Board, the Office of the General Counsel, and the process for appellate review, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions. Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, today I am reintroducing the NLRB Reform Act with Senator McConnell. Our legislation will change the National Labor Relations Board from an advocate to an umpire. The board was created 80 years ago to act as an impartial umpire in labor disputes that threaten the free flow of commerce. The board's decisions affect about 85 million private-sector workers and 5.7 million private-sector employers. But over time, the board has become an advocate for one interest group over the other--changing positions with each new administration. There are three significant problems the board faces today: First, the biggest problem is partisan advocacy. Today, the majority of the 5-member board is made up of appointees who follow the president's political leanings. President Obama has appointed 3 labor union lawyers to the board. Second, the board has a freewheeling advocate for a general counsel. The board's most recent general counsels have been exceeding their statutory authority and bringing questionable cases that threaten American jobs. Third, it is too slow to resolve disputes. Right now, 145 cases, that is 32 percent of the board's caseload, have been pending for more than a year. Our bill provides three fixes. First, it ends partisan advocacy. A 6-member board of 3 Republicans and 3 Democrats and a majority of 4 will require both sides to find a middle ground. Second, it reins in the general counsel. Businesses and unions would be able to challenge complaints filed by the General Counsel in Federal district court, and they will have greater transparency about the basis and legal reasoning of charges brought by the General Counsel. Third, it encourages timely decisions in two ways. First, either party in a case before the board may appeal to a Federal Court of Appeals if the board fails to reach a decision in their case within one year. Second, funding for the entire NLRB would be reduced by 20 percent if the board is not able to decide 90 percent of its cases within one year over the first 2-year period post-reform. Our bill would offer these solutions without taking away rights or remedies for any employee, business, or union. While the increasing partisanship at the board has occurred in Republican administrations as well as Democrat administrations, it has reached a climax in this administration. Three of President Obama's recent nominees came to the board from a major labor union's leadership. One labor law professor at a major university recently said that she can't even use the most recent textbook, instead she has to resort to handing out NLRB decisions. The decisions are coming out so rapidly and this NLRB is venturing into new territory with efforts at rulemaking. This is no way to maintain a national labor law policy. ______ By Mr. DURBIN (for himself, Mr. Brown, Ms. Klobuchar, Mrs. Boxer, Mr. Markey, Mr. Cardin, Mr. Franken, Mr. Casey, and Mr. Schumer): S. 289.

A bill to amend section 2259 of title 18, United States Code, and for other purposes; to the Committee on the Judiciary. Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation to help victims of child pornography, one of society's most heinous crimes. I am joined by 34 Senators on both sides of the aisle. I hope this legislation will soon become law. Sexually exploiting a child distorts her life and leaves scars long after the abuse itself ends and the abuser has been prosecuted. For this reason, the Violence Against Women Act includes a provision requiring that in such cases a defendant must pay restitution to cover all of the victim's losses. Those losses can include future lost income as well as medical care, mental health counseling, and therapy. Child pornography isn't merely the record of a child's sexual abuse, it is itself an instance of abuse. The ongoing trafficking and those images pile harm upon harm. As a result, it becomes even more difficult for a victim to put together a life that was shattered before it had barely begun. As the Supreme Court has recognized, ``every viewing of child pornography is a repetition of the victim's abuse.'' The current restitution statute was enacted in 1994, before the Internet became prime real estate for trafficking of child pornography. It puts victims in an impossible bind. In a case decided last spring, the Supreme Court said the current restitution statute requires the victim to prove how much of her losses were specifically caused by a single defendant's possession of her images. With a burden like that, it is no wonder that under this statute victims receive no restitution at all in more than three-quarters of child pornography cases. The cruel irony today is that the more individuals who participate in harming a victim, the less any of them is financially responsible, and the less timely help the victim will receive. Perpetrators are easily lost in a crowd. [[Page S603]] The bill I introduce today will amend the restitution statute so that it works for child pornography victims. It is named for Amy and Vicky, brave women who are the victims of two of the most widely viewed child pornography series in the world. Amy's case went before the Supreme Court last year, and my staff worked with the legal team for these women in developing this bill. I want to mention in particular James Marsh, whose legal practice in New York focuses exclusively on helping victims; Professor Paul Cassell at the University of Utah, who argued Amy's case before the Supreme Court; and Carol Hepburn, who practices law in Seattle on behalf of Vicky and many other victims. This bill changes the current restitution statute in three important ways so that it works for child pornography victims. First, it gives judges options for determining a victim's losses and calculating restitution. Second, it gives judges the ability to impose restitution on defendants in different kinds of cases to ensure that victims actually receive meaningful restitution. Third, it shifts the burden of chasing defendants all over the country from victims to defendants who can share the restitution costs with other defendants. Both Amy and Vicky personally support this bill. I am also pleased that many national victim advocacy groups support this bill, including the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, the National Organization for Victim Assistance, the National Crime Victim Law Institute, the National Center for Victims of Crime, and the National Task Force to End Sexual and Domestic Violence Against Women. Last October I received a letter endorsing this bill signed by the attorneys general of 43 States, 22 Republicans and 21 Democrats. I want to share with my colleagues the story of a young man, a Utah resident, who uses the name Andy. Between the ages of 7 and 12, he was sexually abused by a trusted adult and family friend. Dr. David Corwin, the University of Utah child psychologist who examined him, said that based on 30 years of experience with child sexual abuse victims, the images and videos of Andy's abuse were the most disturbing he had ever seen. According to the FBI, the images and videos created from Andy's abuse are one of the most widely distributed boy series in the country. The FBI says that as of last month Andy is a named victim in 726 cases. He has been granted restitution in 24 of the 101 cases in which he requested it and has collected anything at all in only 2 cases. Andy wrote to support the bill I am introducing today. He addresses letters to the Members of the Congress, which means that he is writing to each Member of this body. Andy says this legislation will prevent him from having to spend decades trying to recover minuscule amounts of restitution from hundreds, if not thousands of defendants all over the country. I want my colleagues to hear his words: My images may never be taken off the Internet and may always be circulating around the country. At least with this congressional change, I can start to heal, learn how to handle my circumstances, and re-build my life. There are many more Amys, Vickys, and Andys than any of us want to admit, and they need our help. In our system of government, we have the responsibility to pass or change legislation to address issues and problems Americans face. All the courts could do was confirm that the current restitution statute is no longer suited to help child pornography victims. It is now up to us to do our duty and enact a statute that will. Amy, Vicky, and Andy are counting on us, and we must not let them down. ____________________","Congressional Record, Volume 161 Issue 14 (Wednesday, January 28, 2015) [Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 14 (Wednesday, January 28, 2015)] [Senate] [Pages S591-S603] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] STATEMENTS ON INTRODUCED BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS By Mr. BARRASSO (for himself, Mr. Tester, and Ms. Murkowski): S. 286. A bill to amend the Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act to provide further self-governance by Indian tribes, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Indian Affairs. Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation that would further advance the goals of Indian self-governance and self-determination. The legislation is entitled, the Department of the Interior Self-Governance Act of 2015. I thank my colleagues who have joined me as original cosponsors of this legislation, including Indian Affairs Committee Vice Chairman Senator Tester and Senator Murkowski. One of the cornerstones of Federal Indian policy is the concept of tribal self-determination and self-governance. In 1975, Congress passed the Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act. The Act, Public Law No. 93-638 authorizes Indian tribes to carry out certain Federal Indian programs, activities, and functions within the Department of the Interior and the Department of the Health and Human Services. Self-governance is both a policy and procedure whereby, pursuant to the Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act, Indian tribes administer Federal programs for Indians. Tribal administration of these programs promotes local control and decision-making for these important programs that affect the local tribal community. Tribal administration through these processes also serves to reduce Federal bureaucracy. This legislation promotes accountability by maintaining requirements that Indian tribes must demonstrate a higher level of responsible governance and administration. Good governance is vital for continuing this policy. The act gives authority to the Secretaries of the Interior and Health and Human Services to enter into 638 contracts and self-governance compacts with Indian tribes. Each 638 contact or self-governance compact identifies functions and activities to be carried out by the tribe, as well as any administrative, reporting, or other requirements that must be followed. Despite the increased flexibility in the tribal self-governance program, Indian tribes have stated to Congress that the Department of the Interior has, for many years, resisted the efforts by tribes to carry out Interior programs. Without additional reforms, the success of the Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act cannot reach its full potential. The bill intends to clarify and expand the provisions of the Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act. This legislation will give tribes a better opportunity to advance the policy of tribal self- governance by authorizing the Secretary of the Interior to select up to 50 new Indian tribes to participate in the tribal self-governance program. In addition, the bill clarifies that provisions of water settlements and their authorizing legislation will not be affected by the self-governance amendments. Furthermore, nothing in this will expand or limit programs eligible for self-governance compacts beyond those already authorized under current law. This bipartisan bill is supported by Indian tribes across the country. I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.

(a) Findings.--Congress finds that-- (1) the safety of the food supply of the United States is vital to the public health, to public confidence in the food supply, and to the success of the food sector of the Nation's economy; (2) lapses in the protection of the food supply and loss of public confidence in food safety are damaging to consumers and the food industry, and place a burden on interstate commerce; (3) the safety and security of the food supply requires an integrated, systemwide approach to preventing foodborne illness, a thorough and broad-based approach to basic and applied research, and intensive, effective, and efficient management of the Nation's food safety program; (4) the task of preserving the safety of the food supply of the United States faces tremendous pressures with regard to-- (A) emerging pathogens and other contaminants and the ability to detect all forms of contamination; (B) an aging and immune-compromised population, with a growing number of people at high risk for foodborne illnesses, including infants and children; (C) a concern regarding food fraud for economic gain, especially with mislabeling and intentionally misleading claims; (D) an increasing volume of imported food, without adequate monitoring and inspection; and (E) maintenance of rigorous inspection of the domestic food processing and food service industries; (5) Federal food safety standard setting, inspection, enforcement, and research efforts should be based on the best available science and public health considerations and food safety resources should be systematically deployed in ways that most effectively prevent foodborne illness; (6) the Federal food safety system is fragmented, with at least 15 Federal agencies sharing responsibility for food safety, and operates under laws that do not reflect current conditions in the food system or current scientific knowledge about the cause and prevention of foodborne illness; (7) the fragmented Federal food safety system and outdated laws preclude an integrated, systemwide approach to preventing foodborne illness, to the effective and efficient operation of the Nation's food safety program, and to the most beneficial deployment of food safety resources; (8) the National Academy of Sciences recommended in the report ``Ensuring Safe Food from Production to Consumption'' that Congress establish by statute a unified and central framework for managing Federal food safety programs, and recommended modifying Federal statutes so that inspection, enforcement, and research efforts are based on scientifically supportable assessments of risks to public health; and (9) the lack of a single focal point for food safety leadership in the United States undercuts the ability of the United States to exert food safety leadership internationally, which is detrimental to the public health and the international trade interests of the United States. (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are-- (1) to establish a single agency to be known as the ``Food Safety Administration'' to-- (A) regulate food safety and related labeling to strengthen the protection of the public health; (B) ensure that food facilities fulfill their responsibility to produce food in a manner that protects the public health of all people in the United States; (C) lead an integrated, systemwide approach to food safety and to make more effective and efficient use of resources to prevent foodborne illness; (D) provide a single focal point for food safety leadership, both nationally and internationally; and (E) provide an integrated food safety research capability, utilizing internally-generated, scientifically and statistically valid studies, in cooperation with academic institutions and other scientific entities of the Federal and State governments, to achieve the continuous improvement of research on foodborne illness and contaminants; (2) to transfer to the Food Safety Administration the food safety, labeling, inspection, and enforcement functions that, as of the day before the effective date of this Act, are performed by other Federal agencies; and (3) to modernize and strengthen the Federal food safety laws to achieve more effective application and efficient management of the laws for the protection and improvement of public health.

This Act and the amendments made by this Act take effect on the date of enactment of this Act. ______ By Mr. ALEXANDER (for himself, Mr. McConnell, Mr. Enzi, Mr. Isakson, Mr. Rubio, and Mr. Scott): S. 288. A bill to amend the National Labor Relations Act to reform the National Labor Relations Board, the Office of the General Counsel, and the process for appellate review, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions. Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, today I am reintroducing the NLRB Reform Act with Senator McConnell. Our legislation will change the National Labor Relations Board from an advocate to an umpire. The board was created 80 years ago to act as an impartial umpire in labor disputes that threaten the free flow of commerce. The board's decisions affect about 85 million private-sector workers and 5.7 million private-sector employers. But over time, the board has become an advocate for one interest group over the other--changing positions with each new administration. There are three significant problems the board faces today: First, the biggest problem is partisan advocacy. Today, the majority of the 5-member board is made up of appointees who follow the president's political leanings. President Obama has appointed 3 labor union lawyers to the board. Second, the board has a freewheeling advocate for a general counsel. The board's most recent general counsels have been exceeding their statutory authority and bringing questionable cases that threaten American jobs. Third, it is too slow to resolve disputes. Right now, 145 cases, that is 32 percent of the board's caseload, have been pending for more than a year. Our bill provides three fixes. First, it ends partisan advocacy. A 6-member board of 3 Republicans and 3 Democrats and a majority of 4 will require both sides to find a middle ground. Second, it reins in the general counsel. Businesses and unions would be able to challenge complaints filed by the General Counsel in Federal district court, and they will have greater transparency about the basis and legal reasoning of charges brought by the General Counsel. Third, it encourages timely decisions in two ways. First, either party in a case before the board may appeal to a Federal Court of Appeals if the board fails to reach a decision in their case within one year. Second, funding for the entire NLRB would be reduced by 20 percent if the board is not able to decide 90 percent of its cases within one year over the first 2-year period post-reform. Our bill would offer these solutions without taking away rights or remedies for any employee, business, or union. While the increasing partisanship at the board has occurred in Republican administrations as well as Democrat administrations, it has reached a climax in this administration. Three of President Obama's recent nominees came to the board from a major labor union's leadership. One labor law professor at a major university recently said that she can't even use the most recent textbook, instead she has to resort to handing out NLRB decisions. The decisions are coming out so rapidly and this NLRB is venturing into new territory with efforts at rulemaking. This is no way to maintain a national labor law policy. ______ By Mr. DURBIN (for himself, Mr. Brown, Ms. Klobuchar, Mrs. Boxer, Mr. Markey, Mr. Cardin, Mr. Franken, Mr. Casey, and Mr. Schumer): S. 289.

Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation to help victims of child pornography, one of society's most heinous crimes. I am joined by 34 Senators on both sides of the aisle. I hope this legislation will soon become law. Sexually exploiting a child distorts her life and leaves scars long after the abuse itself ends and the abuser has been prosecuted. For this reason, the Violence Against Women Act includes a provision requiring that in such cases a defendant must pay restitution to cover all of the victim's losses. Those losses can include future lost income as well as medical care, mental health counseling, and therapy. Child pornography isn't merely the record of a child's sexual abuse, it is itself an instance of abuse. The ongoing trafficking and those images pile harm upon harm. As a result, it becomes even more difficult for a victim to put together a life that was shattered before it had barely begun. As the Supreme Court has recognized, ``every viewing of child pornography is a repetition of the victim's abuse.'' The current restitution statute was enacted in 1994, before the Internet became prime real estate for trafficking of child pornography. It puts victims in an impossible bind. In a case decided last spring, the Supreme Court said the current restitution statute requires the victim to prove how much of her losses were specifically caused by a single defendant's possession of her images. With a burden like that, it is no wonder that under this statute victims receive no restitution at all in more than three-quarters of child pornography cases. The cruel irony today is that the more individuals who participate in harming a victim, the less any of them is financially responsible, and the less timely help the victim will receive. Perpetrators are easily lost in a crowd. [[Page S603]] The bill I introduce today will amend the restitution statute so that it works for child pornography victims. It is named for Amy and Vicky, brave women who are the victims of two of the most widely viewed child pornography series in the world. Amy's case went before the Supreme Court last year, and my staff worked with the legal team for these women in developing this bill. I want to mention in particular James Marsh, whose legal practice in New York focuses exclusively on helping victims; Professor Paul Cassell at the University of Utah, who argued Amy's case before the Supreme Court; and Carol Hepburn, who practices law in Seattle on behalf of Vicky and many other victims. This bill changes the current restitution statute in three important ways so that it works for child pornography victims. First, it gives judges options for determining a victim's losses and calculating restitution. Second, it gives judges the ability to impose restitution on defendants in different kinds of cases to ensure that victims actually receive meaningful restitution. Third, it shifts the burden of chasing defendants all over the country from victims to defendants who can share the restitution costs with other defendants. Both Amy and Vicky personally support this bill. I am also pleased that many national victim advocacy groups support this bill, including the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, the National Organization for Victim Assistance, the National Crime Victim Law Institute, the National Center for Victims of Crime, and the National Task Force to End Sexual and Domestic Violence Against Women. Last October I received a letter endorsing this bill signed by the attorneys general of 43 States, 22 Republicans and 21 Democrats. I want to share with my colleagues the story of a young man, a Utah resident, who uses the name Andy. Between the ages of 7 and 12, he was sexually abused by a trusted adult and family friend. Dr. David Corwin, the University of Utah child psychologist who examined him, said that based on 30 years of experience with child sexual abuse victims, the images and videos of Andy's abuse were the most disturbing he had ever seen. According to the FBI, the images and videos created from Andy's abuse are one of the most widely distributed boy series in the country. The FBI says that as of last month Andy is a named victim in 726 cases. He has been granted restitution in 24 of the 101 cases in which he requested it and has collected anything at all in only 2 cases. Andy wrote to support the bill I am introducing today. He addresses letters to the Members of the Congress, which means that he is writing to each Member of this body. Andy says this legislation will prevent him from having to spend decades trying to recover minuscule amounts of restitution from hundreds, if not thousands of defendants all over the country. I want my colleagues to hear his words: My images may never be taken off the Internet and may always be circulating around the country. At least with this congressional change, I can start to heal, learn how to handle my circumstances, and re-build my life. There are many more Amys, Vickys, and Andys than any of us want to admit, and they need our help. In our system of government, we have the responsibility to pass or change legislation to address issues and problems Americans face. All the courts could do was confirm that the current restitution statute is no longer suited to help child pornography victims. It is now up to us to do our duty and enact a statute that will. Amy, Vicky, and Andy are counting on us, and we must not let them down. ____________________",package_114_121.csv,113613,113613,113685,"[congressional record volume 161, number 14 (wednesday, january 28, 2015)] [senate] [pages s591-s603] from the congressional record online through the government publishing office [ www.gpo.gov ] statements on introduced bills and joint resolutions by mr. barrasso (for himself, mr. tester, and ms. murkowski): s. 286. a bill to amend the indian self-determination and education assistance act to provide further self-governance by indian tribes, and for other purposes; to the committee on indian affairs. mr. barrasso. mr. president, i rise today to introduce legislation that would further advance the goals of indian self-governance and self-determination. the legislation is entitled, the department of the interior self-governance act of 2015. i thank my colleagues who have joined me as original cosponsors of this legislation, including indian affairs committee vice chairman senator tester and senator murkowski. one of the cornerstones of federal indian policy is the concept of tribal self-determination and self-governance. in 1975, congress passed the indian self-determination and education assistance act. the act, public law no. 93-638 authorizes indian tribes to carry out certain federal indian programs, activities, and functions within the department of the interior and the department of the health and human services. self-governance is both a policy and procedure whereby, pursuant to the indian self-determination and education assistance act, indian tribes administer federal programs for indians. tribal administration of these programs promotes local control and decision-making for these important programs that affect the local tribal community. tribal administration through these processes also serves to reduce federal bureaucracy. this legislation promotes accountability by maintaining requirements that indian tribes must demonstrate a higher level of responsible governance and administration. good governance is vital for continuing this policy. the act gives authority to the secretaries of the interior and health and human services to enter into 638 contracts and self-governance compacts with indian tribes. each 638 contact or self-governance compact identifies functions and activities to be carried out by the tribe, as well as any administrative, reporting, or other requirements that must be followed. despite the increased flexibility in the tribal self-governance program, indian tribes have stated to congress that the department of the interior has, for many years, resisted the efforts by tribes to carry out interior programs. without additional reforms, the success of the indian self-determination and education assistance act cannot reach its full potential. the bill intends to clarify and expand the provisions of the indian self-determination and education assistance act. this legislation will give tribes a better opportunity to advance the policy of tribal self- governance by authorizing the secretary of the interior to select up to 50 new indian tribes to participate in the tribal self-governance program. in addition, the bill clarifies that provisions of water settlements and their authorizing legislation will not be affected by the self-governance amendments. furthermore, nothing in this will expand or limit programs eligible for self-governance compacts beyond those already authorized under current law. this bipartisan bill is supported by indian tribes across the country. i urge my colleagues to support this legislation.

(a) findings.--congress finds that-- (1) the safety of the food supply of the united states is vital to the public health, to public confidence in the food supply, and to the success of the food sector of the nation's economy; (2) lapses in the protection of the food supply and loss of public confidence in food safety are damaging to consumers and the food industry, and place a burden on interstate commerce; (3) the safety and security of the food supply requires an integrated, systemwide approach to preventing foodborne illness, a thorough and broad-based approach to basic and applied research, and intensive, effective, and efficient management of the nation's food safety program; (4) the task of preserving the safety of the food supply of the united states faces tremendous pressures with regard to-- (a) emerging pathogens and other contaminants and the ability to detect all forms of contamination; (b) an aging and immune-compromised population, with a growing number of people at high risk for foodborne illnesses, including infants and children; (c) a concern regarding food fraud for economic gain, especially with mislabeling and intentionally misleading claims; (d) an increasing volume of imported food, without adequate monitoring and inspection; and (e) maintenance of rigorous inspection of the domestic food processing and food service industries; (5) federal food safety standard setting, inspection, enforcement, and research efforts should be based on the best available science and public health considerations and food safety resources should be systematically deployed in ways that most effectively prevent foodborne illness; (6) the federal food safety system is fragmented, with at least 15 federal agencies sharing responsibility for food safety, and operates under laws that do not reflect current conditions in the food system or current scientific knowledge about the cause and prevention of foodborne illness; (7) the fragmented federal food safety system and outdated laws preclude an integrated, systemwide approach to preventing foodborne illness, to the effective and efficient operation of the nation's food safety program, and to the most beneficial deployment of food safety resources; (8) the national academy of sciences recommended in the report ``ensuring safe food from production to consumption'' that congress establish by statute a unified and central framework for managing federal food safety programs, and recommended modifying federal statutes so that inspection, enforcement, and research efforts are based on scientifically supportable assessments of risks to public health; and (9) the lack of a single focal point for food safety leadership in the united states undercuts the ability of the united states to exert food safety leadership internationally, which is detrimental to the public health and the international trade interests of the united states. (b) purposes.--the purposes of this act are-- (1) to establish a single agency to be known as the ``food safety administration'' to-- (a) regulate food safety and related labeling to strengthen the protection of the public health; (b) ensure that food facilities fulfill their responsibility to produce food in a manner that protects the public health of all people in the united states; (c) lead an integrated, systemwide approach to food safety and to make more effective and efficient use of resources to prevent foodborne illness; (d) provide a single focal point for food safety leadership, both nationally and internationally; and (e) provide an integrated food safety research capability, utilizing internally-generated, scientifically and statistically valid studies, in cooperation with academic institutions and other scientific entities of the federal and state governments, to achieve the continuous improvement of research on foodborne illness and contaminants; (2) to transfer to the food safety administration the food safety, labeling, inspection, and enforcement functions that, as of the day before the effective date of this act, are performed by other federal agencies; and (3) to modernize and strengthen the federal food safety laws to achieve more effective application and efficient management of the laws for the protection and improvement of public health. sec. 3. definitions. in this act: (1) administration.--the term ``administration'' means the food safety administration established under section 101(a)(1).

to the committee on health, education, labor, and pensions. mr. alexander. mr. president, today i am reintroducing the nlrb reform act with senator mcconnell. our legislation will change the national labor relations board from an advocate to an umpire. the board was created 80 years ago to act as an impartial umpire in labor disputes that threaten the free flow of commerce. the board's decisions affect about 85 million private-sector workers and 5.7 million private-sector employers. but over time, the board has become an advocate for one interest group over the other--changing positions with each new administration. there are three significant problems the board faces today: first, the biggest problem is partisan advocacy. today, the majority of the 5-member board is made up of appointees who follow the president's political leanings. president obama has appointed 3 labor union lawyers to the board. second, the board has a freewheeling advocate for a general counsel. the board's most recent general counsels have been exceeding their statutory authority and bringing questionable cases that threaten american jobs. third, it is too slow to resolve disputes. right now, 145 cases, that is 32 percent of the board's caseload, have been pending for more than a year. our bill provides three fixes. first, it ends partisan advocacy. a 6-member board of 3 republicans and 3 democrats and a majority of 4 will require both sides to find a middle ground. second, it reins in the general counsel. businesses and unions would be able to challenge complaints filed by the general counsel in federal district court, and they will have greater transparency about the basis and legal reasoning of charges brought by the general counsel. third, it encourages timely decisions in two ways. first, either party in a case before the board may appeal to a federal court of appeals if the board fails to reach a decision in their case within one year. second, funding for the entire nlrb would be reduced by 20 percent if the board is not able to decide 90 percent of its cases within one year over the first 2-year period post-reform. our bill would offer these solutions without taking away rights or remedies for any employee, business, or union. while the increasing partisanship at the board has occurred in republican administrations as well as democrat administrations, it has reached a climax in this administration. three of president obama's recent nominees came to the board from a major labor union's leadership. one labor law professor at a major university recently said that she can't even use the most recent textbook, instead she has to resort to handing out nlrb decisions. the decisions are coming out so rapidly and this nlrb is venturing into new territory with efforts at rulemaking. this is no way to maintain a national labor law policy. ______ by mr. durbin (for himself, mr. brown, ms. klobuchar, mrs. boxer, mr. markey, mr. cardin, mr. franken, mr. casey, and mr. schumer): s. 289. a bill to prioritize funding for an expanded and sustained national investment in biomedical research;

to the committee on the judiciary. mr. hatch. mr. president, today i am introducing legislation to help victims of child pornography, one of society's most heinous crimes. i am joined by 34 senators on both sides of the aisle. i hope this legislation will soon become law. sexually exploiting a child distorts her life and leaves scars long after the abuse itself ends and the abuser has been prosecuted. for this reason, the violence against women act includes a provision requiring that in such cases a defendant must pay restitution to cover all of the victim's losses. those losses can include future lost income as well as medical care, mental health counseling, and therapy. child pornography isn't merely the record of a child's sexual abuse, it is itself an instance of abuse. the ongoing trafficking and those images pile harm upon harm. as a result, it becomes even more difficult for a victim to put together a life that was shattered before it had barely begun. as the supreme court has recognized, ``every viewing of child pornography is a repetition of the victim's abuse.'' the current restitution statute was enacted in 1994, before the internet became prime real estate for trafficking of child pornography. it puts victims in an impossible bind. in a case decided last spring, the supreme court said the current restitution statute requires the victim to prove how much of her losses were specifically caused by a single defendant's possession of her images. with a burden like that, it is no wonder that under this statute victims receive no restitution at all in more than three-quarters of child pornography cases. the cruel irony today is that the more individuals who participate in harming a victim, the less any of them is financially responsible, and the less timely help the victim will receive. perpetrators are easily lost in a crowd. [[page s603]] the bill i introduce today will amend the restitution statute so that it works for child pornography victims. it is named for amy and vicky, brave women who are the victims of two of the most widely viewed child pornography series in the world. amy's case went before the supreme court last year, and my staff worked with the legal team for these women in developing this bill. i want to mention in particular james marsh, whose legal practice in new york focuses exclusively on helping victims; professor paul cassell at the university of utah, who argued amy's case before the supreme court; and carol hepburn, who practices law in seattle on behalf of vicky and many other victims. this bill changes the current restitution statute in three important ways so that it works for child pornography victims. first, it gives judges options for determining a victim's losses and calculating restitution. second, it gives judges the ability to impose restitution on defendants in different kinds of cases to ensure that victims actually receive meaningful restitution. third, it shifts the burden of chasing defendants all over the country from victims to defendants who can share the restitution costs with other defendants. both amy and vicky personally support this bill. i am also pleased that many national victim advocacy groups support this bill, including the national center for missing and exploited children, the national organization for victim assistance, the national crime victim law institute, the national center for victims of crime, and the national task force to end sexual and domestic violence against women. last october i received a letter endorsing this bill signed by the attorneys general of 43 states, 22 republicans and 21 democrats. i want to share with my colleagues the story of a young man, a utah resident, who uses the name andy. between the ages of 7 and 12, he was sexually abused by a trusted adult and family friend. dr. david corwin, the university of utah child psychologist who examined him, said that based on 30 years of experience with child sexual abuse victims, the images and videos of andy's abuse were the most disturbing he had ever seen. according to the fbi, the images and videos created from andy's abuse are one of the most widely distributed boy series in the country. the fbi says that as of last month andy is a named victim in 726 cases. he has been granted restitution in 24 of the 101 cases in which he requested it and has collected anything at all in only 2 cases. andy wrote to support the bill i am introducing today. he addresses letters to the members of the congress, which means that he is writing to each member of this body. andy says this legislation will prevent him from having to spend decades trying to recover minuscule amounts of restitution from hundreds, if not thousands of defendants all over the country. i want my colleagues to hear his words: my images may never be taken off the internet and may always be circulating around the country. at least with this congressional change, i can start to heal, learn how to handle my circumstances, and re-build my life. there are many more amys, vickys, and andys than any of us want to admit, and they need our help. in our system of government, we have the responsibility to pass or change legislation to address issues and problems americans face. all the courts could do was confirm that the current restitution statute is no longer suited to help child pornography victims. it is now up to us to do our duty and enact a statute that will. amy, vicky, and andy are counting on us, and we must not let them down. ____________________",113613

A bill to amend the Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act to provide further self-governance by Indian tribes, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Indian Affairs. Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation that would further advance the goals of Indian self-governance and self-determination. The legislation is entitled, the Department of the Interior Self-Governance Act of 2015. I thank my colleagues who have joined me as original cosponsors of this legislation, including Indian Affairs Committee Vice Chairman Senator Tester and Senator Murkowski. One of the cornerstones of Federal Indian policy is the concept of tribal self-determination and self-governance. In 1975, Congress passed the Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act. The Act, Public Law No. 93-638 authorizes Indian tribes to carry out certain Federal Indian programs, activities, and functions within the Department of the Interior and the Department of the Health and Human Services. Self-governance is both a policy and procedure whereby, pursuant to the Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act, Indian tribes administer Federal programs for Indians. Tribal administration of these programs promotes local control and decision-making for these important programs that affect the local tribal community. Tribal administration through these processes also serves to reduce Federal bureaucracy. This legislation promotes accountability by maintaining requirements that Indian tribes must demonstrate a higher level of responsible governance and administration. Good governance is vital for continuing this policy. The act gives authority to the Secretaries of the Interior and Health and Human Services to enter into 638 contracts and self-governance compacts with Indian tribes. Each 638 contact or self-governance compact identifies functions and activities to be carried out by the tribe, as well as any administrative, reporting, or other requirements that must be followed. Despite the increased flexibility in the tribal self-governance program, Indian tribes have stated to Congress that the Department of the Interior has, for many years, resisted the efforts by tribes to carry out Interior programs. Without additional reforms, the success of the Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act cannot reach its full potential. The bill intends to clarify and expand the provisions of the Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act. This legislation will give tribes a better opportunity to advance the policy of tribal self- governance by authorizing the Secretary of the Interior to select up to 50 new Indian tribes to participate in the tribal self-governance program. In addition, the bill clarifies that provisions of water settlements and their authorizing legislation will not be affected by the self-governance amendments. Furthermore, nothing in this will expand or limit programs eligible for self-governance compacts beyond those already authorized under current law. This bipartisan bill is supported by Indian tribes across the country. I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.

A bill to amend the National Labor Relations Act to reform the National Labor Relations Board, the Office of the General Counsel, and the process for appellate review, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions. Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, today I am reintroducing the NLRB Reform Act with Senator McConnell. Our legislation will change the National Labor Relations Board from an advocate to an umpire. The board was created 80 years ago to act as an impartial umpire in labor disputes that threaten the free flow of commerce. The board's decisions affect about 85 million private-sector workers and 5.7 million private-sector employers. But over time, the board has become an advocate for one interest group over the other--changing positions with each new administration. There are three significant problems the board faces today: First, the biggest problem is partisan advocacy. Today, the majority of the 5-member board is made up of appointees who follow the president's political leanings. President Obama has appointed 3 labor union lawyers to the board. Second, the board has a freewheeling advocate for a general counsel. The board's most recent general counsels have been exceeding their statutory authority and bringing questionable cases that threaten American jobs. Third, it is too slow to resolve disputes. Right now, 145 cases, that is 32 percent of the board's caseload, have been pending for more than a year. Our bill provides three fixes. First, it ends partisan advocacy. A 6-member board of 3 Republicans and 3 Democrats and a majority of 4 will require both sides to find a middle ground. Second, it reins in the general counsel. Businesses and unions would be able to challenge complaints filed by the General Counsel in Federal district court, and they will have greater transparency about the basis and legal reasoning of charges brought by the General Counsel. Third, it encourages timely decisions in two ways. First, either party in a case before the board may appeal to a Federal Court of Appeals if the board fails to reach a decision in their case within one year. Second, funding for the entire NLRB would be reduced by 20 percent if the board is not able to decide 90 percent of its cases within one year over the first 2-year period post-reform. Our bill would offer these solutions without taking away rights or remedies for any employee, business, or union. While the increasing partisanship at the board has occurred in Republican administrations as well as Democrat administrations, it has reached a climax in this administration. Three of President Obama's recent nominees came to the board from a major labor union's leadership. One labor law professor at a major university recently said that she can't even use the most recent textbook, instead she has to resort to handing out NLRB decisions. The decisions are coming out so rapidly and this NLRB is venturing into new territory with efforts at rulemaking. This is no way to maintain a national labor law policy. ______","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 14 (Wednesday, January 28, 2015)] [Senate] [Page S600] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] By Mr. ALEXANDER (for himself, Mr. McConnell, Mr. Enzi, Mr. Isakson, Mr. Rubio, and Mr. Scott): S. 288.

(a) Findings.--Congress finds that-- (1) the safety of the food supply of the United States is vital to the public health, to public confidence in the food supply, and to the success of the food sector of the Nation's economy; (2) lapses in the protection of the food supply and loss of public confidence in food safety are damaging to consumers and the food industry, and place a burden on interstate commerce; (3) the safety and security of the food supply requires an integrated, systemwide approach to preventing foodborne illness, a thorough and broad-based approach to basic and applied research, and intensive, effective, and efficient management of the Nation's food safety program; (4) the task of preserving the safety of the food supply of the United States faces tremendous pressures with regard to-- (A) emerging pathogens and other contaminants and the ability to detect all forms of contamination; (B) an aging and immune-compromised population, with a growing number of people at high risk for foodborne illnesses, including infants and children; (C) a concern regarding food fraud for economic gain, especially with mislabeling and intentionally misleading claims; (D) an increasing volume of imported food, without adequate monitoring and inspection; and (E) maintenance of rigorous inspection of the domestic food processing and food service industries; (5) Federal food safety standard setting, inspection, enforcement, and research efforts should be based on the best available science and public health considerations and food safety resources should be systematically deployed in ways that most effectively prevent foodborne illness; (6) the Federal food safety system is fragmented, with at least 15 Federal agencies sharing responsibility for food safety, and operates under laws that do not reflect current conditions in the food system or current scientific knowledge about the cause and prevention of foodborne illness; (7) the fragmented Federal food safety system and outdated laws preclude an integrated, systemwide approach to preventing foodborne illness, to the effective and efficient operation of the Nation's food safety program, and to the most beneficial deployment of food safety resources; (8) the National Academy of Sciences recommended in the report ``Ensuring Safe Food from Production to Consumption'' that Congress establish by statute a unified and central framework for managing Federal food safety programs, and recommended modifying Federal statutes so that inspection, enforcement, and research efforts are based on scientifically supportable assessments of risks to public health; and (9) the lack of a single focal point for food safety leadership in the United States undercuts the ability of the United States to exert food safety leadership internationally, which is detrimental to the public health and the international trade interests of the United States. (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are-- (1) to establish a single agency to be known as the ``Food Safety Administration'' to-- (A) regulate food safety and related labeling to strengthen the protection of the public health; (B) ensure that food facilities fulfill their responsibility to produce food in a manner that protects the public health of all people in the United States; (C) lead an integrated, systemwide approach to food safety and to make more effective and efficient use of resources to prevent foodborne illness; (D) provide a single focal point for food safety leadership, both nationally and internationally; and (E) provide an integrated food safety research capability, utilizing internally-generated, scientifically and statistically valid studies, in cooperation with academic institutions and other scientific entities of the Federal and State governments, to achieve the continuous improvement of research on foodborne illness and contaminants; (2) to transfer to the Food Safety Administration the food safety, labeling, inspection, and enforcement functions that, as of the day before the effective date of this Act, are performed by other Federal agencies; and (3) to modernize and strengthen the Federal food safety laws to achieve more effective application and efficient management of the laws for the protection and improvement of public health.

(a) Findings.--Congress finds that-- (1) the safety of the food supply of the United States is vital to the public health, to public confidence in the food supply, and to the success of the food sector of the Nation's economy; (2) lapses in the protection of the food supply and loss of public confidence in food safety are damaging to consumers and the food industry, and place a burden on interstate commerce; (3) the safety and security of the food supply requires an integrated, systemwide approach to preventing foodborne illness, a thorough and broad-based approach to basic and applied research, and intensive, effective, and efficient management of the Nation's food safety program; (4) the task of preserving the safety of the food supply of the United States faces tremendous pressures with regard to-- (A) emerging pathogens and other contaminants and the ability to detect all forms of contamination; (B) an aging and immune-compromised population, with a growing number of people at high risk for foodborne illnesses, including infants and children; (C) a concern regarding food fraud for economic gain, especially with mislabeling and intentionally misleading claims; (D) an increasing volume of imported food, without adequate monitoring and inspection; and (E) maintenance of rigorous inspection of the domestic food processing and food service industries; (5) Federal food safety standard setting, inspection, enforcement, and research efforts should be based on the best available science and public health considerations and food safety resources should be systematically deployed in ways that most effectively prevent foodborne illness; (6) the Federal food safety system is fragmented, with at least 15 Federal agencies sharing responsibility for food safety, and operates under laws that do not reflect current conditions in the food system or current scientific knowledge about the cause and prevention of foodborne illness; (7) the fragmented Federal food safety system and outdated laws preclude an integrated, systemwide approach to preventing foodborne illness, to the effective and efficient operation of the Nation's food safety program, and to the most beneficial deployment of food safety resources; (8) the National Academy of Sciences recommended in the report ``Ensuring Safe Food from Production to Consumption'' that Congress establish by statute a unified and central framework for managing Federal food safety programs, and recommended modifying Federal statutes so that inspection, enforcement, and research efforts are based on scientifically supportable assessments of risks to public health; and (9) the lack of a single focal point for food safety leadership in the United States undercuts the ability of the United States to exert food safety leadership internationally, which is detrimental to the public health and the international trade interests of the United States. (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are-- (1) to establish a single agency to be known as the ``Food Safety Administration'' to-- (A) regulate food safety and related labeling to strengthen the protection of the public health; (B) ensure that food facilities fulfill their responsibility to produce food in a manner that protects the public health of all people in the United States; (C) lead an integrated, systemwide approach to food safety and to make more effective and efficient use of resources to prevent foodborne illness; (D) provide a single focal point for food safety leadership, both nationally and internationally; and (E) provide an integrated food safety research capability, utilizing internally-generated, scientifically and statistically valid studies, in cooperation with academic institutions and other scientific entities of the Federal and State governments, to achieve the continuous improvement of research on foodborne illness and contaminants; (2) to transfer to the Food Safety Administration the food safety, labeling, inspection, and enforcement functions that, as of the day before the effective date of this Act, are performed by other Federal agencies; and (3) to modernize and strengthen the Federal food safety laws to achieve more effective application and efficient management of the laws for the protection and improvement of public health.

(a) Findings.--Congress finds that-- (1) the safety of the food supply of the United States is vital to the public health, to public confidence in the food supply, and to the success of the food sector of the Nation's economy; (2) lapses in the protection of the food supply and loss of public confidence in food safety are damaging to consumers and the food industry, and place a burden on interstate commerce; (3) the safety and security of the food supply requires an integrated, systemwide approach to preventing foodborne illness, a thorough and broad-based approach to basic and applied research, and intensive, effective, and efficient management of the Nation's food safety program; (4) the task of preserving the safety of the food supply of the United States faces tremendous pressures with regard to-- (A) emerging pathogens and other contaminants and the ability to detect all forms of contamination; (B) an aging and immune-compromised population, with a growing number of people at high risk for foodborne illnesses, including infants and children; (C) a concern regarding food fraud for economic gain, especially with mislabeling and intentionally misleading claims; (D) an increasing volume of imported food, without adequate monitoring and inspection; and (E) maintenance of rigorous inspection of the domestic food processing and food service industries; (5) Federal food safety standard setting, inspection, enforcement, and research efforts should be based on the best available science and public health considerations and food safety resources should be systematically deployed in ways that most effectively prevent foodborne illness; (6) the Federal food safety system is fragmented, with at least 15 Federal agencies sharing responsibility for food safety, and operates under laws that do not reflect current conditions in the food system or current scientific knowledge about the cause and prevention of foodborne illness; (7) the fragmented Federal food safety system and outdated laws preclude an integrated, systemwide approach to preventing foodborne illness, to the effective and efficient operation of the Nation's food safety program, and to the most beneficial deployment of food safety resources; (8) the National Academy of Sciences recommended in the report ``Ensuring Safe Food from Production to Consumption'' that Congress establish by statute a unified and central framework for managing Federal food safety programs, and recommended modifying Federal statutes so that inspection, enforcement, and research efforts are based on scientifically supportable assessments of risks to public health; and (9) the lack of a single focal point for food safety leadership in the United States undercuts the ability of the United States to exert food safety leadership internationally, which is detrimental to the public health and the international trade interests of the United States. (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are-- (1) to establish a single agency to be known as the ``Food Safety Administration'' to-- (A) regulate food safety and related labeling to strengthen the protection of the public health; (B) ensure that food facilities fulfill their responsibility to produce food in a manner that protects the public health of all people in the United States; (C) lead an integrated, systemwide approach to food safety and to make more effective and efficient use of resources to prevent foodborne illness; (D) provide a single focal point for food safety leadership, both nationally and internationally; and (E) provide an integrated food safety research capability, utilizing internally-generated, scientifically and statistically valid studies, in cooperation with academic institutions and other scientific entities of the Federal and State governments, to achieve the continuous improvement of research on foodborne illness and contaminants; (2) to transfer to the Food Safety Administration the food safety, labeling, inspection, and enforcement functions that, as of the day before the effective date of this Act, are performed by other Federal agencies; and (3) to modernize and strengthen the Federal food safety laws to achieve more effective application and efficient management of the laws for the protection and improvement of public health.

(a) findings.--congress finds that-- (1) the safety of the food supply of the united states is vital to the public health, to public confidence in the food supply, and to the success of the food sector of the nation's economy; (2) lapses in the protection of the food supply and loss of public confidence in food safety are damaging to consumers and the food industry, and place a burden on interstate commerce; (3) the safety and security of the food supply requires an integrated, systemwide approach to preventing foodborne illness, a thorough and broad-based approach to basic and applied research, and intensive, effective, and efficient management of the nation's food safety program; (4) the task of preserving the safety of the food supply of the united states faces tremendous pressures with regard to-- (a) emerging pathogens and other contaminants and the ability to detect all forms of contamination; (b) an aging and immune-compromised population, with a growing number of people at high risk for foodborne illnesses, including infants and children; (c) a concern regarding food fraud for economic gain, especially with mislabeling and intentionally misleading claims; (d) an increasing volume of imported food, without adequate monitoring and inspection; and (e) maintenance of rigorous inspection of the domestic food processing and food service industries; (5) federal food safety standard setting, inspection, enforcement, and research efforts should be based on the best available science and public health considerations and food safety resources should be systematically deployed in ways that most effectively prevent foodborne illness; (6) the federal food safety system is fragmented, with at least 15 federal agencies sharing responsibility for food safety, and operates under laws that do not reflect current conditions in the food system or current scientific knowledge about the cause and prevention of foodborne illness; (7) the fragmented federal food safety system and outdated laws preclude an integrated, systemwide approach to preventing foodborne illness, to the effective and efficient operation of the nation's food safety program, and to the most beneficial deployment of food safety resources; (8) the national academy of sciences recommended in the report ``ensuring safe food from production to consumption'' that congress establish by statute a unified and central framework for managing federal food safety programs, and recommended modifying federal statutes so that inspection, enforcement, and research efforts are based on scientifically supportable assessments of risks to public health; and (9) the lack of a single focal point for food safety leadership in the united states undercuts the ability of the united states to exert food safety leadership internationally, which is detrimental to the public health and the international trade interests of the united states. (b) purposes.--the purposes of this act are-- (1) to establish a single agency to be known as the ``food safety administration'' to-- (a) regulate food safety and related labeling to strengthen the protection of the public health; (b) ensure that food facilities fulfill their responsibility to produce food in a manner that protects the public health of all people in the united states; (c) lead an integrated, systemwide approach to food safety and to make more effective and efficient use of resources to prevent foodborne illness; (d) provide a single focal point for food safety leadership, both nationally and internationally; and (e) provide an integrated food safety research capability, utilizing internally-generated, scientifically and statistically valid studies, in cooperation with academic institutions and other scientific entities of the federal and state governments, to achieve the continuous improvement of research on foodborne illness and contaminants; (2) to transfer to the food safety administration the food safety, labeling, inspection, and enforcement functions that, as of the day before the effective date of this act, are performed by other federal agencies; and (3) to modernize and strengthen the federal food safety laws to achieve more effective application and efficient management of the laws for the protection and improvement of public health. sec. 3. definitions. in this act: (1) administration.--the term ``administration'' means the food safety administration established under section 101(a)(1).

A bill to amend section 2259 of title 18, United States Code, and for other purposes; to the Committee on the Judiciary. Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation to help victims of child pornography, one of society's most heinous crimes. I am joined by 34 Senators on both sides of the aisle. I hope this legislation will soon become law. Sexually exploiting a child distorts her life and leaves scars long after the abuse itself ends and the abuser has been prosecuted. For this reason, the Violence Against Women Act includes a provision requiring that in such cases a defendant must pay restitution to cover all of the victim's losses. Those losses can include future lost income as well as medical care, mental health counseling, and therapy. Child pornography isn't merely the record of a child's sexual abuse, it is itself an instance of abuse. The ongoing trafficking and those images pile harm upon harm. As a result, it becomes even more difficult for a victim to put together a life that was shattered before it had barely begun. As the Supreme Court has recognized, ``every viewing of child pornography is a repetition of the victim's abuse.'' The current restitution statute was enacted in 1994, before the Internet became prime real estate for trafficking of child pornography. It puts victims in an impossible bind. In a case decided last spring, the Supreme Court said the current restitution statute requires the victim to prove how much of her losses were specifically caused by a single defendant's possession of her images. With a burden like that, it is no wonder that under this statute victims receive no restitution at all in more than three-quarters of child pornography cases. The cruel irony today is that the more individuals who participate in harming a victim, the less any of them is financially responsible, and the less timely help the victim will receive. Perpetrators are easily lost in a crowd. [[Page S603]] The bill I introduce today will amend the restitution statute so that it works for child pornography victims. It is named for Amy and Vicky, brave women who are the victims of two of the most widely viewed child pornography series in the world. Amy's case went before the Supreme Court last year, and my staff worked with the legal team for these women in developing this bill. I want to mention in particular James Marsh, whose legal practice in New York focuses exclusively on helping victims; Professor Paul Cassell at the University of Utah, who argued Amy's case before the Supreme Court; and Carol Hepburn, who practices law in Seattle on behalf of Vicky and many other victims. This bill changes the current restitution statute in three important ways so that it works for child pornography victims. First, it gives judges options for determining a victim's losses and calculating restitution. Second, it gives judges the ability to impose restitution on defendants in different kinds of cases to ensure that victims actually receive meaningful restitution. Third, it shifts the burden of chasing defendants all over the country from victims to defendants who can share the restitution costs with other defendants. Both Amy and Vicky personally support this bill. I am also pleased that many national victim advocacy groups support this bill, including the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, the National Organization for Victim Assistance, the National Crime Victim Law Institute, the National Center for Victims of Crime, and the National Task Force to End Sexual and Domestic Violence Against Women. Last October I received a letter endorsing this bill signed by the attorneys general of 43 States, 22 Republicans and 21 Democrats. I want to share with my colleagues the story of a young man, a Utah resident, who uses the name Andy. Between the ages of 7 and 12, he was sexually abused by a trusted adult and family friend. Dr. David Corwin, the University of Utah child psychologist who examined him, said that based on 30 years of experience with child sexual abuse victims, the images and videos of Andy's abuse were the most disturbing he had ever seen. According to the FBI, the images and videos created from Andy's abuse are one of the most widely distributed boy series in the country. The FBI says that as of last month Andy is a named victim in 726 cases. He has been granted restitution in 24 of the 101 cases in which he requested it and has collected anything at all in only 2 cases. Andy wrote to support the bill I am introducing today. He addresses letters to the Members of the Congress, which means that he is writing to each Member of this body. Andy says this legislation will prevent him from having to spend decades trying to recover minuscule amounts of restitution from hundreds, if not thousands of defendants all over the country. I want my colleagues to hear his words: My images may never be taken off the Internet and may always be circulating around the country. At least with this congressional change, I can start to heal, learn how to handle my circumstances, and re-build my life. There are many more Amys, Vickys, and Andys than any of us want to admit, and they need our help. In our system of government, we have the responsibility to pass or change legislation to address issues and problems Americans face. All the courts could do was confirm that the current restitution statute is no longer suited to help child pornography victims. It is now up to us to do our duty and enact a statute that will. Amy, Vicky, and Andy are counting on us, and we must not let them down. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 14 (Wednesday, January 28, 2015)] [Senate] [Pages S602-S603] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] By Mr. HATCH (for himself, Mr. Schumer, Ms. Ayotte, Mr. Blumenthal, Mr. Blunt, Ms. Cantwell, Mrs. Capito, Mr. Carper, Mr. Casey, Mr. Coons, Mr. Cornyn, Mr. Daines, Mrs. Feinstein, Mr. Franken, Mrs. Gillibrand, Mr. Graham, Mr. Grassley, Mr. Inhofe, Mr. Isakson, Mr. Kirk, Ms. Klobuchar, Mr. Lee, Mr. Markey, Mr. McCain, Mrs. Murray, Mr. Perdue, Mr. Portman, Mr. Roberts, Mr. Rubio, Mr. Thune, Mr. Toomey, Mr. Udall, Mr. Vitter, Ms. Warren, Mr. Whitehouse, and Mr. Manchin): S. 295.

A bill to amend section 2259 of title 18, United States Code, and for other purposes; to the Committee on the Judiciary. Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation to help victims of child pornography, one of society's most heinous crimes. I am joined by 34 Senators on both sides of the aisle. I hope this legislation will soon become law. Sexually exploiting a child distorts her life and leaves scars long after the abuse itself ends and the abuser has been prosecuted. For this reason, the Violence Against Women Act includes a provision requiring that in such cases a defendant must pay restitution to cover all of the victim's losses. Those losses can include future lost income as well as medical care, mental health counseling, and therapy. Child pornography isn't merely the record of a child's sexual abuse, it is itself an instance of abuse. The ongoing trafficking and those images pile harm upon harm. As a result, it becomes even more difficult for a victim to put together a life that was shattered before it had barely begun. As the Supreme Court has recognized, ``every viewing of child pornography is a repetition of the victim's abuse.'' The current restitution statute was enacted in 1994, before the Internet became prime real estate for trafficking of child pornography. It puts victims in an impossible bind. In a case decided last spring, the Supreme Court said the current restitution statute requires the victim to prove how much of her losses were specifically caused by a single defendant's possession of her images. With a burden like that, it is no wonder that under this statute victims receive no restitution at all in more than three-quarters of child pornography cases. The cruel irony today is that the more individuals who participate in harming a victim, the less any of them is financially responsible, and the less timely help the victim will receive. Perpetrators are easily lost in a crowd. [[Page S603]] The bill I introduce today will amend the restitution statute so that it works for child pornography victims. It is named for Amy and Vicky, brave women who are the victims of two of the most widely viewed child pornography series in the world. Amy's case went before the Supreme Court last year, and my staff worked with the legal team for these women in developing this bill. I want to mention in particular James Marsh, whose legal practice in New York focuses exclusively on helping victims; Professor Paul Cassell at the University of Utah, who argued Amy's case before the Supreme Court; and Carol Hepburn, who practices law in Seattle on behalf of Vicky and many other victims. This bill changes the current restitution statute in three important ways so that it works for child pornography victims. First, it gives judges options for determining a victim's losses and calculating restitution. Second, it gives judges the ability to impose restitution on defendants in different kinds of cases to ensure that victims actually receive meaningful restitution. Third, it shifts the burden of chasing defendants all over the country from victims to defendants who can share the restitution costs with other defendants. Both Amy and Vicky personally support this bill. I am also pleased that many national victim advocacy groups support this bill, including the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, the National Organization for Victim Assistance, the National Crime Victim Law Institute, the National Center for Victims of Crime, and the National Task Force to End Sexual and Domestic Violence Against Women. Last October I received a letter endorsing this bill signed by the attorneys general of 43 States, 22 Republicans and 21 Democrats. I want to share with my colleagues the story of a young man, a Utah resident, who uses the name Andy. Between the ages of 7 and 12, he was sexually abused by a trusted adult and family friend. Dr. David Corwin, the University of Utah child psychologist who examined him, said that based on 30 years of experience with child sexual abuse victims, the images and videos of Andy's abuse were the most disturbing he had ever seen. According to the FBI, the images and videos created from Andy's abuse are one of the most widely distributed boy series in the country. The FBI says that as of last month Andy is a named victim in 726 cases. He has been granted restitution in 24 of the 101 cases in which he requested it and has collected anything at all in only 2 cases. Andy wrote to support the bill I am introducing today. He addresses letters to the Members of the Congress, which means that he is writing to each Member of this body. Andy says this legislation will prevent him from having to spend decades trying to recover minuscule amounts of restitution from hundreds, if not thousands of defendants all over the country. I want my colleagues to hear his words: My images may never be taken off the Internet and may always be circulating around the country. At least with this congressional change, I can start to heal, learn how to handle my circumstances, and re-build my life. There are many more Amys, Vickys, and Andys than any of us want to admit, and they need our help. In our system of government, we have the responsibility to pass or change legislation to address issues and problems Americans face. All the courts could do was confirm that the current restitution statute is no longer suited to help child pornography victims. It is now up to us to do our duty and enact a statute that will. Amy, Vicky, and Andy are counting on us, and we must not let them down. ____________________",package_114_121.csv,6300,6300,6372,"[congressional record volume 161, number 14 (wednesday, january 28, 2015)] [senate] [pages s602-s603] from the congressional record online through the government publishing office [ www.gpo.gov ] by mr. hatch (for himself, mr. schumer, ms. ayotte, mr. blumenthal, mr. blunt, ms. cantwell, mrs. capito, mr. carper, mr. casey, mr. coons, mr. cornyn, mr. daines, mrs. feinstein, mr. franken, mrs. gillibrand, mr. graham, mr. grassley, mr. inhofe, mr. isakson, mr. kirk, ms. klobuchar, mr. lee, mr. markey, mr. mccain, mrs. murray, mr. perdue, mr. portman, mr. roberts, mr. rubio, mr. thune, mr. toomey, mr. udall, mr. vitter, ms. warren, mr. whitehouse, and mr. manchin): s. 295. a bill to amend section 2259 of title 18, united states code, and for other purposes; to the committee on the judiciary. mr. hatch. mr. president, today i am introducing legislation to help victims of child pornography, one of society's most heinous crimes. i am joined by 34 senators on both sides of the aisle. i hope this legislation will soon become law. sexually exploiting a child distorts her life and leaves scars long after the abuse itself ends and the abuser has been prosecuted. for this reason, the violence against women act includes a provision requiring that in such cases a defendant must pay restitution to cover all of the victim's losses. those losses can include future lost income as well as medical care, mental health counseling, and therapy. child pornography isn't merely the record of a child's sexual abuse, it is itself an instance of abuse. the ongoing trafficking and those images pile harm upon harm. as a result, it becomes even more difficult for a victim to put together a life that was shattered before it had barely begun. as the supreme court has recognized, ``every viewing of child pornography is a repetition of the victim's abuse.'' the current restitution statute was enacted in 1994, before the internet became prime real estate for trafficking of child pornography. it puts victims in an impossible bind. in a case decided last spring, the supreme court said the current restitution statute requires the victim to prove how much of her losses were specifically caused by a single defendant's possession of her images. with a burden like that, it is no wonder that under this statute victims receive no restitution at all in more than three-quarters of child pornography cases. the cruel irony today is that the more individuals who participate in harming a victim, the less any of them is financially responsible, and the less timely help the victim will receive. perpetrators are easily lost in a crowd.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to the consideration of S. Res. 51, submitted earlier today. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the resolution by title. The legislative clerk read as follows: A resolution (S. Res. 51) recognizing the goals of Catholic Schools Week and honoring the valuable contributions of Catholic schools in the United States. There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the resolution. Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, I rise today in honor of Catholic schools across our Nation who provide our children with an outstanding education while preparing them to lead lives in the example of Jesus Christ. This year, we mark the 41st year of celebrating Catholic Schools Week, shedding light on the extraordinary contributions these schools and their students make to communities across the country. This year's theme, ``Catholic Schools: Communities of Faith, Knowledge, and Service,'' provides a solid representation of the mission of these schools in educating the whole person and forming our children into responsible stewards ready to take on the challenges of the future. Today, more than 2 million children are educated in Catholic schools in the United States. Ninety-nine percent of them graduate from high school and 85 percent pursue post-secondary education. Such a rate of success is a great testament to the quality of our Catholic schools and their educators. As an alumnus of a Catholic school in New Orleans, I have firsthand experience of the benefits of receiving a Catholic education. These schools are devoted to nurturing the young minds that pass though their halls each year, instilling in them the values necessary to become active and caring members of their communities, cities, and Nation. In the words of Pope Francis, ``[o]ur generation will show that it can rise to the promise found in each young person when we know how to give them space. This means that we have to create the material and spiritual conditions for their full development; to give them a solid basis on which to build their lives; to guarantee their safety and their education to be everything they can be.'' During the week of January 25 to January 31, let us recognize the steadfast commitment of the administrators, teachers, students, and families, who support Catholic schools across the United States, and appreciate their efforts to educate the youth of our Nation. In that respect, I am hopeful that the Senate will pass this resolution celebrating Catholic Schools Week. Mr. HOEVEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the resolution be agreed to, the preamble be agreed to, and the motions to reconsider be laid upon the table with no intervening action or debate.

Today, more than 2 million children are educated in Catholic schools in the United States. Ninety-nine percent of them graduate from high school and 85 percent pursue post-secondary education. Such a rate of success is a great testament to the quality of our Catholic schools and their educators. As an alumnus of a Catholic school in New Orleans, I have firsthand experience of the benefits of receiving a Catholic education. These schools are devoted to nurturing the young minds that pass though their halls each year, instilling in them the values necessary to become active and caring members of their communities, cities, and Nation. In the words of Pope Francis, ``[o]ur generation will show that it can rise to the promise found in each young person when we know how to give them space. This means that we have to create the material and spiritual conditions for their full development; to give them a solid basis on which to build their lives; to guarantee their safety and their education to be everything they can be.'' During the week of January 25 to January 31, let us recognize the steadfast commitment of the administrators, teachers, students, and families, who support Catholic schools across the United States, and appreciate their efforts to educate the youth of our Nation. In that respect, I am hopeful that the Senate will pass this resolution celebrating Catholic Schools Week. Mr. HOEVEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the resolution be agreed to, the preamble be agreed to, and the motions to reconsider be laid upon the table with no intervening action or debate. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The resolution (S. Res. 51) was agreed to. The preamble was agreed to.

BRETT GUTHRIE of kentucky in the house of representatives Wednesday, January 28, 2015 Mr. GUTHRIE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in memory of Wendell Hampton Ford. A dedicated public servant, Senator Ford held many roles in state and federal politics, including Governor of the Commonwealth and U.S. Senator. A Daviess County native, Senator Ford always held his hometown close to his heart. It was his starting point in government and his final resting place. Holding elected office for more than three decades, Senator Ford is the only Kentuckian to seek and win election to consecutive terms as lieutenant governor, governor and U.S. senator. Throughout his long tenure in state and federal government, Senator Ford was known and will be remembered for being an advocate for his fellow Kentuckians. A friend of the farmers, Senator Ford has been recognized for his work on agricultural issues, particularly tobacco. Senator Ford understood the vital role tobacco played--and still plays--in Kentucky's economy. In tackling these big issues, Senator Ford quickly rose through the ranks. He was elected the whip of his party in 1990, a position he held until he left the U.S. Senate. He once described himself to the New York Times as ``being a workhorse and not a show horse.'' It's that same attitude that led him to be a behind-the-scenes dealmaker, who strived to achieve solutions to our policy woes. That desire to better his community and country did not stop when Senator Ford left public service. After serving four terms in the U.S. Senate, Senator Ford created the Wendell H. Ford Government Education Center, located in Owensboro, KY. Designed to educate young people about civics and public policy, Senator Ford continued teaching those lessons until the end of his life. It is a fantastic facility with a wonderful mission, and the center is just one of the many lasting legacies his leadership has left on the region. I join with Kentucky's Second District in sending prayers to Senator Ford's family. We will miss him and are grateful for his service to the Commonwealth and our nation. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 14 (Wednesday, January 28, 2015)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E127] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] IN MEMORY OF SENATOR WENDELL FORD ______ HON.

BRADLEY BYRNE of alabama in the house of representatives Wednesday, January 28, 2015 Mr. BYRNE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to highlight an important occasion, the creation of the modern-day United States Coast Guard (USCG). The important designation was made official by President Woodrow Wilson on January 28, 1915, when he signed into law the ``Act to Create the Coast Guard,'' merging the Revenue Cutter Service with the U.S. Life-Saving Service. The origins of the present-day Coast Guard can be traced back to August 4, 1790, when President George Washington signed the Tariff Act to empower ten United States ships to enforce trade laws and reduce smuggling. The USCG is one of the oldest organizations of the federal government and was the only armed force patrolling the seas until the Navy Department was established in 1798. Over its long and storied history, the USCG has acquired various responsibilities from maintaining the country's tools for maritime navigation to handling merchant marine licensing and merchant vessel safety. Additionally, the USCG is the nation's frontline of defense from threats at sea and is dedicated to saving lives, one of its most important functions. Mr. Speaker, I come from an area that truly understands the important work the Coast Guard does on a daily basis. Mobile, Alabama, located in my Congressional district, is home to the Guard Aviation Training Center and also the USCG Sector Mobile Base. The Aviation Center acts as the Coast Guard's aviation and capabilities development center and also conducts traditional Coast Guard air station missions including search and rescue, homeland security, and environmental protection. I am proud of all the brave men and women who serve in this essential organization, and I encourage all Americans to take some time to reflect on the sacrifices these people have made for our great country. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 14 (Wednesday, January 28, 2015)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E127] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] RECOGNIZING THE BIRTH OF THE MODERN UNITED STATES COAST GUARD ______ HON.

SHEILA JACKSON LEE of texas in the house of representatives Tuesday, January 27, 2015 Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise to speak about the rule governing debate on this bill, H.R. 351, the ``LNG Permitting Certainty and Transparency Act.'' Mr. Speaker, I am not anti-energy exploration. I am not anti-trade. I am, however strongly ``pro-jobs,'' ``pro-economic growth,'' and ``pro- sustainable environment.'' As a Member of Congress from Houston I have always been mindful of the importance of, and have strongly advocated for, national energy policies that will make our nation energy independent, preserve and create jobs, and keep our nation's economy strong. That is why I carefully consider each energy legislative proposal brought to the floor on its individual merits and support them when they are sound, balanced, fair, and promote the national interest. Where they fall short, I believe in working across the aisle to improve them if possible by offering constructive amendments. Although I believe the nation would benefit by increased exports of natural gas, the legislation before contains several provisions that are of great concern to me. Pursuant to Section 2, subsection (a) of the bill, an application for authorization to export LNG is ``deemed'' approved if the Department of Energy (DOE) or other federal agencies do not approve or deny the application within 30 days of the conclusion of the site review. I have three concerns with this regulatory scheme. First, as a senior member of the Committee on the Judiciary, I have a problem with ``deeming'' something done that has not been done in fact. Thus, the provision is unwise. Second, this provision is a remedy in search of a problem. There is no lengthy or intolerable backlog of neglected natural gas export authority applications awaiting action by DOE. The provision is unnecessary because DOE has to date authorized the export of over 10 [[Page E128]] billion cubic feet per day of LNG to non-Free Trade Agreement countries. Together with exports to FTA countries, this level of LNG exports that would transform the United States into one of the world's largest exporters. Third, the provision is irresponsible because it would require DOE and other agencies to make decisions based on incomplete information or information that may not be available within the stringent deadlines, and to deny applications that otherwise would have been approved, but for lack of sufficient review time. Supporters of this bill argue that it is vital, in the face of Russian aggression and restrictions, to provide our allies in Europe with additional exports of LNG. However, because actual exports through approved terminals are not expected to begin until late 2015, this legislation will have no impact on current exports. And, limiting the time for review would prevent DOE from properly analyzing the domestic impact that of exporting large amounts of LNG. The Energy Information Administration (EIA) estimates that increased exports could result in an increase of as much as 8% in domestic LNG prices. Given the inherent delicacy involved in assessing the impact of trade authorizations, both domestically and abroad, this state of affairs is likely to lead to DOE erring on the side of caution and denying applications that may otherwise have been approved if it had more time and more resources to carry out its responsibilities. For these reasons, I urge all Members to oppose the rule, and the underlying bill. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 14 (Wednesday, January 28, 2015)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Pages E127-E128] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 351, LNG PERMITTING CERTAINTY AND TRANSPARENCY ACT ______ speech of HON.

ERIC SWALWELL of california in the house of representatives Wednesday, January 28, 2015 Mr. SWALWELL of California. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor four former Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL) scientists and engineers who were inducted into the Laboratory's Entrepreneurs' Hall of Fame on January 20, 2015. The group of former LLNL researchers, who represent the second class of inductees into the Laboratory's Entrepreneurs' Hall of Fame, were honored for developing technologies during or after their laboratory careers that created major economic impacts and spawned important new companies. This year's inductees are Martin Casado, Bill Colston, Fred Milanovich, and David Tuckerman. Between them, these inductees initially started three different companies--an Internet security company, a biomedical company that advanced personalized medicine and a microchip firm. Computer scientist Martin Casado revolutionized the information technology world when he developed software-defined networking (SDN). Casado is currently continuing efforts to upgrade computer networking security, not only for the computer industry, but for banking, retail, health care and homeland security. Bill Colston and Fred Milanovich left LLNL to found QuantaLife Inc. based in Pleasanton which is in my district. In collaboration with Milanovich and other experts, Colston developed QuantaLife's hallmark product, an anti-bioterrorism technology that was converted into medical applications. David Tuckerman co-founded nCHIP Inc., a technology company that developed enhanced microchips and multi-chip module systems. Tuckerman then went on to found Tuckerman & Associates Inc.--an independent technical consultancy firm that helps venture capitalists and industrial clients advance their ideas into reality. Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me celebrating these entrepreneurs and honoring Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory for supporting their employees' entrepreneurial ambitions. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 14 (Wednesday, January 28, 2015)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E128] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] IN RECOGNITION OF THE RESEARCHERS INDUCTED INTO THE LAWRENCE LIVERMORE LABORATORY'S ENTREPRENEURS' HALL OF FAME ______ HON.

ELIOT L. ENGEL of new york in the house of representatives Wednesday, January 28, 2015 Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, some community members have the unique ability to shape their entire neighborhood for the better. For the Bronx's 47th Precinct community, that person who has shaped and improved the neighborhood for the better has been Elizabeth Gill. Elizabeth was born and raised by her Caribbean parents in the Bronx. She has been a lifelong community advocate who has worked with a wide variety of civic organizations, both as a member and volunteer. She currently serves at the New York City Police Department 47th Precinct Community Council President, a post she has held for over 20 years. Other organizations that she has done work for include the 47th Precinct Crisis Intervention Team; North Bronx Williamsbridge Branch of the NAACP; Mount Vernon Police Department Community Board; St. Mary's Hospital for Children With Special Needs; the 47th Precinct annual fellowship Breakfast Planning Committee; The Selective Service Board; and the Co-op City Public Committee. Elizabeth has also worked to procure many grants for the entire 47th Precinct community, with funding going towards community affairs vans, auxiliary vests, bicycles for police officers, and a command center bus. As a result of her accomplishments, Elizabeth has received a host of community service awards. She has been honored by the Korean Merchants Association of the Northeast Bronx, the Police Reserve association of the City of New York, and the New York State association of Black and Puerto Rican Legislators, just to name a few. This year Elizabeth is celebrating her 85th birthday, and on the occasion I wish to congratulate her for all of her wonderful accomplishments.

J. ROBERT BEYSTER ______ HON. SUSAN A. DAVIS of california in the house of representatives Wednesday, January 28, 2015 Mrs. DAVIS of California. Mr. Speaker, I rise with great respect to mourn the passing of one of San Diego's greatest innovators, businessmen, educators and humanitarians, Dr. J. Robert Beyster. Dr. Beyster was born in Detroit, MI on July 26, 1924, to his parents John F. and Lillian E. Beyster. He attended Dlocum Truax High School in Trenton, Michigan and graduated as Salutatorian. Just as the United States entered World War II, he enlisted in the Navy. He was sent by the Navy to the University of Michigan and later commissioned an Ensign. Dr. Beyster's impressive biography describes a World War II Veteran, a nuclear engineer whose research propelled the Department of Defense's weapons systems and submarines into the future of war fighting, but most notably, he founded Science Applications International Corporation (SAIC), an employee-owned multi-billion dollar corporation. His selfless vision built SAIC from the ground up. He believed in the simple principle that wealth should be distributed among those who contribute to the growth of the company. Dr. Beyster was the recipient of multiple distinguished awards, to include a Lifetime Achievement Award from Ernst & Young and the Spirit of San Diego Award from the San Diego Regional Chamber of Commerce. We remember him for his high standards of excellence and influence at the University of California's Sulpizio Cardiovascular Center. Furthermore, he founded the Foundation for Enterprise Development, which launched the Beyster Institute at the University of California San Diego's Rady School of Management for technologists, entrepreneurs, executives and educators. San Diego was fortunate to have someone like Dr. Beyster in our community. We see his altruistic contributions in the success of the students who've been given incredible opportunities from his charitable donations. Our community employs those who have been educated through his generous grants, scholarships and fellowships. We grow from those who will undoubtedly give back to the community in the same ways in which they have, themselves, benefited from his generosity. His efforts have provided our next generation of scientists, doctors and intellectual leaders. He was an author, educator, philanthropist, veteran, a family man of integrity, values and of charitable contributions, who will be sorely missed by his family, friends and colleagues. We are fortunate to have constant reminders of his giving nature and his brilliant mind. Thank you Dr. Beyster, for giving San Diego so much of your incredible life. You will never be forgotten. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 14 (Wednesday, January 28, 2015)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E129] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] HONORING DR.

In fact, Santa Clara County of my Silicon Valley district also proclaimed this month as Human Trafficking Awareness Month. In the fight against this modern-day slavery, I am proud to introduce the vital bipartisan legislation--Survivors of Human Trafficking Empowerment Act--alongside my colleagues, Congressman Ted Poe, Karen Bass, and Rodney Davis. Mr. Speaker, human trafficking is a disease upon our humanity, and it remains the world's fastest growing criminal enterprise. According to the International Labor Organization, trafficking is an estimated $150 billion industry worldwide, which exploits nearly 21 million victims around the world. Sadly, my home state of California is near the top in reported trafficking cases. Furthermore, it is estimated that 40 percent of the human trafficking activity on the West Coast comes through the three Bay Area airports of San Jose, San Francisco, and Oakland. My legislation will turn back the tide of human trafficking, as it allows those survivors who were impacted by this cruel system to [[Page E130]] voice their experiences and educate policymakers. Specifically, this bill will create a survivors-led U.S. Advisory Council on Human Trafficking to review federal government policy and programs on human trafficking. This council will advise, formulate assessments and recommendations, and submit reports to the Senior Policy Operating Group and the President's Task Force to Monitor and Combat Trafficking Persons. Directly hearing and learning from those who fell victim to this heinous crime is the best tool to eliminate human trafficking. Ultimately, this legislation values survivors, beyond just their stories. I look forward to working with my colleagues to pass this crucial bill, so that we may finally rid of human trafficking--once and for all. Mr. Speaker, be it labor or sex trafficking, human trafficking is the worst kind of atrocity. Each day, this scourge continues to endanger, exploit, and enslave lives. Even as we bring further awareness to this crime this month of January, we must sustain the fight each and every day. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 14 (Wednesday, January 28, 2015)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Pages E129-E130] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] SURVIVORS OF HUMAN TRAFFICKING EMPOWERMENT ACT ______ HON.

UNICO is the largest Italian American service and volunteer organization in the United States, and many of my constituents, especially those living in the Wyoming Valley, have come to know Mr. Dente well through the Scranton Chapter. Mr. Dente is a lifelong resident of Pittston, PA, having graduated from Seton Catholic High School before matriculating to East Stroudsburg University of Pennsylvania. There, he earned a Bachelor of Science in Hotel, Restaurant, and Tourism Management; a degree that he has put to commendable use in his ownership and operation of Dente's Catering and Rental. As a member of the American Culinary Federation (ACF), Mr. Dente obtained his certification as a Certified Chef de Cuisine, and in 2011, was inducted as an ``honorary fellow'' in the American Academy of Chefs, a prestigious subset within the ACF. Mr. Dente has earned a slew of other esteemed decorations, including medals, ribbons, and certificates for his work in both hot and cold food competitions. He was subsequently named the ACF Chapter Chef of the Year in 2008. As an active member of the Scranton Chapter of UNICO since 2004, Mr. Dente and his staff host an annual dinner meeting for the chapter's membership.

ANDREE CARSON of indiana in the house of representatives Wednesday, January 28, 2015 Mr. CARSON of Indiana. Mr. Speaker, I am proud to reintroduce legislation to award the Congressional Gold Medal to Muhammad Ali in recognition of his contributions to our nation. I believe it is long past time to recognize and honor an American civil rights activist and sporting legend with Congress' highest honor. Over the course of his illustrious career, Muhammad Ali has produced some of our nation's most lasting sports memories. From winning a Gold Medal at the 1960 Summer Olympics to lighting the Olympic torch at the 1996 Summer Olympics, his influence as an athlete and a humanitarian has spanned over fifty years. Despite having been diagnosed with Parkinson's disease in the 1980s, Ali has devoted his life to charitable organizations. Ali and his wife, Lonnie, are founding directors of the Muhammad Ali Parkinson Center and Movement Disorders Clinic in Phoenix, AZ and have helped raise over $50 million for Parkinson's research. In addition to helping families cope with illness, Ali has led efforts to provide meals for the hungry and has helped countless organizations such as the Make-A-Wish-Foundation and the Special Olympics. Muhammad Ali's humanitarian efforts go beyond his charitable activities in the United [[Page E131]] States. In 1990 Muhammad Ali travelled to the Middle East to seek the release of American and British hostages that were being held as human shields in the first Gulf War. After his intervention, 15 hostages were freed. Thanks to his devotion to diplomatic causes and racial harmony, Ali is the recipient of many accolades, including being chosen as a ``U.N. Messenger of Peace'' in 1998 and receiving the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 2005. Through his unyielding dedication to his sport and to struggling populations around the world, Muhammad Ali serves as an example of service and self-sacrifice for generations of Americans. The Congressional Gold Medal is a fitting commemoration of his life and work, for which he is deservingly known as ``the Greatest.'' Mr. Speaker, I hope my colleagues will join me in recognizing one of our nation's most lasting and influential figures by signing on to this important legislation. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 14 (Wednesday, January 28, 2015)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Pages E130-E131] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] THE REINTRODUCTION OF LEGISLATION TO AWARD THE CONGRESSIONAL GOLD MEDAL TO HUMANITARIAN AND SPORTING LEGEND MUHAMMAD ALI ______ HON.

EARL BLUMENAUER of oregon in the house of representatives Wednesday, January 28, 2015 Mr. BLUMENAUER. Mr. Speaker, today I am introducing the CIDER Act, legislation that will support the growing number of craft and entrepreneurial cider makers across the country. The cider industry has tripled in size since 2007 and there has been tremendous growth in Oregon. As these businesses get off the ground, I am working with them to ensure a strong federal partnership and to break down arbitrary barriers that prevent this industry from realizing its potential. During the fermentation process, a variety of factors can lead to small changes in the composition of a cider's alcohol content and carbonation. Because of the narrow way that hard cider is currently defined in the tax code, these small variations can lead to cider being taxed at a rate fifteen times higher than what the statute clearly intended. The legislation will better tailor IRS rules to reflect variations in craft ciders. This legislation will update the tax definitions to reflect the growing diversity of the U.S. cider market, better match international rules and strengthen U.S. export opportunities, and broaden the definition to include both pear and apple ciders. Production nationally has been robust, more than tripling from 9.4 million gallons in 2011 to 32 million gallons in 2013. Cider revenues in the U.S. have been just as impressive, tripling from $178 million in 2007 to $601 million in 2012. Providing clear regulations and a tax structure that mirrors the real world for this agricultural product will allow this industry to continue its expansion while making ciders that people want to drink. Cider making is sometimes closer to an art than a science. As the American apple and pear hard cider industry becomes more prominent on the world stage, and cider becomes a beverage choice for more Americans' developing palettes, we need to ensure that cideries have every opportunity to expand and meet the needs of this growing market without an unfair tax burden. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 14 (Wednesday, January 28, 2015)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E131] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] THE CIDER ACT ______ HON.

One of those wonderful organizations, Chabad Lubavitch of Riverdale, is hosting their ``Celebrating 23 Years of Kindness'' dinner on January 24th, and I couldn't be more thrilled to recognize them on this occasion. Founded in 1992 under the guidance of the Lubavitcher Rebbe, Chabad Lubavitch of Riverdale seeks to strengthen the cultural bonds of Jewish identity through spiritual outreach, adult education, childhood education, daycare, day camps, Sabbath and Festival services and hospital visitation. As one of 2,700 centers in 70 different countries, Chabad Lubavitch of Riverdale embraces the Chabad Lubavitch philosophy, teaching understanding and recognition of the Creator as a means of reinforcing and nurturing Jewish culture. For the entire Chabad Lubavitch community, refining and governing one's actions through wisdom, comprehension, and knowledge is the true key to a fulfilled life, and it is in this vein that Chabad [[Page E132]] Lubavitch of Riverdale has worked to improve the lives of the Jewish population in the community. As community centers go, Chabad Lubavitch of Riverdale has always shown a great deal of warmth as they embrace the very young to the old and everyone in between that live in the neighborhood. By utilizing contemporary approaches to traditional values they have gone a long way toward reinvigorating the Jewish community.

Mr. Speaker, today I rise to mark January as National Slavery and Human Trafficking Prevention Month. Millions of people are subjected to sex trafficking or forced labor every year. Each January we take time to recognize the continuing scourge of human trafficking, but it is never easy to accept or believe that this horrible practice still continues in the 21st Century. And this is not a problem only in far off foreign lands--it is happening right here, in our own country. We know this in the East Bay, which I represent, in which there is a significant problem with human trafficking and sex exploitation. That is why we are so fortunate to have Alameda County District Attorney Nancy O'Malley fighting back hard against these traffickers and standing up for victims. Earlier this month Nancy announced her office's latest public relations campaign to help raise awareness about the tragedy of sex trafficking and make sure victims know how they can obtain help. She even has a special division within her office, called the Human Exploitation and Trafficking (H.E.A.T.) Unit, to fight trafficking. I want to thank Nancy and everyone in the H.E.A.T.

Luke was a beloved member of the Queens community, who recently passed away at 76 years of age. A longtime Queens resident, Luke settled in Sunnyside as a young man and quickly became one of the community's most well-known activists. One of Luke's enduring legacies was his leadership at the helm of the Gateway Restoration Project, which led to the creation of Sunnyside's most iconic symbol, the Sunnyside Arch. Luke led the charge on a number of additional projects to improve Sunnyside as a prominent member of the Sunnyside Chamber of Commerce, Sunnyside/Woodside Lions Club, Sunnyside Kiwanis Club, and Sunnyside Artists. In recognition of his long list of accomplishments, the Sunnyside Chamber's annual `Sunnysider of the Year' award was named in his honor. Luke will forever be known not only for his love for his community, but also for his generosity and selflessness. Luke's loyalty to his friends and community was unmatched, and he was willing to go above and beyond for those who asked him for help. Whether it was raising money for the hungry, being the first to welcome a newcomer to the neighborhood, or ensuring that others who joined him in his civic engagement received proper recognition, Luke was the most humble and genuine person one could come across.

EDMUND FRANCIS LA GAMMA ______ HON. NITA M. LOWEY of new york in the house of representatives Wednesday, January 28, 2015 Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Dr. Edmund Francis La Gamma for his receipt of the ``Mentor of the Year'' Award from the Eastern Society for Pediatric Research in recognition of his outstanding contributions to the care and treatment of our most vulnerable citizens--our newborns. For almost four decades, Dr. La Gamma has committed himself to improving our understanding of diseases which affect premature babies and advancing their care. He has served as a Professor of Pediatrics, Biochemistry and Molecular Biology at New York Medical College and Director of both the Division of Newborn Medicine and the Neonatal- Perinatal Fellowship Program at Maria Fareri Children's Hospital. In these roles, he has been responsible for the care of infants at over 10 regional affiliate hospitals which span an area the size of the state of Delaware. In that time, he has transformed neonatal intensive care at Westchester Medical Center into one of the state's most recognized neonatal intensive care units, earning New York's highest designation of care and national admiration. In addition, his work as a scientist has contributed greatly to the field of neonatology. Working with some of the most prominent doctors in his field, Dr. La Gamma has expanded our understanding of neonatal development and improved our ability to treat deadly diseases in newborn infants. Moreover, throughout his career he has remained focused on ensuring his research be shared with the scientific community to advance neonatal care, and has published over 150 peer- reviewed research articles, including 25 book chapters. From this work, neonatologists across the country have benefitted from his insights on caring for premature and critically-ill newborns. As head of one of the largest neonatal fellowship programs in the nation, he has helped shape the future of pediatric and neonatology through his mentorship of students, junior pediatricians, junior neonatologists and academic faculty. He has directly mentored almost 100 fellows in his career, and he has also shared his knowledge in hundreds of invited lectures around the world. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Dr. La Gamma for his lifelong dedication to newborn health, his over 15 years of dedication to neonatal intensive care in my district, New York State, and the nation. I urge my colleagues to join me in congratulating him for his well- deserved ``Mentor of the Year'' award, and applaud his tremendous accomplishments. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 14 (Wednesday, January 28, 2015)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E132] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] HONORING DR.

PATRICK J. TIBERI of ohio in the house of representatives Wednesday, January 28, 2015 Mr. TIBERI. Mr. Speaker, the Medicare Fee-for-Service program stands virtually alone among health care payers in the United States in not fully recognizing the clinical and cost benefits of providing infusion therapy to patients in their homes. Infusion therapy is fully covered by Medicare in hospitals, skilled nursing facilities, hospital outpatient departments, and physician offices, but coverage in patients' homes is very limited. As a result, Medicare beneficiaries in need of infusion therapy usually receive their treatments in health care facilities rather than in their homes, which is the setting that is the most desirable, convenient, and by far the most cost-effective. This is unfortunate and unnecessary. In the private sector, the accepted standard of care and practice for over 30 years is to provide infusion therapy at home where medically indicated and when requested by the attending physician. Ironically, patients who have access to this benefit under their private plans lose this coverage when they enroll in Medicare. Medicare's lack of coverage for infusion therapy in the home setting can lead to substantial patient and family lifestyle disruptions and costs. Because Medicare only covers infusion services in institutional and limited outpatient settings, the beneficiary either has to travel to a health care facility to receive infusion treatments, sometimes multiple times a day, or remain in a facility for the duration of the therapy. Today, Representative Eliot Engel and I are introducing The Medicare Home Infusion Site of Care Act of 2015 so patients can receive the same infusion treatments that they currently receive in facility-based environments in their homes at a lower cost to Medicare. Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to support our bill to give patients better quality care at lower costs. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 14 (Wednesday, January 28, 2015)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E133] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] INTRODUCTION OF THE MEDICARE HOME INFUSION SITE OF CARE ACT OF 2015 ______ HON.
