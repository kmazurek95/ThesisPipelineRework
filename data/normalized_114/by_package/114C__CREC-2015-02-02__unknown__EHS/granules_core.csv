The Chair recognizes the gentleman from West Virginia (Mr. Mooney) for 5 minutes. Mr. MOONEY of West Virginia. Thank you, Mr. Speaker, for the great honor of addressing the Nation as a newly-elected Representative for the people of West Virginia's Second District. My name is Alex Mooney, and I grew up in a home where the American ideals of personal freedom and limited government were cherished. My mother was born and raised in Cuba where, at age 21, she was thrown in jail for 7 weeks as a political prisoner by the communist regime of Fidel Castro. After her release, she fled here to the United States where she was welcomed with open arms to restart her life in freedom. My father was a feisty Irishman from New York and a Vietnam veteran. He was an ardent conservative and had great pride in leaders like Ronald Reagan. Through the hard work of my parents, my three siblings and I had the chance to live the American Dream. My older brother, Vincent, is a professor of electrical engineers at Georgia Tech. My younger brother, Patrick, is a successful businessman. My younger sister, Margarita, is a professor of sociology at Yale University where she conducts research on happiness, virtues, and the common good. I was blessed to have the opportunity to attend Dartmouth College where I played football and rugby and graduated in 1993. In 2001, my father suffered a stroke and was dying. There was one doctor who was particularly compassionate in her efforts to comfort my family and me through that difficult time. She also happened to be very pretty. One year later, that neurosurgeon, Dr. Grace Gonzalez, agreed to marry me. My wonderful wife and I have been blessed with three beautiful children. My son, Lucas, is 11; my daughter, Camille, is 9; and we were pleasantly surprised on October 13 of last year with a third child, Gabrielle. My wife and I have been doing the hard work of homeschooling our older children, imparting on them an appreciation for the special place America holds in the world, just as my parents did for me. My parents also taught me personal responsibility enshrined in the Constitution must always be protected. Their example showed me we must never cower in the face of tyranny, never give up on the God-given rights we are entitled to, and never stop fighting for the American Dream. They taught me the importance of serving one's Nation and community. I knew early in life I wanted an opportunity to fight for the values which have made our Nation a beacon of freedom and prosperity around the world. As a young State senator, I fought for relief for hardworking taxpayers, for more personal responsibility, for the right to life of unborn babies, for a prosperous business climate, and to protect our Second Amendment rights. Last fall, the people of the Second District of West Virginia afforded me the tremendous honor of representing them in Congress. Our Nation faces great challenges. Our President and his liberal allies on the left would see us lose the values which make us who we are, lose the values my father fought for and my mother escaped despotism to enjoy. West Virginia is blessed to be abundant in natural resources. I will fight so that West Virginians and all Americans are able to seek prosperity from our natural bounty. I expect to spend much of my time at my home in Charles Town and crossing the district, listening to the citizens I serve. During my first week in office, I didn't wait to begin delivering on West Virginia priorities. I cosponsored legislation to gut onerous provisions of ObamaCare, to audit the Federal Reserve, and authorize construction of the Keystone XL pipeline. I also cosponsored bipartisan legislation to protect the unborn after 20 weeks when they are capable of feeling pain. I am fortunate to serve on the House Natural Resources Committee, where I will focus on policies which contribute to the energy security of our Nation and the expansion of our production here at home. I have also been selected to serve on the important House Budget Committee, where I will fight to fulfill my commitment for a balanced Federal budget. It is totally unacceptable for West Virginians and all Americans to live within their means while the Federal Government continues to allow its spending and debt to run rampant. We are a nation whose values are emulated around the world by people seeking freedom, justice, and constitutional self-government defined by the rule of law. [[Page H671]] This legacy faces great challenges today, and I am proud to stand here on the floor of the United States Congress, vigilant in the defense of our defining principles and West Virginia priorities. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 17 (Monday, February 2, 2015)] [House] [Pages H670-H671] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] WEST VIRGINIA'S SECOND DISTRICT PRIORITIES The SPEAKER pro tempore.

The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from North Carolina (Ms. Foxx) for 5 minutes. Ms. FOXX. Mr. Speaker, today, I rise to recognize Stacy Eggers, Jr., of Boone, North Carolina. [[Page H670]] On March 20, Stacy will be 91 years old, but he hasn't let age slow him down one bit. He still goes daily to his office on West King Street where he has been continually practicing law since 1950. Back then, he was one of only four attorneys in Watauga County. Stacy is one of the last attorneys in the State of North Carolina who did not attend law school. He was admitted by the North Carolina State Bar to practice law on April 19, 1950, and eventually, his law practice became a family affair. He formed the law firm Eggers & Eggers with his son Stacy Eggers III in 1974 and later formed Eggers, Eggers, & Eggers when his daughter Rebecca Eggers-Gryder joined the practice. His grandson Stacy Eggers IV, who is known as Four, joined the firm in 2001. His granddaughter-in-law Kimberly Eggers joined the firm in 2010. Another grandson, Austin Eggers, joined the firm in 2011. I think it bears repeating that Stacy still goes to work every day at the age of 90. In fact, he tried a property rights case with his grandson Four before a local jury at the age of 88. You rarely see that kind of dedication to one's profession anymore. In addition to his work in private practice, Stacy has served as county attorney for Watauga County, as well as town attorney for Blowing Rock and Seven Devils. His service to the bar also includes terms as councilor of the North Carolina State Bar for the 24th Judicial District, president of the Watauga Bar Association, and president of the 24th Judicial District Bar Association. He is an active member of the North Carolina Bar Association, where he served on the Client Security Fund Board, which helps reimburse individuals who have suffered financial loss as a result of the dishonest conduct of lawyers. In 1996, Stacy was inducted into the North Carolina General Practice Hall of Fame and received the Liberty Bell Award in 2008. The Liberty Bell Award is given annually by the North Carolina Bar Association's Young Lawyers Division to one individual who ``has strengthened the American system of freedom under law.'' Active in the local community, Stacy has served as a member of the Watauga County Hospital Board of Trustees, the Watauga County Board of Elections, the Boone Rotary Club, the executive committee of the Watauga County Republican Party, the Boone Chamber of Commerce, and the Watauga Savings and Loan Association Board of Directors. He also currently serves on the board for LifeStore Bank. Prior to his career as a lawyer, Stacy served in the Army Air Corps during World War II. When describing the experience to his children in later years, he would say he received a personal invitation from the President to take an all-expense paid world tour. He left on a transport out of Charleston, North Carolina, and by the time he arrived in Los Angeles at the end of the war, he had served his country in locations across the globe, including Africa, the Mediterranean, India, and Tinian. Stacy is a lifetime member and past commander of the American Legion and a lifetime member and judge advocate of the Veterans of Foreign Wars. Stacy raised four children with his loving and supportive wife of 56 years, Elizabeth Bingham Eggers, who passed away in 2004. He is blessed with eight grandsons and three great-grandsons and has another great- grandbaby on the way. His family is one of the most respected families in Watauga County. Stacy is a man of few words but great wisdom. He has tremendous insights into human nature, and his observations are well worth hearing. Watauga County is fortunate to call this hardworking citizen one of its own. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 17 (Monday, February 2, 2015)] [House] [Pages H669-H670] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] RECOGNIZING STACY EGGERS, JR.

He is an active member of the North Carolina Bar Association, where he served on the Client Security Fund Board, which helps reimburse individuals who have suffered financial loss as a result of the dishonest conduct of lawyers. In 1996, Stacy was inducted into the North Carolina General Practice Hall of Fame and received the Liberty Bell Award in 2008. The Liberty Bell Award is given annually by the North Carolina Bar Association's Young Lawyers Division to one individual who ``has strengthened the American system of freedom under law.'' Active in the local community, Stacy has served as a member of the Watauga County Hospital Board of Trustees, the Watauga County Board of Elections, the Boone Rotary Club, the executive committee of the Watauga County Republican Party, the Boone Chamber of Commerce, and the Watauga Savings and Loan Association Board of Directors. He also currently serves on the board for LifeStore Bank. Prior to his career as a lawyer, Stacy served in the Army Air Corps during World War II. When describing the experience to his children in later years, he would say he received a personal invitation from the President to take an all-expense paid world tour. He left on a transport out of Charleston, North Carolina, and by the time he arrived in Los Angeles at the end of the war, he had served his country in locations across the globe, including Africa, the Mediterranean, India, and Tinian. Stacy is a lifetime member and past commander of the American Legion and a lifetime member and judge advocate of the Veterans of Foreign Wars. Stacy raised four children with his loving and supportive wife of 56 years, Elizabeth Bingham Eggers, who passed away in 2004. He is blessed with eight grandsons and three great-grandsons and has another great- grandbaby on the way. His family is one of the most respected families in Watauga County. Stacy is a man of few words but great wisdom. He has tremendous insights into human nature, and his observations are well worth hearing. Watauga County is fortunate to call this hardworking citizen one of its own. ____________________","Congressional Record, Volume 161 Issue 17 (Monday, February 2, 2015) [Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 17 (Monday, February 2, 2015)] [House] [Pages H669-H670] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] RECOGNIZING STACY EGGERS, JR. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from North Carolina (Ms. Foxx) for 5 minutes. Ms. FOXX. Mr. Speaker, today, I rise to recognize Stacy Eggers, Jr., of Boone, North Carolina. [[Page H670]] On March 20, Stacy will be 91 years old, but he hasn't let age slow him down one bit. He still goes daily to his office on West King Street where he has been continually practicing law since 1950. Back then, he was one of only four attorneys in Watauga County. Stacy is one of the last attorneys in the State of North Carolina who did not attend law school. He was admitted by the North Carolina State Bar to practice law on April 19, 1950, and eventually, his law practice became a family affair. He formed the law firm Eggers & Eggers with his son Stacy Eggers III in 1974 and later formed Eggers, Eggers, & Eggers when his daughter Rebecca Eggers-Gryder joined the practice. His grandson Stacy Eggers IV, who is known as Four, joined the firm in 2001. His granddaughter-in-law Kimberly Eggers joined the firm in 2010. Another grandson, Austin Eggers, joined the firm in 2011. I think it bears repeating that Stacy still goes to work every day at the age of 90. In fact, he tried a property rights case with his grandson Four before a local jury at the age of 88. You rarely see that kind of dedication to one's profession anymore. In addition to his work in private practice, Stacy has served as county attorney for Watauga County, as well as town attorney for Blowing Rock and Seven Devils.

The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Thompson) for 5 minutes. Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, the Twenty-Five Percent Fund Act of 1908 required 25 percent of tax receipts of timber harvested from U.S. national forests to be returned to the counties where the tax receipts originated. Since local property taxes cannot be levied on Federal lands, these dollars along with payment in lieu of taxes, or PILT, funding are critical for counties located in national forests and other Federal lands. This is because the 1908 law specifies that they directly support local schools and road activities in national forests. Unfortunately, timbering has dramatically decreased in the National Forest System since the late 1980s. According to the Forest Service, the agency was annually harvesting over 12 billion board feet by the end of the 1980s, but today, this amount has decreased to less than 2 billion board feet per year. Make no mistake, timbering activities, such as removing unhealthy wood waste and potential fire fuel, plays a fundamental role in the core mission of the Forest Service and lends the forest health. Leading up to the turn of the century, declining timber production has resulted in less forest management and, therefore, decreased forest health, fewer local employment opportunities, and dramatically less funding for schools and roads in forested communities. As a result, the Secure Rural Schools program was created in 2000 to help offset the lack of funding for essential local activities. Unfortunately, the program was allowed to expire at the end of September 2014, resulting in payments to counties reverting back to previous law which again requires 25 percent of the tax receipts from timbering to be returned to the counties of origin. Earlier this month, the U.S. Department of Agriculture, the parent agency of the Forest Service, announced that 25 percent of receipts will be paid to 41 States throughout the coming months in 2015. These funds are very much needed in rural communities located on Federal lands, including the Allegheny National Forest, where four counties in northwestern Pennsylvania directly benefit. While these funds amount to nearly $50 million nationally, they represent only one-sixth of the funds that were provided the previous year through the Secure Rural Schools program. Mr. Speaker, as a member of the Education and the Workforce Committee and a former school board president, I can attest that there is no school district in America that could have 94 percent of a funding stream pulled out from underneath them and still manage. Make no mistake, the Secure Rural Schools program has gone a long way in helping communities bridge the financial shortfalls for the lack of taxable land over the past 15 years, but the program alone does not solve the underlying challenges faced by counties and communities colocated in national forests and other Federal lands. In order to ensure the long-term ecological sustainability and economic prosperity of our national forests and our local communities, the Forest Service must adhere to its historical mission of active forest management and timber harvesting for our Nation. Mr. Speaker, let us not be confused. National forests are not national parks; they are home to the people's resources. We must encourage sustainable and increased production of the public's resources which directly support those communities that are colocated on Federal lands. This would be a win-win for the country. The American people deserve as much. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 17 (Monday, February 2, 2015)] [House] [Page H669] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] ACTIVE FOREST MANAGEMENT LEADS TO HEALTHY COMMUNITIES The SPEAKER pro tempore.

CREC-2015-02-02-pt1-PgH671,CREC-2015-02-02,114,IT IS ALL IN THE NAME--THE NAME IS TERRORIST,"[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 17 (Monday, February 2, 2015)] [House] [Page H671] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] {time} 1215 IT IS ALL IN THE NAME--THE NAME IS TERRORIST The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Speaker recognizes the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Poe) for 5 minutes. Mr. POE of Texas. Mr. Speaker, ISIS has beheaded yet another person. Just this morning we also learned that the Taliban assassins murdered nine people in Afghanistan. A few months ago, the Taliban did a most vicious act of jihad. They attacked a school and murdered 150 children and their teachers in Pakistan. Last week, we learned that one of the Taliban Five, who was unfortunately swapped by the President in exchange for deserter Bowe Bergdahl, has recently called his buddies in the jihadist Taliban. Now, isn't that lovely? But the Taliban are not terrorists, so sayeth the White House. According to the White House Press Secretary: They do carry out tactics that are akin to terrorism. They do pursue terror attacks in an effort to try to advance their agenda. Well then, why not call them ``terrorists''? Why is the White House so timid and so intimidated by refusing to call the Taliban ``terrorists''? The National Review reports that the Al Jazeera news service has banned the terms ``Islamist,'' ``jihad,'' and ``terrorists'' from their reporting. Is the White House Press Secretary getting his politically correct language and censored statements from Al Jazeera? Who knows. Even Secretary Kerry refuses to define the foreign terrorist group ISIS as the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria. Mr. Speaker, at a House Foreign Affairs Committee hearing on September 18, entitled, ``The ISIS Threat: Weighing the Obama Administration's Response,'' I asked Secretary Kerry this question: Who are we at war with? I call them ``ISIS.'' Who would you call them? Secretary Kerry: Well, I would call them the ``enemy of Islam'' because that is what I think they are, and they certainly don't represent a state even though they try to claim to do so. So, officially, Mr. Kerry, we should refer to them as the ``enemy of Islam''? Secretary Kerry: Well, I do. Mr. Speaker, this administration also refuses to say that we are at war with radical Islam. There is so much sensitivity in the White House over its statements that one is puzzled to wonder: Why are they sensitive about calling terrorists ``terrorists''? Radical Islam is a cancer that is spreading throughout the world. Thousands are joining in the jihad, which preaches hate and murder in the name of religion. Even other world leaders have publicly recognized this and have called our enemy ``terrorists''--but not the United States. The leader of the free world dances around the topic instead of telling it like it is. Why does the administration refuse to define our enemy? We are at war with radical Islam. We are at war with the Taliban. We are at war with ISIS, and we are at war with terrorism and terrorists. And, Mr. Speaker, they are at war with us. Is the White House worried about hurting the feelings of the radical terrorists, who make it their mission to kill us, and so refuses to call them ``terrorists''? We need to call them what they are-- terrorists who kill in the name of radical Islam. Political correctness and political jargon will not win this war. Americans and our military must have a clearly defined enemy, not some nebulous, undefined named enemy that the White House advocates. The threat of Islamic extremism has never been greater. Their mission is clear. They are ruthless in pursuing it and will kill anybody who doesn't agree with them regardless of their religion. These killers are at war with America and humanity. We cannot defeat this enemy without first knowing who they are and then defining them. Mr. Speaker, they are terrorists. And that is just the way it is. Report: Al Jazeera's Banned `Islamist,' `Jihad,' `Terrorist' From Airwaves Al Jazeera's New York and Washington, D.C. journalists have reportedly received strict orders from Qatari management: please do not use the words ``terrorist,'' ``militant,'' ``Islamist,'' ``jihad'' and ``extremist'' in your reporting. After a January 27 Islamist terrorist attack in Libya, an internal email obtained by National Review showed that Al Jazeera English executive Carlos van Meek sent out an email demanding that his employees refrain from using the banned terms. ``All: We manage our words carefully around here,'' van Meek reportedly wrote. ``So I'd like to bring to your attention some key words that have a tendency of tripping us up.'' Van Meek explained, ``One person's terrorist is another person's freedom fighter,'' in writing why his employees must stop using the aforementioned words. ``Avoid characterizing people,'' he reportedly added. Regarding the term Islamist: ``Do not use,'' van Meek wrote in bold. ``We will continue to describe groups and individuals, by talking about their previous actions and current aims to give viewers the context they require, rather than use a simplistic label. ``Strictly speaking, jihad means an inner spiritual struggle, not a holy war,'' van Meek said in explaining why the Arabic term will no longer be allowed in Al Jazeera's reporting. He continued, ``It is not by tradition a negative term. It also means the struggle to defend Islam against things challenging it.'' He added: ``We do not use words such as militants, radicals, insurgents. We will stick with fighters.'' National Review reports that van Meek was previously described as the man tasked with ``establishing Al Jazeera in America.'' Breitbart News has reported on Al Jazeera's radical past, including its current support for Egypt's Muslim Brotherhood terror group. After September 11, 2001, the network's headquarters in Doha reportedly put on display multiple pictures in its studio honoring the deceased Al Qaeda terrorist Osama bin Laden. In 2013, dozens of staff resigned in protest of Al Jazeera's ``biased coverage'' in favor of the Muslim Brotherhood jihadist organization. ______ [From HFAC Hearing on Sept. 18 entitled, ``The ISIS Threat: Weighing the Obama Administration's Response''] Mr. Poe. You just go ahead and answer the question: Who are we at war with? I call them ISIS. Who would you call these? Secretary Kerry. Well, I call them the enemy of Islam, because that is what, I think, they are. And they certainly don't represent a state, even though they try to claim to. Mr. Poe. So officially we should refer to them as the enemy of Islam. Secretary Kerry. Well, I do. Mr. Poe. Okay. Secretary Kerry. I don't know if there is an official whatever. Mr. Poe. Well, why don't we tell the American people---- Secretary Kerry. I hope you join me in doing that, because that is what I think they are; and I don't think they deserve to have a reference in their name that gives them legitimacy. Mr. Poe. Are they the enemy of the United States? Secretary Kerry. Beg your pardon? Mr. Poe. Are they the enemy of the United States? Secretary Kerry. They are an enemy of humanity. Mr. Poe. So they are an enemy of the U.S., too? Secretary Kerry. Among others. Mr. Poe. Okay. Secretary Kerry. Among many others---- Mr. Poe. Well, I am just looking specifically at the national security interest of the United States. Secretary Kerry.

For all those reasons, yes. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 17 (Monday, February 2, 2015)] [House] [Page H671] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] {time} 1215 IT IS ALL IN THE NAME--THE NAME IS TERRORIST The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Speaker recognizes the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Poe) for 5 minutes. Mr. POE of Texas. Mr. Speaker, ISIS has beheaded yet another person. Just this morning we also learned that the Taliban assassins murdered nine people in Afghanistan. A few months ago, the Taliban did a most vicious act of jihad. They attacked a school and murdered 150 children and their teachers in Pakistan. Last week, we learned that one of the Taliban Five, who was unfortunately swapped by the President in exchange for deserter Bowe Bergdahl, has recently called his buddies in the jihadist Taliban. Now, isn't that lovely? But the Taliban are not terrorists, so sayeth the White House. According to the White House Press Secretary: They do carry out tactics that are akin to terrorism. They do pursue terror attacks in an effort to try to advance their agenda. Well then, why not call them ``terrorists''? Why is the White House so timid and so intimidated by refusing to call the Taliban ``terrorists''? The National Review reports that the Al Jazeera news service has banned the terms ``Islamist,'' ``jihad,'' and ``terrorists'' from their reporting. Is the White House Press Secretary getting his politically correct language and censored statements from Al Jazeera? Who knows. Even Secretary Kerry refuses to define the foreign terrorist group ISIS as the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria. Mr. Speaker, at a House Foreign Affairs Committee hearing on September 18, entitled, ``The ISIS Threat: Weighing the Obama Administration's Response,'' I asked Secretary Kerry this question: Who are we at war with? I call them ``ISIS.'' Who would you call them? Secretary Kerry: Well, I would call them the ``enemy of Islam'' because that is what I think they are, and they certainly don't represent a state even though they try to claim to do so. So, officially, Mr. Kerry, we should refer to them as the ``enemy of Islam''? Secretary Kerry: Well, I do. Mr. Speaker, this administration also refuses to say that we are at war with radical Islam. There is so much sensitivity in the White House over its statements that one is puzzled to wonder: Why are they sensitive about calling terrorists ``terrorists''? Radical Islam is a cancer that is spreading throughout the world. Thousands are joining in the jihad, which preaches hate and murder in the name of religion. Even other world leaders have publicly recognized this and have called our enemy ``terrorists''--but not the United States. The leader of the free world dances around the topic instead of telling it like it is. Why does the administration refuse to define our enemy? We are at war with radical Islam. We are at war with the Taliban. We are at war with ISIS, and we are at war with terrorism and terrorists. And, Mr. Speaker, they are at war with us. Is the White House worried about hurting the feelings of the radical terrorists, who make it their mission to kill us, and so refuses to call them ``terrorists''? We need to call them what they are-- terrorists who kill in the name of radical Islam. Political correctness and political jargon will not win this war. Americans and our military must have a clearly defined enemy, not some nebulous, undefined named enemy that the White House advocates. The threat of Islamic extremism has never been greater. Their mission is clear. They are ruthless in pursuing it and will kill anybody who doesn't agree with them regardless of their religion. These killers are at war with America and humanity. We cannot defeat this enemy without first knowing who they are and then defining them. Mr. Speaker, they are terrorists. And that is just the way it is. Report: Al Jazeera's Banned `Islamist,' `Jihad,' `Terrorist' From Airwaves Al Jazeera's New York and Washington, D.C. journalists have reportedly received strict orders from Qatari management: please do not use the words ``terrorist,'' ``militant,'' ``Islamist,'' ``jihad'' and ``extremist'' in your reporting. After a January 27 Islamist terrorist attack in Libya, an internal email obtained by National Review showed that Al Jazeera English executive Carlos van Meek sent out an email demanding that his employees refrain from using the banned terms. ``All: We manage our words carefully around here,'' van Meek reportedly wrote. ``So I'd like to bring to your attention some key words that have a tendency of tripping us up.'' Van Meek explained, ``One person's terrorist is another person's freedom fighter,'' in writing why his employees must stop using the aforementioned words. ``Avoid characterizing people,'' he reportedly added. Regarding the term Islamist: ``Do not use,'' van Meek wrote in bold. ``We will continue to describe groups and individuals, by talking about their previous actions and current aims to give viewers the context they require, rather than use a simplistic label. ``Strictly speaking, jihad means an inner spiritual struggle, not a holy war,'' van Meek said in explaining why the Arabic term will no longer be allowed in Al Jazeera's reporting. He continued, ``It is not by tradition a negative term. It also means the struggle to defend Islam against things challenging it.'' He added: ``We do not use words such as militants, radicals, insurgents. We will stick with fighters.'' National Review reports that van Meek was previously described as the man tasked with ``establishing Al Jazeera in America.'' Breitbart News has reported on Al Jazeera's radical past, including its current support for Egypt's Muslim Brotherhood terror group. After September 11, 2001, the network's headquarters in Doha reportedly put on display multiple pictures in its studio honoring the deceased Al Qaeda terrorist Osama bin Laden. In 2013, dozens of staff resigned in protest of Al Jazeera's ``biased coverage'' in favor of the Muslim Brotherhood jihadist organization. ______ [From HFAC Hearing on Sept. 18 entitled, ``The ISIS Threat: Weighing the Obama Administration's Response''] Mr. Poe. You just go ahead and answer the question: Who are we at war with? I call them ISIS. Who would you call these? Secretary Kerry.

Mr. KILDEE. Mr. Speaker, it is week five for the new Congress--and it happens to be Groundhog Day--and my Republican colleagues, unfortunately, I think, are still stuck in the shadow of their extreme agenda. Instead of taking up a jobs bill or an infrastructure bill or a minimum wage bill to give working families bigger paychecks, they have again decided this week, for the 56th time, to take up repeal of the Affordable Care Act. Never mind that repealing the ACA in this House would take away insurance for millions of individuals or raise insurance premiums on working families or allow insurance companies to once again discriminate against those who have preexisting medical conditions. This extreme bill we know will never see the light of day or become law, however. Similar bills were dead on arrival the first time that the Speaker brought it up, and it is not going anywhere this time. This vote, pandering to the most extreme voices at the expense of a jobs bill or the first vote on a national manufacturing plan or the first vote to repair our crumbling roads and bridges, takes away the time to deal with those important issues and continues this House on the road to another repeal of the ACA. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 17 (Monday, February 2, 2015)] [House] [Page H672] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] REPEAL OF THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT FOR THE 56TH TIME (Mr. KILDEE asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.)

I am proud to have cosponsored and voted in favor of several bills last week which diverted more financial and labor-intensive resources to countering these atrocities. These bills include H.R. 514, the Human Trafficking Prioritization Act, and H.R. 469, the Strengthening Child Welfare Response to Trafficking Act, among others.

CREC-2015-02-02-pt1-PgH673,CREC-2015-02-02,114,THE BUDGET MESSAGE OF THE PRESIDENT--MESSAGE FROM THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES (H. DOC. NO. 114-3),"[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 17 (Monday, February 2, 2015)] [House] [Pages H673-H675] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] THE BUDGET MESSAGE OF THE PRESIDENT--MESSAGE FROM THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES (H. DOC. NO. 114-3) The SPEAKER pro tempore laid before the House the following message from the President of the United States; which was read and, together with the accompanying papers, referred to the Committee on Appropriations and ordered to be printed: To the Congress of the United States: After a breakthrough year for America, our economy is growing and creating jobs at the fastest pace since 1999, and in 58 months we have created over 11 million jobs. Our unemployment rate is now lower than it was before the financial crisis. More of our kids are graduating than ever before. More of our people are insured than ever before. We are as free from the grip of foreign oil as we've been in almost 30 years. Thanks to the hard work, resilience, and determination of the American people over the last six years, the shadow of crisis has passed. With a growing economy, shrinking deficits, bustling industry, and booming energy production, we have risen from recession freer to write our own future than any other Nation on Earth. It's now up to us to choose what kind of country we want to be over the next 15 years, and for decades to come. Will we accept an economy where prosperity belongs to a few and opportunity remains out of reach for too many? Or will we commit ourselves to an economy that generates rising incomes and chances for everyone who makes the effort? Over the last six years, we've seen that middle-class economic works. We've reaffirmed one of our most fundamental values as Americans: that this country does best when everyone gets their fair shot, does their fair share, and plays by the same set of rules. The ideas I offer in this Budget are designed to bring middle-class economics into the 21st Century. These proposals are practical, not partisan. They'll help working families feel more secure with paychecks that go further, help American workers upgrade their skills, so they can compete for higher-paying jobs, and help create the conditions for our businesses to keep generating good new jobs for our workers to fill. The Budget will do these things while fulfilling our most basic responsibility to keep Americans safe. We will make these investments and end the harmful spending cuts known as sequestration, by cutting inefficient spending, and closing tax loopholes. We will also put our Nation on a more sustainable fiscal path by achieving $1.8 trillion in deficit reduction, primarily from reforms in health programs, our tax code, and immigration. First, middle-class economics means helping working families afford the cornerstones of economic security: child care, college, health care, a home, and retirement. We will help working families tackle the high costs of child care and make ends meet by tripling the maximum child care credit for middle-class families with young children, increasing it to up to $3,000 per child, expanding child care assistance to all eligible low-income families with children under four by the end of 10 years, and making preschool available to all four- year-olds. The Budget also provides middle-class families more flexibility at work by encouraging States to develop paid family leave programs. Today, we're the only advanced country on Earth that doesn't guarantee paid sick leave or paid maternity leave to our workers. Forty-three million workers have no paid sick leave, which forces too many parents to make the gut-wrenching choice between a paycheck and a sick kid at home. It's time to change that. For many families in today's economy, having both parents in the workforce isn't a luxury, it's an economic necessity. Second, middle-class economics means making sure more Americans have the chance to earn the skills and education they need to keep earning higher wages down the road. The Budget calls for new investments and innovation that will expand preschool and invest in high-quality early education for America's youngest learners, provide more help to disadvantaged students and the schools that serve them, better prepare and support teachers, and transform our high schools so they help all students graduate prepared for college and career. In a 21st Century economy that rewards knowledge more than ever, our efforts must reach higher than high school. By the end of this decade, two-thirds of job openings will require some higher education, and no American should be priced out of the education they need. Over the course of my Administration, we have increased Pell Grants, and the Budget continues to ensure that they will keep pace with inflation over time. The Budget also includes a bold new plan to bring down the cost of community college tuition for responsible students, to zero. Forty percent of college students attend community college; some to learn a particular skill, others as a path to a four-year degree. It is time for two years of college to become as free and universal in America as high school is today. Even as we help give our students the chance to succeed, we also must work together to give our workers the chance to retool. Last year, the Congress came together and passed important improvements to the Nation's job training system with the bipartisan Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act. To build on this progress, the proposals in this Budget support more in-person career counseling for unemployed workers and double the number of workers receiving training through the workforce development system. My plan would also expand the successful ``learn-as-you-earn'' approaches that our European counterparts use successfully by investing in the expansion of registered apprenticeships that allow workers to learn new skills while they are earning a paycheck. The Budget would also ensure that training leads to high-quality jobs by investing in projects that feature strong employer partnerships, include work-based learning, and develop new employer- validated credentials. As we welcome home a new generation of returning heroes, the Budget makes sure they have the chance to live the American Dream they helped defend. It invests in the five pillars I have outlined to support our Nation's veterans: providing the resources and funding they deserve; ensuring high-quality and timely health care; getting veterans their earned benefits quickly and efficiently; ending veteran homelessness; and helping veterans and their families get good jobs, education, and access to affordable housing. Third, middle-class economics means creating the kind of environment that helps businesses start here, stay here, and hire here. We want to build on the growth we have seen in the manufacturing sector, where more than 750,000 new jobs have been created over the last 58 months. To create jobs, continue growth in the industry, and strengthen America's leadership in advanced manufacturing technology, the Budget funds a national network of 45 manufacturing institutes, building on the nine already funded through 2015. As part of the manufacturing initiative, the Budget also launches a Scale-Up Fund, funded through a public-private partnership to help ensure that if a technology is invented in the United States, it can be made in the United States. The Budget proposes an investment fund to help startup companies produce the goods they have developed. Taken together, these investments will help ensure that America keeps making things the rest of the world wants to buy and will also help create manufacturing jobs for the future. Our Nation thrives when we are leading the world with cutting-edge technology in manufacturing, infrastructure, clean energy, and other growing fields. That is why the Budget includes investments in cutting- edge advanced manufacturing research--to make sure we are leading the way in creating technology that supports our manufacturing sector; biomedical research--like our BRAIN initiative, which studies the brain to offer new insight into diseases like Alzheimer's, and Precision Medicine, which can improve [[Page H674]] health outcomes and better treat diseases; or, agricultural research-- looking at climate resilience and sustainability. These investments have the potential to create high-wage jobs, improve lives, and open the door to new industries, resulting in sustainable economic growth. As our economy continues to grow, our Nation's businesses and workers also need a stronger infrastructure that works in the new economy-- modern ports, stronger bridges, better roads, faster trains, and better broadband. The Budget proposes to build a 21st Century infrastructure that creates jobs for thousands of construction workers and engineers, connects hardworking Americans to their jobs, and makes it easier for businesses to transport goods. The Budget would do more to repair and modernize our existing roads and bridges, while expanding transit systems to link communities and support workers. These proposals will put more money in middle-class pockets, raise wages, and bring more high-paying jobs to America. To pay for them, the Budget will cut inefficient spending and close tax loopholes to make sure that everyone pays their fair share. The Budget closes loopholes that punish businesses investing domestically and reward companies that keep profits abroad, and uses some of the savings created to rebuild our aging infrastructure. The Budget closes loopholes that perpetuate inequality by allowing the top one percent of Americans to avoid paying any taxes on their accumulated wealth and uses that money to help more young people go to college. The Budget simplifies the system so that a small business owner can file based on her actual bank statement, instead of the number of accountants she can afford. It is time for tax reform that at its core is about helping working families afford child care and college, and plan for retirement, and above all, get a leg up in the new economy. Of course, we cannot separate our work here at home from challenges beyond our shores. By winding down the wars overseas and lowering war spending, we've strengthened our economy and shrunk our deficits. But we still face threats to our security that we must address. The Budget supports our efforts to degrade and ultimately destroy ISIL. We are leading over 60 partners in a global effort that will take time and steady resolve. As I made clear in my State of the Union address, I am calling on the Congress to show the world that we are united in this mission by passing a bill to authorize the use of force against ISIL. The Budget supports our efforts to counter Russian pressure and aggressive actions in concert with our European allies, by funding support for Ukraine's democracy and efforts to reassure our NATO allies. We also must look beyond the issues that have consumed us in the past to shape the coming century. This Budget provides the resources we need to defend the Nation against cyber-attacks. No foreign nation, no hacker, should be able to shut down our networks, steal our trade secrets, or invade the privacy of American families. In addition to increasing funding to protect our Nation against cyber-attacks, I continue to urge the Congress to finally pass the legislation we need to meet this evolving threat. The Budget invests in our efforts to confront the threat posed by infectious diseases like Ebola--here at home, and internationally. It provides resources to support the Global Health Security Agenda, increases funding to eradicate polio and other global health challenges, and creates a new Impact Fund for targeted global HIV/AIDS efforts. In addition, the Budget increases funding for domestic preparedness efforts to more effectively and efficiently respond to potential, future outbreaks here at home and dedicates funding for States to develop HIV Plans to help them reach the goals of the National HIV/AIDS Strategy. The Budget also capitalizes on historic opportunities in Asia and the Pacific--where we are modernizing alliances, opening new markets, and making sure that other nations play by the rules--in how they trade, resolve disputes, and do their part to confront the biggest challenges we face. No challenge poses a greater threat to future generations than climate change. Fourteen of our planet's 15 warmest years on record have all fallen in the first 15 years of this century. The world's best scientists are telling us that our activities are changing the climate, and if we do not act forcefully, we'll continue to see rising oceans, longer, hotter heat waves, dangerous droughts and floods, and massive disruptions that can trigger greater migration, conflict, and hunger around the globe. The Pentagon says that climate change poses immediate risks to our national security. And as discussed in the Budget, the significant costs to inaction on climate change hit the Federal Government's bottom-line directly, as worsening climate impacts create Government liabilities. That's why this Budget takes action on climate by supporting the Climate Action Plan that I released in 2013 with investments to accelerate carbon pollution reductions, to build on-the- ground partnerships with local communities and help them put in place strategies for greater resilience to climate change impacts, and to support America's leadership abroad on this important moral and fiscal issue. Beyond these critical investments, the Budget also supports my Management Agenda, which seeks to create a Government for the future that is more efficient, effective, and supportive of economic growth. The Budget includes initiatives to improve the service we provide to the American public; to leverage the Federal Government's buying power to bring more value and efficiency to how we use taxpayer dollars; to open Government data and research to the private sector to drive innovation and economic growth; to promote smarter information technology; and, to attract and retain the best talent in the Federal workforce. The Budget includes proposals to consolidate and reorganize Government agencies to make them leaner and more efficient, and it increases the use of evidence and evaluation to ensure that taxpayer dollars are spent wisely on programs that work. The Congress can also help grow the economy, reduce deficits, and strengthen Social Security by passing comprehensive immigration reform. Last year, I took a series of executive actions to crack down on illegal immigration at the border; prioritize deporting felons, not families; and allow certain undocumented immigrants who register and pass criminal and national security background checks to start paying their fair share of taxes and stay in the United States without fear of deportation. I also took action to streamline the legal immigration system for talented STEM students, entrepreneurs, and business. These actions will raise average wages for all American workers and reduce the deficit. But this is only a first step toward real reform, and as I have said before, the Congress should act on the more comprehensive reform that only changes in the law can provide. Independent economists say immigration reform will grow our economy and shrink our deficits by almost $1 trillion over 20 years. It is time to fix our broken system and help grow our economy by passing comprehensive immigration reform. The Budget also builds on the progress we have made ensuring that every American has the peace of mind that comes with quality, affordable health insurance. The Affordable Care Act has helped to provide millions more Americans get covered. It has forced insurance companies to play by the rules by prohibiting discrimination for pre- existing conditions and eliminating lifetime insurance caps. It has also helped to put our Nation on a more sustainable fiscal path by slowing the growth of health care costs. The Budget includes additional reforms and cost saving proposals to continue encouraging high-quality and efficient health care. This Budget shows what we can do if we invest in America's future and commit ourselves to an economy that rewards hard work, generates rising incomes, and allows everyone to share in the prosperity of a growing America. It lays out a strategy to strengthen our middle class, and help America's hard-working families get ahead in a time of relentless economic and technological change. Fifteen years into this new century, and six years after the darkest days of the financial crisis, we have picked [[Page H675]] ourselves up, dusted ourselves off, and begun again the work of remaking America. We've laid a new foundation. A brighter future is ours to write. This Budget will help us begin this new chapter together. Barack Obama.

The White House, February 2, 2015. ____________________","Congressional Record, Volume 161 Issue 17 (Monday, February 2, 2015) [Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 17 (Monday, February 2, 2015)] [House] [Pages H673-H675] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] THE BUDGET MESSAGE OF THE PRESIDENT--MESSAGE FROM THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES (H. DOC. NO. 114-3) The SPEAKER pro tempore laid before the House the following message from the President of the United States; which was read and, together with the accompanying papers, referred to the Committee on Appropriations and ordered to be printed: To the Congress of the United States: After a breakthrough year for America, our economy is growing and creating jobs at the fastest pace since 1999, and in 58 months we have created over 11 million jobs. Our unemployment rate is now lower than it was before the financial crisis. More of our kids are graduating than ever before. More of our people are insured than ever before. We are as free from the grip of foreign oil as we've been in almost 30 years. Thanks to the hard work, resilience, and determination of the American people over the last six years, the shadow of crisis has passed. With a growing economy, shrinking deficits, bustling industry, and booming energy production, we have risen from recession freer to write our own future than any other Nation on Earth. It's now up to us to choose what kind of country we want to be over the next 15 years, and for decades to come. Will we accept an economy where prosperity belongs to a few and opportunity remains out of reach for too many? Or will we commit ourselves to an economy that generates rising incomes and chances for everyone who makes the effort? Over the last six years, we've seen that middle-class economic works. We've reaffirmed one of our most fundamental values as Americans: that this country does best when everyone gets their fair shot, does their fair share, and plays by the same set of rules. The ideas I offer in this Budget are designed to bring middle-class economics into the 21st Century. These proposals are practical, not partisan. They'll help working families feel more secure with paychecks that go further, help American workers upgrade their skills, so they can compete for higher-paying jobs, and help create the conditions for our businesses to keep generating good new jobs for our workers to fill. The Budget will do these things while fulfilling our most basic responsibility to keep Americans safe. We will make these investments and end the harmful spending cuts known as sequestration, by cutting inefficient spending, and closing tax loopholes. We will also put our Nation on a more sustainable fiscal path by achieving $1.8 trillion in deficit reduction, primarily from reforms in health programs, our tax code, and immigration. First, middle-class economics means helping working families afford the cornerstones of economic security: child care, college, health care, a home, and retirement. We will help working families tackle the high costs of child care and make ends meet by tripling the maximum child care credit for middle-class families with young children, increasing it to up to $3,000 per child, expanding child care assistance to all eligible low-income families with children under four by the end of 10 years, and making preschool available to all four- year-olds. The Budget also provides middle-class families more flexibility at work by encouraging States to develop paid family leave programs. Today, we're the only advanced country on Earth that doesn't guarantee paid sick leave or paid maternity leave to our workers. Forty-three million workers have no paid sick leave, which forces too many parents to make the gut-wrenching choice between a paycheck and a sick kid at home. It's time to change that. For many families in today's economy, having both parents in the workforce isn't a luxury, it's an economic necessity. Second, middle-class economics means making sure more Americans have the chance to earn the skills and education they need to keep earning higher wages down the road. The Budget calls for new investments and innovation that will expand preschool and invest in high-quality early education for America's youngest learners, provide more help to disadvantaged students and the schools that serve them, better prepare and support teachers, and transform our high schools so they help all students graduate prepared for college and career. In a 21st Century economy that rewards knowledge more than ever, our efforts must reach higher than high school. By the end of this decade, two-thirds of job openings will require some higher education, and no American should be priced out of the education they need. Over the course of my Administration, we have increased Pell Grants, and the Budget continues to ensure that they will keep pace with inflation over time. The Budget also includes a bold new plan to bring down the cost of community college tuition for responsible students, to zero. Forty percent of college students attend community college; some to learn a particular skill, others as a path to a four-year degree. It is time for two years of college to become as free and universal in America as high school is today. Even as we help give our students the chance to succeed, we also must work together to give our workers the chance to retool. Last year, the Congress came together and passed important improvements to the Nation's job training system with the bipartisan Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act. To build on this progress, the proposals in this Budget support more in-person career counseling for unemployed workers and double the number of workers receiving training through the workforce development system. My plan would also expand the successful ``learn-as-you-earn'' approaches that our European counterparts use successfully by investing in the expansion of registered apprenticeships that allow workers to learn new skills while they are earning a paycheck. The Budget would also ensure that training leads to high-quality jobs by investing in projects that feature strong employer partnerships, include work-based learning, and develop new employer- validated credentials. As we welcome home a new generation of returning heroes, the Budget makes sure they have the chance to live the American Dream they helped defend. It invests in the five pillars I have outlined to support our Nation's veterans: providing the resources and funding they deserve; ensuring high-quality and timely health care; getting veterans their earned benefits quickly and efficiently; ending veteran homelessness; and helping veterans and their families get good jobs, education, and access to affordable housing. Third, middle-class economics means creating the kind of environment that helps businesses start here, stay here, and hire here. We want to build on the growth we have seen in the manufacturing sector, where more than 750,000 new jobs have been created over the last 58 months. To create jobs, continue growth in the industry, and strengthen America's leadership in advanced manufacturing technology, the Budget funds a national network of 45 manufacturing institutes, building on the nine already funded through 2015. As part of the manufacturing initiative, the Budget also launches a Scale-Up Fund, funded through a public-private partnership to help ensure that if a technology is invented in the United States, it can be made in the United States. The Budget proposes an investment fund to help startup companies produce the goods they have developed. Taken together, these investments will help ensure that America keeps making things the rest of the world wants to buy and will also help create manufacturing jobs for the future. Our Nation thrives when we are leading the world with cutting-edge technology in manufacturing, infrastructure, clean energy, and other growing fields. That is why the Budget includes investments in cutting- edge advanced manufacturing research--to make sure we are leading the way in creating technology that supports our manufacturing sector; biomedical research--like our BRAIN initiative, which studies the brain to offer new insight into diseases like Alzheimer's, and Precision Medicine, which can improve [[Page H674]] health outcomes and better treat diseases; or, agricultural research-- looking at climate resilience and sustainability. These investments have the potential to create high-wage jobs, improve lives, and open the door to new industries, resulting in sustainable economic growth. As our economy continues to grow, our Nation's businesses and workers also need a stronger infrastructure that works in the new economy-- modern ports, stronger bridges, better roads, faster trains, and better broadband. The Budget proposes to build a 21st Century infrastructure that creates jobs for thousands of construction workers and engineers, connects hardworking Americans to their jobs, and makes it easier for businesses to transport goods. The Budget would do more to repair and modernize our existing roads and bridges, while expanding transit systems to link communities and support workers. These proposals will put more money in middle-class pockets, raise wages, and bring more high-paying jobs to America. To pay for them, the Budget will cut inefficient spending and close tax loopholes to make sure that everyone pays their fair share. The Budget closes loopholes that punish businesses investing domestically and reward companies that keep profits abroad, and uses some of the savings created to rebuild our aging infrastructure. The Budget closes loopholes that perpetuate inequality by allowing the top one percent of Americans to avoid paying any taxes on their accumulated wealth and uses that money to help more young people go to college. The Budget simplifies the system so that a small business owner can file based on her actual bank statement, instead of the number of accountants she can afford. It is time for tax reform that at its core is about helping working families afford child care and college, and plan for retirement, and above all, get a leg up in the new economy. Of course, we cannot separate our work here at home from challenges beyond our shores. By winding down the wars overseas and lowering war spending, we've strengthened our economy and shrunk our deficits. But we still face threats to our security that we must address. The Budget supports our efforts to degrade and ultimately destroy ISIL. We are leading over 60 partners in a global effort that will take time and steady resolve. As I made clear in my State of the Union address, I am calling on the Congress to show the world that we are united in this mission by passing a bill to authorize the use of force against ISIL. The Budget supports our efforts to counter Russian pressure and aggressive actions in concert with our European allies, by funding support for Ukraine's democracy and efforts to reassure our NATO allies. We also must look beyond the issues that have consumed us in the past to shape the coming century. This Budget provides the resources we need to defend the Nation against cyber-attacks. No foreign nation, no hacker, should be able to shut down our networks, steal our trade secrets, or invade the privacy of American families. In addition to increasing funding to protect our Nation against cyber-attacks, I continue to urge the Congress to finally pass the legislation we need to meet this evolving threat. The Budget invests in our efforts to confront the threat posed by infectious diseases like Ebola--here at home, and internationally. It provides resources to support the Global Health Security Agenda, increases funding to eradicate polio and other global health challenges, and creates a new Impact Fund for targeted global HIV/AIDS efforts. In addition, the Budget increases funding for domestic preparedness efforts to more effectively and efficiently respond to potential, future outbreaks here at home and dedicates funding for States to develop HIV Plans to help them reach the goals of the National HIV/AIDS Strategy. The Budget also capitalizes on historic opportunities in Asia and the Pacific--where we are modernizing alliances, opening new markets, and making sure that other nations play by the rules--in how they trade, resolve disputes, and do their part to confront the biggest challenges we face. No challenge poses a greater threat to future generations than climate change. Fourteen of our planet's 15 warmest years on record have all fallen in the first 15 years of this century. The world's best scientists are telling us that our activities are changing the climate, and if we do not act forcefully, we'll continue to see rising oceans, longer, hotter heat waves, dangerous droughts and floods, and massive disruptions that can trigger greater migration, conflict, and hunger around the globe. The Pentagon says that climate change poses immediate risks to our national security. And as discussed in the Budget, the significant costs to inaction on climate change hit the Federal Government's bottom-line directly, as worsening climate impacts create Government liabilities. That's why this Budget takes action on climate by supporting the Climate Action Plan that I released in 2013 with investments to accelerate carbon pollution reductions, to build on-the- ground partnerships with local communities and help them put in place strategies for greater resilience to climate change impacts, and to support America's leadership abroad on this important moral and fiscal issue. Beyond these critical investments, the Budget also supports my Management Agenda, which seeks to create a Government for the future that is more efficient, effective, and supportive of economic growth. The Budget includes initiatives to improve the service we provide to the American public; to leverage the Federal Government's buying power to bring more value and efficiency to how we use taxpayer dollars; to open Government data and research to the private sector to drive innovation and economic growth; to promote smarter information technology; and, to attract and retain the best talent in the Federal workforce. The Budget includes proposals to consolidate and reorganize Government agencies to make them leaner and more efficient, and it increases the use of evidence and evaluation to ensure that taxpayer dollars are spent wisely on programs that work. The Congress can also help grow the economy, reduce deficits, and strengthen Social Security by passing comprehensive immigration reform. Last year, I took a series of executive actions to crack down on illegal immigration at the border; prioritize deporting felons, not families; and allow certain undocumented immigrants who register and pass criminal and national security background checks to start paying their fair share of taxes and stay in the United States without fear of deportation. I also took action to streamline the legal immigration system for talented STEM students, entrepreneurs, and business. These actions will raise average wages for all American workers and reduce the deficit. But this is only a first step toward real reform, and as I have said before, the Congress should act on the more comprehensive reform that only changes in the law can provide. Independent economists say immigration reform will grow our economy and shrink our deficits by almost $1 trillion over 20 years. It is time to fix our broken system and help grow our economy by passing comprehensive immigration reform. The Budget also builds on the progress we have made ensuring that every American has the peace of mind that comes with quality, affordable health insurance. The Affordable Care Act has helped to provide millions more Americans get covered. It has forced insurance companies to play by the rules by prohibiting discrimination for pre- existing conditions and eliminating lifetime insurance caps. It has also helped to put our Nation on a more sustainable fiscal path by slowing the growth of health care costs. The Budget includes additional reforms and cost saving proposals to continue encouraging high-quality and efficient health care. This Budget shows what we can do if we invest in America's future and commit ourselves to an economy that rewards hard work, generates rising incomes, and allows everyone to share in the prosperity of a growing America. It lays out a strategy to strengthen our middle class, and help America's hard-working families get ahead in a time of relentless economic and technological change. Fifteen years into this new century, and six years after the darkest days of the financial crisis, we have picked [[Page H675]] ourselves up, dusted ourselves off, and begun again the work of remaking America. We've laid a new foundation. A brighter future is ours to write. This Budget will help us begin this new chapter together. Barack Obama.

Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 361) to amend the Homeland Security Act of 2002 to codify authority under existing grant guidance authorizing use of Urban Area Security Initiative and State Homeland Security Grant Program funding for enhancing medical preparedness, medical surge capacity, and mass prophylaxis capabilities. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The text of the bill is as follows: H.R. 361 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. This Act may be cited as the ``Medical Preparedness Allowable Use Act''. SEC. 2. USE OF CERTAIN HOMELAND SECURITY GRANT FUNDS FOR ENHANCING MEDICAL PREPAREDNESS, MEDICAL SURGE CAPACITY, AND MASS PROPHYLAXIS CAPABILITIES. Section 2008 of the Homeland Security Act of 2002 (6 U.S.C. 609) is amended-- (1) in subsection (a), by redesignating paragraphs (10) through (13) as paragraphs (11) through (14), respectively, and by inserting after paragraph (9) the following: ``(10) enhancing medical preparedness, medical surge capacity, and mass prophylaxis capabilities, including the development and maintenance of an initial pharmaceutical stockpile, including medical kits, and diagnostics sufficient to protect first responders, their families, immediate victims, and vulnerable populations from a chemical or biological event;''; and (2) in subsection (b)(3)(B), by striking ``(a)(10)'' and inserting ``(a)(11)''. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Carter) and the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Payne) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Georgia. General Leave Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks and include any extraneous material on the bill under consideration. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Georgia? There was no objection. Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 361, the Medical Preparedness Allowable Use Act, introduced by my colleague and the former chairman of the Committee on Homeland Security's Subcommittee on Emergency Preparedness, Response, and Communications, Congressman Bilirakis. This bill amends the Homeland Security Act of 2002 to make it clear that grant funds under the State Homeland Security Grant Program and the Urban Area Security Initiative may be used to enhance medical preparedness and purchase medical countermeasures. The grant guidance for these programs currently allows funds to be used for medical preparedness equipment and activities. This bill codifies those activities to ensure that they will continue to be allowable, and it will not cost any additional money to do so. We have seen the benefits that grant funds, including those used for medical preparedness activities, have provided when it comes to response capabilities. This was clearly demonstrated in the response to the Boston Marathon bombings. We know that the threat of a chemical or biological attack is real. We must ensure that our first responders have the tools and capabilities they need if such an event should occur. As a result of this bill, grant funds could be used for items such as predeployed medical kits for first responders and their families, caches of equipment, training and exercises, and planning activities. Identical language to H.R. 361 was approved by the Committee on Homeland Security last year by a bipartisan voice vote and passed the House by a vote of 391-2. Mr. Speaker, as a pharmacist and someone whose coastal district lives under constant threat of hurricanes, floods, and other natural disasters, I know firsthand the benefits that these types of equipment and activities can provide for our first responders and the citizens that they protect. I urge Members to support this bill, and I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. PAYNE. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 361, the Medical Preparedness Allowable Use Act, and I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, H.R. 361 would authorize grant recipients under the Homeland Security Grant or Urban Area Security Initiative Program to use funding to enhance medical preparedness and medical surge capacity. Currently, the Federal Emergency Management Agency already permits grantees to use these funds for such purposes. However, enactment of this measure into law will give some predictability to the grant recipients as they struggle to build and maintain medical response capabilities at the State and local levels. Over the course of the past year, our doctors, nurses, and emergency service personnel have responded to outbreaks of Ebola, measles, D68, and other contagious diseases. Although none of these outbreaks were the result of bioterrorism, they nevertheless served as a reminder that medical preparedness is a critical component of our national preparedness. I commend the gentleman from Florida for working with the Homeland Security Committee to make sure that medical preparedness continues to remain a priority at the Federal, State, and local level. I would be remiss if I did not take this time and opportunity to express my support for the reauthorization of the Metropolitan Medical Response System, which would provide dedicated funds to medical preparedness activities. I would also note that Members may be here today to discuss the use of grant funding, but overshadowing this debate is a more immediate obstacle to the effectiveness of DHS' grant programs: the fact that Congress has not passed a full-year funding for the Department of Homeland Security that the President can sign into law. Mr. Speaker, I will place into the Record a Washington Post editorial piece entitled, ``GOP holds security hostage to immigration.'' It underscores the urgent need for gamesmanship over immigration to be put aside for the betterment of national security. With respect to the measure before us today, I would note that, without funding, neither the Urban Area Security Initiative nor the State Homeland Security Grant Program will be working to build medical preparedness capabilities, or any other capability, at the State and local level. Ask any first responder, and they will tell you: These grant programs are essential to building, maintaining, and exercising important preparedness capabilities. [[Page H676]] Representing the 10th Congressional District, I have seen firsthand how these programs have bolstered capabilities, both in Newark and Jersey City. Delays or cuts to these programs only punish first responders and medical services personnel, and the citizens whom they are charged with protecting. GOP Holds Security Hostage to Immigration [By Editorial Board, February 1, 2015] How far will Republicans in Congress take their reckless flirtation with undermining government this time? Will they, as seems increasingly likely, fail to pass a bill that the president can sign ensuring adequate funding for the Department of Homeland Security and its 280,000 employees before the agency's support expires Feb. 27? Are they ready to let funding lapse, secure in the knowledge that Border Patrol officers, Secret Service agents, airport security personnel and other so-called essential employees would still have to report to work--even though they would not be drawing paychecks? A number of prominent Republican lawmakers clearly believe that denying funding to the nation's premier organ of domestic security is no big deal, as long as the move expresses the GOP's anger about President Obama's executive actions on immigration. As Rep. Mario Diaz-Balart (R-Fla.) put it to Politico: Letting the department's funding lapse would not be ``the end of the world.'' Mr. Diaz-Balart's complacency may come as news to Americans concerned about the risk of terrorism in the wake of attacks in Paris, Ottawa, Sydney and elsewhere. It certainly came as news to Homeland Security Secretary Jeh C. Johnson, as well as his three predecessors--Democrat Janet Napolitano and Republicans Michael Chertoff and Tom Ridge--all of whom have warned GOP lawmakers not to conflate essential funding for the department with the political fight over immigration. House Republicans were deaf to such appeals. Last month, they passed a bill furnishing the department with $40 billion in funding through September, the end of the current budget year. But they attached provisions to that bill, certain to draw a presidential veto, that would kill the administration's plan to temporarily protect several million undocumented immigrants from deportation and repeal a program, in force since 2012, that offers a similar shield to people brought here illegally as children. There is room for legitimate debate over the president's most recent unilateral moves on immigration, which we happen to agree represent executive overreach. If congressional Republicans want to attack those actions responsibly, with discrete legislation, they are free to try--though they are unlikely to muster the votes to override a presidential veto. However, it is another thing to wield their frustration over immigration as a cudgel, holding hostage an entire department of government that is critical to the nation's security. That is as irresponsible as it is politically ill advised. On Friday, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) announced the body would consider the House bill this week, a sign that the GOP is persisting with its game of chicken. The bill is unlikely to attract the necessary 60 votes for passage, which would require a half-dozen Democratic defections. But there is no shortage of Republican lawmakers who would rather try to antagonize the president than carry out the workaday task of funding the government. In the absence of a bill, the department's funding lapses in less than a month. What happens in the intervening weeks will indicate whether Republicans are more interested in gamesmanship or governance. Mr. PAYNE. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I yield as much time as he may consume to the distinguished gentleman from Florida (Mr. Bilirakis), the sponsor of this legislation. Mr. BILIRAKIS. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Carter) as well. I also want to thank the ranking member for doing such a great job and working on this piece of legislation. I rise in support of my bill, H.R. 361, the Medical Preparedness Allowable Use Act. This legislation would amend the Homeland Security Act of 2002 to clarify that grant funds under the State Homeland Security Grant Program and the Urban Area Security Initiative may be used to enhance medical preparedness and purchase medical countermeasures. I originally introduced the Medical Preparedness Allowable Use Act in 2012 after a series of hearings on medical countermeasures when I proudly served as chairman of the Subcommittee on Emergency Preparedness, Response, and Communications. At these hearings, the need for this legislation was highlighted when we received numerous testimonies from the emergency response community on the importance of stockpiling medical countermeasures in the event of a WMD attack. This includes predeployed medical kits for first responders, as Mr. Carter said, their families, and immediate victims of widespread terrorist attacks on our homeland and natural disasters, resources similar to those provided to postal workers participating in the national U.S. Postal Medical Countermeasures Dispensing Pilot Program. The grant guidance for the State Homeland Security Grant Program and the Urban Area Security Initiative currently permits this funding to be used to procure medical countermeasures. It also allows for other medical preparedness and medical surge capacity equipment and activities. However, this guidance is developed on an annual basis. There is no guarantee that these uses will be authorized in the future. To be clear, as Mr. Carter said, no new funding is authorized in this bill. However, the expenditures authorized and codified by the bill we are considering today can make a big difference in protecting the public. If we are not safe, Mr. Speaker, nothing else matters. {time} 1715 Codifying this authority will assist emergency responders in the event of an attack, providing certainty that grant funding may be used to support them now and in the future. We must have certainty. I consistently find myself in awe of our first responders and the sacrifices that they make on the public's behalf. In the wake of recent terrorist attacks, such as the Boston Marathon bombing, I am committed to ensuring Congress fulfills its obligation to support those brave men and women responding to these various threats. I thank my colleagues, Representative Susan Brooks and Representative Peter King, for being original cosponsors and for their continued support with this legislation. I would also like to commend the chairman of the full Homeland Security Committee, Chairman McCaul, for his leadership in making this initiative a priority and also for being a cosponsor of this good bill. Finally, I would like to note that the Emergency Services Coalition for Medical Preparedness continues to endorse this bill and its intent. The Medical Preparedness Allowable Use Act passed the House with overwhelming bipartisan support in the last two Congresses; however, the Senate never acted on this measure. With new leadership in the Senate, Mr. Speaker, I am hopeful that they can take this measure up quickly so that we can get this before the President to be signed into law. We have a responsibility to ensure our communities are prepared, equipped, and capable of executing countermeasures for future terrorist threats and natural disasters. Passage of H.R. 361 would truly aid our first responders in this endeavor. Mr. Speaker, I urge all my colleagues to vote in favor of this great bill. Mr. PAYNE. Mr. Speaker, I have no further requests for time on my side. If my colleague on the other side is ready to close, I am as well. Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I have no further requests for time and am prepared to close. Mr. PAYNE. Mr. Speaker, the Medical Preparedness Allowable Use Act is a good bill, and it has my support. The gentleman from Florida has given us a piece of commonsense legislation, and this is the type of legislation, when it comes to keeping our Nation safe during times of attack or natural disaster, that we need. I also urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support the passage of a clean DHS funding bill so that the States and urban areas across the country can continue building and maintaining critical preparedness capabilities. Again, I would like to thank the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Bilirakis) for working with us on this issue, and I congratulate him on a wonderful bill that ensures that our Nation continues to be prepared in times of disaster. I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 361, the Medical Preparedness Allowable Use Act. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, as I noted earlier, this bill enjoyed [[Page H677]] broad bipartisan support last Congress. I hope Members will once again express their support for the men and women who protect us every day by voting for this bill. I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. McCAUL. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 361, the Medical Preparedness Allowable Use Act that was introduced by Congressman Bilirakis. Over the years, the Committee on Homeland Security has heard about the importance of medical countermeasures. This bill amends the Homeland Security Act of 2002 to make it clear that grant funds under the State Homeland Security Grant Program and Urban Area Security Initiative may be used to enhance medical preparedness and purchase medical countermeasures. We owe it to our emergency response community, our first responders, to ensure that they have every tool necessary to be prepared for and combat the threats they face every day and may face in the future. Over the years, we have seen that the investments in medical preparedness activities have provided positive benefits when it comes to response capabilities. This was clearly demonstrated in the response to the Boston Marathon bombings when the medical community was largely praised by all involved in the response. The Committee on Homeland Security heard testimony last year from the head of Boston Emergency Medical Services, Chief Hooley, who spoke about the importance of Homeland Security grant funding in their preparation for events such as the Boston Marathon Bombing. Sadly, we realize that the threat of a biological or chemical or other attack is real. We therefore must do everything that we can to ensure that our first responders are prepared to combat the threat. This measure has passed the House both in the 112th and the 113th Congress with overwhelming bipartisan support. I ask my colleagues to support this measure and my colleagues in the Senate to do the same Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 361, the Medical Preparedness Allowable Use Act for two reasons. First, the bill will save lives. Second, the legislation is necessary to support the vital work of first responders in the event of a biological and chemical terrorists attack or incident. The legislation provides for the development and maintenance of an initial pharmaceutical stockpile, including medical kits, and diagnostics sufficient to protect first responders, their families, and immediate victims from a chemical or biological event. The Medical Preparedness Allowable Use Act will amend the Homeland Security Act of 2002 to authorize the use of Urban Area Security Initiative and State Homeland Security Grant Program funding for: enhancing medical preparedness, medical surge capacity, and mass prophylaxis capabilities. This legislation ensures that first responders have necessary medicines and treatments to protect themselves, their families and those within their vicinity immediately should a biological and chemical terrorist attack occur. In short, first responders will not be able to do the work of saving lives if they fall victim to an attack or are distracted by worry regarding how their family may be fairing during a biological or chemical attack should one occur. First responders often include law enforcement officers, fire fighters, and emergency medical personnel. The city of Houston covers over a 1000 square mile region in Southeast Texas. It has an evening population of nearly two million people and over three million during the day when commuters are in the city. There are 103 Fire Stations that serve the city of Houston with most offering ambulance or medic support, but there is only one station Number 22 that Specializes in Hazardous Material. In the city of Houston one out of every ten citizens use Emergency Management Services (EMS) and within a year there are over 200,000 EMS incidents involving over 225,000 patients or potential patients. EMS response services have 88 City of Houston EMS vehicles, with just under fifty percent staffed by two paramedics and can provide Advanced Life Support (ALS) to patients. These consist of 15 ALS Squads, and 22 ALS transport units with eight functioning in a ``Dual'' capacity as both Advanced Life Support and Basic Life Support (BLS). The remaining fifty-one transport units are Basic Life Support (BLS), and staffed by two Emergency Medical Technicians. Law enforcement agencies that serve the city of Houston include the Houston Police Department, Harris County Sheriff's Department, Harris County Constables, Port of Houston Authority Police and Corrections Officers. Because of the nature of chemical or biological terrorist attacks mass casualties are the objective and the impressive resources of our nation's 4th largest city would likely be overwhelmed immediately should an attack occur it is important to provide them with the resources provided by this legislation. The prepositioning of resources in the form of medicines that can support pulmonary respiratory function or arrest neurological damage as a result of poisoning lives can be saved that could otherwise be lost. This bill can reduce deaths and give victims the greatest chance for survival and recovery. Emergency responders because of this bill would have treatments in the communities where they serve and live to help neighbors, co- workers, and people who are immediate need to live saving help. As a senior member of the House Homeland Security Committee, I am mindful of the need for our first responders to be prepared and well trained to manage a wide range of potential threats both conventional and unconventional. This bill offers one more resource that will be available to first responders to do the work they have dedicated their lives to doing-- saving lives. I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting H.R. 361 the Medical Preparedness Allowable Use Act for two reasons. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Carter) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 361. The question was taken. The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the opinion of the Chair, two-thirds being in the affirmative, the ayes have it. Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays. The yeas and nays were ordered. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further proceedings on this motion will be postponed. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 17 (Monday, February 2, 2015)] [House] [Pages H675-H677] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] MEDICAL PREPAREDNESS ALLOWABLE USE ACT Mr. CARTER of Georgia.

Mr. Speaker, as I noted earlier, this bill enjoyed [[Page H677]] broad bipartisan support last Congress. I hope Members will once again express their support for the men and women who protect us every day by voting for this bill. I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. McCAUL. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 361, the Medical Preparedness Allowable Use Act that was introduced by Congressman Bilirakis. Over the years, the Committee on Homeland Security has heard about the importance of medical countermeasures. This bill amends the Homeland Security Act of 2002 to make it clear that grant funds under the State Homeland Security Grant Program and Urban Area Security Initiative may be used to enhance medical preparedness and purchase medical countermeasures. We owe it to our emergency response community, our first responders, to ensure that they have every tool necessary to be prepared for and combat the threats they face every day and may face in the future. Over the years, we have seen that the investments in medical preparedness activities have provided positive benefits when it comes to response capabilities. This was clearly demonstrated in the response to the Boston Marathon bombings when the medical community was largely praised by all involved in the response. The Committee on Homeland Security heard testimony last year from the head of Boston Emergency Medical Services, Chief Hooley, who spoke about the importance of Homeland Security grant funding in their preparation for events such as the Boston Marathon Bombing. Sadly, we realize that the threat of a biological or chemical or other attack is real. We therefore must do everything that we can to ensure that our first responders are prepared to combat the threat. This measure has passed the House both in the 112th and the 113th Congress with overwhelming bipartisan support. I ask my colleagues to support this measure and my colleagues in the Senate to do the same Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 361, the Medical Preparedness Allowable Use Act for two reasons. First, the bill will save lives. Second, the legislation is necessary to support the vital work of first responders in the event of a biological and chemical terrorists attack or incident. The legislation provides for the development and maintenance of an initial pharmaceutical stockpile, including medical kits, and diagnostics sufficient to protect first responders, their families, and immediate victims from a chemical or biological event. The Medical Preparedness Allowable Use Act will amend the Homeland Security Act of 2002 to authorize the use of Urban Area Security Initiative and State Homeland Security Grant Program funding for: enhancing medical preparedness, medical surge capacity, and mass prophylaxis capabilities. This legislation ensures that first responders have necessary medicines and treatments to protect themselves, their families and those within their vicinity immediately should a biological and chemical terrorist attack occur. In short, first responders will not be able to do the work of saving lives if they fall victim to an attack or are distracted by worry regarding how their family may be fairing during a biological or chemical attack should one occur. First responders often include law enforcement officers, fire fighters, and emergency medical personnel. The city of Houston covers over a 1000 square mile region in Southeast Texas. It has an evening population of nearly two million people and over three million during the day when commuters are in the city. There are 103 Fire Stations that serve the city of Houston with most offering ambulance or medic support, but there is only one station Number 22 that Specializes in Hazardous Material. In the city of Houston one out of every ten citizens use Emergency Management Services (EMS) and within a year there are over 200,000 EMS incidents involving over 225,000 patients or potential patients. EMS response services have 88 City of Houston EMS vehicles, with just under fifty percent staffed by two paramedics and can provide Advanced Life Support (ALS) to patients. These consist of 15 ALS Squads, and 22 ALS transport units with eight functioning in a ``Dual'' capacity as both Advanced Life Support and Basic Life Support (BLS). The remaining fifty-one transport units are Basic Life Support (BLS), and staffed by two Emergency Medical Technicians. Law enforcement agencies that serve the city of Houston include the Houston Police Department, Harris County Sheriff's Department, Harris County Constables, Port of Houston Authority Police and Corrections Officers. Because of the nature of chemical or biological terrorist attacks mass casualties are the objective and the impressive resources of our nation's 4th largest city would likely be overwhelmed immediately should an attack occur it is important to provide them with the resources provided by this legislation. The prepositioning of resources in the form of medicines that can support pulmonary respiratory function or arrest neurological damage as a result of poisoning lives can be saved that could otherwise be lost. This bill can reduce deaths and give victims the greatest chance for survival and recovery. Emergency responders because of this bill would have treatments in the communities where they serve and live to help neighbors, co- workers, and people who are immediate need to live saving help. As a senior member of the House Homeland Security Committee, I am mindful of the need for our first responders to be prepared and well trained to manage a wide range of potential threats both conventional and unconventional. This bill offers one more resource that will be available to first responders to do the work they have dedicated their lives to doing-- saving lives. I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting H.R. 361 the Medical Preparedness Allowable Use Act for two reasons. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Carter) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 361. The question was taken. The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the opinion of the Chair, two-thirds being in the affirmative, the ayes have it. Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays. The yeas and nays were ordered. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further proceedings on this motion will be postponed. ____________________","Congressional Record, Volume 161 Issue 17 (Monday, February 2, 2015) [Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 17 (Monday, February 2, 2015)] [House] [Pages H675-H677] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] MEDICAL PREPAREDNESS ALLOWABLE USE ACT Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 361) to amend the Homeland Security Act of 2002 to codify authority under existing grant guidance authorizing use of Urban Area Security Initiative and State Homeland Security Grant Program funding for enhancing medical preparedness, medical surge capacity, and mass prophylaxis capabilities. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The text of the bill is as follows: H.R. 361 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. This Act may be cited as the ``Medical Preparedness Allowable Use Act''. SEC. 2. USE OF CERTAIN HOMELAND SECURITY GRANT FUNDS FOR ENHANCING MEDICAL PREPAREDNESS, MEDICAL SURGE CAPACITY, AND MASS PROPHYLAXIS CAPABILITIES. Section 2008 of the Homeland Security Act of 2002 (6 U.S.C. 609) is amended-- (1) in subsection (a), by redesignating paragraphs (10) through (13) as paragraphs (11) through (14), respectively, and by inserting after paragraph (9) the following: ``(10) enhancing medical preparedness, medical surge capacity, and mass prophylaxis capabilities, including the development and maintenance of an initial pharmaceutical stockpile, including medical kits, and diagnostics sufficient to protect first responders, their families, immediate victims, and vulnerable populations from a chemical or biological event;''; and (2) in subsection (b)(3)(B), by striking ``(a)(10)'' and inserting ``(a)(11)''. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Carter) and the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Payne) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Georgia. General Leave Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks and include any extraneous material on the bill under consideration. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Georgia? There was no objection. Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 361, the Medical Preparedness Allowable Use Act, introduced by my colleague and the former chairman of the Committee on Homeland Security's Subcommittee on Emergency Preparedness, Response, and Communications, Congressman Bilirakis. This bill amends the Homeland Security Act of 2002 to make it clear that grant funds under the State Homeland Security Grant Program and the Urban Area Security Initiative may be used to enhance medical preparedness and purchase medical countermeasures. The grant guidance for these programs currently allows funds to be used for medical preparedness equipment and activities. This bill codifies those activities to ensure that they will continue to be allowable, and it will not cost any additional money to do so. We have seen the benefits that grant funds, including those used for medical preparedness activities, have provided when it comes to response capabilities. This was clearly demonstrated in the response to the Boston Marathon bombings. We know that the threat of a chemical or biological attack is real. We must ensure that our first responders have the tools and capabilities they need if such an event should occur. As a result of this bill, grant funds could be used for items such as predeployed medical kits for first responders and their families, caches of equipment, training and exercises, and planning activities. Identical language to H.R. 361 was approved by the Committee on Homeland Security last year by a bipartisan voice vote and passed the House by a vote of 391-2. Mr. Speaker, as a pharmacist and someone whose coastal district lives under constant threat of hurricanes, floods, and other natural disasters, I know firsthand the benefits that these types of equipment and activities can provide for our first responders and the citizens that they protect. I urge Members to support this bill, and I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. PAYNE. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 361, the Medical Preparedness Allowable Use Act, and I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, H.R. 361 would authorize grant recipients under the Homeland Security Grant or Urban Area Security Initiative Program to use funding to enhance medical preparedness and medical surge capacity. Currently, the Federal Emergency Management Agency already permits grantees to use these funds for such purposes. However, enactment of this measure into law will give some predictability to the grant recipients as they struggle to build and maintain medical response capabilities at the State and local levels. Over the course of the past year, our doctors, nurses, and emergency service personnel have responded to outbreaks of Ebola, measles, D68, and other contagious diseases. Although none of these outbreaks were the result of bioterrorism, they nevertheless served as a reminder that medical preparedness is a critical component of our national preparedness. I commend the gentleman from Florida for working with the Homeland Security Committee to make sure that medical preparedness continues to remain a priority at the Federal, State, and local level. I would be remiss if I did not take this time and opportunity to express my support for the reauthorization of the Metropolitan Medical Response System, which would provide dedicated funds to medical preparedness activities. I would also note that Members may be here today to discuss the use of grant funding, but overshadowing this debate is a more immediate obstacle to the effectiveness of DHS' grant programs: the fact that Congress has not passed a full-year funding for the Department of Homeland Security that the President can sign into law. Mr. Speaker, I will place into the Record a Washington Post editorial piece entitled, ``GOP holds security hostage to immigration.'' It underscores the urgent need for gamesmanship over immigration to be put aside for the betterment of national security. With respect to the measure before us today, I would note that, without funding, neither the Urban Area Security Initiative nor the State Homeland Security Grant Program will be working to build medical preparedness capabilities, or any other capability, at the State and local level. Ask any first responder, and they will tell you: These grant programs are essential to building, maintaining, and exercising important preparedness capabilities. [[Page H676]] Representing the 10th Congressional District, I have seen firsthand how these programs have bolstered capabilities, both in Newark and Jersey City. Delays or cuts to these programs only punish first responders and medical services personnel, and the citizens whom they are charged with protecting. GOP Holds Security Hostage to Immigration [By Editorial Board, February 1, 2015] How far will Republicans in Congress take their reckless flirtation with undermining government this time? Will they, as seems increasingly likely, fail to pass a bill that the president can sign ensuring adequate funding for the Department of Homeland Security and its 280,000 employees before the agency's support expires Feb. 27? Are they ready to let funding lapse, secure in the knowledge that Border Patrol officers, Secret Service agents, airport security personnel and other so-called essential employees would still have to report to work--even though they would not be drawing paychecks? A number of prominent Republican lawmakers clearly believe that denying funding to the nation's premier organ of domestic security is no big deal, as long as the move expresses the GOP's anger about President Obama's executive actions on immigration. As Rep. Mario Diaz-Balart (R-Fla.) put it to Politico: Letting the department's funding lapse would not be ``the end of the world.'' Mr. Diaz-Balart's complacency may come as news to Americans concerned about the risk of terrorism in the wake of attacks in Paris, Ottawa, Sydney and elsewhere. It certainly came as news to Homeland Security Secretary Jeh C. Johnson, as well as his three predecessors--Democrat Janet Napolitano and Republicans Michael Chertoff and Tom Ridge--all of whom have warned GOP lawmakers not to conflate essential funding for the department with the political fight over immigration. House Republicans were deaf to such appeals. Last month, they passed a bill furnishing the department with $40 billion in funding through September, the end of the current budget year. But they attached provisions to that bill, certain to draw a presidential veto, that would kill the administration's plan to temporarily protect several million undocumented immigrants from deportation and repeal a program, in force since 2012, that offers a similar shield to people brought here illegally as children. There is room for legitimate debate over the president's most recent unilateral moves on immigration, which we happen to agree represent executive overreach. If congressional Republicans want to attack those actions responsibly, with discrete legislation, they are free to try--though they are unlikely to muster the votes to override a presidential veto. However, it is another thing to wield their frustration over immigration as a cudgel, holding hostage an entire department of government that is critical to the nation's security. That is as irresponsible as it is politically ill advised. On Friday, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) announced the body would consider the House bill this week, a sign that the GOP is persisting with its game of chicken. The bill is unlikely to attract the necessary 60 votes for passage, which would require a half-dozen Democratic defections. But there is no shortage of Republican lawmakers who would rather try to antagonize the president than carry out the workaday task of funding the government. In the absence of a bill, the department's funding lapses in less than a month. What happens in the intervening weeks will indicate whether Republicans are more interested in gamesmanship or governance. Mr. PAYNE. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I yield as much time as he may consume to the distinguished gentleman from Florida (Mr. Bilirakis), the sponsor of this legislation. Mr. BILIRAKIS. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Carter) as well. I also want to thank the ranking member for doing such a great job and working on this piece of legislation. I rise in support of my bill, H.R. 361, the Medical Preparedness Allowable Use Act. This legislation would amend the Homeland Security Act of 2002 to clarify that grant funds under the State Homeland Security Grant Program and the Urban Area Security Initiative may be used to enhance medical preparedness and purchase medical countermeasures. I originally introduced the Medical Preparedness Allowable Use Act in 2012 after a series of hearings on medical countermeasures when I proudly served as chairman of the Subcommittee on Emergency Preparedness, Response, and Communications. At these hearings, the need for this legislation was highlighted when we received numerous testimonies from the emergency response community on the importance of stockpiling medical countermeasures in the event of a WMD attack. This includes predeployed medical kits for first responders, as Mr. Carter said, their families, and immediate victims of widespread terrorist attacks on our homeland and natural disasters, resources similar to those provided to postal workers participating in the national U.S. Postal Medical Countermeasures Dispensing Pilot Program. The grant guidance for the State Homeland Security Grant Program and the Urban Area Security Initiative currently permits this funding to be used to procure medical countermeasures. It also allows for other medical preparedness and medical surge capacity equipment and activities. However, this guidance is developed on an annual basis. There is no guarantee that these uses will be authorized in the future. To be clear, as Mr. Carter said, no new funding is authorized in this bill. However, the expenditures authorized and codified by the bill we are considering today can make a big difference in protecting the public. If we are not safe, Mr. Speaker, nothing else matters. {time} 1715 Codifying this authority will assist emergency responders in the event of an attack, providing certainty that grant funding may be used to support them now and in the future. We must have certainty. I consistently find myself in awe of our first responders and the sacrifices that they make on the public's behalf. In the wake of recent terrorist attacks, such as the Boston Marathon bombing, I am committed to ensuring Congress fulfills its obligation to support those brave men and women responding to these various threats. I thank my colleagues, Representative Susan Brooks and Representative Peter King, for being original cosponsors and for their continued support with this legislation. I would also like to commend the chairman of the full Homeland Security Committee, Chairman McCaul, for his leadership in making this initiative a priority and also for being a cosponsor of this good bill. Finally, I would like to note that the Emergency Services Coalition for Medical Preparedness continues to endorse this bill and its intent. The Medical Preparedness Allowable Use Act passed the House with overwhelming bipartisan support in the last two Congresses; however, the Senate never acted on this measure. With new leadership in the Senate, Mr. Speaker, I am hopeful that they can take this measure up quickly so that we can get this before the President to be signed into law. We have a responsibility to ensure our communities are prepared, equipped, and capable of executing countermeasures for future terrorist threats and natural disasters. Passage of H.R. 361 would truly aid our first responders in this endeavor. Mr. Speaker, I urge all my colleagues to vote in favor of this great bill. Mr. PAYNE. Mr. Speaker, I have no further requests for time on my side. If my colleague on the other side is ready to close, I am as well. Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I have no further requests for time and am prepared to close. Mr. PAYNE. Mr. Speaker, the Medical Preparedness Allowable Use Act is a good bill, and it has my support. The gentleman from Florida has given us a piece of commonsense legislation, and this is the type of legislation, when it comes to keeping our Nation safe during times of attack or natural disaster, that we need. I also urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support the passage of a clean DHS funding bill so that the States and urban areas across the country can continue building and maintaining critical preparedness capabilities. Again, I would like to thank the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Bilirakis) for working with us on this issue, and I congratulate him on a wonderful bill that ensures that our Nation continues to be prepared in times of disaster. I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 361, the Medical Preparedness Allowable Use Act. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, as I noted earlier, this bill enjoyed [[Page H677]] broad bipartisan support last Congress. I hope Members will once again express their support for the men and women who protect us every day by voting for this bill. I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. McCAUL. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 361, the Medical Preparedness Allowable Use Act that was introduced by Congressman Bilirakis.

for passage, which would require a half-dozen democratic defections. but there is no shortage of republican lawmakers who would rather try to antagonize the president than carry out the workaday task of funding the government. in the absence of a bill, the department's funding lapses in less than a month. what happens in the intervening weeks will indicate whether republicans are more interested in gamesmanship or governance. mr. payne. mr. speaker, i reserve the balance of my time. mr. carter of georgia. mr. speaker, i yield as much time as he may consume to the distinguished gentleman from florida (mr. bilirakis), the sponsor of this legislation. mr. bilirakis. mr. speaker, i want to thank the gentleman from georgia (mr. carter) as well. i also want to thank the ranking member for doing such a great job and working on this piece of legislation. i rise in support of my bill, h.r. 361, the medical preparedness allowable use act. this legislation would amend the homeland security act of 2002 to clarify that grant funds under the state homeland security grant program and the urban area security initiative may be used to enhance medical preparedness and purchase medical countermeasures. i originally introduced the medical preparedness allowable use act in 2012 after a series of hearings on medical countermeasures when i proudly served as chairman of the subcommittee on emergency preparedness, response, and communications. at these hearings, the need for this legislation was highlighted when we received numerous testimonies from the emergency response community on the importance of stockpiling medical countermeasures in the event of a wmd attack. this includes predeployed medical kits for first responders, as mr. carter said, their families, and immediate victims of widespread terrorist attacks on our homeland and natural disasters, resources similar to those provided to postal workers participating in the national u.s. postal medical countermeasures dispensing pilot program. the grant guidance for the state homeland security grant program and the urban area security initiative currently permits this funding to be used to procure medical countermeasures. it also allows for other medical preparedness and medical surge capacity equipment and activities. however, this guidance is developed on an annual basis. there is no guarantee that these uses will be authorized in the future. to be clear, as mr. carter said, no new funding is authorized in this bill. however, the expenditures authorized and codified by the bill we are considering today can make a big difference in protecting the public. if we are not safe, mr. speaker, nothing else matters. {time} 1715 codifying this authority will assist emergency responders in the event of an attack, providing certainty that grant funding may be used to support them now and in the future. we must have certainty. i consistently find myself in awe of our first responders and the sacrifices that they make on the public's behalf. in the wake of recent terrorist attacks, such as the boston marathon bombing, i am committed to ensuring congress fulfills its obligation to support those brave men and women responding to these various threats. i thank my colleagues, representative susan brooks and representative peter king, for being original cosponsors and for their continued support with this legislation. i would also like to commend the chairman of the full homeland security committee, chairman mccaul, for his leadership in making this initiative a priority and also for being a cosponsor of this good bill. finally, i would like to note that the emergency services coalition for medical preparedness continues to endorse this bill and its intent. the medical preparedness allowable use act passed the house with overwhelming bipartisan support in the last two congresses; however, the senate never acted on this measure. with new leadership in the senate, mr. speaker, i am hopeful that they can take this measure up quickly so that we can get this before the president to be signed into law. we have a responsibility to ensure our communities are prepared, equipped, and capable of executing countermeasures for future terrorist threats and natural disasters. passage of h.r. 361 would truly aid our first responders in this endeavor. mr. speaker, i urge all my colleagues to vote in favor of this great bill. mr. payne. mr. speaker, i have no further requests for time on my side. if my colleague on the other side is ready to close, i am as well. mr. carter of georgia. mr. speaker, i have no further requests for time and am prepared to close. mr. payne. mr. speaker, the medical preparedness allowable use act is a good bill, and it has my support. the gentleman from florida has given us a piece of commonsense legislation, and this is the type of legislation, when it comes to keeping our nation safe during times of attack or natural disaster, that we need. i also urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support the passage of a clean dhs funding bill so that the states and urban areas across the country can continue building and maintaining critical preparedness capabilities. again, i would like to thank the gentleman from florida (mr. bilirakis) for working with us on this issue, and i congratulate him on a wonderful bill that ensures that our nation continues to be prepared in times of disaster. i urge my colleagues to support h.r. 361, the medical preparedness allowable use act. mr. speaker, i yield back the balance of my time. mr. carter of georgia. mr. speaker, as i noted earlier, this bill enjoyed [[page h677]] broad bipartisan support last congress. i hope members will once again express their support for the men and women who protect us every day by voting for this bill. i yield back the balance of my time. mr. mccaul. mr. speaker, i rise today in support of h.r. 361, the medical preparedness allowable use act that was introduced by congressman bilirakis. over the years, the committee on homeland security has heard about the importance of medical countermeasures. this bill amends the homeland security act of 2002 to make it clear that grant funds under the state homeland security grant program and urban area security initiative may be used to enhance medical preparedness and purchase medical countermeasures. we owe it to our emergency response community, our first responders, to ensure that they have every tool necessary to be prepared for and combat the threats they face every day and may face in the future. over the years, we have seen that the investments in medical preparedness activities have provided positive benefits when it comes to response capabilities. this was clearly demonstrated in the response to the boston marathon bombings when the medical community was largely praised by all involved in the response. the committee on homeland security heard testimony last year from the head of boston emergency medical services, chief hooley, who spoke about the importance of homeland security grant funding in their preparation for events such as the boston marathon bombing. sadly, we realize that the threat of a biological or chemical or other attack is real. we therefore must do everything that we can to ensure that our first responders are prepared to combat the threat. this measure has passed the house both in the 112th and the 113th congress with overwhelming bipartisan support. i ask my colleagues to support this measure and my colleagues in the senate to do the same ms. jackson lee. mr. speaker, i rise in strong support of h.r. 361, the medical preparedness allowable use act for two reasons. first, the bill will save lives. second, the legislation is necessary to support the vital work of first responders in the event of a biological and chemical terrorists attack or incident. the legislation provides for the development and maintenance of an initial pharmaceutical stockpile, including medical kits, and diagnostics sufficient to protect first responders, their families, and immediate victims from a chemical or biological event. the medical preparedness allowable use act will amend the homeland security act of 2002 to authorize the use of urban area security initiative and state homeland security grant program funding for: enhancing medical preparedness, medical surge capacity, and mass prophylaxis capabilities. this legislation ensures that first responders have necessary medicines and treatments to protect themselves, their families and those within their vicinity immediately should a biological and chemical terrorist attack occur. in short, first responders will not be able to do the work of saving lives if they fall victim to an attack or are distracted by worry regarding how their family may be fairing during a biological or chemical attack should one occur. first responders often include law enforcement officers, fire fighters, and emergency medical personnel. the city of houston covers over a 1000 square mile region in southeast texas. it has an evening population of nearly two million people and over three million during the day when commuters are in the city. there are 103 fire stations that serve the city of houston with most offering ambulance or medic support, but there is only one station number 22 that specializes in hazardous material. in the city of houston one out of every ten citizens use emergency management services (ems) and within a year there are over 200,000 ems incidents involving over 225,000 patients or potential patients. ems response services have 88 city of houston ems vehicles, with just under fifty percent staffed by two paramedics and can provide advanced life support (als) to patients. these consist of 15 als squads, and 22 als transport units with eight functioning in a ``dual'' capacity as both advanced life support and basic life support (bls). the remaining fifty-one transport units are basic life support (bls), and staffed by two emergency medical technicians. law enforcement agencies that serve the city of houston include the houston police department, harris county sheriff's department, harris county constables, port of houston authority police and corrections officers. because of the nature of chemical or biological terrorist attacks mass casualties are the objective and the impressive resources of our nation's 4th largest city would likely be overwhelmed immediately should an attack occur it is important to provide them with the resources provided by this legislation. the prepositioning of resources in the form of medicines that can support pulmonary respiratory function or arrest neurological damage as a result of poisoning lives can be saved that could otherwise be lost. this bill can reduce deaths and give victims the greatest chance for survival and recovery. emergency responders because of this bill would have treatments in the communities where they serve and live to help neighbors, co- workers, and people who are immediate need to live saving help. as a senior member of the house homeland security committee, i am mindful of the need for our first responders to be prepared and well trained to manage a wide range of potential threats both conventional and unconventional. this bill offers one more resource that will be available to first responders to do the work they have dedicated their lives to doing-- saving lives. i urge my colleagues to join me in supporting h.r. 361 the medical preparedness allowable use act for two reasons. the speaker pro tempore. the question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from georgia (mr. carter) that the house suspend the rules and pass the bill, h.r. 361. the question was taken. the speaker pro tempore. in the opinion of the chair, two-thirds being in the affirmative, the ayes have it. mr. carter of georgia. mr. speaker, on that i demand the yeas and nays. the yeas and nays were ordered. the speaker pro tempore. pursuant to clause 8 of rule xx, further proceedings on this motion will be postponed. ____________________",22051
CREC-2015-02-02-pt1-PgH677,CREC-2015-02-02,114,DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY INTEROPERABLE COMMUNICATIONS ACT,"[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 17 (Monday, February 2, 2015)] [House] [Pages H677-H680] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY INTEROPERABLE COMMUNICATIONS ACT Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 615) to amend the Homeland Security Act of 2002 to require the Under Secretary for Management of the Department of Homeland Security to take administrative action to achieve and maintain interoperable communications capabilities among the components of the Department of Homeland Security, and for other purposes.

Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Carter) and the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Payne) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Georgia. General Leave Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks and include any extraneous material on the bill under consideration. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Georgia? There was no objection. Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 615, the Department of Homeland Security Interoperable Communications Act, introduced by the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Payne), the ranking member of the Committee on Homeland Security's Subcommittee on Emergency Preparedness, Response, and Communications. This bill amends the Homeland Security Act of 2002 to include, among the responsibilities of the Department of Homeland Security's Under Secretary for Management, achieving and maintaining interoperable communications among the Department's components. H.R. 615 addresses the findings and recommendations of a November 2012 DHS Office of Inspector General report, which stated that the Department does not have the appropriate oversight or governance structure to ensure communications interoperability among its components. The Department has been in the forefront on working with stakeholders to provide our Nation's first responders with the resources and tools needed to have effective interoperable communications. Now the Department needs to practice what they preach. It is vital that the Department's components are able to effectively communicate day to day and, most importantly, during emergencies. Mr. Speaker, I recently visited our southwest border and met with men and women from the Border Patrol, Customs and Border Protection, and the Coast Guard who are on the front lines of our efforts to secure the border. It is vital that they have the ability to communicate with one another and personnel from other DHS components as they work to achieve their vital missions. In order to ensure the Department is taking the necessary steps to achieve and maintain interoperable communications capabilities, H.R. 615 requires the Department's Under Secretary for Management to submit an interoperable communications strategy to the Committee on Homeland Security no later than 120 days after enactment. I urge all Members to join me in supporting this bill, and I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. PAYNE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself as much time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 615, the Department of Homeland Security Interoperable Communications Act. My goal today is to put the Department of Homeland Security on the path to achieving agencywide interoperable communications. Almost 15 years ago, courageous first responders raced to Lower Manhattan, to an area that came to be known as Ground Zero. In the days that followed, first responders from neighboring jurisdictions, including Jersey City, responded to help with response and recovery efforts. Not long after these devastating attacks, concerns were raised about the interoperability gaps that existed between responders on that deadly September day. The 9/11 Commission identified improving interoperable communications at all levels of government as a pressing recommendation. They emphasized that both technology and governance are critical components of interoperable solutions and recognized DHS as the Federal agency responsible for spearheading such an effort. Though nationwide over $13 billion has been invested in achieving interoperable communications at the State and local level, we are still not there. At DHS, over $430 million has been invested into communication capabilities for its 123,000 radio users since 2003. However, in 2012, the Department's own top watchdog, the Office of Inspector General, found that DHS ``personnel do not have reliable interoperable communications for daily operations, planned events, and emergencies.'' In May of 2014, the inspector general testified before the Homeland Security Subcommittee that, out of 479 field radios that attempted to communicate on a specific channel, only one user could do so. That is a 99.8 percent failure rate. Too often, communication failures are attributed to technology or a lack of resources. But here, technology is not the culprit; it is the scapegoat. Indeed, the inspector general found that DHS had not established protocols to ensure that practices are in place to achieve interoperability throughout the Department. H.R. 615, the DHS Interoperable Communications Act, which I introduced with the gentlewoman from Indiana, Congresswoman Susan Brooks, the former chair of the Emergency Preparedness Subcommittee, would direct the Under Secretary for Management to issue policies and directives related to interoperability, develop a strategy to achieve DHS-wide interoperability, and report to Congress biannually on the Department's progress. Interoperable communications are essential to emergency response and Homeland Security operations. The men and women in uniform that serve and protect the 10th Congressional District of New Jersey never miss an opportunity to remind me of something we already know: interoperable communications save lives during disasters. Interoperable communications challenges must be addressed in a timely and thoughtful manner. Last Congress, [[Page H679]] this Chamber unanimously approved legislation identical to the measure before you today. Enactment of H.R. 615 into law would put DHS on the path to achieving interoperability. I would like to thank the former subcommittee chairwoman, Susan Brooks, for her dedicated efforts to work with me on this measure. I will miss working with her on this panel. I would also like to thank Ranking Member Thompson, Chairman McCaul, and the new chairwoman of the subcommittee, Ms. McSally, for their continued support in addressing this important issue. I urge my colleagues to support improving interoperable communications at DHS by voting. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as she may consume to the distinguished gentlelady from Indiana (Mrs. Brooks), the former chairman of the Subcommittee on Emergency Preparedness, Response, and Communications. Mrs. BROOKS of Indiana. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 615, the Department of Homeland Security Interoperable Communications Act. I did have the opportunity to work on this bill with the fine gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Payne), the ranking member of the Subcommittee on Emergency Preparedness, Response, and Communications last Congress when I chaired the subcommittee. I am very pleased to see this bill on the floor today, and I want to thank Chairman McCaul and Ranking Member Thompson for bringing it back to the floor. The need for interoperable communications was highlighted, as the Congressman from New Jersey noted, by the 9/11 Commission after the September 11 terrorist attacks. We know that much progress has been made by first responders across the country in gaining interoperability, and the Nationwide Public Safety Broadband Network that is being developed by the First Responder Network Authority will further contribute to these capabilities. However, as the Department of Homeland Security inspector general's November 2012 report illustrated, the Department, itself, has not made sufficient progress in addressing its own interoperable communications capabilities. {time} 1730 H.R. 615 works to address this serious issue by requiring the Department's Under Secretary for Management to develop a strategy for achieving and maintaining interoperable communications between the DHS components. It requires DHS, as you have learned, to report to Congress on the progress it is making toward achieving milestones. As a former U.S. attorney who helped set up Indiana's Anti-Terrorism Advisory Council after 9/11 and Indiana's first fusion center, I know firsthand the importance of seamless communication between first responders, especially in times of crisis, including those in the Department of Homeland Security. Continued inability to make progress on interoperability can have serious consequences for public safety across our country. That is why Congress must hold our various law enforcement agencies, particularly those in Federal Government, accountable for communicating clearly with one another to ensure we eliminate confusion, duplication, and discord among those most necessary when lives are on the line. That is exactly what the gentleman from New Jersey's bill does, and that is why I encourage my colleagues to support, once again, this very important piece of legislation, and I thank him for his leadership. Mr. PAYNE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentlewoman from New Jersey (Mrs. Watson Coleman), the ranking member of the Subcommittee on Oversight and Management Efficiency. I am glad to have her join us here in Congress for her great ability in the State legislature, and she has removed me from being the lowest member in the delegation, off the bottom. Mrs. WATSON COLEMAN. Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague from New Jersey and fellow member of the Committee on Homeland Security, Mr. Payne, and obviously my senior for yielding me this time. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of Ranking Member Payne's legislation, H.R. 615, the DHS Interoperable Communications Act. This commonsense, bipartisan legislation builds upon recommendations made by the Office of Inspector General of the Department of Homeland Security by requiring DHS to develop a strategy for achieving interoperable communications among the Department's components. During an emergency, be that a terrorist attack or natural disaster such as Superstorm Sandy that devastated my home State of New Jersey, it is essential that first responders are able to communicate. It is also essential that components of the Department of Homeland Security are able to communicate with one another at all times. H.R. 615, as introduced by my colleague from New Jersey and before us on the floor today, seeks to make that aspiration a reality. Sadly, Mr. Speaker, in the 14 years since the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, we have still not reached the day where interoperable communications is a universal reality among State, local, and Federal agencies. Ranking Member Payne's bill puts us on a path to fixing that reality as it relates to the Department of Homeland Security. Importantly, the bill clarifies and enhances the Department's Under Secretary for Management's responsibility for achieving and maintaining interoperable communications among the components of DHS. By doing so, the bill focuses this important mission and will aid Congress in conducting the oversight necessary to see that the policy goals of the bill are achieved. As ranking member of the Subcommittee on Oversight and Management Efficiency, I look forward to conducting robust oversight of DHS' operations in many areas, including interoperable communications. Mr. Speaker, I applaud the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Payne) for his work on this legislation and urge all of my colleagues to support H.R. 615, the DHS Interoperable Communications Act. Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I have no more speakers. If the gentleman from New Jersey has no further speakers, I am prepared to close once the gentleman does. Mr. PAYNE. Mr. Speaker, I have no more speakers, and I am prepared to close. Mr. Speaker, TSA must be able to talk to FEMA and the Coast Guard during an emergency, be it a terrorist incident or natural disaster. For that reason, the achievement of cross-component interoperable communications is essential to DHS' being able to carry out its mission. H.R. 615 takes a responsible approach to addressing the oversight findings of the inspector general and the Committee on Homeland Security about a serious operational gap at the Department of Homeland Security: interoperability. Moreover, an earlier version of this bipartisan measure passed the House unanimously last Congress. For these reasons, I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 615. With that, Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, it is vital that the various component agencies at the Department of Homeland Security be able to communicate on a daily basis and particularly in times of crisis. This bill will help to ensure these capabilities are implemented and maintained. I urge all Members to join me in supporting this legislation, and I yield back the balance of my time. Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 615, the Homeland Security Interoperable Communications Act for three reasons. The bill would address interoperability among information technology systems and radio communications systems to exchange voice, data, and video in real time. First, the bill will save lives of first responders and those they seek to help. Second, the legislation is necessary to create a seamless level of communication among Department of Homeland Security components that are first responders to a terrorist attack, natural [[Page H680]] or manmade disaster; and finally to meet the technological challenges of bridging the communication divide between different communications systems used by first responders within the Department of Homeland Security. As a senior member of the House Committee on Homeland Security, I am well aware, as are many of my colleagues, of the essential and lifesaving role of communications during a crisis. Because the tragedy of September 11, 2001, was compounded by communication failures among the brave first responders who entered the burning towers that comprised the World Trade Center it has been an imperative of the Homeland Security Committee to address first responder communication interoperability challenges. The number of first responders lost on that single day was the greatest loss of first responders at any single event in U.S. History: 343 New York City Fire Department firefighters; 23 New York City Police Department officers; 37 Port Authority Police Department officers; 15 EMTs; and 3 court officers were casualties of the attacks. The need for this bill authored by Congressman Payne is evident. The City of Houston covers over a 1000 square mile region in Southeast Texas. It has a night-time population of nearly two million people, which peaks with over three million daytime inhabitants. The city of Houston's 9-1-1 Emergency Center manages nearly 9,000 emergency calls per day. The volume of emergency calls can easily double during times of inclement weather or special City social/ sporting events like Hurricanes Ike in September 2008; and Katrina as well as Rita, which occurred in September and October of 2005). Annually, one out of every ten citizens uses EMS. There are over 200,000 EMS incidents involving over 225,000 patients or potential patients annually. On the average, EMS responds to a citizen every 3 minutes. Each EMS response is made by one of 88 City of Houston EMS vehicles. In 2013, the City of Houston's fire Department lost Captain EMT Matthew Renaud, Engineer Operator EMT Robert Bebee, Firefighter EMT Robert Garner and Probationary Firefighter Anne Sullivan when they responded to a hotel fire. Throughout the history of the Houston Police Department over 110 officers have lost their lives in the line of duty. Each member of the House of Representatives knows of the loss of a first responder who was going to the aid of those in harm's way. This bill will offer additional resources to the first responders of the Department of Homeland Security. The bill amends the Homeland Security Act of 2002 to include among the responsibilities of the Under Secretary for Management responsibilities with respect to policies and directives to achieve and maintain interoperable communications among the components of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). The Under Secretary of Homeland Security would submit to the House and Senate Homeland Security Committees a strategy, which shall be updated as necessary, for achieving and maintaining interoperable communications, including for daily operations, planned events, and emergencies, with corresponding milestones, that includes: an assessment of interoperability gaps in radio communications DHS components, as of this Act's enactment date; information on DHS efforts and activities, including current and planned policies, directives, and training, since November 1, 2012, to achieve and maintain interoperable communications, and planned efforts and activities to achieve and maintain interoperable communications; an assessment of obstacles and challenges to achieving and maintaining interoperable communications; information on, and an assessment of, the adequacy of mechanisms available to the Under Secretary to enforce and compel compliance with interoperable communications policies and directives of DHS; guidance provided to DHS components to implement interoperable communications policies and directives; the total amount of funds expended by DHS since November 1, 2012, and projected future expenditures, to achieve interoperable communications; and dates upon which DHS-wide interoperability is projected to be achieved for voice, data, and video communications, respectively, and interim milestones. The bill ensures that the Department of Homeland Security would conduct a survey of intra-agency efforts or task forces that have been delegated responsibilities for achieving and maintaining interoperable communications, and report on the status of these efforts, including: progress on each interim milestone; information on any policies, directives, guidance, and training established by the Under Secretary of Homeland Security; an assessment of the level of compliance, adoption, and participation among the DHS components with the policies, directives, guidance, and training established by the Under Secretary; and information on any additional resources or authorities needed by the Under Secretary. This bill will ensure that the Department of Homeland Security's first responders are prepared to meet the challenges of manmade or natural disasters. I ask my colleagues to join me in voting in favor of H.R. 615. Mr. McCAUL. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 615, the Department of Homeland Security Interoperable Communications Act that was introduced by the Congressman Payne. I am proud to join Ranking Member Thompson and Congresswoman Brooks in cosponsoring this legislation that will begin to solve a problem that continues to plague the Department of Homeland Security. This measure was written to address a November 2012 DHS Office of Inspector General report, which found that DHS lacks an effective governance structure to ensure interoperable communications among its components. This is unacceptable, and an issue that should be fixed, especially after the Department has been in existence for well over a decade. Component agencies of the Department of Homeland Security must be able to communicate on a daily basis, and particularly in times of crisis. One of the benefits of have a Department of Homeland Security should be that components, including FEMA, ICE, and CBP, are able to act as one department and communicate at will. This bill requires the Department's Under Secretary of Management to submit a strategy to the Committee on Homeland Security on achieving and maintaining interoperability within the Department. This measure passed the 113th Congress on a bipartisan vote and I urge all Members to join me in supporting this important legislation. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Carter) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 615. The question was taken. The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the opinion of the Chair, two-thirds being in the affirmative, the ayes have it. Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays. The yeas and nays were ordered.

Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Carter) and the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Payne) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Georgia. General Leave Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks and include any extraneous material on the bill under consideration. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Georgia? There was no objection. Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 615, the Department of Homeland Security Interoperable Communications Act, introduced by the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Payne), the ranking member of the Committee on Homeland Security's Subcommittee on Emergency Preparedness, Response, and Communications. This bill amends the Homeland Security Act of 2002 to include, among the responsibilities of the Department of Homeland Security's Under Secretary for Management, achieving and maintaining interoperable communications among the Department's components. H.R. 615 addresses the findings and recommendations of a November 2012 DHS Office of Inspector General report, which stated that the Department does not have the appropriate oversight or governance structure to ensure communications interoperability among its components. The Department has been in the forefront on working with stakeholders to provide our Nation's first responders with the resources and tools needed to have effective interoperable communications. Now the Department needs to practice what they preach. It is vital that the Department's components are able to effectively communicate day to day and, most importantly, during emergencies. Mr. Speaker, I recently visited our southwest border and met with men and women from the Border Patrol, Customs and Border Protection, and the Coast Guard who are on the front lines of our efforts to secure the border. It is vital that they have the ability to communicate with one another and personnel from other DHS components as they work to achieve their vital missions. In order to ensure the Department is taking the necessary steps to achieve and maintain interoperable communications capabilities, H.R. 615 requires the Department's Under Secretary for Management to submit an interoperable communications strategy to the Committee on Homeland Security no later than 120 days after enactment. I urge all Members to join me in supporting this bill, and I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. PAYNE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself as much time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 615, the Department of Homeland Security Interoperable Communications Act. My goal today is to put the Department of Homeland Security on the path to achieving agencywide interoperable communications. Almost 15 years ago, courageous first responders raced to Lower Manhattan, to an area that came to be known as Ground Zero. In the days that followed, first responders from neighboring jurisdictions, including Jersey City, responded to help with response and recovery efforts. Not long after these devastating attacks, concerns were raised about the interoperability gaps that existed between responders on that deadly September day. The 9/11 Commission identified improving interoperable communications at all levels of government as a pressing recommendation. They emphasized that both technology and governance are critical components of interoperable solutions and recognized DHS as the Federal agency responsible for spearheading such an effort. Though nationwide over $13 billion has been invested in achieving interoperable communications at the State and local level, we are still not there. At DHS, over $430 million has been invested into communication capabilities for its 123,000 radio users since 2003. However, in 2012, the Department's own top watchdog, the Office of Inspector General, found that DHS ``personnel do not have reliable interoperable communications for daily operations, planned events, and emergencies.'' In May of 2014, the inspector general testified before the Homeland Security Subcommittee that, out of 479 field radios that attempted to communicate on a specific channel, only one user could do so. That is a 99.8 percent failure rate. Too often, communication failures are attributed to technology or a lack of resources. But here, technology is not the culprit; it is the scapegoat. Indeed, the inspector general found that DHS had not established protocols to ensure that practices are in place to achieve interoperability throughout the Department. H.R. 615, the DHS Interoperable Communications Act, which I introduced with the gentlewoman from Indiana, Congresswoman Susan Brooks, the former chair of the Emergency Preparedness Subcommittee, would direct the Under Secretary for Management to issue policies and directives related to interoperability, develop a strategy to achieve DHS-wide interoperability, and report to Congress biannually on the Department's progress. Interoperable communications are essential to emergency response and Homeland Security operations. The men and women in uniform that serve and protect the 10th Congressional District of New Jersey never miss an opportunity to remind me of something we already know: interoperable communications save lives during disasters. Interoperable communications challenges must be addressed in a timely and thoughtful manner. Last Congress, [[Page H679]] this Chamber unanimously approved legislation identical to the measure before you today. Enactment of H.R. 615 into law would put DHS on the path to achieving interoperability. I would like to thank the former subcommittee chairwoman, Susan Brooks, for her dedicated efforts to work with me on this measure. I will miss working with her on this panel. I would also like to thank Ranking Member Thompson, Chairman McCaul, and the new chairwoman of the subcommittee, Ms. McSally, for their continued support in addressing this important issue. I urge my colleagues to support improving interoperable communications at DHS by voting. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as she may consume to the distinguished gentlelady from Indiana (Mrs. Brooks), the former chairman of the Subcommittee on Emergency Preparedness, Response, and Communications. Mrs. BROOKS of Indiana. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 615, the Department of Homeland Security Interoperable Communications Act. I did have the opportunity to work on this bill with the fine gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Payne), the ranking member of the Subcommittee on Emergency Preparedness, Response, and Communications last Congress when I chaired the subcommittee. I am very pleased to see this bill on the floor today, and I want to thank Chairman McCaul and Ranking Member Thompson for bringing it back to the floor. The need for interoperable communications was highlighted, as the Congressman from New Jersey noted, by the 9/11 Commission after the September 11 terrorist attacks. We know that much progress has been made by first responders across the country in gaining interoperability, and the Nationwide Public Safety Broadband Network that is being developed by the First Responder Network Authority will further contribute to these capabilities. However, as the Department of Homeland Security inspector general's November 2012 report illustrated, the Department, itself, has not made sufficient progress in addressing its own interoperable communications capabilities. {time} 1730 H.R. 615 works to address this serious issue by requiring the Department's Under Secretary for Management to develop a strategy for achieving and maintaining interoperable communications between the DHS components. It requires DHS, as you have learned, to report to Congress on the progress it is making toward achieving milestones. As a former U.S. attorney who helped set up Indiana's Anti-Terrorism Advisory Council after 9/11 and Indiana's first fusion center, I know firsthand the importance of seamless communication between first responders, especially in times of crisis, including those in the Department of Homeland Security. Continued inability to make progress on interoperability can have serious consequences for public safety across our country. That is why Congress must hold our various law enforcement agencies, particularly those in Federal Government, accountable for communicating clearly with one another to ensure we eliminate confusion, duplication, and discord among those most necessary when lives are on the line. That is exactly what the gentleman from New Jersey's bill does, and that is why I encourage my colleagues to support, once again, this very important piece of legislation, and I thank him for his leadership. Mr. PAYNE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentlewoman from New Jersey (Mrs. Watson Coleman), the ranking member of the Subcommittee on Oversight and Management Efficiency. I am glad to have her join us here in Congress for her great ability in the State legislature, and she has removed me from being the lowest member in the delegation, off the bottom. Mrs. WATSON COLEMAN. Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague from New Jersey and fellow member of the Committee on Homeland Security, Mr. Payne, and obviously my senior for yielding me this time. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of Ranking Member Payne's legislation, H.R. 615, the DHS Interoperable Communications Act. This commonsense, bipartisan legislation builds upon recommendations made by the Office of Inspector General of the Department of Homeland Security by requiring DHS to develop a strategy for achieving interoperable communications among the Department's components. During an emergency, be that a terrorist attack or natural disaster such as Superstorm Sandy that devastated my home State of New Jersey, it is essential that first responders are able to communicate. It is also essential that components of the Department of Homeland Security are able to communicate with one another at all times. H.R. 615, as introduced by my colleague from New Jersey and before us on the floor today, seeks to make that aspiration a reality. Sadly, Mr. Speaker, in the 14 years since the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, we have still not reached the day where interoperable communications is a universal reality among State, local, and Federal agencies. Ranking Member Payne's bill puts us on a path to fixing that reality as it relates to the Department of Homeland Security. Importantly, the bill clarifies and enhances the Department's Under Secretary for Management's responsibility for achieving and maintaining interoperable communications among the components of DHS. By doing so, the bill focuses this important mission and will aid Congress in conducting the oversight necessary to see that the policy goals of the bill are achieved. As ranking member of the Subcommittee on Oversight and Management Efficiency, I look forward to conducting robust oversight of DHS' operations in many areas, including interoperable communications. Mr. Speaker, I applaud the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Payne) for his work on this legislation and urge all of my colleagues to support H.R. 615, the DHS Interoperable Communications Act. Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I have no more speakers. If the gentleman from New Jersey has no further speakers, I am prepared to close once the gentleman does. Mr. PAYNE. Mr. Speaker, I have no more speakers, and I am prepared to close. Mr. Speaker, TSA must be able to talk to FEMA and the Coast Guard during an emergency, be it a terrorist incident or natural disaster. For that reason, the achievement of cross-component interoperable communications is essential to DHS' being able to carry out its mission. H.R. 615 takes a responsible approach to addressing the oversight findings of the inspector general and the Committee on Homeland Security about a serious operational gap at the Department of Homeland Security: interoperability. Moreover, an earlier version of this bipartisan measure passed the House unanimously last Congress. For these reasons, I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 615. With that, Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, it is vital that the various component agencies at the Department of Homeland Security be able to communicate on a daily basis and particularly in times of crisis. This bill will help to ensure these capabilities are implemented and maintained. I urge all Members to join me in supporting this legislation, and I yield back the balance of my time. Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 615, the Homeland Security Interoperable Communications Act for three reasons. The bill would address interoperability among information technology systems and radio communications systems to exchange voice, data, and video in real time. First, the bill will save lives of first responders and those they seek to help. Second, the legislation is necessary to create a seamless level of communication among Department of Homeland Security components that are first responders to a terrorist attack, natural [[Page H680]] or manmade disaster; and finally to meet the technological challenges of bridging the communication divide between different communications systems used by first responders within the Department of Homeland Security. As a senior member of the House Committee on Homeland Security, I am well aware, as are many of my colleagues, of the essential and lifesaving role of communications during a crisis. Because the tragedy of September 11, 2001, was compounded by communication failures among the brave first responders who entered the burning towers that comprised the World Trade Center it has been an imperative of the Homeland Security Committee to address first responder communication interoperability challenges. The number of first responders lost on that single day was the greatest loss of first responders at any single event in U.S. History: 343 New York City Fire Department firefighters; 23 New York City Police Department officers; 37 Port Authority Police Department officers; 15 EMTs; and 3 court officers were casualties of the attacks. The need for this bill authored by Congressman Payne is evident. The City of Houston covers over a 1000 square mile region in Southeast Texas. It has a night-time population of nearly two million people, which peaks with over three million daytime inhabitants. The city of Houston's 9-1-1 Emergency Center manages nearly 9,000 emergency calls per day. The volume of emergency calls can easily double during times of inclement weather or special City social/ sporting events like Hurricanes Ike in September 2008; and Katrina as well as Rita, which occurred in September and October of 2005). Annually, one out of every ten citizens uses EMS. There are over 200,000 EMS incidents involving over 225,000 patients or potential patients annually. On the average, EMS responds to a citizen every 3 minutes. Each EMS response is made by one of 88 City of Houston EMS vehicles. In 2013, the City of Houston's fire Department lost Captain EMT Matthew Renaud, Engineer Operator EMT Robert Bebee, Firefighter EMT Robert Garner and Probationary Firefighter Anne Sullivan when they responded to a hotel fire. Throughout the history of the Houston Police Department over 110 officers have lost their lives in the line of duty. Each member of the House of Representatives knows of the loss of a first responder who was going to the aid of those in harm's way. This bill will offer additional resources to the first responders of the Department of Homeland Security. The bill amends the Homeland Security Act of 2002 to include among the responsibilities of the Under Secretary for Management responsibilities with respect to policies and directives to achieve and maintain interoperable communications among the components of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). The Under Secretary of Homeland Security would submit to the House and Senate Homeland Security Committees a strategy, which shall be updated as necessary, for achieving and maintaining interoperable communications, including for daily operations, planned events, and emergencies, with corresponding milestones, that includes: an assessment of interoperability gaps in radio communications DHS components, as of this Act's enactment date; information on DHS efforts and activities, including current and planned policies, directives, and training, since November 1, 2012, to achieve and maintain interoperable communications, and planned efforts and activities to achieve and maintain interoperable communications; an assessment of obstacles and challenges to achieving and maintaining interoperable communications; information on, and an assessment of, the adequacy of mechanisms available to the Under Secretary to enforce and compel compliance with interoperable communications policies and directives of DHS; guidance provided to DHS components to implement interoperable communications policies and directives; the total amount of funds expended by DHS since November 1, 2012, and projected future expenditures, to achieve interoperable communications; and dates upon which DHS-wide interoperability is projected to be achieved for voice, data, and video communications, respectively, and interim milestones. The bill ensures that the Department of Homeland Security would conduct a survey of intra-agency efforts or task forces that have been delegated responsibilities for achieving and maintaining interoperable communications, and report on the status of these efforts, including: progress on each interim milestone; information on any policies, directives, guidance, and training established by the Under Secretary of Homeland Security; an assessment of the level of compliance, adoption, and participation among the DHS components with the policies, directives, guidance, and training established by the Under Secretary; and information on any additional resources or authorities needed by the Under Secretary. This bill will ensure that the Department of Homeland Security's first responders are prepared to meet the challenges of manmade or natural disasters. I ask my colleagues to join me in voting in favor of H.R. 615. Mr. McCAUL. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 615, the Department of Homeland Security Interoperable Communications Act that was introduced by the Congressman Payne. I am proud to join Ranking Member Thompson and Congresswoman Brooks in cosponsoring this legislation that will begin to solve a problem that continues to plague the Department of Homeland Security. This measure was written to address a November 2012 DHS Office of Inspector General report, which found that DHS lacks an effective governance structure to ensure interoperable communications among its components. This is unacceptable, and an issue that should be fixed, especially after the Department has been in existence for well over a decade. Component agencies of the Department of Homeland Security must be able to communicate on a daily basis, and particularly in times of crisis. One of the benefits of have a Department of Homeland Security should be that components, including FEMA, ICE, and CBP, are able to act as one department and communicate at will. This bill requires the Department's Under Secretary of Management to submit a strategy to the Committee on Homeland Security on achieving and maintaining interoperability within the Department. This measure passed the 113th Congress on a bipartisan vote and I urge all Members to join me in supporting this important legislation. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Carter) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 615. The question was taken. The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the opinion of the Chair, two-thirds being in the affirmative, the ayes have it. Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays. The yeas and nays were ordered. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further proceedings on this motion will be postponed. ____________________","Congressional Record, Volume 161 Issue 17 (Monday, February 2, 2015) [Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 17 (Monday, February 2, 2015)] [House] [Pages H677-H680] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY INTEROPERABLE COMMUNICATIONS ACT Mr. CARTER of Georgia.

I am very pleased to see this bill on the floor today, and I want to thank Chairman McCaul and Ranking Member Thompson for bringing it back to the floor. The need for interoperable communications was highlighted, as the Congressman from New Jersey noted, by the 9/11 Commission after the September 11 terrorist attacks. We know that much progress has been made by first responders across the country in gaining interoperability, and the Nationwide Public Safety Broadband Network that is being developed by the First Responder Network Authority will further contribute to these capabilities. However, as the Department of Homeland Security inspector general's November 2012 report illustrated, the Department, itself, has not made sufficient progress in addressing its own interoperable communications capabilities. {time} 1730 H.R. 615 works to address this serious issue by requiring the Department's Under Secretary for Management to develop a strategy for achieving and maintaining interoperable communications between the DHS components. It requires DHS, as you have learned, to report to Congress on the progress it is making toward achieving milestones. As a former U.S. attorney who helped set up Indiana's Anti-Terrorism Advisory Council after 9/11 and Indiana's first fusion center, I know firsthand the importance of seamless communication between first responders, especially in times of crisis, including those in the Department of Homeland Security. Continued inability to make progress on interoperability can have serious consequences for public safety across our country. That is why Congress must hold our various law enforcement agencies, particularly those in Federal Government, accountable for communicating clearly with one another to ensure we eliminate confusion, duplication, and discord among those most necessary when lives are on the line. That is exactly what the gentleman from New Jersey's bill does, and that is why I encourage my colleagues to support, once again, this very important piece of legislation, and I thank him for his leadership. Mr. PAYNE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentlewoman from New Jersey (Mrs. Watson Coleman), the ranking member of the Subcommittee on Oversight and Management Efficiency. I am glad to have her join us here in Congress for her great ability in the State legislature, and she has removed me from being the lowest member in the delegation, off the bottom. Mrs. WATSON COLEMAN. Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague from New Jersey and fellow member of the Committee on Homeland Security, Mr. Payne, and obviously my senior for yielding me this time. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of Ranking Member Payne's legislation, H.R. 615, the DHS Interoperable Communications Act. This commonsense, bipartisan legislation builds upon recommendations made by the Office of Inspector General of the Department of Homeland Security by requiring DHS to develop a strategy for achieving interoperable communications among the Department's components. During an emergency, be that a terrorist attack or natural disaster such as Superstorm Sandy that devastated my home State of New Jersey, it is essential that first responders are able to communicate. It is also essential that components of the Department of Homeland Security are able to communicate with one another at all times. H.R. 615, as introduced by my colleague from New Jersey and before us on the floor today, seeks to make that aspiration a reality. Sadly, Mr. Speaker, in the 14 years since the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, we have still not reached the day where interoperable communications is a universal reality among State, local, and Federal agencies. Ranking Member Payne's bill puts us on a path to fixing that reality as it relates to the Department of Homeland Security. Importantly, the bill clarifies and enhances the Department's Under Secretary for Management's responsibility for achieving and maintaining interoperable communications among the components of DHS. By doing so, the bill focuses this important mission and will aid Congress in conducting the oversight necessary to see that the policy goals of the bill are achieved. As ranking member of the Subcommittee on Oversight and Management Efficiency, I look forward to conducting robust oversight of DHS' operations in many areas, including interoperable communications. Mr. Speaker, I applaud the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Payne) for his work on this legislation and urge all of my colleagues to support H.R. 615, the DHS Interoperable Communications Act. Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I have no more speakers. If the gentleman from New Jersey has no further speakers, I am prepared to close once the gentleman does. Mr. PAYNE. Mr. Speaker, I have no more speakers, and I am prepared to close. Mr. Speaker, TSA must be able to talk to FEMA and the Coast Guard during an emergency, be it a terrorist incident or natural disaster. For that reason, the achievement of cross-component interoperable communications is essential to DHS' being able to carry out its mission. H.R. 615 takes a responsible approach to addressing the oversight findings of the inspector general and the Committee on Homeland Security about a serious operational gap at the Department of Homeland Security: interoperability. Moreover, an earlier version of this bipartisan measure passed the House unanimously last Congress. For these reasons, I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 615. With that, Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, it is vital that the various component agencies at the Department of Homeland Security be able to communicate on a daily basis and particularly in times of crisis. This bill will help to ensure these capabilities are implemented and maintained. I urge all Members to join me in supporting this legislation, and I yield back the balance of my time. Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 615, the Homeland Security Interoperable Communications Act for three reasons. The bill would address interoperability among information technology systems and radio communications systems to exchange voice, data, and video in real time. First, the bill will save lives of first responders and those they seek to help. Second, the legislation is necessary to create a seamless level of communication among Department of Homeland Security components that are first responders to a terrorist attack, natural [[Page H680]] or manmade disaster; and finally to meet the technological challenges of bridging the communication divide between different communications systems used by first responders within the Department of Homeland Security. As a senior member of the House Committee on Homeland Security, I am well aware, as are many of my colleagues, of the essential and lifesaving role of communications during a crisis. Because the tragedy of September 11, 2001, was compounded by communication failures among the brave first responders who entered the burning towers that comprised the World Trade Center it has been an imperative of the Homeland Security Committee to address first responder communication interoperability challenges. The number of first responders lost on that single day was the greatest loss of first responders at any single event in U.S. History: 343 New York City Fire Department firefighters; 23 New York City Police Department officers; 37 Port Authority Police Department officers; 15 EMTs; and 3 court officers were casualties of the attacks. The need for this bill authored by Congressman Payne is evident. The City of Houston covers over a 1000 square mile region in Southeast Texas. It has a night-time population of nearly two million people, which peaks with over three million daytime inhabitants. The city of Houston's 9-1-1 Emergency Center manages nearly 9,000 emergency calls per day. The volume of emergency calls can easily double during times of inclement weather or special City social/ sporting events like Hurricanes Ike in September 2008; and Katrina as well as Rita, which occurred in September and October of 2005). Annually, one out of every ten citizens uses EMS. There are over 200,000 EMS incidents involving over 225,000 patients or potential patients annually. On the average, EMS responds to a citizen every 3 minutes. Each EMS response is made by one of 88 City of Houston EMS vehicles. In 2013, the City of Houston's fire Department lost Captain EMT Matthew Renaud, Engineer Operator EMT Robert Bebee, Firefighter EMT Robert Garner and Probationary Firefighter Anne Sullivan when they responded to a hotel fire. Throughout the history of the Houston Police Department over 110 officers have lost their lives in the line of duty. Each member of the House of Representatives knows of the loss of a first responder who was going to the aid of those in harm's way. This bill will offer additional resources to the first responders of the Department of Homeland Security. The bill amends the Homeland Security Act of 2002 to include among the responsibilities of the Under Secretary for Management responsibilities with respect to policies and directives to achieve and maintain interoperable communications among the components of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). The Under Secretary of Homeland Security would submit to the House and Senate Homeland Security Committees a strategy, which shall be updated as necessary, for achieving and maintaining interoperable communications, including for daily operations, planned events, and emergencies, with corresponding milestones, that includes: an assessment of interoperability gaps in radio communications DHS components, as of this Act's enactment date; information on DHS efforts and activities, including current and planned policies, directives, and training, since November 1, 2012, to achieve and maintain interoperable communications, and planned efforts and activities to achieve and maintain interoperable communications; an assessment of obstacles and challenges to achieving and maintaining interoperable communications; information on, and an assessment of, the adequacy of mechanisms available to the Under Secretary to enforce and compel compliance with interoperable communications policies and directives of DHS; guidance provided to DHS components to implement interoperable communications policies and directives; the total amount of funds expended by DHS since November 1, 2012, and projected future expenditures, to achieve interoperable communications; and dates upon which DHS-wide interoperability is projected to be achieved for voice, data, and video communications, respectively, and interim milestones. The bill ensures that the Department of Homeland Security would conduct a survey of intra-agency efforts or task forces that have been delegated responsibilities for achieving and maintaining interoperable communications, and report on the status of these efforts, including: progress on each interim milestone; information on any policies, directives, guidance, and training established by the Under Secretary of Homeland Security; an assessment of the level of compliance, adoption, and participation among the DHS components with the policies, directives, guidance, and training established by the Under Secretary; and information on any additional resources or authorities needed by the Under Secretary. This bill will ensure that the Department of Homeland Security's first responders are prepared to meet the challenges of manmade or natural disasters. I ask my colleagues to join me in voting in favor of H.R. 615. Mr. McCAUL. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 615, the Department of Homeland Security Interoperable Communications Act that was introduced by the Congressman Payne. I am proud to join Ranking Member Thompson and Congresswoman Brooks in cosponsoring this legislation that will begin to solve a problem that continues to plague the Department of Homeland Security. This measure was written to address a November 2012 DHS Office of Inspector General report, which found that DHS lacks an effective governance structure to ensure interoperable communications among its components. This is unacceptable, and an issue that should be fixed, especially after the Department has been in existence for well over a decade. Component agencies of the Department of Homeland Security must be able to communicate on a daily basis, and particularly in times of crisis. One of the benefits of have a Department of Homeland Security should be that components, including FEMA, ICE, and CBP, are able to act as one department and communicate at will. This bill requires the Department's Under Secretary of Management to submit a strategy to the Committee on Homeland Security on achieving and maintaining interoperability within the Department. This measure passed the 113th Congress on a bipartisan vote and I urge all Members to join me in supporting this important legislation. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Carter) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 615. The question was taken. The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the opinion of the Chair, two-thirds being in the affirmative, the ayes have it. Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays. The yeas and nays were ordered. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further proceedings on this motion will be postponed. ____________________",package_114_256.csv,26597,26597,26666,"[congressional record volume 161, number 17 (monday, february 2, 2015)] [house] [pages h677-h680] from the congressional record online through the government publishing office [ www.gpo.gov ] department of homeland security interoperable communications act mr. carter of georgia. mr. speaker, i move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (h.r. 615) to amend the homeland security act of 2002 to require the under secretary for management of the department of homeland security to take administrative action to achieve and maintain interoperable communications capabilities among the components of the department of homeland security, and for other purposes. the clerk read the title of the bill. the text of the bill is as follows: h.r. 615 be it enacted by the senate and house of representatives of the united states of america in congress assembled, section 1. short title. this act may be cited as the ``department of homeland security interoperable communications act'' or the ``dhs interoperable communications act''. sec. 2. inclusion of interoperable communications capabilities in responsibilities of under secretary for management. section 701 of the homeland security act of 2002 (6 u.s.c. 341) is amended-- (1) in paragraph (4) of subsection (a), by inserting before the period at the end the following: ``, including policies and directives to achieve and maintain interoperable communications among the components of the department''; and (2) by adding at the end the following new subsection: ``(d) interoperable communications defined.--in this section, the term `interoperable communications' means the ability of components of the department to communicate with each other as necessary, utilizing information technology systems and radio communications systems to exchange voice, data, and video in real time, as necessary, for acts of terrorism, daily operations, planned events, and emergencies.''. sec. 3. strategy.

new jersey (mr. payne) each will control 20 minutes. the chair recognizes the gentleman from georgia. general leave mr. carter of georgia. mr. speaker, i ask unanimous consent that all members have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks and include any extraneous material on the bill under consideration. the speaker pro tempore. is there objection to the request of the gentleman from georgia? there was no objection. mr. carter of georgia. mr. speaker, i yield myself such time as i may consume. mr. speaker, i rise today in support of h.r. 615, the department of homeland security interoperable communications act, introduced by the gentleman from new jersey (mr. payne), the ranking member of the committee on homeland security's subcommittee on emergency preparedness, response, and communications. this bill amends the homeland security act of 2002 to include, among the responsibilities of the department of homeland security's under secretary for management, achieving and maintaining interoperable communications among the department's components. h.r. 615 addresses the findings and recommendations of a november 2012 dhs office of inspector general report, which stated that the department does not have the appropriate oversight or governance structure to ensure communications interoperability among its components. the department has been in the forefront on working with stakeholders to provide our nation's first responders with the resources and tools needed to have effective interoperable communications. now the department needs to practice what they preach. it is vital that the department's components are able to effectively communicate day to day and, most importantly, during emergencies. mr. speaker, i recently visited our southwest border and met with men and women from the border patrol, customs and border protection, and the coast guard who are on the front lines of our efforts to secure the border. it is vital that they have the ability to communicate with one another and personnel from other dhs components as they work to achieve their vital missions. in order to ensure the department is taking the necessary steps to achieve and maintain interoperable communications capabilities, h.r. 615 requires the department's under secretary for management to submit an interoperable communications strategy to the committee on homeland security no later than 120 days after enactment. i urge all members to join me in supporting this bill, and i reserve the balance of my time. mr. payne. mr. speaker, i yield myself as much time as i may consume. mr. speaker, i rise in strong support of h.r. 615, the department of homeland security interoperable communications act. my goal today is to put the department of homeland security on the path to achieving agencywide interoperable communications. almost 15 years ago, courageous first responders raced to lower manhattan, to an area that came to be known as ground zero. in the days that followed, first responders from neighboring jurisdictions, including jersey city, responded to help with response and recovery efforts. not long after these devastating attacks, concerns were raised about the interoperability gaps that existed between responders on that deadly september day. the 9/11 commission identified improving interoperable communications at all levels of government as a pressing recommendation. they emphasized that both technology and governance are critical components of interoperable solutions and recognized dhs as the federal agency responsible for spearheading such an effort. though nationwide over $13 billion has been invested in achieving interoperable communications at the state and local level, we are still not there. at dhs, over $430 million has been invested into communication capabilities for its 123,000 radio users since 2003. however, in 2012, the department's own top watchdog, the office of inspector general, found that dhs ``personnel do not have reliable interoperable communications for daily operations, planned events, and emergencies.'' in may of 2014, the inspector general testified before the homeland security subcommittee that, out of 479 field radios that attempted to communicate on a specific channel, only one user could do so. that is a 99.8 percent failure rate. too often, communication failures are attributed to technology or a lack of resources. but here, technology is not the culprit; it is the scapegoat. indeed, the inspector general found that dhs had not established protocols to ensure that practices are in place to achieve interoperability throughout the department. h.r. 615, the dhs interoperable communications act, which i introduced with the gentlewoman from indiana, congresswoman susan brooks, the former chair of the emergency preparedness subcommittee, would direct the under secretary for management to issue policies and directives related to interoperability, develop a strategy to achieve dhs-wide interoperability, and report to congress biannually on the department's progress. interoperable communications are essential to emergency response and homeland security operations. the men and women in uniform that serve and protect the 10th congressional district of new jersey never miss an opportunity to remind me of something we already know: interoperable communications save lives during disasters. interoperable communications challenges must be addressed in a timely and thoughtful manner. last congress, [[page h679]] this chamber unanimously approved legislation identical to the measure before you today. enactment of h.r. 615 into law would put dhs on the path to achieving interoperability. i would like to thank the former subcommittee chairwoman, susan brooks, for her dedicated efforts to work with me on this measure. i will miss working with her on this panel. i would also like to thank ranking member thompson, chairman mccaul, and the new chairwoman of the subcommittee, ms. mcsally, for their continued support in addressing this important issue. i urge my colleagues to support improving interoperable communications at dhs by voting. mr. speaker, i reserve the balance of my time. mr. carter of georgia. mr. speaker, i yield such time as she may consume to the distinguished gentlelady from indiana (mrs. brooks), the former chairman of the subcommittee on emergency preparedness, response, and communications. mrs. brooks of indiana. mr. speaker, i rise today in support of h.r. 615, the department of homeland security interoperable communications act. i did have the opportunity to work on this bill with the fine gentleman from new jersey (mr. payne), the ranking member of the

particularly in times of crisis. one of the benefits of have a department of homeland security should be that components, including fema, ice, and cbp, are able to act as one department and communicate at will. this bill requires the department's under secretary of management to submit a strategy to the committee on homeland security on achieving and maintaining interoperability within the department. this measure passed the 113th congress on a bipartisan vote and i urge all members to join me in supporting this important legislation. the speaker pro tempore. the question is on the

Social media working group.''. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentlewoman from Indiana (Mrs. Brooks) and the gentlewoman from the District of Columbia (Ms. Norton) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Indiana. General Leave Mrs. BROOKS of Indiana. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous materials on H.R. 623. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentlewoman from Indiana? There was no objection. Mrs. BROOKS of Indiana. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 623, the Social Media Working Group Act of 2015. Social media is transforming the way the Nation is communicating before, during, and after terrorist attacks, natural disasters, and other emergencies. There are countless examples from recent events of how citizens are turning to Facebook, Twitter, and even Instagram for public safety information, to comfort survivors, and to request assistance. For example, during the height of the most recent winter storm Juno in the Northeast, there were over 20,000 posts using the hashtag #blizzardof2015. A quarter of Americans--let me repeat that--a quarter of Americans got information about the devastating terrorist attack at the 2013 Boston Marathon from Facebook and Twitter. Immediately following that attack and during the manhunt, the Boston Police Department utilized social media as a way to communicate with and solicit information from citizens and visitors. In fact, the first official announcement that Boston Marathon bomber Dzhokhar Tsarnaev had been captured was not through a traditional press conference, but it was through the Boston Police Department's Twitter account. That post was retweeted more than 135,000 times. These examples prove that social media has become one of the primary ways we share information. In the 113th Congress, I served as the chair of the Committee on Homeland Security's Subcommittee on Emergency Preparedness, Response, and Communications with the gentleman from New Jersey as my ranking member. Our subcommittee held two hearings that focused on this new phenomenon, and we learned that while the Nation is making great strides in this area, gaps and challenges remain. One of the key takeaways from these hearings was that during and after a terrorist attack, natural disaster, or other emergency, there is still a need for better communication between the public sector and the private sector, specifically with how we utilize social media as a communication tool. Last year, I introduced this bill, along with Ranking Member Payne, Chairman McCaul, Representative Palazzo, and Representative Swalwell, to address this issue; and I am pleased now to reintroduce the bill this Congress. Mr. Speaker, H.R. 623 addresses the issues we heard in our hearings by authorizing and enhancing the Department of Homeland Security's Virtual Social Media Working Group to ensure information sharing between the Department and appropriate stakeholders and the leveraging of best practices. Currently, the Virtual Social Media Working Group, which is made up mostly of State and local officials, is doing great work in developing guidance documents on how to utilize social media during disasters. In fact, it produced a lessons learned paper on social media usage during Hurricane Sandy. This bill will increase the working group's stakeholder participation, particularly among the private sector and Federal response agencies, thereby creating a Whole Community dialogue on this issue. The bill will require this group to submit an annual report to Congress highlighting best practices, lessons learned, and any recommendations. Finally, this bill will require the group to meet in person or virtually at least twice a year, and it will not be a financial burden on the Department. In today's day and age, when new social media platforms and technologies can change the game almost instantly, we must ensure our critical first responders are nimble enough to adapt to an ever- changing landscape. This group is one way to help facilitate this. [[Page H682]] The House passed this bill last Congress with strong bipartisan support. I now want to thank Chairman Shuster and Chairman Barletta of the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee for working with the Committee on Homeland Security and me to get this bill to the floor today. Mr. Speaker, I urge Members to join me in supporting this bill, and I reserve the balance of my time. Ms. NORTON. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I congratulate and commend Mrs. Brooks of Indiana and Mr. Payne of New Jersey for sponsoring the Social Media Working Group Act of 2013 which addresses an emerging and important topic in emergency management. More and more, we are seeing social media, especially Twitter, Facebook, and YouTube, playing a critical role in the preparedness, response, and recovery operations in emergency situations. In the past few years, social media has become a valuable tool that has been used by emergency managers at all levels to warn those in harm's way of impending natural disasters. I might add that the same could occur in terrorist disasters. Moreover, it has been used to inform survivors of how to access disaster assistance and tips for speedier recovery. Equally important, social media has been used to coordinate and manage assistance from nonprofits and volunteers who want to help in recovery efforts. It is not just emergency managers who use social media regarding emergencies. Individuals have used social media to help identify locations where assistance may still be needed and to raise awareness of impending hazards. They have used it to communicate with loved ones who may be impacted by an event, as well as to reconnect pets with their owners. It was no different here in the District of Columbia, Mr. Speaker, after 9/11, and I refer to the earthquake centered in Mineral, Virginia, but certainly felt in every part of the Nation's Capital. Because cellphone service was jammed, residents turned to social media to communicate. Within minutes of that earthquake, Twitter noted that over 40,000 earthquake-related tweets were sent about the occurrence. {time} 1745 Facebook noted 3 million mentions related to the earthquake. In 2010, the Department of Homeland Security established the Virtual Social Media Working Group to provide recommendations on how to use social media before, during, and after emergencies. The existing working group consists of emergency responders, nonprofit organizations, and Federal agencies. H.R. 623 would codify the working group to make certain that their good work continues. To allow for broader representation, the bill expands the working group membership to include the private sectors and requires consultation with nonmembers. To ensure accountability, the bill requires an annual report to Congress on important issues such as best practices and lessons learned. It would also provide recommendations on various issues, including how to improve the use of social media for emergency management purposes. This is a very timely bill, Mr. Speaker. It will assist in informing the public of critical emergency information which may well save lives and reduce injuries. I strongly urge my colleagues to support this bill. I reserve the balance of my time. Mrs. BROOKS of Indiana. Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers, and I reserve the balance of my time. Ms. NORTON. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, as I was coming to the floor, I tweeted and Facebooked that I would be on the floor managing this bill. We are used to Tweeting and Facebooking our every movement, usually for fun--and yes, even to come on the floor. I will be very interested to know whether, after we had the tragic accident last month in our Metro system when we lost one life--and we know for sure communication between the District of Columbia fire, emergency, and Metro was informed--I will be very interested to know whether Facebook, Twitter, and other forms of social media were helpful. I cannot believe they were not. We all think of social media for social fun. What is important about the bill that my two colleagues, Representative Brooks and Representative Payne, have brought to us is, of course, that it shows a very essential use. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Payne), a cosponsor of the bill. Mr. PAYNE. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the gentlewoman from the District of Columbia (Ms. Norton) for yielding me this time. Last Congress, the Subcommittee on Emergency Preparedness, Response, and Communications held a series of hearings examining how the Internet can positively impact disaster response at all levels. Over the course of these hearings, industry stakeholders, who included Google.org, Palantir, and the Internet Association, provided testimony about how the Internet helped galvanize citizens affected by disasters--from the Boston Marathon bombings to Hurricane Sandy. We also heard from an energy services company headquartered in my district, PSE&G, that was recognized by J.D. Power and Associates for its innovative use of social media in the days leading up to and following Hurricane Sandy. PSE&G used social media to communicate with its customers about how to prepare for the storm and to mitigate damage and about power restoration efforts afterward. Additionally, PSE&G testified about lessons learned about using social media during disaster response--ranging from using the right tone in messages to preparing social media companies to handle the increased volume of messages. In those hearings, we also took testimony from Federal, State, and local governments about how to use social media more effectively to provide disaster-related information to be better integrated into disaster response applications. We also heard from FEMA and local officials on efforts to improve the use of social media following a terrorist attack or natural disaster. I was pleased to work with then-Subcommittee Chairwoman Susan Brooks on this oversight effort and ultimately on the bill to ensure that the important conversation about how to best use social media following a disaster can continue. Last July, I was pleased to manage an identical version of this bill on the House floor on behalf of the Committee on Homeland Security. That measure, H.R. 4263, passed the House on suspension, as I hope will occur with H.R. 623. This Congress, I am pleased that my committee was able to work with the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure to ensure that H.R. 623 gets considered early this Congress. That said, I am disappointed that this time around, under the rules of the House, the committee that developed the legislation, in response to extensive oversight findings, was not given the opportunity to present it in the full House on its own. That said, I congratulate Subcommittee Chairwoman Brooks on the success of her efforts to ensure that Federal, State, and local governments continue to work with the private sector and nonprofit disaster response providers to develop innovative uses of social media. I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 623. Mrs. BROOKS of Indiana. Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank the gentlelady from the District of Columbia and the gentleman from New Jersey for continuing this important work that we began last year. It was a visit to the American Red Cross shortly after Hurricane Sandy where we learned about the important role that social media had played and the growing role that it played and the fact that they have digital volunteers now who continue to work on behalf of saving lives. I just want to thank all of those who have been supportive of this bill, and I urge my colleagues to join me in once again supporting this important legislation. I reserve the balance of my time. Ms. NORTON. Mr. Speaker, I congratulate the sponsor and cosponsor [[Page H683]] once again on this vital and valuable bill. As we see the kinds of, really, unheard of events we are experiencing, it seems to us often that phones and cell phones are so 20th century. Twitter and Facebook are the functional equivalent for many Americans of 911. So today on this floor, I think we are resolved that social media are, to be sure, often about fun and games, but they may also be about life and death. I am pleased to support this bill and ask Members for its support here in the House. I yield back the balance of my time. Mrs. BROOKS of Indiana. Mr. Speaker, in closing, I again thank the gentlewoman from the District of Columbia and the gentleman from New Jersey in supporting this important legislation. I yield back the balance of my time. Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, as a senior member of the Homeland Security Committee, I rise in support of H.R. 423, ``The Social Media Working Group Act of 2014,'' which would establish within the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) a social media working group. The Social Media Working Group would provide guidance and best practices to the emergency preparedness and response community on the use of social media technologies before, during, and after a terrorist attack. Today, people are relying more on Internet enabled communications to engage and be engaged in personal, professional and commercial communications. Since September 11, 2001, our nation has committed resources toward the preparation of our first responders and citizens in preventing, mitigating and responding to terrorist events. As these efforts continue, we must keep pace with the rapid changing nature of the Internet. Part of this requires that Congress ensure that the Department of Homeland Security and especially the Federal Emergency Management Agency can reach citizens in new ways so that critical information is received in a timely manner. In 2012, smartphones, most particularly phones running Apple Computer's iOS and the open source Android operating system, accounted for at least 40 percent of the mobile devices used in the United States. In the first quarter of 2012, mobile phone consumers spent over $109 billion, while consumers of landline-telephone service spent $64.4 billion. The Federal Communication Commission reports that this trend is expected accelerate as United States consumers participate in a worldwide trend towards mobile communication devices and away from traditional means of receiving and sending information. Electronic tablet computers and e-readers, the other fully enabled portable Internet devices, smartphones are increasingly a resource for people to access information, share content, and communicate their views. Social media is quickly emerging as a major source of information that citizens rely upon to receive news and engage government. The number of people using social networking sites has nearly doubled since 2008. In a 2011, a Pew Internet Center Research Project reported that 79 percent of American adults said they used the Internet and 59 percent of all Internet users say they use at least one of social networking service, such as Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn or Instagram. The reasons for supporting this bill are obvious and I ask my colleagues in the House to vote for its passage. Mr. McCAUL. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 623, the Social Media Working Group Act of 2015, which was introduced by Congresswoman Brooks, Congressman Payne, and myself. Social media is becoming an important tool before, during and after disasters. This becomes more and more obvious after every incident and was especially prevalent both after Hurricane Sandy and the Boston bombings. Almost two years ago, when two pressure cooker bombs exploded at the finish line of the Boston Marathon, local emergency managers and law enforcement turned to social media to alert the public, solicit assistance, and offer comfort to the city. Incidents like these point to the fact that authorities must embrace the use of social media as a way to both collect and disseminate information in the management of a disaster. Last year, I visited the headquarters of the American Red Cross with the author of this legislation, Congresswoman Brooks. One of the highlights of our visit was the Red Cross Digital Disaster Operations Center, where, in partnership with Dell, the Red Cross built the first- ever social media operations center for humanitarian relief. I was impressed to see how the Red Cross is communicating with disaster survivors through social media and how social media is changing the way we are able to prepare for and respond to disasters. In the last Congress, the Committee on Homeland Security's Subcommittee on Emergency Preparedness, Response and Communications held two hearings on the impact of social media before, during and after disasters. These hearings informed the writing of this legislation which authorizes and enhances the Department's Virtual Social Media Working Group to ensure best practices and lessons learned are shared with appropriate stakeholders, including the private sector, and ensure our first responders understand the ever changing dynamic of using social media. This measure passed the House floor with almost 400 votes in the 113th Congress, demonstrating its importance and bipartisan support. I urge Members to join me in supporting this bill today. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentlewoman from Indiana (Mrs. Brooks) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 623. The question was taken. The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the opinion of the Chair, two-thirds being in the affirmative, the ayes have it. Mrs. BROOKS of Indiana. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays. The yeas and nays were ordered. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further proceedings on this motion will be postponed. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 17 (Monday, February 2, 2015)] [House] [Pages H680-H683] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] SOCIAL MEDIA WORKING GROUP ACT OF 2015 Mrs. BROOKS of Indiana.

Is there objection to the request of the gentlewoman from Indiana? There was no objection. Mrs. BROOKS of Indiana. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 623, the Social Media Working Group Act of 2015. Social media is transforming the way the Nation is communicating before, during, and after terrorist attacks, natural disasters, and other emergencies. There are countless examples from recent events of how citizens are turning to Facebook, Twitter, and even Instagram for public safety information, to comfort survivors, and to request assistance. For example, during the height of the most recent winter storm Juno in the Northeast, there were over 20,000 posts using the hashtag #blizzardof2015.

In fact, the first official announcement that Boston Marathon bomber Dzhokhar Tsarnaev had been captured was not through a traditional press conference, but it was through the Boston Police Department's Twitter account. That post was retweeted more than 135,000 times. These examples prove that social media has become one of the primary ways we share information.

Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Payne), a cosponsor of the bill. Mr. PAYNE. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the gentlewoman from the District of Columbia (Ms. Norton) for yielding me this time. Last Congress, the Subcommittee on Emergency Preparedness, Response, and Communications held a series of hearings examining how the Internet can positively impact disaster response at all levels. Over the course of these hearings, industry stakeholders, who included Google.org, Palantir, and the Internet Association, provided testimony about how the Internet helped galvanize citizens affected by disasters--from the Boston Marathon bombings to Hurricane Sandy. We also heard from an energy services company headquartered in my district, PSE&G, that was recognized by J.D. Power and Associates for its innovative use of social media in the days leading up to and following Hurricane Sandy. PSE&G used social media to communicate with its customers about how to prepare for the storm and to mitigate damage and about power restoration efforts afterward. Additionally, PSE&G testified about lessons learned about using social media during disaster response--ranging from using the right tone in messages to preparing social media companies to handle the increased volume of messages. In those hearings, we also took testimony from Federal, State, and local governments about how to use social media more effectively to provide disaster-related information to be better integrated into disaster response applications. We also heard from FEMA and local officials on efforts to improve the use of social media following a terrorist attack or natural disaster. I was pleased to work with then-Subcommittee Chairwoman Susan Brooks on this oversight effort and ultimately on the bill to ensure that the important conversation about how to best use social media following a disaster can continue. Last July, I was pleased to manage an identical version of this bill on the House floor on behalf of the Committee on Homeland Security. That measure, H.R. 4263, passed the House on suspension, as I hope will occur with H.R. 623. This Congress, I am pleased that my committee was able to work with the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure to ensure that H.R. 623 gets considered early this Congress.

It was a visit to the American Red Cross shortly after Hurricane Sandy where we learned about the important role that social media had played and the growing role that it played and the fact that they have digital volunteers now who continue to work on behalf of saving lives. I just want to thank all of those who have been supportive of this bill, and I urge my colleagues to join me in once again supporting this important legislation. I reserve the balance of my time. Ms. NORTON. Mr. Speaker, I congratulate the sponsor and cosponsor [[Page H683]] once again on this vital and valuable bill. As we see the kinds of, really, unheard of events we are experiencing, it seems to us often that phones and cell phones are so 20th century. Twitter and Facebook are the functional equivalent for many Americans of 911. So today on this floor, I think we are resolved that social media are, to be sure, often about fun and games, but they may also be about life and death. I am pleased to support this bill and ask Members for its support here in the House. I yield back the balance of my time. Mrs. BROOKS of Indiana. Mr. Speaker, in closing, I again thank the gentlewoman from the District of Columbia and the gentleman from New Jersey in supporting this important legislation. I yield back the balance of my time. Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, as a senior member of the Homeland Security Committee, I rise in support of H.R. 423, ``The Social Media Working Group Act of 2014,'' which would establish within the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) a social media working group. The Social Media Working Group would provide guidance and best practices to the emergency preparedness and response community on the use of social media technologies before, during, and after a terrorist attack. Today, people are relying more on Internet enabled communications to engage and be engaged in personal, professional and commercial communications. Since September 11, 2001, our nation has committed resources toward the preparation of our first responders and citizens in preventing, mitigating and responding to terrorist events. As these efforts continue, we must keep pace with the rapid changing nature of the Internet. Part of this requires that Congress ensure that the Department of Homeland Security and especially the Federal Emergency Management Agency can reach citizens in new ways so that critical information is received in a timely manner. In 2012, smartphones, most particularly phones running Apple Computer's iOS and the open source Android operating system, accounted for at least 40 percent of the mobile devices used in the United States. In the first quarter of 2012, mobile phone consumers spent over $109 billion, while consumers of landline-telephone service spent $64.4 billion. The Federal Communication Commission reports that this trend is expected accelerate as United States consumers participate in a worldwide trend towards mobile communication devices and away from traditional means of receiving and sending information. Electronic tablet computers and e-readers, the other fully enabled portable Internet devices, smartphones are increasingly a resource for people to access information, share content, and communicate their views. Social media is quickly emerging as a major source of information that citizens rely upon to receive news and engage government. The number of people using social networking sites has nearly doubled since 2008. In a 2011, a Pew Internet Center Research Project reported that 79 percent of American adults said they used the Internet and 59 percent of all Internet users say they use at least one of social networking service, such as Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn or Instagram. The reasons for supporting this bill are obvious and I ask my colleagues in the House to vote for its passage. Mr. McCAUL.

Social media is becoming an important tool before, during and after disasters. This becomes more and more obvious after every incident and was especially prevalent both after Hurricane Sandy and the Boston bombings. Almost two years ago, when two pressure cooker bombs exploded at the finish line of the Boston Marathon, local emergency managers and law enforcement turned to social media to alert the public, solicit assistance, and offer comfort to the city. Incidents like these point to the fact that authorities must embrace the use of social media as a way to both collect and disseminate information in the management of a disaster. Last year, I visited the headquarters of the American Red Cross with the author of this legislation, Congresswoman Brooks. One of the highlights of our visit was the Red Cross Digital Disaster Operations Center, where, in partnership with Dell, the Red Cross built the first- ever social media operations center for humanitarian relief. I was impressed to see how the Red Cross is communicating with disaster survivors through social media and how social media is changing the way we are able to prepare for and respond to disasters. In the last Congress, the Committee on Homeland Security's Subcommittee on Emergency Preparedness, Response and Communications held two hearings on the impact of social media before, during and after disasters. These hearings informed the writing of this legislation which authorizes and enhances the Department's Virtual Social Media Working Group to ensure best practices and lessons learned are shared with appropriate stakeholders, including the private sector, and ensure our first responders understand the ever changing dynamic of using social media. This measure passed the House floor with almost 400 votes in the 113th Congress, demonstrating its importance and bipartisan support. I urge Members to join me in supporting this bill today. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentlewoman from Indiana (Mrs. Brooks) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 623. The question was taken. The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the opinion of the Chair, two-thirds being in the affirmative, the ayes have it. Mrs. BROOKS of Indiana. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays. The yeas and nays were ordered. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further proceedings on this motion will be postponed. ____________________","Congressional Record, Volume 161 Issue 17 (Monday, February 2, 2015) [Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 17 (Monday, February 2, 2015)] [House] [Pages H680-H683] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] SOCIAL MEDIA WORKING GROUP ACT OF 2015 Mrs. BROOKS of Indiana.

Pursuant to the rule, the gentlewoman from Indiana (Mrs. Brooks) and the gentlewoman from the District of Columbia (Ms. Norton) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Indiana. General Leave Mrs. BROOKS of Indiana. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous materials on H.R. 623. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentlewoman from Indiana? There was no objection. Mrs. BROOKS of Indiana. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 623, the Social Media Working Group Act of 2015. Social media is transforming the way the Nation is communicating before, during, and after terrorist attacks, natural disasters, and other emergencies. There are countless examples from recent events of how citizens are turning to Facebook, Twitter, and even Instagram for public safety information, to comfort survivors, and to request assistance. For example, during the height of the most recent winter storm Juno in the Northeast, there were over 20,000 posts using the hashtag #blizzardof2015. A quarter of Americans--let me repeat that--a quarter of Americans got information about the devastating terrorist attack at the 2013 Boston Marathon from Facebook and Twitter. Immediately following that attack and during the manhunt, the Boston Police Department utilized social media as a way to communicate with and solicit information from citizens and visitors. In fact, the first official announcement that Boston Marathon bomber Dzhokhar Tsarnaev had been captured was not through a traditional press conference, but it was through the Boston Police Department's Twitter account. That post was retweeted more than 135,000 times. These examples prove that social media has become one of the primary ways we share information. In the 113th Congress, I served as the chair of the Committee on Homeland Security's Subcommittee on Emergency Preparedness, Response, and Communications with the gentleman from New Jersey as my ranking member. Our subcommittee held two hearings that focused on this new phenomenon, and we learned that while the Nation is making great strides in this area, gaps and challenges remain. One of the key takeaways from these hearings was that during and after a terrorist attack, natural disaster, or other emergency, there is still a need for better communication between the public sector and the private sector, specifically with how we utilize social media as a communication tool. Last year, I introduced this bill, along with Ranking Member Payne, Chairman McCaul, Representative Palazzo, and Representative Swalwell, to address this issue; and I am pleased now to reintroduce the bill this Congress. Mr. Speaker, H.R. 623 addresses the issues we heard in our hearings by authorizing and enhancing the Department of Homeland Security's Virtual Social Media Working Group to ensure information sharing between the Department and appropriate stakeholders and the leveraging of best practices. Currently, the Virtual Social Media Working Group, which is made up mostly of State and local officials, is doing great work in developing guidance documents on how to utilize social media during disasters. In fact, it produced a lessons learned paper on social media usage during Hurricane Sandy. This bill will increase the working group's stakeholder participation, particularly among the private sector and Federal response agencies, thereby creating a Whole Community dialogue on this issue. The bill will require this group to submit an annual report to Congress highlighting best practices, lessons learned, and any recommendations. Finally, this bill will require the group to meet in person or virtually at least twice a year, and it will not be a financial burden on the Department. In today's day and age, when new social media platforms and technologies can change the game almost instantly, we must ensure our critical first responders are nimble enough to adapt to an ever- changing landscape. This group is one way to help facilitate this. [[Page H682]] The House passed this bill last Congress with strong bipartisan support. I now want to thank Chairman Shuster and Chairman Barletta of the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee for working with the Committee on Homeland Security and me to get this bill to the floor today. Mr. Speaker, I urge Members to join me in supporting this bill, and I reserve the balance of my time. Ms. NORTON. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I congratulate and commend Mrs. Brooks of Indiana and Mr. Payne of New Jersey for sponsoring the Social Media Working Group Act of 2013 which addresses an emerging and important topic in emergency management. More and more, we are seeing social media, especially Twitter, Facebook, and YouTube, playing a critical role in the preparedness, response, and recovery operations in emergency situations. In the past few years, social media has become a valuable tool that has been used by emergency managers at all levels to warn those in harm's way of impending natural disasters. I might add that the same could occur in terrorist disasters. Moreover, it has been used to inform survivors of how to access disaster assistance and tips for speedier recovery. Equally important, social media has been used to coordinate and manage assistance from nonprofits and volunteers who want to help in recovery efforts. It is not just emergency managers who use social media regarding emergencies. Individuals have used social media to help identify locations where assistance may still be needed and to raise awareness of impending hazards. They have used it to communicate with loved ones who may be impacted by an event, as well as to reconnect pets with their owners. It was no different here in the District of Columbia, Mr. Speaker, after 9/11, and I refer to the earthquake centered in Mineral, Virginia, but certainly felt in every part of the Nation's Capital. Because cellphone service was jammed, residents turned to social media to communicate. Within minutes of that earthquake, Twitter noted that over 40,000 earthquake-related tweets were sent about the occurrence. {time} 1745 Facebook noted 3 million mentions related to the earthquake. In 2010, the Department of Homeland Security established the Virtual Social Media Working Group to provide recommendations on how to use social media before, during, and after emergencies. The existing working group consists of emergency responders, nonprofit organizations, and Federal agencies. H.R. 623 would codify the working group to make certain that their good work continues. To allow for broader representation, the bill expands the working group membership to include the private sectors and requires consultation with nonmembers. To ensure accountability, the bill requires an annual report to Congress on important issues such as best practices and lessons learned. It would also provide recommendations on various issues, including how to improve the use of social media for emergency management purposes. This is a very timely bill, Mr. Speaker. It will assist in informing the public of critical emergency information which may well save lives and reduce injuries. I strongly urge my colleagues to support this bill. I reserve the balance of my time. Mrs. BROOKS of Indiana. Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers, and I reserve the balance of my time. Ms. NORTON. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, as I was coming to the floor, I tweeted and Facebooked that I would be on the floor managing this bill. We are used to Tweeting and Facebooking our every movement, usually for fun--and yes, even to come on the floor. I will be very interested to know whether, after we had the tragic accident last month in our Metro system when we lost one life--and we know for sure communication between the District of Columbia fire, emergency, and Metro was informed--I will be very interested to know whether Facebook, Twitter, and other forms of social media were helpful. I cannot believe they were not. We all think of social media for social fun. What is important about the bill that my two colleagues, Representative Brooks and Representative Payne, have brought to us is, of course, that it shows a very essential use. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Payne), a cosponsor of the bill. Mr. PAYNE. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the gentlewoman from the District of Columbia (Ms. Norton) for yielding me this time. Last Congress, the Subcommittee on Emergency Preparedness, Response, and Communications held a series of hearings examining how the Internet can positively impact disaster response at all levels. Over the course of these hearings, industry stakeholders, who included Google.org, Palantir, and the Internet Association, provided testimony about how the Internet helped galvanize citizens affected by disasters--from the Boston Marathon bombings to Hurricane Sandy. We also heard from an energy services company headquartered in my district, PSE&G, that was recognized by J.D. Power and Associates for its innovative use of social media in the days leading up to and following Hurricane Sandy. PSE&G used social media to communicate with its customers about how to prepare for the storm and to mitigate damage and about power restoration efforts afterward. Additionally, PSE&G testified about lessons learned about using social media during disaster response--ranging from using the right tone in messages to preparing social media companies to handle the increased volume of messages. In those hearings, we also took testimony from Federal, State, and local governments about how to use social media more effectively to provide disaster-related information to be better integrated into disaster response applications. We also heard from FEMA and local officials on efforts to improve the use of social media following a terrorist attack or natural disaster. I was pleased to work with then-Subcommittee Chairwoman Susan Brooks on this oversight effort and ultimately on the bill to ensure that the important conversation about how to best use social media following a disaster can continue. Last July, I was pleased to manage an identical version of this bill on the House floor on behalf of the Committee on Homeland Security. That measure, H.R. 4263, passed the House on suspension, as I hope will occur with H.R. 623. This Congress, I am pleased that my committee was able to work with the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure to ensure that H.R. 623 gets considered early this Congress. That said, I am disappointed that this time around, under the rules of the House, the committee that developed the legislation, in response to extensive oversight findings, was not given the opportunity to present it in the full House on its own. That said, I congratulate Subcommittee Chairwoman Brooks on the success of her efforts to ensure that Federal, State, and local governments continue to work with the private sector and nonprofit disaster response providers to develop innovative uses of social media. I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 623. Mrs. BROOKS of Indiana. Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank the gentlelady from the District of Columbia and the gentleman from New Jersey for continuing this important work that we began last year. It was a visit to the American Red Cross shortly after Hurricane Sandy where we learned about the important role that social media had played and the growing role that it played and the fact that they have digital volunteers now who continue to work on behalf of saving lives. I just want to thank all of those who have been supportive of this bill, and I urge my colleagues to join me in once again supporting this important legislation. I reserve the balance of my time. Ms. NORTON. Mr. Speaker, I congratulate the sponsor and cosponsor [[Page H683]] once again on this vital and valuable bill. As we see the kinds of, really, unheard of events we are experiencing, it seems to us often that phones and cell phones are so 20th century. Twitter and Facebook are the functional equivalent for many Americans of 911. So today on this floor, I think we are resolved that social media are, to be sure, often about fun and games, but they may also be about life and death. I am pleased to support this bill and ask Members for its support here in the House. I yield back the balance of my time. Mrs. BROOKS of Indiana. Mr. Speaker, in closing, I again thank the gentlewoman from the District of Columbia and the gentleman from New Jersey in supporting this important legislation. I yield back the balance of my time. Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, as a senior member of the Homeland Security Committee, I rise in support of H.R. 423, ``The Social Media Working Group Act of 2014,'' which would establish within the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) a social media working group. The Social Media Working Group would provide guidance and best practices to the emergency preparedness and response community on the use of social media technologies before, during, and after a terrorist attack. Today, people are relying more on Internet enabled communications to engage and be engaged in personal, professional and commercial communications. Since September 11, 2001, our nation has committed resources toward the preparation of our first responders and citizens in preventing, mitigating and responding to terrorist events. As these efforts continue, we must keep pace with the rapid changing nature of the Internet. Part of this requires that Congress ensure that the Department of Homeland Security and especially the Federal Emergency Management Agency can reach citizens in new ways so that critical information is received in a timely manner. In 2012, smartphones, most particularly phones running Apple Computer's iOS and the open source Android operating system, accounted for at least 40 percent of the mobile devices used in the United States. In the first quarter of 2012, mobile phone consumers spent over $109 billion, while consumers of landline-telephone service spent $64.4 billion. The Federal Communication Commission reports that this trend is expected accelerate as United States consumers participate in a worldwide trend towards mobile communication devices and away from traditional means of receiving and sending information. Electronic tablet computers and e-readers, the other fully enabled portable Internet devices, smartphones are increasingly a resource for people to access information, share content, and communicate their views. Social media is quickly emerging as a major source of information that citizens rely upon to receive news and engage government. The number of people using social networking sites has nearly doubled since 2008. In a 2011, a Pew Internet Center Research Project reported that 79 percent of American adults said they used the Internet and 59 percent of all Internet users say they use at least one of social networking service, such as Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn or Instagram. The reasons for supporting this bill are obvious and I ask my colleagues in the House to vote for its passage. Mr. McCAUL. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 623, the Social Media Working Group Act of 2015, which was introduced by Congresswoman Brooks, Congressman Payne, and myself. Social media is becoming an important tool before, during and after disasters. This becomes more and more obvious after every incident and was especially prevalent both after Hurricane Sandy and the Boston bombings. Almost two years ago, when two pressure cooker bombs exploded at the finish line of the Boston Marathon, local emergency managers and law enforcement turned to social media to alert the public, solicit assistance, and offer comfort to the city.

[[page h682]] the house passed this bill last congress with strong bipartisan support. i now want to thank chairman shuster and chairman barletta of the transportation and infrastructure committee for working with the committee on homeland security and me to get this bill to the floor today. mr. speaker, i urge members to join me in supporting this bill, and i reserve the balance of my time. ms. norton. mr. speaker, i yield myself such time as i may consume. mr. speaker, i congratulate and commend mrs. brooks of indiana and mr. payne of new jersey for sponsoring the social media working group act of 2013 which addresses an emerging and important topic in emergency management. more and more, we are seeing social media, especially twitter, facebook, and youtube, playing a critical role in

before, during, and after emergencies. the existing working group consists of emergency responders, nonprofit organizations, and federal agencies. h.r. 623 would codify the working group to make certain that their good work continues. to allow for broader representation, the bill expands the working group membership to include the private sectors and requires consultation with nonmembers. to ensure accountability, the bill requires an annual report to congress on important issues such as best practices and lessons learned. it would also provide recommendations on various issues, including how to improve the use of social media for emergency management purposes. this is a very timely bill, mr. speaker. it will assist in informing the public of critical emergency information which may well save lives and reduce injuries. i strongly urge my colleagues to support this bill. i reserve the balance of my time. mrs. brooks of indiana. mr. speaker, i have no further speakers, and i reserve the balance of my time. ms. norton. mr. speaker, i yield myself such time as i may consume. mr. speaker, as i was coming to the floor, i tweeted and facebooked that i would be on the floor managing this bill. we are used to tweeting and facebooking our every movement, usually for fun--and yes, even to come on the floor. i will be very interested to know whether, after we had the tragic accident last month in our metro system when we lost one life--and we know for sure communication between the district of columbia fire, emergency, and metro was informed--i will be very interested to know whether facebook, twitter, and other forms of social media were helpful. i cannot believe they were not. we all think of social media for social fun. what is important about the bill that my two colleagues, representative brooks and representative payne, have brought to us is, of course, that it shows a very essential use. mr. speaker, i yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from new jersey (mr. payne), a cosponsor of the bill. mr. payne. mr. speaker, i want to thank the gentlewoman from the district of columbia (ms. norton) for yielding me this time. last congress, the subcommittee on emergency preparedness, response, and communications held a series of hearings examining how the internet can positively impact disaster response at all levels. over the course of these hearings, industry stakeholders, who included google.org, palantir, and the internet association, provided testimony about how the internet helped galvanize citizens affected by disasters--from the boston marathon bombings to hurricane sandy. we also heard from an energy services company headquartered in my district, pse&g, that was recognized by j.d. power and associates for its innovative use of social media in the days leading up to and following hurricane sandy. pse&g used social media to communicate with its customers about how to prepare for the storm and to mitigate damage and about power restoration efforts afterward. additionally, pse&g testified about lessons learned about using social media during disaster response--ranging from using the right tone in messages to preparing social media companies to handle the increased volume of messages. in those hearings, we also took testimony from federal, state, and local governments about how to use social media more effectively to provide disaster-related information to be better integrated into disaster response applications. we also heard from fema and local officials on efforts to improve the use of social media following a terrorist attack or natural disaster. i was pleased to work with then-subcommittee chairwoman susan brooks on this oversight effort and ultimately on the bill to ensure that the important conversation about how to best use social media following a disaster can continue. last july, i was pleased to manage an identical version of this bill on the house floor on behalf of the committee on homeland security. that measure, h.r. 4263, passed the house on suspension, as i hope will occur with h.r. 623. this congress, i am pleased that my committee was able to work with the committee on transportation and infrastructure to ensure that h.r. 623 gets considered early this congress. that said, i am disappointed that this time around, under the rules of the house, the committee that developed the legislation, in response to extensive oversight findings, was not given the opportunity to present it in the full house on its own. that said, i congratulate subcommittee chairwoman brooks on the success of her efforts to ensure that federal, state, and local governments continue to work with the private sector and nonprofit disaster response providers to develop innovative uses of social media. i urge my colleagues to support h.r. 623. mrs. brooks of indiana. mr. speaker, i would like to thank the gentlelady from the district of columbia and the gentleman from new jersey for continuing this important work that we began last year. it was a visit to the american red cross shortly after hurricane sandy where we learned about the important role that social media had played and the growing role that it played and the fact that they have digital volunteers now who continue to work on behalf of saving lives. i just want to thank all of those who have been supportive of this bill, and i urge my colleagues to join me in once again supporting this important legislation. i reserve the balance of my time. ms. norton. mr. speaker, i congratulate the sponsor and cosponsor [[page h683]] once again on this vital and valuable bill. as we see the kinds of, really, unheard of events we are experiencing, it seems to us often that phones and cell phones are so 20th century. twitter and facebook are the functional equivalent for many americans of 911. so today on this floor, i think we are resolved that social media are, to be sure, often about fun and games, but they may also be about life and death. i am pleased to support this bill and ask members for its support here in the house. i yield back the balance of my time. mrs. brooks of indiana. mr. speaker, in closing, i again thank the gentlewoman from the district of columbia and the gentleman from new jersey in supporting this important legislation. i yield back the balance of my time. ms. jackson lee. mr. speaker, as a senior member of the homeland security committee, i rise in support of h.r. 423, ``the social media working group act of 2014,'' which would establish within the department of homeland security (dhs) a social media working group. the social media working group would provide guidance and best practices to the emergency preparedness and response community on the use of social media technologies before, during, and after a terrorist attack. today, people are relying more on internet enabled communications to engage and be engaged in personal, professional and commercial communications. since september 11, 2001, our nation has committed resources toward the preparation of our first responders and citizens in preventing, mitigating and responding to terrorist events. as these efforts continue, we must keep pace with the rapid changing nature of the internet. part of this requires that congress ensure that the department of homeland security and especially the federal emergency management agency can reach citizens in new ways so that critical information is received in a timely manner. in 2012, smartphones, most particularly phones running apple computer's ios and the open source android operating system, accounted for at least 40 percent of the mobile devices used in the united states. in the first quarter of 2012, mobile phone consumers spent over $109 billion, while consumers of landline-telephone service spent $64.4 billion. the federal communication commission reports that this trend is expected accelerate as united states consumers participate in a worldwide trend towards mobile communication devices and away from traditional means of receiving and sending information. electronic tablet computers and e-readers, the other fully enabled portable internet devices, smartphones are increasingly a resource for people to access information, share content, and communicate their views. social media is quickly emerging as a major source of information that citizens rely upon to receive news and engage government. the number of people using social networking sites has nearly doubled since 2008. in a 2011, a pew internet center research project reported that 79 percent of american adults said they used the internet and 59 percent of all internet users say they use at least one of social networking service, such as facebook, twitter, linkedin or instagram. the reasons for supporting this bill are obvious and i ask my colleagues in the house to vote for its passage. mr. mccaul. mr. speaker, i rise today in support of h.r. 623, the social media working group act of 2015, which was introduced by congresswoman brooks, congressman payne, and myself. social media is becoming an important tool before, during and after disasters. this becomes more and more obvious after every incident and was especially prevalent both after hurricane sandy and the boston bombings. almost two years ago, when two pressure cooker bombs exploded at the finish line of the boston marathon, local emergency managers and law enforcement turned to social media to alert the public, solicit assistance, and offer comfort to the city. incidents like these point to the fact that authorities must embrace the use of social media as a way to both collect and disseminate information in the management of a disaster. last year, i visited the headquarters of the american red cross with the author of this legislation, congresswoman brooks. one of the highlights of our visit was the red cross digital disaster operations center, where, in partnership with dell, the red cross built the first- ever social media operations center for humanitarian relief. i was impressed to see how the red cross is communicating with disaster survivors through social media and how social media is changing the way we are able to prepare for and respond to disasters. in the last congress, the committee on homeland security's subcommittee on emergency preparedness, response and communications held two hearings on the impact of social media before, during and after disasters. these hearings informed the writing of this legislation which authorizes and enhances the department's virtual social media working group to ensure best practices and lessons learned are shared with appropriate stakeholders, including the private sector, and ensure our first responders understand the ever changing dynamic of using social media. this measure passed the house floor with almost 400 votes in the 113th congress, demonstrating its importance and bipartisan support. i urge members to join me in supporting this bill today. the speaker pro tempore. the question is on the motion offered by the gentlewoman from indiana (mrs. brooks) that the house suspend the rules and pass the bill, h.r. 623. the question was taken. the speaker pro tempore. in the opinion of the chair, two-thirds being in the affirmative,

Ms. JACKSON LEE. Today, Mr. Speaker, I sent a letter to the Food and Drug Administration and the Centers for Disease Control requesting an alert to the public that highlights the importance of our children becoming vaccinated for this outbreak of measles, particularly the MMR. The United States is experiencing a large multistate measles outbreak that started in California in December of 2014 and has spread to six additional States and Mexico. From December 28, Mr. Speaker, through January 21, 2015, 51 confirmed cases linked to this outbreak have been reported to the CDC: 42 from California and nine from six other States--three in Utah, two in Washington, one in Oregon, one in Colorado, one in Nebraska, and one in Arizona. But the spread of this is enormous. The most disturbing aspect of this outbreak is that 86 percent of the patients who have contracted the disease had either been unvaccinated or had an unknown vaccination status. The outbreak is aggravated by the large number of children whose parents have chosen not to get the MMR vaccine. What I want to focus on, Mr. Speaker, is for us to be cautious and for us to be able to do the right thing. The saddest case was an 8- month-old baby in [[Page H687]] Arizona--innocent--who was exposed to the measles. I ask that we take this seriously, as a member of the Homeland Security Committee, and find a way to alert parents to make the right decision for their children.

Under the Speaker's announced policy of January 6, 2015, the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Payne) is recognized for 60 minutes as the designee of the minority leader. General Leave Mr. PAYNE. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members be given 5 days to revise and extend their remarks. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from New Jersey? There was no objection. Mr. PAYNE. Mr. Speaker, I want to begin by welcoming our new members and by thanking the gentlewoman from Ohio, Congresswoman Marcia Fudge, for her leadership of the Congressional Black Caucus during the 113th Congress. Thanks to her dedication and tireless work, this caucus is better positioned to address the diverse challenges of the African American community. I also want to thank the new CBC chair, the Honorable Congressman G.K. Butterfield of North Carolina. I am confident that he will do a great job leading this caucus with steadfast commitment to justice and to building an America that works for everyone. Let me also thank my counterpart, the Honorable Congresswoman Robin Kelly, for joining me in leading the CBC Special Orders this year. I am truly honored to take on this new role, and I look forward to working with her as we help carry out the critical mission of this caucus. Mr. Speaker, 50 years ago, in the midst of the civil rights movement, hundreds of brave men and women gathered in Selma, Alabama, to begin a long, arduous march to Montgomery in support of the fundamental truth: that every American, regardless of what they look like, has the right to vote. {time} 1930 On March 7, 1965, 600 men and women set out from Selma following the death of 26-year-old Jimmie Lee Jackson, a deacon from Marion, Alabama, who died from gunshot wounds inflicted by a State trooper at a nonviolent demonstration. Theirs was a peaceful, nonviolent march, but it was met with fierce brutality. It would take the marchers two more attempts to arrive at Montgomery; but on March 25, after a 12-day journey, they did arrive. Since that day, our country has made significant strides in achieving equality and justice for all, but significant challenges remain unmet. Tonight, we will examine where we have come from, where we are, and where we would like to go as a society. We must be ready to go. In 1965, Selma became the focal point of voter registration efforts in the South. At the time, only 2 percent of the city's eligible African American voters had been able to register. The impact of Selma to the Montgomery march was profound. As Dr. King said, ``Selma produced the voting rights legislation of 1965.'' The Voting Rights Act of 1965 banned discriminatory voting requirements that disenfranchised African American voters throughout this country; yet, today, the dream of full equality is still something many African Americans can only dream of. Where we are, nearly 6 years after the end of the recession, people still struggle to find work, and the gap between the rich and poor continues to grow. For African Americans, this situation is severe, given the disproportionate effect of unemployment on our communities. At the same time, there remains widespread poverty, a defining challenge of our time. This persistent economic inequality threatens to undercut the gains that African American communities have made, and it undermines the idea of economic mobility, the idea that if you work hard in this country and have ambition, you can get ahead. The economic crisis is not only facing African American communities. Where we are in education, education is the most important economic investment we can make now and for future generations; yet, across the country, we still have seen cuts to education at all levels and attacks on critical programs like Head Start and Pell grants. These attacks undermine the ability of African Americans to get ahead--that is why I strongly support President Obama's new, bold initiative for free access to community colleges--so, too, do efforts to dismantle social safety net programs which our communities depend on. Those efforts are irresponsible, unjust, and contrary to who we are as Americans. The Congressional Black Caucus will make criminal justice reform a centerpiece of our agenda. We will work to reduce the epidemic of poverty in this country. We will work to create educational opportunities for African American children, and we will support efforts to strengthen our 105 Historically Black Colleges and Universities. The CBC also remains committed to fighting against efforts to dismantle the social safety net. We are determined to restore section 5 of the Voting Rights Act and to make sure everyone, regardless of what they look like or where they come from, has equal access to the polls, and we resolve to ensure that increasing diversity in this Nation is reflected in American corporations. Together, these policies will bring us closer as a nation where we are empowering the communities of African Americans, and they will benefit from the full equality and live the American Dream. There is no doubt that we are in difficult times in this Nation. Injustices are widespread and threaten some of our most fundamental rights, but we will find no answers in apathy, no comfort in complacency. As we always have, we will continue the march for progress, for freedom, for justice, and for equality for all. Mr. Speaker, it is my honor and privilege now that I yield to the distinguished gentlewoman from Illinois, Ms. Robin Kelly. Ms. KELLY of Illinois. Thank you, my friend from New Jersey. It is an honor to host with you this year. I am excited about the work ahead for the CBC in the 114th Congress. I also want to acknowledge the great job that Congressman Horsford and Congressman Jeffries did in hosting the Special Order hour in the 113th Congress. I also want to honor our past chair, Congresswoman Marcia Fudge, for all of her great work. Discussing 50 years from Selma, where we were, where we are, and where we are headed, I expect this to be very stimulating, frustrating, and rewarding all at the same time. It remains that we have a lot of work to do. Mr. PAYNE. I thank the gentlewoman. Mr. Speaker, at this time, it is my honor and privilege for the first time in the 114th Congress to have the chairman of the Congressional Black Caucus, G.K. Butterfield, address us, and I yield to the gentleman. Mr. BUTTERFIELD. I thank the gentleman for yielding. [[Page H688]] The Congressional Black Caucus is delighted to come to the floor this evening to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the 1965 Voting Rights Act. At the end of slavery, Mr. Speaker, in 1865, which was 150 years ago, the State of North Carolina had a slave population of 331,000 slaves. After the passage of the 13th Amendment and ratification of it by 27 States, these slaves became free. They became American citizens, and males 21 years old or older would soon be entitled to vote. Among those 331,000 slaves gaining freedom, 128,000 of them resided in my congressional district. In some of the counties, the Black population exceeded the White population. In 1870, African American citizens gained the right to vote by the enactment of the 15th Amendment. For the next 30 years, Mr. Speaker, African American men voted in large numbers and became a political force in State politics. Four African Americans were elected to Congress in North Carolina, eight in South Carolina, three in Alabama, and one each in Georgia, Florida, Mississippi, Virginia, and Louisiana. Many more were elected to State and local office. In 1900, after KKK violence and lynchings had not deterred Black political participation, most Southern States passed disfranchisement laws requiring a literacy test and the payment of a poll tax. These laws had the intent and effect of disenfranchising Black people from voting, and it worked. For the next half century, African Americans were effectively denied the right to vote with a few exceptions. Following his 1964 acceptance of the Nobel Peace Prize, Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., approached President Lyndon Johnson about advocating for a strong voting rights law that would enforce the 15th Amendment. President Johnson was uncomfortable in advancing the idea of a voting rights law, which greatly disappointed Dr. King. Dr. King was motivated to launch the Selma voting rights movement. On March 7, 1965, under the leadership of Dr. King, John Lewis, and others, Black residents of Selma attempted to march from Brown Chapel Church to the Alabama State capital to demand a voting rights law. As they approached the Edmund Pettus Bridge, the marchers were brutalized, and they were terrorized by State police and forced to retreat. We now refer to this confrontation as ``Bloody Sunday.'' Two days later, the marchers again began their journey to Montgomery, but as they crossed the bridge and saw the strong police presence, they turned around and returned to the church. At this point, President Johnson was outraged with Governor George Wallace for preventing the march. Johnson telephoned Wallace to demand that the marchers walk to Montgomery without incident. Three weeks later, on March 21, 1965, Dr. King persuaded thousands of Black and White to come to Selma to participate in the march. The march proceeded without incident. Fifty thousand participated. Following the March, a White marcher, Mrs. Viola Liuzzo from Detroit, was murdered while transporting marchers back to Selma. Jimmie Lee Jackson was killed by police during a Selma protest in February 1965. Saddened by these murders, President Johnson reconsidered his unwillingness to promote voting rights legislation. He went on national television on March 15 and announced that he would support a voting rights bill. Despite the Southern filibuster, the Voting Rights Act was enacted into law on August 6, 1965. This important law has changed the political landscape for African American communities. It bans the use of literacy tests. It gives minority communities the right to litigate discriminatory election schemes that dilute their vote. The act provides for a section 5 that requires certain jurisdictions with discriminatory histories to preclear election law changes with the Attorney General. To our great dismay, on June 25, 2013, the U.S. Supreme Court made section 5 unenforceable because the data used to determine covered jurisdictions is outdated, according to the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court has now called on Congress to modify the formula. To this day, Mr. Speaker, our Republican colleagues have refused to allow the bipartisan VRA amendment bill to be voted upon. In fact, the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, Mr. Goodlatte, announced that he has no intention to legislate a modification to the formula, and so the effect of not having section 5 is to allow jurisdictions to pass discriminatory election laws with impunity and without oversight. The Voting Rights Act has enabled African American communities to elect hundreds of Black elected officials. We successfully litigated dozens and dozens of cases. Many of my colleagues were elected because enforcement of the Voting Rights Act forced--forced--States to draw congressional districts where Black communities are not submerged and their vote diluted. Mr. Speaker, this story must be understood by every American citizen. The right to vote for African Americans was obtained by blood, sweat, and tears; and we are determined--the Congressional Black Caucus is determined--to continue this fight into 2016 and beyond. Mr. Payne, thank you very much for yielding time. Mr. PAYNE. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. We are looking forward to your leadership in the 114th Congress, and we will continue to strive to make sure that the issues that the CBC find important are relevant on the day-to-day basis. Now, Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from South Carolina (Mr. Clyburn), the leader, who has probably forgotten more about the goings- on and the rules in this Chamber than I will ever know. Mr. CLYBURN. Thank you so much, Mr. Payne, for yielding me time. I appreciate your accolades, and I promise you that my long, distant memory is getting very good, but I assure you that your contributions to this great body are very much appreciated. Mr. Speaker, yesterday, I opened up Black History Month with a speech at Cornerstone Baptist Church on Wayne Street in Columbia, South Carolina. They had an interesting topic for me to develop. It was all about remembering our past and preparing for the future. Chairman Butterfield has talked a little bit about the past that many of us remember, but 50 years after Selma, we must turn to the question that Martin Luther King, Jr., asked in one of his great books: Where do we go from here, chaos or community? Statistics show that there are nearly 500 counties and thousands of communities in the United States that are classified by the United States Census Bureau as persistent poverty areas. They are so defined because 20 percent of their populations have lived below the poverty level for the past 30 years or more. {time} 1945 They are diverse, including Caucasian communities in States like West Virginia, Kentucky, and Tennessee; Native American communities in States like South Dakota, Alaska, and Oklahoma; Latino communities in States like Arizona, New Mexico, and Texas; and African American communities in States like South Carolina, Alabama, and Mississippi. They are urban communities in States like New York and heartland communities in States like Missouri. 139 of these counties are represented in this body by Democrats; 331 of these counties are represented in this body by Republicans; and 18 of these counties are split between the two parties. Combating persistent poverty should matter to all of us, regardless of party, geography, or race. In early 2009, when we were putting together the Recovery Act, I proposed language to require that at least 10 percent of funds in three rural development accounts be directed to efforts in these persistent- poverty counties. This requirement was enacted into law. In light of the definition of persistent-poverty counties as having at least 20 percent poverty rates over 30 years, the provision became known as the 10-20-30 initiative. This initiative bore dividends as economic development projects proliferated in persistent poverty communities across the country. Using the 10-20-30 formula, the Recovery Act funded a total of 4,655 projects in persistent-poverty counties, totaling nearly $1.7 billion. I saw firsthand the positive effects of these projects in my district. [[Page H689]] We were able to undertake projects to create jobs that would have otherwise languished. Among those investments was a $5.8 million grant and a $2 million loan to construct 51 miles of water lines in the little community of Brittons Neck in Marion County, South Carolina. There are many other success stories. In Lowndes County, Mississippi, $17.5 million was spent to install a water line, elevated tank, and two wastewater pump stations, providing potable water to rural Mississippians and creating badly needed construction jobs. The Wellborn Special Utility District in Brazos County, Texas, received a $538,000 loan to construct more than 9 miles of new water distribution lines and connect over 60 households to a new water system. In 2011, I joined with our former Republican colleague, Representative Jo Ann Emerson of Missouri, to introduce an amendment to the continuing resolution that would have continued 10-20-30 for rural development and expanded it to 11 additional accounts throughout the Federal Government affecting economic development, education, job training, health, justice, the environment, and more. I want to make one thing clear about the 10-20-30 approach. It does not--I repeat, it does not--add one dime to the deficit. It simply targets resources from funds already authorized or appropriated. Over the past 30 years, the national economy has risen and fallen multiple times. During each economic downturn, while we have been rightly focused on getting the economy as a whole back on track, we have not given adequate attention to these communities that are suffering from chronic distress and Depression-era levels of joblessness. As a result, they have suffered even in good economic times. The 10- 20-30 approach would provide a mechanism to address this deprivation in times of want and in times of plenty, in times of Federal investment and in times of fiscal austerity. Last year, I wrote an essay on 10-20-30 which was published in the Harvard Journal on Legislation. I discussed the history of our Nation's efforts to address chronic poverty and more fully laid out the case for broadly implementing 10-20-30 in a bipartisan fashion. Mr. Speaker, as we begin to put our 2016 budget together, I look forward to working with all Members in this body on both sides of the aisle irrespective of what State or county you may represent. I look forward to working together so that we can make a real productive legacy for Selma and we can move forward and answer Dr. King's question ``Chaos or community?'' with a resounding: We are building communities. Mr. PAYNE. Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. Clyburn. As in the past, the Congressional Black Caucus will work to continue to reduce the epidemic of poverty in this country. When over 45 million Americans live below the poverty line, we are failing as a nation. As Congressman Butterfield said earlier this month, the CBC will advocate the Clyburn 10-20-30 plan, which redirects at least 10 percent of an agency's grants in its discretionary budget to communities where at least 20 percent of the population has lived below the poverty line for the past 30 years. These are the issues that we will continue to work on as members of the Congressional Black Caucus. It is now my honor to yield to the gentleman from New York (Mr. Rangel), one of my mentors since before I arrived in Congress, a former friend of my father's and a great colleague. Mr. RANGEL. Mr. Speaker, I wish I had a prepared statement, but I was so moved after listening and being a part of this great congressional group in this great country to be able to celebrate 50 years since the Voting Rights Act. As a kid who grew up on the streets of Lenox Avenue and dropped out of high school, I didn't have the benefit of having anything to attach a dream to that would allow me to believe that one day I could be sitting in the United States House of Representatives. But after returning from the war in Korea and after being the beneficiary of the GI bill, and after graduating from law school, I was able to see and hear atrocities that have been committed on Black folks in this country the likes of which I had not seen except during wartime. And even though my mother's family came from Virginia, in the city of New York even today I don't ever remember meeting any White people from the South. I don't know what that is. Perhaps Congressman Butterfield may be able to do some historical research about why they stayed in the South and didn't come to New York City, where racism had a sugar coating to it. They didn't use dogs and bombs and things of that nature. But I recall so vividly seeing people like Andy Young and especially our dear friend and colleague, John Lewis, be prepared to put their lives on the line for our country, not for themselves. In Korea and in most wars, people fight to stay alive and they don't voluntarily put their life on the line, as John Lewis and others have done. But what happened was, when they had the first Selma march, what we refer to as Bloody Sunday, years before our beloved Congresswoman was born, I saw something that really pained me as an American rather than as a human being. And then they had the second march from Selma to Montgomery and Dr. King pulled that back, and then we had the plea for people from all over the country to come down for the third march. I recalled before, I had bad feet and wasn't thinking about going to Selma to do 54 miles, but the inspiration to see people that had been prepared to put their life on the line for me and others like me could not allow me to return to New York. It is very interesting that I have to admit publicly that when I heard the voice of Lyndon Johnson coming across on radio and television saying, ``We shall overcome,'' I kind of thought, Terri, that those were our words. And if a White person was to say it, I never expected to find that accent of the very people that sounded as though they were part of a conspiracy to keep children of slaves from assimilating into the constitutional beliefs that we had since learned to live by and enjoy and hope for. What an historic moment that was. What a revolutionary period that was, because as we review that and look at the picture ``Selma,'' we wonder where did all of the people that represented this hatred go, the people who stood in the way of people registering voters; the people who took advantage of the idea that just because of their complexion they were superior; the people that belonged to the Ku Klux Klan; the people who used religion as a sword instead of a shield? Did they disappear? What happened to the so-called Dixiecrats? But then I am reminded that as a result of the Voting Rights Act and the Civil Rights Act that they didn't go very far, that they threw down their party label but they stayed in the same places, and many of them are doing the same thing--trying to continue to prevent people of color from enjoying their full constitutional voting rights. Then when I was honored enough to come down here in 1971 with half a dozen Congressional Black Caucus members, nine, who joined with four of us who had decided to form the Congressional Black Caucus, you could not believe, Congressman Payne, how it was never our dream that that small group would go from 13 to 26 to 40 to 46 to 47, and reach the historic impact on our policy and on our Nation, a group that had no intention of doing anything except to introduce, create, and support policies that could make this great country even stronger for all of us. And true, we have a lot of obstacles to overcome, but I don't think any group of people have been as successful as we have in coming from the pits of slavery in such a short period of time as we are now, and to see how much more work we have to do so that one day our children and our grandchildren will say: Why did they have to have a Congressional Black Caucus? Why wasn't it just a Democratic caucus? Why did we need it? {time} 2000 Well, because of the intellect, the commitment of individual members of the Black Caucus, like the rest of the Congress, that come from all walks of life and they got here to make this a better country, a more effective Congress, soon and very soon, we may hear those words: Why were we needed? [[Page H690]] Until we accomplish these lofty goals, thank God that we have had it. I think that the Democrats appreciate the work that we are trying to do, and one day, as so many people who got rid of their sheets, their children and their grandchildren would see that we only were trying to eliminate the pain for all people, regardless of color, to make the red, white, and blue, rather than just whether you are Black or White, become the theme that the fathers of this Constitution should have been striving for. There is no question in my mind that the things we stand for really and what the country is committed to do, and I am so proud of these last couple of years, that there is not a group of people I would rather spend my time with than with my friends and my colleagues in the Congressional Black Caucus. Mr. PAYNE. I thank the gentleman from New York. His kind thoughts and perspective is always, always needed in this House. Now, I have the honor and the privilege of yielding to the gentlewoman from Alabama (Ms. Sewell), who represents the city, the town, that is on everybody's breath over the last couple of months. Ms. SEWELL of Alabama. Mr. Speaker, I applaud the CBC for this Special Order hour, and I commend my colleague from New Jersey (Mr. Payne) and my colleague from Illinois (Ms. Kelly) for choosing such a great topic for tonight's Special Order hour. Selma, Lord, Selma. I have the great pleasure of standing before you not only as a Representative who represents the great city of Selma but as a native of Selma, Alabama, and a lifelong member of the historic Brown Chapel AME Church. I know that the journey I now take, the journey that many others who are here today take, was only made possible because of the courage, fortitude, and determination of those brave men and women on that bridge, Bloody Sunday, March 7, 1965. We who have the privilege and honor of taking this journey must ask ourselves: What will we do to extend the legacy? What will we do to protect the legacy? Selma is the soul of America. It is the place where the struggle for civil rights and voting rights began, the epicenter, if you will, of the voting rights movement. It deserves to be more than just a footnote in the history books. It deserves to take up chapters in the history books, the tactical and strategic voices of Martin Luther King and those brave men and women of SCLC and SNCC that had the fortitude and had the intellect to see this as a strategy, to know that they were speaking not only for themselves and their children, but for future generations. Only a true visionary could defeat such opposition with little more than a dream, and Dr. King held so tightly to his that it forced our country to become a more equal and just nation. Some want to forget the painful past. I know many in my district and many in my city would like to forget our painful past, but we cannot turn the pages as if certain chapters were never written; nor can we celebrate how far we have come without first acknowledging where we have been. Bloody Sunday forced America to confront its own inhumanity. Our painful past has ushered in a new day. As I tell my constituents, out of our painful past came the birth of a movement that changed a nation, and from that movement came a human rights movement that changed a world. If we don't write our own history, others will tell it for us, and they may not be so kind, they may not tell our history the way we would tell our history. My father grew up in Selma, as did I, and the Selma of my childhood was very, very different than the Selma of my father's childhood. There has been progress. My father went to segregated schools in Selma. My father drank from ``colored only'' fountains in Selma. My father's mother never got the chance to vote, though she tried to register several times. The Selma that I grew up in had an integrated public high school, a public high school that was 55 percent African American and 45 percent White. Yes, across town, there was an all-White private school. I want you to know that the Selma I grew up in, in the seventies and eighties, it produced me as its first Black valedictorian of Selma High School. I know that Selma and the journey that we all take now because of Selma was only made possible because of the bravery of others. As I stood to give my speech as a valedictorian in 1982 at Selma High School, I remember standing up and saying: Maybe one day I could join the likes of a Charlie Rangel, of a John Lewis, in the House of Congress. I said it as a pious, overly confident teenager probably, but I said it with every vigor because I believed in my heart that I could be and do anything. Why? Because the people of that community nurtured me, Black and White, my teachers, my Girl Scout troop leaders, my Sunday school teachers. Yes, I had proud parents who were educators, educated at Alabama State University, and because of their education at this wonderful quality institution of higher learning, I had a chance to go to Princeton--but I had more than that. I had an obligation to give back, to make sure that others had an opportunity to walk through those same doors. It wasn't enough to be the first. In fact, I was most proud 5 years after I graduated from Princeton that April Williams from Selma High School got to go to Princeton. I must have done something right. The Voting Rights Act of 1965 would have never been possible had it not been for the intellect, the mind of these wonderful leaders, some known. All of us know about the contributions of our colleague, John Lewis; all of us know about the contributions of the SCLC, Andy Young, and Martin Luther King. Some unknown, like my sixth grade teacher, Mrs. Richie Jean Jackson, she was featured in the movie ``Selma'' because it was her home, the home that she shared with Dr. Jackson, the first Black dentist in Selma, that housed Martin Luther King and Andrew Young and all those leaders every time they came to Selma because they couldn't stay at the all-White hotel. Mrs. Jackson was my sixth grade teacher. Mrs. Jackson did not live to see the movie ``Selma,'' but I am proud that this body is seeking to provide a Congressional Gold Medal to the foot soldiers of the movement, so that the Richie Jacksons, Mrs. Jacksons of the world, who had the bravery to go and be on that bridge Bloody Sunday or Turnaround Tuesday or the ultimate final march from Selma to Montgomery, that they are acknowledged by this Nation for the sacrifices that they made. In closing, I want to remind my colleagues of my guest at the State of the Union, January 20, 2015. My special guest was the 103-year-old Amelia Boynton. Amelia Boynton was characterized in the movie ``Selma'' as the proud African American woman who told Coretta Scott King: You are prepared. You are the descendants of kings and queens. Your heritage is one and your bloodline is one that survived slave ships. You are prepared. Amelia Boynton is known for her bravery that Bloody Sunday when she was bludgeoned, but she came back 2 days later on Turnaround Tuesday and continued to fight in Selma long after this march from Selma to Montgomery. She honored us with her presence, and as person after person came up to her and kissed her on the cheek and said, ``Miss Boynton, I stand on your shoulders today, thank you,'' Miss Boynton said something very poignant. She said, ``Everybody keeps talking about being on my shoulders. I tell them, Get off my shoulders, do your own work, there is plenty of work to be done.'' I want to remind my colleagues that there is plenty of work for us still to do. I want to honor the legacy of Amelia Boynton, F.D. Reese, John Lewis, and so many; but we cannot honor their legacy without acknowledging that the Voting Rights Act of 1965, major sections of it, have been invalidated. We owe it to that legacy, the legacy and memory of those who fought so valiantly, that this body should once again work together to make sure that Federal protections are there because, as we know, progress is always elusive, all battles become new again, and there is a renewed assault on voting. [[Page H691]] It may not be counting how many jelly beans are in a jar or how many county judges there are in the State of Alabama; but, nevertheless, we still have modern-day barriers to voting that we must overcome. I hope that we have the courage of our own convictions to see the movie ``Selma'' as a beginning of a national conversation about how we can continue to recommit ourselves to the ideals that were fought on that Bloody Sunday. I know that if we combined our hearts and our minds, both sides of the aisle will see that it is in everyone's best interest that all Americans have the right to vote. I thank my colleagues of the CBC for having this Special Order hour. I invite all of my colleagues from both sides of the aisle to come to Selma, to experience the living history, and I hope that we will all come away from the 50th commemoration of the march from Selma to Montgomery with a renewed vigor to once again provide Federal protection for all Americans to exercise that sacred right to vote. Mr. PAYNE. Thank you. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee). {time} 2015 Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, this is a very important evening. I thank my colleagues, both Mr. Payne of New Jersey and Ms. Kelly, for, first of all, taking up a very important challenge of being able to lead the members of the Congressional Black Caucus through this period of challenge to America. I am reflective of the number of Members who have had the chance to convey their thoughts, and each one I thank personally: our chairman, Mr. G.K. Butterfield, for his leadership and his internal knowledge from his walk in life of the civil rights journey; Mr. Clyburn for living and understanding the civil rights journey and conveying it in his legislative journey; Mr. Rangel for his service to this Nation as a Korean war vet and then coming home to be a vet of the civil rights effort; then, of course, the holder of the seat who represents Selma for her life story. Today, I rise to ask the question, What is our moral standard? And, following the words of Dr. Martin Luther King, why we can't wait. This is a clarion call to my colleagues--Democrats and Republicans-- that, in fact, this year--of all years--calls for us to act. It calls for us to be able to understand why the Nation cannot wait and who is going to lift up the moral standard. The walk from Selma to Montgomery turned into Bloody Sunday. It was where a young man by the name of John Lewis stood bravely alongside names like Hosea Williams. It was, of course, a place where the world watched, and it became the stair steps on which the Voting Rights Act was passed. Today, we realize that, on the shoulders of that tragic time, violence claimed the life of Jimmie Lee Jackson, beaten by State troopers as he was attempting to protect his mother and others, and that violence claimed the lives of Reverend James Reeb of Boston and of Viola Liuzzo of Detroit at that time as she returned from the Selma march--a time when 25,000 strong or more marched across the Montgomery bridge. We understand that our job is yet not done. In the wake of the decision by the Supreme Court that crippled the Voting Rights Act, we as members of the Judiciary Committee, led by our colleagues Mr. Clyburn and John Conyers, sought to correct that crippling. Today, I stand and ask my chairman and the Speaker of the House to have us put that fix with the new Members, our Republicans and Democrats--the same body of individuals who President Johnson convened--to be able to ensure that that Voting Rights Act of 1965 could be done. It is important to note that we not allow the efforts to go unnoted. Mr. Speaker, the voter ID law in Texas needs to be corrected by passing the Voting Rights Amendment Act. The terrible oppression of individuals in their walks to the polls has to be corrected by this amendment. Of course, we must ensure against the horrors of wealth inequality. The median income of Black households is $33,764--a mere 60 percent of the median income for White households. Then, of course, we must move to criminal justice reform. I am privileged, Mr. Speaker, to serve as the ranking member on the Crime Subcommittee, and I join my colleagues in the commitment to ensure that we, in fact, answer the call of the mothers of so many, such as those of Trayvon Martin, Sean Bell, Eric Garner, Michael Brown, Bobby Tolan, Jordan Baker, and many others, that we have grand jury reform, special prosecutor reform, prison reform--the transitioning of nonviolent offenders to productive lives--law enforcement training and best practices. Yes, the bill that I introduced, the Build TRUST Act, will not give incentives to towns that rely upon racial profiling and on stopping African Americans and other minorities to build their revenue. Mr. Speaker, tonight, I have the opportunity to remind us that our walk is not done in wealth inequality, in criminal justice reform and, as I know that my colleague Mr. Green will mention, in the body cameras. All of these--closing the wealth gap and passing the Voting Rights Act--are challenges not to Democrats, not to minorities; they are to the Nation, to our Republicans and our Democrats. So I answer the question why we cannot wait: because Dr. King left us a prophetic message and a mountain to climb to get to the promised land. Tonight, as I close, I call upon all aspects of the beloved community that John Lewis so often speaks of--the youth who continue to persist in the streets of America, indicating that Black lives and all lives matter; women, the impoverished, the faith community, workers, and many others whose names I have left out. Today, I ask for them to join hands and march in the month of March in your own cities and hamlets and counties on an agenda of healing, justice, and equality in commemoration of the march of those who crossed on that bloody day but of those who crossed as well successfully from Selma to Montgomery. Do not sit in your seats. Do not sit in your homes. March in the month of March. Let me hear your voices. Let us see you. Let us join you. You call us, and we will join you in those marches to make a difference in this Nation. I ask for that to all of my colleagues tonight. Mr. PAYNE. Thank you. I yield to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Al Green). Mr. AL GREEN of Texas. Thank you, Mr. Payne. Mr. Speaker, because time is of the essence, please allow me to get right to my message. Where were we in 1965? I will relate this to Congress. In 1965, when they crossed the Edmund Pettus Bridge, there were five African American Members of Congress. Now there are 48. In 1965, there were four Latino Members of Congress. Now there are 38. There were three Asian Americans in Congress. Now we have a total of 14. There were 14 women in Congress. We now have 104. Where were we? We were at a point in our history when it was turning for us, but it was a bloody point in our history because, when President Johnson signed the Voting Rights Act, he signed it in ink, but it was written in blood. It was written in the blood of the people who crossed the Edmund Pettus Bridge, in the blood of the people who lived and died so that some of us could have these opportunities to serve in the Congress of the United States of America. That is where we were. We have progressed. We have more Members of Congress, but in a true sense, it is back to the future because we have seen the evisceration of section 4 of the Voting Rights Act, which emasculated section 5 of the Voting Rights Act, meaning you don't have any States or any territories under section 4 so you cannot preclear them under section 5. We are now back to a point wherein we have to find a way to revitalize and to reinstate section 4 of the Voting Rights Act. I am sorry that the time has run out, but I do want to say this: if we with only five Members of Congress could get a Voting Rights Act passed, one would think that with 48 we can get it reinstated. Mr. PAYNE. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I rise today, along with my colleagues of the Congressional Black Caucus, [[Page H692]] to recognize the lasting legacy of the Selma marches. 50 years ago, Dr. Martin Luther King, Stokely Carmichael, Congressman John Lewis, and a number of other fearless fighters, led the historic marches from Selma to Montgomery, Alabama in protest of discriminatory voting laws. In the years prior to the Selma marches, less than 1% of the black voting age population was registered to vote in Dallas County, where Selma is located. However, more than 80% of Dallas County blacks lived below the poverty line. Various efforts to get blacks in Dallas County registered to vote were met physical violence and economic intimidation. But with the local leadership of the Dallas County Voters League, and the help of two national organizations, the Southern Christian Leadership Conference and the Student Nonviolence Coordinating Committee, the Selma marches were born. During the first march from Selma to Montgomery, in what would become known as ``Bloody Sunday,'' the nation watched in horror as African Americans were brutally beaten by police officers, attacked by dogs, and sprayed by fire hoses. Their courage, in the face of dehumanizing treatment from law enforcement, thrust the issue of segregation and race relations in the Deep South into the national consciousness. It led to President Lyndon B. Johnson presenting to a joint session of Congress what would become the Voting Rights Act of 1965, the most important piece of civil rights legislation in the history of this country. 50 years later, the images of ``Bloody Sunday'' are permanently etched into our Nation's history as a deep and painful reminder of the struggles we triumphantly conquered to get to where we are today. And yet, the deaths of Michael Brown and Eric Garner, at the hands of law enforcement, serve as tragic reminders that we still have so far to go. The work of Selma is not finished. The work of Dr. King, Stokely Carmichael, and Congressman Lewis is not finished. But we must remain encouraged and faithful for the progress still left to achieve. While the discriminatory voting laws of the 1960s are no more, we have encountered a new brand of voter disenfranchisement in 2015 that poses a serious threat to the electoral process. And once again, the great citizens of this nation must fight to protect their constitutional right to vote. It is with the painful lessons learned from the marches on Selma, and with the same tenacity and fearlessness that we will continue to fight this battle today. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 17 (Monday, February 2, 2015)] [House] [Pages H687-H692] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] CONGRESSIONAL BLACK CAUCUS The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under the Speaker's announced policy of January 6, 2015, the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Payne) is recognized for 60 minutes as the designee of the minority leader. General Leave Mr. PAYNE. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members be given 5 days to revise and extend their remarks. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from New Jersey? There was no objection. Mr. PAYNE. Mr. Speaker, I want to begin by welcoming our new members and by thanking the gentlewoman from Ohio, Congresswoman Marcia Fudge, for her leadership of the Congressional Black Caucus during the 113th Congress. Thanks to her dedication and tireless work, this caucus is better positioned to address the diverse challenges of the African American community. I also want to thank the new CBC chair, the Honorable Congressman G.K. Butterfield of North Carolina. I am confident that he will do a great job leading this caucus with steadfast commitment to justice and to building an America that works for everyone. Let me also thank my counterpart, the Honorable Congresswoman Robin Kelly, for joining me in leading the CBC Special Orders this year. I am truly honored to take on this new role, and I look forward to working with her as we help carry out the critical mission of this caucus. Mr. Speaker, 50 years ago, in the midst of the civil rights movement, hundreds of brave men and women gathered in Selma, Alabama, to begin a long, arduous march to Montgomery in support of the fundamental truth: that every American, regardless of what they look like, has the right to vote. {time} 1930 On March 7, 1965, 600 men and women set out from Selma following the death of 26-year-old Jimmie Lee Jackson, a deacon from Marion, Alabama, who died from gunshot wounds inflicted by a State trooper at a nonviolent demonstration. Theirs was a peaceful, nonviolent march, but it was met with fierce brutality. It would take the marchers two more attempts to arrive at Montgomery; but on March 25, after a 12-day journey, they did arrive. Since that day, our country has made significant strides in achieving equality and justice for all, but significant challenges remain unmet. Tonight, we will examine where we have come from, where we are, and where we would like to go as a society. We must be ready to go. In 1965, Selma became the focal point of voter registration efforts in the South. At the time, only 2 percent of the city's eligible African American voters had been able to register. The impact of Selma to the Montgomery march was profound. As Dr. King said, ``Selma produced the voting rights legislation of 1965.'' The Voting Rights Act of 1965 banned discriminatory voting requirements that disenfranchised African American voters throughout this country; yet, today, the dream of full equality is still something many African Americans can only dream of. Where we are, nearly 6 years after the end of the recession, people still struggle to find work, and the gap between the rich and poor continues to grow. For African Americans, this situation is severe, given the disproportionate effect of unemployment on our communities. At the same time, there remains widespread poverty, a defining challenge of our time. This persistent economic inequality threatens to undercut the gains that African American communities have made, and it undermines the idea of economic mobility, the idea that if you work hard in this country and have ambition, you can get ahead. The economic crisis is not only facing African American communities. Where we are in education, education is the most important economic investment we can make now and for future generations; yet, across the country, we still have seen cuts to education at all levels and attacks on critical programs like Head Start and Pell grants. These attacks undermine the ability of African Americans to get ahead--that is why I strongly support President Obama's new, bold initiative for free access to community colleges--so, too, do efforts to dismantle social safety net programs which our communities depend on. Those efforts are irresponsible, unjust, and contrary to who we are as Americans. The Congressional Black Caucus will make criminal justice reform a centerpiece of our agenda. We will work to reduce the epidemic of poverty in this country. We will work to create educational opportunities for African American children, and we will support efforts to strengthen our 105 Historically Black Colleges and Universities. The CBC also remains committed to fighting against efforts to dismantle the social safety net. We are determined to restore section 5 of the Voting Rights Act and to make sure everyone, regardless of what they look like or where they come from, has equal access to the polls, and we resolve to ensure that increasing diversity in this Nation is reflected in American corporations. Together, these policies will bring us closer as a nation where we are empowering the communities of African Americans, and they will benefit from the full equality and live the American Dream. There is no doubt that we are in difficult times in this Nation. Injustices are widespread and threaten some of our most fundamental rights, but we will find no answers in apathy, no comfort in complacency. As we always have, we will continue the march for progress, for freedom, for justice, and for equality for all. Mr. Speaker, it is my honor and privilege now that I yield to the distinguished gentlewoman from Illinois, Ms. Robin Kelly. Ms. KELLY of Illinois. Thank you, my friend from New Jersey. It is an honor to host with you this year. I am excited about the work ahead for the CBC in the 114th Congress. I also want to acknowledge the great job that Congressman Horsford and Congressman Jeffries did in hosting the Special Order hour in the 113th Congress. I also want to honor our past chair, Congresswoman Marcia Fudge, for all of her great work. Discussing 50 years from Selma, where we were, where we are, and where we are headed, I expect this to be very stimulating, frustrating, and rewarding all at the same time. It remains that we have a lot of work to do. Mr. PAYNE. I thank the gentlewoman. Mr. Speaker, at this time, it is my honor and privilege for the first time in the 114th Congress to have the chairman of the Congressional Black Caucus, G.K. Butterfield, address us, and I yield to the gentleman. Mr. BUTTERFIELD. I thank the gentleman for yielding. [[Page H688]] The Congressional Black Caucus is delighted to come to the floor this evening to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the 1965 Voting Rights Act. At the end of slavery, Mr. Speaker, in 1865, which was 150 years ago, the State of North Carolina had a slave population of 331,000 slaves. After the passage of the 13th Amendment and ratification of it by 27 States, these slaves became free. They became American citizens, and males 21 years old or older would soon be entitled to vote. Among those 331,000 slaves gaining freedom, 128,000 of them resided in my congressional district. In some of the counties, the Black population exceeded the White population. In 1870, African American citizens gained the right to vote by the enactment of the 15th Amendment. For the next 30 years, Mr. Speaker, African American men voted in large numbers and became a political force in State politics. Four African Americans were elected to Congress in North Carolina, eight in South Carolina, three in Alabama, and one each in Georgia, Florida, Mississippi, Virginia, and Louisiana. Many more were elected to State and local office. In 1900, after KKK violence and lynchings had not deterred Black political participation, most Southern States passed disfranchisement laws requiring a literacy test and the payment of a poll tax. These laws had the intent and effect of disenfranchising Black people from voting, and it worked. For the next half century, African Americans were effectively denied the right to vote with a few exceptions. Following his 1964 acceptance of the Nobel Peace Prize, Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., approached President Lyndon Johnson about advocating for a strong voting rights law that would enforce the 15th Amendment. President Johnson was uncomfortable in advancing the idea of a voting rights law, which greatly disappointed Dr. King. Dr. King was motivated to launch the Selma voting rights movement. On March 7, 1965, under the leadership of Dr. King, John Lewis, and others, Black residents of Selma attempted to march from Brown Chapel Church to the Alabama State capital to demand a voting rights law. As they approached the Edmund Pettus Bridge, the marchers were brutalized, and they were terrorized by State police and forced to retreat. We now refer to this confrontation as ``Bloody Sunday.'' Two days later, the marchers again began their journey to Montgomery, but as they crossed the bridge and saw the strong police presence, they turned around and returned to the church. At this point, President Johnson was outraged with Governor George Wallace for preventing the march. Johnson telephoned Wallace to demand that the marchers walk to Montgomery without incident. Three weeks later, on March 21, 1965, Dr. King persuaded thousands of Black and White to come to Selma to participate in the march. The march proceeded without incident. Fifty thousand participated. Following the March, a White marcher, Mrs. Viola Liuzzo from Detroit, was murdered while transporting marchers back to Selma. Jimmie Lee Jackson was killed by police during a Selma protest in February 1965. Saddened by these murders, President Johnson reconsidered his unwillingness to promote voting rights legislation. He went on national television on March 15 and announced that he would support a voting rights bill. Despite the Southern filibuster, the Voting Rights Act was enacted into law on August 6, 1965. This important law has changed the political landscape for African American communities. It bans the use of literacy tests. It gives minority communities the right to litigate discriminatory election schemes that dilute their vote. The act provides for a section 5 that requires certain jurisdictions with discriminatory histories to preclear election law changes with the Attorney General. To our great dismay, on June 25, 2013, the U.S. Supreme Court made section 5 unenforceable because the data used to determine covered jurisdictions is outdated, according to the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court has now called on Congress to modify the formula. To this day, Mr. Speaker, our Republican colleagues have refused to allow the bipartisan VRA amendment bill to be voted upon. In fact, the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, Mr. Goodlatte, announced that he has no intention to legislate a modification to the formula, and so the effect of not having section 5 is to allow jurisdictions to pass discriminatory election laws with impunity and without oversight. The Voting Rights Act has enabled African American communities to elect hundreds of Black elected officials. We successfully litigated dozens and dozens of cases. Many of my colleagues were elected because enforcement of the Voting Rights Act forced--forced--States to draw congressional districts where Black communities are not submerged and their vote diluted. Mr. Speaker, this story must be understood by every American citizen. The right to vote for African Americans was obtained by blood, sweat, and tears; and we are determined--the Congressional Black Caucus is determined--to continue this fight into 2016 and beyond. Mr. Payne, thank you very much for yielding time. Mr. PAYNE. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. We are looking forward to your leadership in the 114th Congress, and we will continue to strive to make sure that the issues that the CBC find important are relevant on the day-to-day basis. Now, Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from South Carolina (Mr. Clyburn), the leader, who has probably forgotten more about the goings- on and the rules in this Chamber than I will ever know. Mr. CLYBURN. Thank you so much, Mr. Payne, for yielding me time. I appreciate your accolades, and I promise you that my long, distant memory is getting very good, but I assure you that your contributions to this great body are very much appreciated. Mr. Speaker, yesterday, I opened up Black History Month with a speech at Cornerstone Baptist Church on Wayne Street in Columbia, South Carolina. They had an interesting topic for me to develop. It was all about remembering our past and preparing for the future. Chairman Butterfield has talked a little bit about the past that many of us remember, but 50 years after Selma, we must turn to the question that Martin Luther King, Jr., asked in one of his great books: Where do we go from here, chaos or community? Statistics show that there are nearly 500 counties and thousands of communities in the United States that are classified by the United States Census Bureau as persistent poverty areas. They are so defined because 20 percent of their populations have lived below the poverty level for the past 30 years or more. {time} 1945 They are diverse, including Caucasian communities in States like West Virginia, Kentucky, and Tennessee; Native American communities in States like South Dakota, Alaska, and Oklahoma; Latino communities in States like Arizona, New Mexico, and Texas; and African American communities in States like South Carolina, Alabama, and Mississippi. They are urban communities in States like New York and heartland communities in States like Missouri. 139 of these counties are represented in this body by Democrats; 331 of these counties are represented in this body by Republicans; and 18 of these counties are split between the two parties. Combating persistent poverty should matter to all of us, regardless of party, geography, or race. In early 2009, when we were putting together the Recovery Act, I proposed language to require that at least 10 percent of funds in three rural development accounts be directed to efforts in these persistent- poverty counties. This requirement was enacted into law. In light of the definition of persistent-poverty counties as having at least 20 percent poverty rates over 30 years, the provision became known as the 10-20-30 initiative. This initiative bore dividends as economic development projects proliferated in persistent poverty communities across the country. Using the 10-20-30 formula, the Recovery Act funded a total of 4,655 projects in persistent-poverty counties, totaling nearly $1.7 billion. I saw firsthand the positive effects of these projects in my district. [[Page H689]] We were able to undertake projects to create jobs that would have otherwise languished. Among those investments was a $5.8 million grant and a $2 million loan to construct 51 miles of water lines in the little community of Brittons Neck in Marion County, South Carolina. There are many other success stories. In Lowndes County, Mississippi, $17.5 million was spent to install a water line, elevated tank, and two wastewater pump stations, providing potable water to rural Mississippians and creating badly needed construction jobs. The Wellborn Special Utility District in Brazos County, Texas, received a $538,000 loan to construct more than 9 miles of new water distribution lines and connect over 60 households to a new water system. In 2011, I joined with our former Republican colleague, Representative Jo Ann Emerson of Missouri, to introduce an amendment to the continuing resolution that would have continued 10-20-30 for rural development and expanded it to 11 additional accounts throughout the Federal Government affecting economic development, education, job training, health, justice, the environment, and more. I want to make one thing clear about the 10-20-30 approach. It does not--I repeat, it does not--add one dime to the deficit. It simply targets resources from funds already authorized or appropriated. Over the past 30 years, the national economy has risen and fallen multiple times. During each economic downturn, while we have been rightly focused on getting the economy as a whole back on track, we have not given adequate attention to these communities that are suffering from chronic distress and Depression-era levels of joblessness. As a result, they have suffered even in good economic times. The 10- 20-30 approach would provide a mechanism to address this deprivation in times of want and in times of plenty, in times of Federal investment and in times of fiscal austerity. Last year, I wrote an essay on 10-20-30 which was published in the Harvard Journal on Legislation. I discussed the history of our Nation's efforts to address chronic poverty and more fully laid out the case for broadly implementing 10-20-30 in a bipartisan fashion. Mr. Speaker, as we begin to put our 2016 budget together, I look forward to working with all Members in this body on both sides of the aisle irrespective of what State or county you may represent. I look forward to working together so that we can make a real productive legacy for Selma and we can move forward and answer Dr. King's question ``Chaos or community?'' with a resounding: We are building communities. Mr. PAYNE. Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. Clyburn. As in the past, the Congressional Black Caucus will work to continue to reduce the epidemic of poverty in this country. When over 45 million Americans live below the poverty line, we are failing as a nation. As Congressman Butterfield said earlier this month, the CBC will advocate the Clyburn 10-20-30 plan, which redirects at least 10 percent of an agency's grants in its discretionary budget to communities where at least 20 percent of the population has lived below the poverty line for the past 30 years. These are the issues that we will continue to work on as members of the Congressional Black Caucus. It is now my honor to yield to the gentleman from New York (Mr. Rangel), one of my mentors since before I arrived in Congress, a former friend of my father's and a great colleague. Mr. RANGEL. Mr. Speaker, I wish I had a prepared statement, but I was so moved after listening and being a part of this great congressional group in this great country to be able to celebrate 50 years since the Voting Rights Act. As a kid who grew up on the streets of Lenox Avenue and dropped out of high school, I didn't have the benefit of having anything to attach a dream to that would allow me to believe that one day I could be sitting in the United States House of Representatives. But after returning from the war in Korea and after being the beneficiary of the GI bill, and after graduating from law school, I was able to see and hear atrocities that have been committed on Black folks in this country the likes of which I had not seen except during wartime. And even though my mother's family came from Virginia, in the city of New York even today I don't ever remember meeting any White people from the South. I don't know what that is. Perhaps Congressman Butterfield may be able to do some historical research about why they stayed in the South and didn't come to New York City, where racism had a sugar coating to it. They didn't use dogs and bombs and things of that nature. But I recall so vividly seeing people like Andy Young and especially our dear friend and colleague, John Lewis, be prepared to put their lives on the line for our country, not for themselves. In Korea and in most wars, people fight to stay alive and they don't voluntarily put their life on the line, as John Lewis and others have done. But what happened was, when they had the first Selma march, what we refer to as Bloody Sunday, years before our beloved Congresswoman was born, I saw something that really pained me as an American rather than as a human being. And then they had the second march from Selma to Montgomery and Dr. King pulled that back, and then we had the plea for people from all over the country to come down for the third march. I recalled before, I had bad feet and wasn't thinking about going to Selma to do 54 miles, but the inspiration to see people that had been prepared to put their life on the line for me and others like me could not allow me to return to New York. It is very interesting that I have to admit publicly that when I heard the voice of Lyndon Johnson coming across on radio and television saying, ``We shall overcome,'' I kind of thought, Terri, that those were our words. And if a White person was to say it, I never expected to find that accent of the very people that sounded as though they were part of a conspiracy to keep children of slaves from assimilating into the constitutional beliefs that we had since learned to live by and enjoy and hope for. What an historic moment that was. What a revolutionary period that was, because as we review that and look at the picture ``Selma,'' we wonder where did all of the people that represented this hatred go, the people who stood in the way of people registering voters; the people who took advantage of the idea that just because of their complexion they were superior; the people that belonged to the Ku Klux Klan; the people who used religion as a sword instead of a shield? Did they disappear? What happened to the so-called Dixiecrats? But then I am reminded that as a result of the Voting Rights Act and the Civil Rights Act that they didn't go very far, that they threw down their party label but they stayed in the same places, and many of them are doing the same thing--trying to continue to prevent people of color from enjoying their full constitutional voting rights. Then when I was honored enough to come down here in 1971 with half a dozen Congressional Black Caucus members, nine, who joined with four of us who had decided to form the Congressional Black Caucus, you could not believe, Congressman Payne, how it was never our dream that that small group would go from 13 to 26 to 40 to 46 to 47, and reach the historic impact on our policy and on our Nation, a group that had no intention of doing anything except to introduce, create, and support policies that could make this great country even stronger for all of us. And true, we have a lot of obstacles to overcome, but I don't think any group of people have been as successful as we have in coming from the pits of slavery in such a short period of time as we are now, and to see how much more work we have to do so that one day our children and our grandchildren will say: Why did they have to have a Congressional Black Caucus? Why wasn't it just a Democratic caucus? Why did we need it? {time} 2000 Well, because of the intellect, the commitment of individual members of the Black Caucus, like the rest of the Congress, that come from all walks of life and they got here to make this a better country, a more effective Congress, soon and very soon, we may hear those words: Why were we needed? [[Page H690]] Until we accomplish these lofty goals, thank God that we have had it. I think that the Democrats appreciate the work that we are trying to do, and one day, as so many people who got rid of their sheets, their children and their grandchildren would see that we only were trying to eliminate the pain for all people, regardless of color, to make the red, white, and blue, rather than just whether you are Black or White, become the theme that the fathers of this Constitution should have been striving for. There is no question in my mind that the things we stand for really and what the country is committed to do, and I am so proud of these last couple of years, that there is not a group of people I would rather spend my time with than with my friends and my colleagues in the Congressional Black Caucus. Mr. PAYNE. I thank the gentleman from New York. His kind thoughts and perspective is always, always needed in this House. Now, I have the honor and the privilege of yielding to the gentlewoman from Alabama (Ms. Sewell), who represents the city, the town, that is on everybody's breath over the last couple of months. Ms. SEWELL of Alabama. Mr. Speaker, I applaud the CBC for this Special Order hour, and I commend my colleague from New Jersey (Mr. Payne) and my colleague from Illinois (Ms. Kelly) for choosing such a great topic for tonight's Special Order hour. Selma, Lord, Selma. I have the great pleasure of standing before you not only as a Representative who represents the great city of Selma but as a native of Selma, Alabama, and a lifelong member of the historic Brown Chapel AME Church. I know that the journey I now take, the journey that many others who are here today take, was only made possible because of the courage, fortitude, and determination of those brave men and women on that bridge, Bloody Sunday, March 7, 1965. We who have the privilege and honor of taking this journey must ask ourselves: What will we do to extend the legacy? What will we do to protect the legacy? Selma is the soul of America. It is the place where the struggle for civil rights and voting rights began, the epicenter, if you will, of the voting rights movement. It deserves to be more than just a footnote in the history books. It deserves to take up chapters in the history books, the tactical and strategic voices of Martin Luther King and those brave men and women of SCLC and SNCC that had the fortitude and had the intellect to see this as a strategy, to know that they were speaking not only for themselves and their children, but for future generations. Only a true visionary could defeat such opposition with little more than a dream, and Dr. King held so tightly to his that it forced our country to become a more equal and just nation. Some want to forget the painful past. I know many in my district and many in my city would like to forget our painful past, but we cannot turn the pages as if certain chapters were never written; nor can we celebrate how far we have come without first acknowledging where we have been. Bloody Sunday forced America to confront its own inhumanity. Our painful past has ushered in a new day. As I tell my constituents, out of our painful past came the birth of a movement that changed a nation, and from that movement came a human rights movement that changed a world. If we don't write our own history, others will tell it for us, and they may not be so kind, they may not tell our history the way we would tell our history. My father grew up in Selma, as did I, and the Selma of my childhood was very, very different than the Selma of my father's childhood. There has been progress. My father went to segregated schools in Selma. My father drank from ``colored only'' fountains in Selma. My father's mother never got the chance to vote, though she tried to register several times. The Selma that I grew up in had an integrated public high school, a public high school that was 55 percent African American and 45 percent White. Yes, across town, there was an all-White private school. I want you to know that the Selma I grew up in, in the seventies and eighties, it produced me as its first Black valedictorian of Selma High School. I know that Selma and the journey that we all take now because of Selma was only made possible because of the bravery of others. As I stood to give my speech as a valedictorian in 1982 at Selma High School, I remember standing up and saying: Maybe one day I could join the likes of a Charlie Rangel, of a John Lewis, in the House of Congress. I said it as a pious, overly confident teenager probably, but I said it with every vigor because I believed in my heart that I could be and do anything. Why? Because the people of that community nurtured me, Black and White, my teachers, my Girl Scout troop leaders, my Sunday school teachers. Yes, I had proud parents who were educators, educated at Alabama State University, and because of their education at this wonderful quality institution of higher learning, I had a chance to go to Princeton--but I had more than that. I had an obligation to give back, to make sure that others had an opportunity to walk through those same doors. It wasn't enough to be the first. In fact, I was most proud 5 years after I graduated from Princeton that April Williams from Selma High School got to go to Princeton. I must have done something right. The Voting Rights Act of 1965 would have never been possible had it not been for the intellect, the mind of these wonderful leaders, some known. All of us know about the contributions of our colleague, John Lewis; all of us know about the contributions of the SCLC, Andy Young, and Martin Luther King. Some unknown, like my sixth grade teacher, Mrs. Richie Jean Jackson, she was featured in the movie ``Selma'' because it was her home, the home that she shared with Dr. Jackson, the first Black dentist in Selma, that housed Martin Luther King and Andrew Young and all those leaders every time they came to Selma because they couldn't stay at the all-White hotel. Mrs. Jackson was my sixth grade teacher. Mrs. Jackson did not live to see the movie ``Selma,'' but I am proud that this body is seeking to provide a Congressional Gold Medal to the foot soldiers of the movement, so that the Richie Jacksons, Mrs. Jacksons of the world, who had the bravery to go and be on that bridge Bloody Sunday or Turnaround Tuesday or the ultimate final march from Selma to Montgomery, that they are acknowledged by this Nation for the sacrifices that they made. In closing, I want to remind my colleagues of my guest at the State of the Union, January 20, 2015. My special guest was the 103-year-old Amelia Boynton. Amelia Boynton was characterized in the movie ``Selma'' as the proud African American woman who told Coretta Scott King: You are prepared. You are the descendants of kings and queens. Your heritage is one and your bloodline is one that survived slave ships. You are prepared. Amelia Boynton is known for her bravery that Bloody Sunday when she was bludgeoned, but she came back 2 days later on Turnaround Tuesday and continued to fight in Selma long after this march from Selma to Montgomery. She honored us with her presence, and as person after person came up to her and kissed her on the cheek and said, ``Miss Boynton, I stand on your shoulders today, thank you,'' Miss Boynton said something very poignant. She said, ``Everybody keeps talking about being on my shoulders. I tell them, Get off my shoulders, do your own work, there is plenty of work to be done.'' I want to remind my colleagues that there is plenty of work for us still to do. I want to honor the legacy of Amelia Boynton, F.D. Reese, John Lewis, and so many; but we cannot honor their legacy without acknowledging that the Voting Rights Act of 1965, major sections of it, have been invalidated. We owe it to that legacy, the legacy and memory of those who fought so valiantly, that this body should once again work together to make sure that Federal protections are there because, as we know, progress is always elusive, all battles become new again, and there is a renewed assault on voting. [[Page H691]] It may not be counting how many jelly beans are in a jar or how many county judges there are in the State of Alabama; but, nevertheless, we still have modern-day barriers to voting that we must overcome. I hope that we have the courage of our own convictions to see the movie ``Selma'' as a beginning of a national conversation about how we can continue to recommit ourselves to the ideals that were fought on that Bloody Sunday. I know that if we combined our hearts and our minds, both sides of the aisle will see that it is in everyone's best interest that all Americans have the right to vote. I thank my colleagues of the CBC for having this Special Order hour. I invite all of my colleagues from both sides of the aisle to come to Selma, to experience the living history, and I hope that we will all come away from the 50th commemoration of the march from Selma to Montgomery with a renewed vigor to once again provide Federal protection for all Americans to exercise that sacred right to vote. Mr. PAYNE. Thank you. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee). {time} 2015 Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, this is a very important evening. I thank my colleagues, both Mr. Payne of New Jersey and Ms. Kelly, for, first of all, taking up a very important challenge of being able to lead the members of the Congressional Black Caucus through this period of challenge to America. I am reflective of the number of Members who have had the chance to convey their thoughts, and each one I thank personally: our chairman, Mr. G.K. Butterfield, for his leadership and his internal knowledge from his walk in life of the civil rights journey; Mr. Clyburn for living and understanding the civil rights journey and conveying it in his legislative journey; Mr. Rangel for his service to this Nation as a Korean war vet and then coming home to be a vet of the civil rights effort; then, of course, the holder of the seat who represents Selma for her life story. Today, I rise to ask the question, What is our moral standard? And, following the words of Dr. Martin Luther King, why we can't wait. This is a clarion call to my colleagues--Democrats and Republicans-- that, in fact, this year--of all years--calls for us to act. It calls for us to be able to understand why the Nation cannot wait and who is going to lift up the moral standard. The walk from Selma to Montgomery turned into Bloody Sunday. It was where a young man by the name of John Lewis stood bravely alongside names like Hosea Williams. It was, of course, a place where the world watched, and it became the stair steps on which the Voting Rights Act was passed. Today, we realize that, on the shoulders of that tragic time, violence claimed the life of Jimmie Lee Jackson, beaten by State troopers as he was attempting to protect his mother and others, and that violence claimed the lives of Reverend James Reeb of Boston and of Viola Liuzzo of Detroit at that time as she returned from the Selma march--a time when 25,000 strong or more marched across the Montgomery bridge. We understand that our job is yet not done. In the wake of the decision by the Supreme Court that crippled the Voting Rights Act, we as members of the Judiciary Committee, led by our colleagues Mr. Clyburn and John Conyers, sought to correct that crippling. Today, I stand and ask my chairman and the Speaker of the House to have us put that fix with the new Members, our Republicans and Democrats--the same body of individuals who President Johnson convened--to be able to ensure that that Voting Rights Act of 1965 could be done. It is important to note that we not allow the efforts to go unnoted. Mr. Speaker, the voter ID law in Texas needs to be corrected by passing the Voting Rights Amendment Act. The terrible oppression of individuals in their walks to the polls has to be corrected by this amendment. Of course, we must ensure against the horrors of wealth inequality. The median income of Black households is $33,764--a mere 60 percent of the median income for White households. Then, of course, we must move to criminal justice reform. I am privileged, Mr. Speaker, to serve as the ranking member on the Crime Subcommittee, and I join my colleagues in the commitment to ensure that we, in fact, answer the call of the mothers of so many, such as those of Trayvon Martin, Sean Bell, Eric Garner, Michael Brown, Bobby Tolan, Jordan Baker, and many others, that we have grand jury reform, special prosecutor reform, prison reform--the transitioning of nonviolent offenders to productive lives--law enforcement training and best practices. Yes, the bill that I introduced, the Build TRUST Act, will not give incentives to towns that rely upon racial profiling and on stopping African Americans and other minorities to build their revenue. Mr. Speaker, tonight, I have the opportunity to remind us that our walk is not done in wealth inequality, in criminal justice reform and, as I know that my colleague Mr. Green will mention, in the body cameras. All of these--closing the wealth gap and passing the Voting Rights Act--are challenges not to Democrats, not to minorities; they are to the Nation, to our Republicans and our Democrats. So I answer the question why we cannot wait: because Dr. King left us a prophetic message and a mountain to climb to get to the promised land. Tonight, as I close, I call upon all aspects of the beloved community that John Lewis so often speaks of--the youth who continue to persist in the streets of America, indicating that Black lives and all lives matter; women, the impoverished, the faith community, workers, and many others whose names I have left out. Today, I ask for them to join hands and march in the month of March in your own cities and hamlets and counties on an agenda of healing, justice, and equality in commemoration of the march of those who crossed on that bloody day but of those who crossed as well successfully from Selma to Montgomery. Do not sit in your seats. Do not sit in your homes. March in the month of March. Let me hear your voices. Let us see you. Let us join you. You call us, and we will join you in those marches to make a difference in this Nation. I ask for that to all of my colleagues tonight. Mr. PAYNE. Thank you. I yield to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Al Green). Mr. AL GREEN of Texas. Thank you, Mr. Payne. Mr. Speaker, because time is of the essence, please allow me to get right to my message. Where were we in 1965? I will relate this to Congress. In 1965, when they crossed the Edmund Pettus Bridge, there were five African American Members of Congress. Now there are 48. In 1965, there were four Latino Members of Congress. Now there are 38. There were three Asian Americans in Congress. Now we have a total of 14. There were 14 women in Congress. We now have 104. Where were we? We were at a point in our history when it was turning for us, but it was a bloody point in our history because, when President Johnson signed the Voting Rights Act, he signed it in ink, but it was written in blood. It was written in the blood of the people who crossed the Edmund Pettus Bridge, in the blood of the people who lived and died so that some of us could have these opportunities to serve in the Congress of the United States of America. That is where we were. We have progressed. We have more Members of Congress, but in a true sense, it is back to the future because we have seen the evisceration of section 4 of the Voting Rights Act, which emasculated section 5 of the Voting Rights Act, meaning you don't have any States or any territories under section 4 so you cannot preclear them under section 5. We are now back to a point wherein we have to find a way to revitalize and to reinstate section 4 of the Voting Rights Act. I am sorry that the time has run out, but I do want to say this: if we with only five Members of Congress could get a Voting Rights Act passed, one would think that with 48 we can get it reinstated. Mr. PAYNE. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I rise today, along with my colleagues of the Congressional Black Caucus, [[Page H692]] to recognize the lasting legacy of the Selma marches. 50 years ago, Dr. Martin Luther King, Stokely Carmichael, Congressman John Lewis, and a number of other fearless fighters, led the historic marches from Selma to Montgomery, Alabama in protest of discriminatory voting laws. In the years prior to the Selma marches, less than 1% of the black voting age population was registered to vote in Dallas County, where Selma is located. However, more than 80% of Dallas County blacks lived below the poverty line. Various efforts to get blacks in Dallas County registered to vote were met physical violence and economic intimidation. But with the local leadership of the Dallas County Voters League, and the help of two national organizations, the Southern Christian Leadership Conference and the Student Nonviolence Coordinating Committee, the Selma marches were born. During the first march from Selma to Montgomery, in what would become known as ``Bloody Sunday,'' the nation watched in horror as African Americans were brutally beaten by police officers, attacked by dogs, and sprayed by fire hoses. Their courage, in the face of dehumanizing treatment from law enforcement, thrust the issue of segregation and race relations in the Deep South into the national consciousness. It led to President Lyndon B. Johnson presenting to a joint session of Congress what would become the Voting Rights Act of 1965, the most important piece of civil rights legislation in the history of this country. 50 years later, the images of ``Bloody Sunday'' are permanently etched into our Nation's history as a deep and painful reminder of the struggles we triumphantly conquered to get to where we are today. And yet, the deaths of Michael Brown and Eric Garner, at the hands of law enforcement, serve as tragic reminders that we still have so far to go. The work of Selma is not finished. The work of Dr. King, Stokely Carmichael, and Congressman Lewis is not finished. But we must remain encouraged and faithful for the progress still left to achieve. While the discriminatory voting laws of the 1960s are no more, we have encountered a new brand of voter disenfranchisement in 2015 that poses a serious threat to the electoral process. And once again, the great citizens of this nation must fight to protect their constitutional right to vote. It is with the painful lessons learned from the marches on Selma, and with the same tenacity and fearlessness that we will continue to fight this battle today. ____________________","Congressional Record, Volume 161 Issue 17 (Monday, February 2, 2015) [Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 17 (Monday, February 2, 2015)] [House] [Pages H687-H692] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] CONGRESSIONAL BLACK CAUCUS The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under the Speaker's announced policy of January 6, 2015, the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Payne) is recognized for 60 minutes as the designee of the minority leader. General Leave Mr. PAYNE. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members be given 5 days to revise and extend their remarks. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from New Jersey? There was no objection. Mr. PAYNE. Mr. Speaker, I want to begin by welcoming our new members and by thanking the gentlewoman from Ohio, Congresswoman Marcia Fudge, for her leadership of the Congressional Black Caucus during the 113th Congress. Thanks to her dedication and tireless work, this caucus is better positioned to address the diverse challenges of the African American community. I also want to thank the new CBC chair, the Honorable Congressman G.K. Butterfield of North Carolina. I am confident that he will do a great job leading this caucus with steadfast commitment to justice and to building an America that works for everyone. Let me also thank my counterpart, the Honorable Congresswoman Robin Kelly, for joining me in leading the CBC Special Orders this year. I am truly honored to take on this new role, and I look forward to working with her as we help carry out the critical mission of this caucus. Mr. Speaker, 50 years ago, in the midst of the civil rights movement, hundreds of brave men and women gathered in Selma, Alabama, to begin a long, arduous march to Montgomery in support of the fundamental truth: that every American, regardless of what they look like, has the right to vote. {time} 1930 On March 7, 1965, 600 men and women set out from Selma following the death of 26-year-old Jimmie Lee Jackson, a deacon from Marion, Alabama, who died from gunshot wounds inflicted by a State trooper at a nonviolent demonstration. Theirs was a peaceful, nonviolent march, but it was met with fierce brutality. It would take the marchers two more attempts to arrive at Montgomery; but on March 25, after a 12-day journey, they did arrive. Since that day, our country has made significant strides in achieving equality and justice for all, but significant challenges remain unmet. Tonight, we will examine where we have come from, where we are, and where we would like to go as a society. We must be ready to go. In 1965, Selma became the focal point of voter registration efforts in the South. At the time, only 2 percent of the city's eligible African American voters had been able to register. The impact of Selma to the Montgomery march was profound. As Dr. King said, ``Selma produced the voting rights legislation of 1965.'' The Voting Rights Act of 1965 banned discriminatory voting requirements that disenfranchised African American voters throughout this country; yet, today, the dream of full equality is still something many African Americans can only dream of. Where we are, nearly 6 years after the end of the recession, people still struggle to find work, and the gap between the rich and poor continues to grow. For African Americans, this situation is severe, given the disproportionate effect of unemployment on our communities. At the same time, there remains widespread poverty, a defining challenge of our time. This persistent economic inequality threatens to undercut the gains that African American communities have made, and it undermines the idea of economic mobility, the idea that if you work hard in this country and have ambition, you can get ahead. The economic crisis is not only facing African American communities. Where we are in education, education is the most important economic investment we can make now and for future generations; yet, across the country, we still have seen cuts to education at all levels and attacks on critical programs like Head Start and Pell grants. These attacks undermine the ability of African Americans to get ahead--that is why I strongly support President Obama's new, bold initiative for free access to community colleges--so, too, do efforts to dismantle social safety net programs which our communities depend on. Those efforts are irresponsible, unjust, and contrary to who we are as Americans. The Congressional Black Caucus will make criminal justice reform a centerpiece of our agenda. We will work to reduce the epidemic of poverty in this country. We will work to create educational opportunities for African American children, and we will support efforts to strengthen our 105 Historically Black Colleges and Universities. The CBC also remains committed to fighting against efforts to dismantle the social safety net. We are determined to restore section 5 of the Voting Rights Act and to make sure everyone, regardless of what they look like or where they come from, has equal access to the polls, and we resolve to ensure that increasing diversity in this Nation is reflected in American corporations. Together, these policies will bring us closer as a nation where we are empowering the communities of African Americans, and they will benefit from the full equality and live the American Dream. There is no doubt that we are in difficult times in this Nation. Injustices are widespread and threaten some of our most fundamental rights, but we will find no answers in apathy, no comfort in complacency. As we always have, we will continue the march for progress, for freedom, for justice, and for equality for all. Mr. Speaker, it is my honor and privilege now that I yield to the distinguished gentlewoman from Illinois, Ms. Robin Kelly. Ms. KELLY of Illinois. Thank you, my friend from New Jersey. It is an honor to host with you this year. I am excited about the work ahead for the CBC in the 114th Congress. I also want to acknowledge the great job that Congressman Horsford and Congressman Jeffries did in hosting the Special Order hour in the 113th Congress. I also want to honor our past chair, Congresswoman Marcia Fudge, for all of her great work. Discussing 50 years from Selma, where we were, where we are, and where we are headed, I expect this to be very stimulating, frustrating, and rewarding all at the same time. It remains that we have a lot of work to do. Mr. PAYNE. I thank the gentlewoman. Mr. Speaker, at this time, it is my honor and privilege for the first time in the 114th Congress to have the chairman of the Congressional Black Caucus, G.K. Butterfield, address us, and I yield to the gentleman. Mr. BUTTERFIELD. I thank the gentleman for yielding. [[Page H688]] The Congressional Black Caucus is delighted to come to the floor this evening to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the 1965 Voting Rights Act. At the end of slavery, Mr. Speaker, in 1865, which was 150 years ago, the State of North Carolina had a slave population of 331,000 slaves. After the passage of the 13th Amendment and ratification of it by 27 States, these slaves became free. They became American citizens, and males 21 years old or older would soon be entitled to vote. Among those 331,000 slaves gaining freedom, 128,000 of them resided in my congressional district. In some of the counties, the Black population exceeded the White population. In 1870, African American citizens gained the right to vote by the enactment of the 15th Amendment. For the next 30 years, Mr. Speaker, African American men voted in large numbers and became a political force in State politics. Four African Americans were elected to Congress in North Carolina, eight in South Carolina, three in Alabama, and one each in Georgia, Florida, Mississippi, Virginia, and Louisiana. Many more were elected to State and local office. In 1900, after KKK violence and lynchings had not deterred Black political participation, most Southern States passed disfranchisement laws requiring a literacy test and the payment of a poll tax. These laws had the intent and effect of disenfranchising Black people from voting, and it worked. For the next half century, African Americans were effectively denied the right to vote with a few exceptions. Following his 1964 acceptance of the Nobel Peace Prize, Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., approached President Lyndon Johnson about advocating for a strong voting rights law that would enforce the 15th Amendment. President Johnson was uncomfortable in advancing the idea of a voting rights law, which greatly disappointed Dr. King. Dr. King was motivated to launch the Selma voting rights movement. On March 7, 1965, under the leadership of Dr. King, John Lewis, and others, Black residents of Selma attempted to march from Brown Chapel Church to the Alabama State capital to demand a voting rights law. As they approached the Edmund Pettus Bridge, the marchers were brutalized, and they were terrorized by State police and forced to retreat. We now refer to this confrontation as ``Bloody Sunday.'' Two days later, the marchers again began their journey to Montgomery, but as they crossed the bridge and saw the strong police presence, they turned around and returned to the church. At this point, President Johnson was outraged with Governor George Wallace for preventing the march. Johnson telephoned Wallace to demand that the marchers walk to Montgomery without incident. Three weeks later, on March 21, 1965, Dr. King persuaded thousands of Black and White to come to Selma to participate in the march. The march proceeded without incident. Fifty thousand participated. Following the March, a White marcher, Mrs. Viola Liuzzo from Detroit, was murdered while transporting marchers back to Selma. Jimmie Lee Jackson was killed by police during a Selma protest in February 1965. Saddened by these murders, President Johnson reconsidered his unwillingness to promote voting rights legislation. He went on national television on March 15 and announced that he would support a voting rights bill. Despite the Southern filibuster, the Voting Rights Act was enacted into law on August 6, 1965. This important law has changed the political landscape for African American communities. It bans the use of literacy tests. It gives minority communities the right to litigate discriminatory election schemes that dilute their vote. The act provides for a section 5 that requires certain jurisdictions with discriminatory histories to preclear election law changes with the Attorney General. To our great dismay, on June 25, 2013, the U.S. Supreme Court made section 5 unenforceable because the data used to determine covered jurisdictions is outdated, according to the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court has now called on Congress to modify the formula. To this day, Mr. Speaker, our Republican colleagues have refused to allow the bipartisan VRA amendment bill to be voted upon. In fact, the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, Mr. Goodlatte, announced that he has no intention to legislate a modification to the formula, and so the effect of not having section 5 is to allow jurisdictions to pass discriminatory election laws with impunity and without oversight. The Voting Rights Act has enabled African American communities to elect hundreds of Black elected officials. We successfully litigated dozens and dozens of cases. Many of my colleagues were elected because enforcement of the Voting Rights Act forced--forced--States to draw congressional districts where Black communities are not submerged and their vote diluted. Mr. Speaker, this story must be understood by every American citizen. The right to vote for African Americans was obtained by blood, sweat, and tears; and we are determined--the Congressional Black Caucus is determined--to continue this fight into 2016 and beyond. Mr. Payne, thank you very much for yielding time. Mr. PAYNE. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. We are looking forward to your leadership in the 114th Congress, and we will continue to strive to make sure that the issues that the CBC find important are relevant on the day-to-day basis. Now, Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from South Carolina (Mr. Clyburn), the leader, who has probably forgotten more about the goings- on and the rules in this Chamber than I will ever know. Mr. CLYBURN. Thank you so much, Mr. Payne, for yielding me time. I appreciate your accolades, and I promise you that my long, distant memory is getting very good, but I assure you that your contributions to this great body are very much appreciated. Mr. Speaker, yesterday, I opened up Black History Month with a speech at Cornerstone Baptist Church on Wayne Street in Columbia, South Carolina. They had an interesting topic for me to develop. It was all about remembering our past and preparing for the future. Chairman Butterfield has talked a little bit about the past that many of us remember, but 50 years after Selma, we must turn to the question that Martin Luther King, Jr., asked in one of his great books: Where do we go from here, chaos or community? Statistics show that there are nearly 500 counties and thousands of communities in the United States that are classified by the United States Census Bureau as persistent poverty areas. They are so defined because 20 percent of their populations have lived below the poverty level for the past 30 years or more. {time} 1945 They are diverse, including Caucasian communities in States like West Virginia, Kentucky, and Tennessee; Native American communities in States like South Dakota, Alaska, and Oklahoma; Latino communities in States like Arizona, New Mexico, and Texas; and African American communities in States like South Carolina, Alabama, and Mississippi. They are urban communities in States like New York and heartland communities in States like Missouri. 139 of these counties are represented in this body by Democrats; 331 of these counties are represented in this body by Republicans; and 18 of these counties are split between the two parties. Combating persistent poverty should matter to all of us, regardless of party, geography, or race. In early 2009, when we were putting together the Recovery Act, I proposed language to require that at least 10 percent of funds in three rural development accounts be directed to efforts in these persistent- poverty counties. This requirement was enacted into law. In light of the definition of persistent-poverty counties as having at least 20 percent poverty rates over 30 years, the provision became known as the 10-20-30 initiative. This initiative bore dividends as economic development projects proliferated in persistent poverty communities across the country. Using the 10-20-30 formula, the Recovery Act funded a total of 4,655 projects in persistent-poverty counties, totaling nearly $1.7 billion. I saw firsthand the positive effects of these projects in my district. [[Page H689]] We were able to undertake projects to create jobs that would have otherwise languished. Among those investments was a $5.8 million grant and a $2 million loan to construct 51 miles of water lines in the little community of Brittons Neck in Marion County, South Carolina. There are many other success stories. In Lowndes County, Mississippi, $17.5 million was spent to install a water line, elevated tank, and two wastewater pump stations, providing potable water to rural Mississippians and creating badly needed construction jobs. The Wellborn Special Utility District in Brazos County, Texas, received a $538,000 loan to construct more than 9 miles of new water distribution lines and connect over 60 households to a new water system. In 2011, I joined with our former Republican colleague, Representative Jo Ann Emerson of Missouri, to introduce an amendment to the continuing resolution that would have continued 10-20-30 for rural development and expanded it to 11 additional accounts throughout the Federal Government affecting economic development, education, job training, health, justice, the environment, and more. I want to make one thing clear about the 10-20-30 approach. It does not--I repeat, it does not--add one dime to the deficit. It simply targets resources from funds already authorized or appropriated. Over the past 30 years, the national economy has risen and fallen multiple times. During each economic downturn, while we have been rightly focused on getting the economy as a whole back on track, we have not given adequate attention to these communities that are suffering from chronic distress and Depression-era levels of joblessness. As a result, they have suffered even in good economic times. The 10- 20-30 approach would provide a mechanism to address this deprivation in times of want and in times of plenty, in times of Federal investment and in times of fiscal austerity. Last year, I wrote an essay on 10-20-30 which was published in the Harvard Journal on Legislation. I discussed the history of our Nation's efforts to address chronic poverty and more fully laid out the case for broadly implementing 10-20-30 in a bipartisan fashion. Mr. Speaker, as we begin to put our 2016 budget together, I look forward to working with all Members in this body on both sides of the aisle irrespective of what State or county you may represent. I look forward to working together so that we can make a real productive legacy for Selma and we can move forward and answer Dr. King's question ``Chaos or community?'' with a resounding: We are building communities. Mr. PAYNE. Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. Clyburn. As in the past, the Congressional Black Caucus will work to continue to reduce the epidemic of poverty in this country. When over 45 million Americans live below the poverty line, we are failing as a nation. As Congressman Butterfield said earlier this month, the CBC will advocate the Clyburn 10-20-30 plan, which redirects at least 10 percent of an agency's grants in its discretionary budget to communities where at least 20 percent of the population has lived below the poverty line for the past 30 years. These are the issues that we will continue to work on as members of the Congressional Black Caucus. It is now my honor to yield to the gentleman from New York (Mr. Rangel), one of my mentors since before I arrived in Congress, a former friend of my father's and a great colleague. Mr. RANGEL. Mr. Speaker, I wish I had a prepared statement, but I was so moved after listening and being a part of this great congressional group in this great country to be able to celebrate 50 years since the Voting Rights Act. As a kid who grew up on the streets of Lenox Avenue and dropped out of high school, I didn't have the benefit of having anything to attach a dream to that would allow me to believe that one day I could be sitting in the United States House of Representatives. But after returning from the war in Korea and after being the beneficiary of the GI bill, and after graduating from law school, I was able to see and hear atrocities that have been committed on Black folks in this country the likes of which I had not seen except during wartime. And even though my mother's family came from Virginia, in the city of New York even today I don't ever remember meeting any White people from the South. I don't know what that is. Perhaps Congressman Butterfield may be able to do some historical research about why they stayed in the South and didn't come to New York City, where racism had a sugar coating to it. They didn't use dogs and bombs and things of that nature. But I recall so vividly seeing people like Andy Young and especially our dear friend and colleague, John Lewis, be prepared to put their lives on the line for our country, not for themselves. In Korea and in most wars, people fight to stay alive and they don't voluntarily put their life on the line, as John Lewis and others have done. But what happened was, when they had the first Selma march, what we refer to as Bloody Sunday, years before our beloved Congresswoman was born, I saw something that really pained me as an American rather than as a human being. And then they had the second march from Selma to Montgomery and Dr. King pulled that back, and then we had the plea for people from all over the country to come down for the third march. I recalled before, I had bad feet and wasn't thinking about going to Selma to do 54 miles, but the inspiration to see people that had been prepared to put their life on the line for me and others like me could not allow me to return to New York. It is very interesting that I have to admit publicly that when I heard the voice of Lyndon Johnson coming across on radio and television saying, ``We shall overcome,'' I kind of thought, Terri, that those were our words. And if a White person was to say it, I never expected to find that accent of the very people that sounded as though they were part of a conspiracy to keep children of slaves from assimilating into the constitutional beliefs that we had since learned to live by and enjoy and hope for. What an historic moment that was. What a revolutionary period that was, because as we review that and look at the picture ``Selma,'' we wonder where did all of the people that represented this hatred go, the people who stood in the way of people registering voters; the people who took advantage of the idea that just because of their complexion they were superior; the people that belonged to the Ku Klux Klan; the people who used religion as a sword instead of a shield? Did they disappear? What happened to the so-called Dixiecrats? But then I am reminded that as a result of the Voting Rights Act and the Civil Rights Act that they didn't go very far, that they threw down their party label but they stayed in the same places, and many of them are doing the same thing--trying to continue to prevent people of color from enjoying their full constitutional voting rights. Then when I was honored enough to come down here in 1971 with half a dozen Congressional Black Caucus members, nine, who joined with four of us who had decided to form the Congressional Black Caucus, you could not believe, Congressman Payne, how it was never our dream that that small group would go from 13 to 26 to 40 to 46 to 47, and reach the historic impact on our policy and on our Nation, a group that had no intention of doing anything except to introduce, create, and support policies that could make this great country even stronger for all of us. And true, we have a lot of obstacles to overcome, but I don't think any group of people have been as successful as we have in coming from the pits of slavery in such a short period of time as we are now, and to see how much more work we have to do so that one day our children and our grandchildren will say: Why did they have to have a Congressional Black Caucus? Why wasn't it just a Democratic caucus? Why did we need it? {time} 2000 Well, because of the intellect, the commitment of individual members of the Black Caucus, like the rest of the Congress, that come from all walks of life and they got here to make this a better country, a more effective Congress, soon and very soon, we may hear those words: Why were we needed? [[Page H690]] Until we accomplish these lofty goals, thank God that we have had it. I think that the Democrats appreciate the work that we are trying to do, and one day, as so many people who got rid of their sheets, their children and their grandchildren would see that we only were trying to eliminate the pain for all people, regardless of color, to make the red, white, and blue, rather than just whether you are Black or White, become the theme that the fathers of this Constitution should have been striving for. There is no question in my mind that the things we stand for really and what the country is committed to do, and I am so proud of these last couple of years, that there is not a group of people I would rather spend my time with than with my friends and my colleagues in the Congressional Black Caucus. Mr. PAYNE. I thank the gentleman from New York. His kind thoughts and perspective is always, always needed in this House. Now, I have the honor and the privilege of yielding to the gentlewoman from Alabama (Ms. Sewell), who represents the city, the town, that is on everybody's breath over the last couple of months. Ms. SEWELL of Alabama. Mr. Speaker, I applaud the CBC for this Special Order hour, and I commend my colleague from New Jersey (Mr. Payne) and my colleague from Illinois (Ms. Kelly) for choosing such a great topic for tonight's Special Order hour. Selma, Lord, Selma. I have the great pleasure of standing before you not only as a Representative who represents the great city of Selma but as a native of Selma, Alabama, and a lifelong member of the historic Brown Chapel AME Church. I know that the journey I now take, the journey that many others who are here today take, was only made possible because of the courage, fortitude, and determination of those brave men and women on that bridge, Bloody Sunday, March 7, 1965. We who have the privilege and honor of taking this journey must ask ourselves: What will we do to extend the legacy? What will we do to protect the legacy? Selma is the soul of America. It is the place where the struggle for civil rights and voting rights began, the epicenter, if you will, of the voting rights movement. It deserves to be more than just a footnote in the history books. It deserves to take up chapters in the history books, the tactical and strategic voices of Martin Luther King and those brave men and women of SCLC and SNCC that had the fortitude and had the intellect to see this as a strategy, to know that they were speaking not only for themselves and their children, but for future generations. Only a true visionary could defeat such opposition with little more than a dream, and Dr. King held so tightly to his that it forced our country to become a more equal and just nation. Some want to forget the painful past. I know many in my district and many in my city would like to forget our painful past, but we cannot turn the pages as if certain chapters were never written; nor can we celebrate how far we have come without first acknowledging where we have been. Bloody Sunday forced America to confront its own inhumanity. Our painful past has ushered in a new day. As I tell my constituents, out of our painful past came the birth of a movement that changed a nation, and from that movement came a human rights movement that changed a world. If we don't write our own history, others will tell it for us, and they may not be so kind, they may not tell our history the way we would tell our history. My father grew up in Selma, as did I, and the Selma of my childhood was very, very different than the Selma of my father's childhood. There has been progress. My father went to segregated schools in Selma. My father drank from ``colored only'' fountains in Selma. My father's mother never got the chance to vote, though she tried to register several times. The Selma that I grew up in had an integrated public high school, a public high school that was 55 percent African American and 45 percent White. Yes, across town, there was an all-White private school. I want you to know that the Selma I grew up in, in the seventies and eighties, it produced me as its first Black valedictorian of Selma High School. I know that Selma and the journey that we all take now because of Selma was only made possible because of the bravery of others. As I stood to give my speech as a valedictorian in 1982 at Selma High School, I remember standing up and saying: Maybe one day I could join the likes of a Charlie Rangel, of a John Lewis, in the House of Congress. I said it as a pious, overly confident teenager probably, but I said it with every vigor because I believed in my heart that I could be and do anything. Why? Because the people of that community nurtured me, Black and White, my teachers, my Girl Scout troop leaders, my Sunday school teachers. Yes, I had proud parents who were educators, educated at Alabama State University, and because of their education at this wonderful quality institution of higher learning, I had a chance to go to Princeton--but I had more than that. I had an obligation to give back, to make sure that others had an opportunity to walk through those same doors. It wasn't enough to be the first. In fact, I was most proud 5 years after I graduated from Princeton that April Williams from Selma High School got to go to Princeton. I must have done something right. The Voting Rights Act of 1965 would have never been possible had it not been for the intellect, the mind of these wonderful leaders, some known. All of us know about the contributions of our colleague, John Lewis; all of us know about the contributions of the SCLC, Andy Young, and Martin Luther King. Some unknown, like my sixth grade teacher, Mrs. Richie Jean Jackson, she was featured in the movie ``Selma'' because it was her home, the home that she shared with Dr. Jackson, the first Black dentist in Selma, that housed Martin Luther King and Andrew Young and all those leaders every time they came to Selma because they couldn't stay at the all-White hotel. Mrs. Jackson was my sixth grade teacher. Mrs. Jackson did not live to see the movie ``Selma,'' but I am proud that this body is seeking to provide a Congressional Gold Medal to the foot soldiers of the movement, so that the Richie Jacksons, Mrs. Jacksons of the world, who had the bravery to go and be on that bridge Bloody Sunday or Turnaround Tuesday or the ultimate final march from Selma to Montgomery, that they are acknowledged by this Nation for the sacrifices that they made. In closing, I want to remind my colleagues of my guest at the State of the Union, January 20, 2015. My special guest was the 103-year-old Amelia Boynton. Amelia Boynton was characterized in the movie ``Selma'' as the proud African American woman who told Coretta Scott King: You are prepared. You are the descendants of kings and queens. Your heritage is one and your bloodline is one that survived slave ships. You are prepared. Amelia Boynton is known for her bravery that Bloody Sunday when she was bludgeoned, but she came back 2 days later on Turnaround Tuesday and continued to fight in Selma long after this march from Selma to Montgomery. She honored us with her presence, and as person after person came up to her and kissed her on the cheek and said, ``Miss Boynton, I stand on your shoulders today, thank you,'' Miss Boynton said something very poignant. She said, ``Everybody keeps talking about being on my shoulders. I tell them, Get off my shoulders, do your own work, there is plenty of work to be done.'' I want to remind my colleagues that there is plenty of work for us still to do. I want to honor the legacy of Amelia Boynton, F.D. Reese, John Lewis, and so many; but we cannot honor their legacy without acknowledging that the Voting Rights Act of 1965, major sections of it, have been invalidated. We owe it to that legacy, the legacy and memory of those who fought so valiantly, that this body should once again work together to make sure that Federal protections are there because, as we know, progress is always elusive, all battles become new again, and there is a renewed assault on voting. [[Page H691]] It may not be counting how many jelly beans are in a jar or how many county judges there are in the State of Alabama; but, nevertheless, we still have modern-day barriers to voting that we must overcome. I hope that we have the courage of our own convictions to see the movie ``Selma'' as a beginning of a national conversation about how we can continue to recommit ourselves to the ideals that were fought on that Bloody Sunday. I know that if we combined our hearts and our minds, both sides of the aisle will see that it is in everyone's best interest that all Americans have the right to vote. I thank my colleagues of the CBC for having this Special Order hour. I invite all of my colleagues from both sides of the aisle to come to Selma, to experience the living history, and I hope that we will all come away from the 50th commemoration of the march from Selma to Montgomery with a renewed vigor to once again provide Federal protection for all Americans to exercise that sacred right to vote. Mr. PAYNE. Thank you. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee). {time} 2015 Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, this is a very important evening. I thank my colleagues, both Mr. Payne of New Jersey and Ms. Kelly, for, first of all, taking up a very important challenge of being able to lead the members of the Congressional Black Caucus through this period of challenge to America. I am reflective of the number of Members who have had the chance to convey their thoughts, and each one I thank personally: our chairman, Mr. G.K. Butterfield, for his leadership and his internal knowledge from his walk in life of the civil rights journey; Mr. Clyburn for living and understanding the civil rights journey and conveying it in his legislative journey; Mr. Rangel for his service to this Nation as a Korean war vet and then coming home to be a vet of the civil rights effort; then, of course, the holder of the seat who represents Selma for her life story. Today, I rise to ask the question, What is our moral standard? And, following the words of Dr. Martin Luther King, why we can't wait. This is a clarion call to my colleagues--Democrats and Republicans-- that, in fact, this year--of all years--calls for us to act. It calls for us to be able to understand why the Nation cannot wait and who is going to lift up the moral standard. The walk from Selma to Montgomery turned into Bloody Sunday. It was where a young man by the name of John Lewis stood bravely alongside names like Hosea Williams. It was, of course, a place where the world watched, and it became the stair steps on which the Voting Rights Act was passed. Today, we realize that, on the shoulders of that tragic time, violence claimed the life of Jimmie Lee Jackson, beaten by State troopers as he was attempting to protect his mother and others, and that violence claimed the lives of Reverend James Reeb of Boston and of Viola Liuzzo of Detroit at that time as she returned from the Selma march--a time when 25,000 strong or more marched across the Montgomery bridge. We understand that our job is yet not done. In the wake of the decision by the Supreme Court that crippled the Voting Rights Act, we as members of the Judiciary Committee, led by our colleagues Mr. Clyburn and John Conyers, sought to correct that crippling. Today, I stand and ask my chairman and the Speaker of the House to have us put that fix with the new Members, our Republicans and Democrats--the same body of individuals who President Johnson convened--to be able to ensure that that Voting Rights Act of 1965 could be done. It is important to note that we not allow the efforts to go unnoted. Mr. Speaker, the voter ID law in Texas needs to be corrected by passing the Voting Rights Amendment Act. The terrible oppression of individuals in their walks to the polls has to be corrected by this amendment. Of course, we must ensure against the horrors of wealth inequality. The median income of Black households is $33,764--a mere 60 percent of the median income for White households. Then, of course, we must move to criminal justice reform. I am privileged, Mr. Speaker, to serve as the ranking member on the Crime Subcommittee, and I join my colleagues in the commitment to ensure that we, in fact, answer the call of the mothers of so many, such as those of Trayvon Martin, Sean Bell, Eric Garner, Michael Brown, Bobby Tolan, Jordan Baker, and many others, that we have grand jury reform, special prosecutor reform, prison reform--the transitioning of nonviolent offenders to productive lives--law enforcement training and best practices. Yes, the bill that I introduced, the Build TRUST Act, will not give incentives to towns that rely upon racial profiling and on stopping African Americans and other minorities to build their revenue. Mr. Speaker, tonight, I have the opportunity to remind us that our walk is not done in wealth inequality, in criminal justice reform and, as I know that my colleague Mr. Green will mention, in the body cameras. All of these--closing the wealth gap and passing the Voting Rights Act--are challenges not to Democrats, not to minorities; they are to the Nation, to our Republicans and our Democrats. So I answer the question why we cannot wait: because Dr. King left us a prophetic message and a mountain to climb to get to the promised land. Tonight, as I close, I call upon all aspects of the beloved community that John Lewis so often speaks of--the youth who continue to persist in the streets of America, indicating that Black lives and all lives matter; women, the impoverished, the faith community, workers, and many others whose names I have left out. Today, I ask for them to join hands and march in the month of March in your own cities and hamlets and counties on an agenda of healing, justice, and equality in commemoration of the march of those who crossed on that bloody day but of those who crossed as well successfully from Selma to Montgomery. Do not sit in your seats. Do not sit in your homes. March in the month of March. Let me hear your voices. Let us see you. Let us join you. You call us, and we will join you in those marches to make a difference in this Nation. I ask for that to all of my colleagues tonight. Mr. PAYNE. Thank you. I yield to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Al Green). Mr. AL GREEN of Texas. Thank you, Mr. Payne. Mr. Speaker, because time is of the essence, please allow me to get right to my message. Where were we in 1965? I will relate this to Congress. In 1965, when they crossed the Edmund Pettus Bridge, there were five African American Members of Congress. Now there are 48. In 1965, there were four Latino Members of Congress. Now there are 38. There were three Asian Americans in Congress. Now we have a total of 14. There were 14 women in Congress. We now have 104. Where were we? We were at a point in our history when it was turning for us, but it was a bloody point in our history because, when President Johnson signed the Voting Rights Act, he signed it in ink, but it was written in blood. It was written in the blood of the people who crossed the Edmund Pettus Bridge, in the blood of the people who lived and died so that some of us could have these opportunities to serve in the Congress of the United States of America. That is where we were. We have progressed. We have more Members of Congress, but in a true sense, it is back to the future because we have seen the evisceration of section 4 of the Voting Rights Act, which emasculated section 5 of the Voting Rights Act, meaning you don't have any States or any territories under section 4 so you cannot preclear them under section 5. We are now back to a point wherein we have to find a way to revitalize and to reinstate section 4 of the Voting Rights Act. I am sorry that the time has run out, but I do want to say this: if we with only five Members of Congress could get a Voting Rights Act passed, one would think that with 48 we can get it reinstated. Mr. PAYNE. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I rise today, along with my colleagues of the Congressional Black Caucus, [[Page H692]] to recognize the lasting legacy of the Selma marches. 50 years ago, Dr. Martin Luther King, Stokely Carmichael, Congressman John Lewis, and a number of other fearless fighters, led the historic marches from Selma to Montgomery, Alabama in protest of discriminatory voting laws. In the years prior to the Selma marches, less than 1% of the black voting age population was registered to vote in Dallas County, where Selma is located. However, more than 80% of Dallas County blacks lived below the poverty line. Various efforts to get blacks in Dallas County registered to vote were met physical violence and economic intimidation. But with the local leadership of the Dallas County Voters League, and the help of two national organizations, the Southern Christian Leadership Conference and the Student Nonviolence Coordinating Committee, the Selma marches were born. During the first march from Selma to Montgomery, in what would become known as ``Bloody Sunday,'' the nation watched in horror as African Americans were brutally beaten by police officers, attacked by dogs, and sprayed by fire hoses. Their courage, in the face of dehumanizing treatment from law enforcement, thrust the issue of segregation and race relations in the Deep South into the national consciousness. It led to President Lyndon B. Johnson presenting to a joint session of Congress what would become the Voting Rights Act of 1965, the most important piece of civil rights legislation in the history of this country. 50 years later, the images of ``Bloody Sunday'' are permanently etched into our Nation's history as a deep and painful reminder of the struggles we triumphantly conquered to get to where we are today. And yet, the deaths of Michael Brown and Eric Garner, at the hands of law enforcement, serve as tragic reminders that we still have so far to go. The work of Selma is not finished. The work of Dr. King, Stokely Carmichael, and Congressman Lewis is not finished. But we must remain encouraged and faithful for the progress still left to achieve. While the discriminatory voting laws of the 1960s are no more, we have encountered a new brand of voter disenfranchisement in 2015 that poses a serious threat to the electoral process. And once again, the great citizens of this nation must fight to protect their constitutional right to vote. It is with the painful lessons learned from the marches on Selma, and with the same tenacity and fearlessness that we will continue to fight this battle today. ____________________",package_114_256.csv,42047,42047,42116,"[congressional record volume 161, number 17 (monday, february 2, 2015)] [house] [pages h687-h692] from the congressional record online through the government publishing office [ www.gpo.gov ] congressional black caucus the speaker pro tempore. under the speaker's announced policy of january 6, 2015, the gentleman from new jersey (mr. payne) is recognized for 60 minutes as the designee of the minority leader. general leave mr. payne. mr. speaker, i ask unanimous consent that all members be given 5 days to revise and extend their remarks. the speaker pro tempore. is there objection to the request of the gentleman from new jersey? there was no objection. mr. payne. mr. speaker, i want to begin by welcoming our new members and by thanking the gentlewoman from ohio, congresswoman marcia fudge, for her leadership of the congressional black caucus during the 113th congress. thanks to her dedication and tireless work, this caucus is better positioned to address the diverse challenges of the african american community. i also want to thank the new cbc chair, the honorable congressman g.k. butterfield of north carolina. i am confident that he will do a great job leading this caucus with steadfast commitment to justice and to building an america that works for everyone. let me also thank my counterpart, the honorable congresswoman robin kelly, for joining me in leading the cbc special orders this year. i am truly honored to take on this new role, and i look forward to working with her as we help carry out the critical mission of this caucus. mr. speaker, 50 years ago, in the midst of the civil rights movement, hundreds of brave men and women gathered in selma, alabama, to begin a long, arduous march to montgomery in support of the fundamental truth: that every american, regardless of what they look like, has the right to vote. {time} 1930 on march 7, 1965, 600 men and women set out from selma following the death of 26-year-old jimmie lee jackson, a deacon from marion, alabama, who died from gunshot wounds inflicted by a state trooper at a nonviolent demonstration. theirs was a peaceful, nonviolent march, but it was met with fierce brutality. it would take the marchers two more attempts to arrive at montgomery; but on march 25, after a 12-day journey, they did arrive. since that day, our country has made significant strides in achieving equality and justice for all, but significant challenges remain unmet. tonight, we will examine where we have come from, where we are, and where we would like to go as a society. we must be ready to go. in 1965, selma became the focal point of voter registration efforts in the south. at the time, only 2 percent of the city's eligible african american voters had been able to register. the impact of selma to the montgomery march was profound. as dr. king said, ``selma produced the voting rights legislation of 1965.'' the voting rights act of 1965 banned discriminatory voting requirements that disenfranchised african american voters throughout this country; yet, today, the dream of full equality is still something many african americans can only dream of. where we are, nearly 6 years after the end of the recession, people still struggle to find work, and the gap between the rich and poor continues to grow. for african americans, this situation is severe, given the disproportionate effect of unemployment on our communities. at the same time, there remains widespread poverty, a defining challenge of our time. this persistent economic inequality threatens to undercut the gains that african american communities have made, and it undermines the idea of economic mobility, the idea that if you work hard in this country and have ambition, you can get ahead. the economic crisis is not only facing african american communities. where we are in education, education is the most important economic investment we can make now and for future generations; yet, across the country, we still have seen cuts to education at all levels and attacks on critical programs like head start and pell grants. these attacks undermine the ability of african americans to get ahead--that is why i strongly support president obama's new, bold initiative for free access to community colleges--so, too, do efforts to dismantle social safety net programs which our communities depend on. those efforts are irresponsible, unjust, and contrary to who we are as americans. the congressional black caucus will make criminal justice reform a centerpiece of our agenda. we will work to reduce the epidemic of poverty in this country. we will work to create educational opportunities for african american children, and we will support efforts to strengthen our 105 historically black colleges and universities. the cbc also remains committed to fighting against efforts to dismantle the social safety net. we are determined to restore section 5 of the voting rights act and to make sure everyone, regardless of what they look like or where they come from, has equal access to the polls, and we resolve to ensure that increasing diversity in this nation is reflected in american corporations. together, these policies will bring us closer as a nation where we are empowering the communities of african americans, and they will benefit from the full equality and live the american dream. there is no doubt that we are in difficult times in this nation. injustices are widespread and threaten some of our most fundamental rights, but we will find no answers in apathy, no comfort in complacency. as we always have, we will continue the march for progress, for freedom, for justice, and for equality for all. mr. speaker, it is my honor and privilege now that i yield to the distinguished gentlewoman from illinois, ms. robin kelly. ms. kelly of illinois. thank you, my friend from new jersey. it is an honor to host with you this year. i am excited about the work ahead for the cbc in the 114th congress. i also want to acknowledge the great job that congressman horsford and congressman jeffries did in hosting the special order hour in the 113th congress. i also want to honor our past chair, congresswoman marcia fudge, for all of her great work. discussing 50 years from selma, where we were, where we are, and where we are headed, i expect this to be very stimulating, frustrating, and rewarding all at the same time. it remains that we have a lot of work to do. mr. payne. i thank the gentlewoman. mr. speaker, at this time, it is my honor and privilege for the first time in the 114th congress to have the chairman of the congressional black caucus, g.k. butterfield, address us, and i yield to the gentleman. mr. butterfield. i thank the gentleman for yielding. [[page h688]] the congressional black caucus is delighted to come to the floor this evening to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the 1965 voting rights act. at the end of slavery, mr. speaker, in 1865, which was 150 years ago, the state of north carolina had a slave population of 331,000 slaves. after the passage of the 13th amendment and ratification of it by 27 states, these slaves became free. they became american citizens, and males 21 years old or older would soon be entitled to vote. among those 331,000 slaves gaining freedom, 128,000 of them resided in my congressional district. in some of the counties, the black population exceeded the white population. in 1870, african american citizens gained the right to vote by the enactment of the 15th amendment. for the next 30 years, mr. speaker, african american men voted in large numbers and became a political force in state politics. four african americans were elected to congress in north carolina, eight in south carolina, three in alabama, and one each in georgia, florida, mississippi, virginia, and louisiana. many more were elected to state and local office. in 1900, after kkk violence and lynchings had not deterred black political participation, most southern states passed disfranchisement laws requiring a literacy test and the payment of a poll tax. these laws had the intent and effect of disenfranchising black people from voting, and it worked. for the next half century, african americans were effectively denied the right to vote with a few exceptions. following his 1964 acceptance of the nobel peace prize, dr. martin luther king, jr., approached president lyndon johnson about advocating for a strong voting rights law that would enforce the 15th amendment. president johnson was uncomfortable in advancing the idea of a voting rights law, which greatly disappointed dr. king. dr. king was motivated to launch the selma voting rights movement. on march 7, 1965, under the leadership of dr. king, john lewis, and others, black residents of selma attempted to march from brown chapel church to the alabama state capital to demand a voting rights law. as they approached the edmund pettus bridge, the marchers were brutalized, and they were terrorized by state police and forced to retreat. we now refer to this confrontation as ``bloody sunday.'' two days later, the marchers again began their journey to montgomery, but as they crossed the bridge and saw the strong police presence, they turned around and returned to the church. at this point, president johnson was outraged with governor george wallace for preventing the march. johnson telephoned wallace to demand that the marchers walk to montgomery without incident. three weeks later, on march 21, 1965, dr. king persuaded thousands of black and white to come to selma to participate in the march. the march proceeded without incident. fifty thousand participated. following the march, a white marcher, mrs. viola liuzzo from detroit, was murdered while transporting marchers back to selma. jimmie lee jackson was killed by police during a selma protest in february 1965. saddened by these murders, president johnson reconsidered his unwillingness to promote voting rights legislation. he went on national television on march 15 and announced that he would support a voting rights bill. despite the southern filibuster, the voting rights act was enacted into law on august 6, 1965. this important law has changed the political landscape for african american communities. it bans the use of literacy tests. it gives minority communities the right to litigate discriminatory election schemes that dilute their vote. the act provides for a section 5 that requires certain jurisdictions with discriminatory histories to preclear election law changes with the attorney general. to our great dismay, on june 25, 2013, the u.s. supreme court made section 5 unenforceable because the data used to determine covered jurisdictions is outdated, according to the supreme court. the supreme court has now called on congress to modify the formula. to this day, mr. speaker, our republican colleagues have refused to allow the bipartisan vra amendment bill to be voted upon. in fact, the chairman of the judiciary committee, mr. goodlatte, announced that he has no intention to legislate a modification to the formula, and so the effect of not having section 5 is to allow jurisdictions to pass discriminatory election laws with impunity and without oversight. the voting rights act has enabled african american communities to elect hundreds of black elected officials. we successfully litigated dozens and dozens of cases. many of my colleagues were elected because enforcement of the voting rights act forced--forced--states to draw congressional districts where black communities are not submerged and their vote diluted. mr. speaker, this story must be understood by every american citizen. the right to vote for african americans was obtained by blood, sweat, and tears; and we are determined--the congressional black caucus is determined--to continue this fight into 2016 and beyond. mr. payne, thank you very much for yielding time. mr. payne. thank you, mr. chairman. we are looking forward to your leadership in the 114th congress, and we will continue to strive to make sure that the issues that the cbc find important are relevant on the day-to-day basis. now, mr. speaker, i yield to the gentleman from south carolina (mr. clyburn), the leader, who has probably forgotten more about the goings- on and the rules in this chamber than i will ever know. mr. clyburn. thank you so much, mr. payne, for yielding me time. i appreciate your accolades, and i promise you that my long, distant memory is getting very good, but i assure you that your contributions to this great body are very much appreciated. mr. speaker, yesterday, i opened up black history month with a speech at cornerstone baptist church on wayne street in columbia, south carolina. they had an interesting topic for me to develop. it was all about remembering our past and preparing for the future. chairman butterfield has talked a little bit about the past that many of us remember, but 50 years after selma, we must turn to the question that martin luther king, jr., asked in one of his great books: where do we go from here, chaos or community? statistics show that there are nearly 500 counties and thousands of communities in the united states that are classified by the united states census bureau as persistent poverty areas. they are so defined because 20 percent of their populations have lived below the poverty level for the past 30 years or more. {time} 1945 they are diverse, including caucasian communities in states like west virginia, kentucky, and tennessee; native american communities in states like south dakota, alaska, and oklahoma; latino communities in states like arizona, new mexico, and texas; and african american communities in states like south carolina, alabama, and mississippi. they are urban communities in states like new york and heartland communities in states like missouri. 139 of these counties are represented in this body by democrats; 331 of these counties are represented in this body by republicans; and 18 of these counties are split between the two parties. combating persistent poverty should matter to all of us, regardless of party, geography, or race. in early 2009, when we were putting together the recovery act, i proposed language to require that at least 10 percent of funds in three rural development accounts be directed to efforts in these persistent- poverty counties. this requirement was enacted into law. in light of the definition of persistent-poverty counties as having at least 20 percent poverty rates over 30 years, the provision became known as the 10-20-30 initiative. this initiative bore dividends as economic development projects proliferated in persistent poverty communities across the country. using the 10-20-30 formula, the recovery act funded a total of 4,655 projects in persistent-poverty counties, totaling nearly $1.7 billion. i saw firsthand the positive effects of these projects in my district. [[page h689]] we were able to undertake projects to create jobs that would have otherwise languished. among those investments was a $5.8 million grant and a $2 million loan to construct 51 miles of water lines in the little community of brittons neck in marion county, south carolina. there are many other success stories. in lowndes county, mississippi, $17.5 million was spent to install a water line, elevated tank, and two wastewater pump stations, providing potable water to rural mississippians and creating badly needed construction jobs. the wellborn special utility district in brazos county, texas, received a $538,000 loan to construct more than 9 miles of new water distribution lines and connect over 60 households to a new water system. in 2011, i joined with our former republican colleague, representative jo ann emerson of missouri, to introduce an amendment to the continuing resolution that would have continued 10-20-30 for rural development and expanded it to 11 additional accounts throughout the federal government affecting economic development, education, job training, health, justice, the environment, and more. i want to make one thing clear about the 10-20-30 approach. it does not--i repeat, it does not--add one dime to the deficit. it simply targets resources from funds already authorized or appropriated. over the past 30 years, the national economy has risen and fallen multiple times. during each economic downturn, while we have been rightly focused on getting the economy as a whole back on track, we have not given adequate attention to these communities that are suffering from chronic distress and depression-era levels of joblessness. as a result, they have suffered even in good economic times. the 10- 20-30 approach would provide a mechanism to address this deprivation in times of want and in times of plenty, in times of federal investment and in times of fiscal austerity. last year, i wrote an essay on 10-20-30 which was published in the harvard journal on legislation. i discussed the history of our nation's efforts to address chronic poverty and more fully laid out the case for broadly implementing 10-20-30 in a bipartisan fashion. mr. speaker, as we begin to put our 2016 budget together, i look forward to working with all members in this body on both sides of the aisle irrespective of what state or county you may represent. i look forward to working together so that we can make a real productive legacy for selma and we can move forward and answer dr. king's question ``chaos or community?'' with a resounding: we are building communities. mr. payne. mr. speaker, i thank mr. clyburn. as in the past, the congressional black caucus will work to continue to reduce the epidemic of poverty in this country. when over 45 million americans live below the poverty line, we are failing as a nation. as congressman butterfield said earlier this month, the cbc will advocate the clyburn 10-20-30 plan, which redirects at least 10 percent of an agency's grants in its discretionary budget to communities where at least 20 percent of the population has lived below the poverty line for the past 30 years. these are the issues that we will continue to work on as members of the congressional black caucus. it is now my honor to yield to the gentleman from new york (mr. rangel), one of my mentors since before i arrived in congress, a former friend of my father's and a great colleague. mr. rangel. mr. speaker, i wish i had a prepared statement, but i was so moved after listening and being a part of this great congressional group in this great country to be able to celebrate 50 years since the voting rights act. as a kid who grew up on the streets of lenox avenue and dropped out of high school, i didn't have the benefit of having anything to attach a dream to that would allow me to believe that one day i could be sitting in the united states house of representatives. but after returning from the war in korea and after being the beneficiary of the gi bill, and after graduating from law school, i was able to see and hear atrocities that have been committed on black folks in this country the likes of which i had not seen except during wartime. and even though my mother's family came from virginia, in the city of new york even today i don't ever remember meeting any white people from the south. i don't know what that is. perhaps congressman butterfield may be able to do some historical research about why they stayed in the south and didn't come to new york city, where racism had a sugar coating to it. they didn't use dogs and bombs and things of that nature. but i recall so vividly seeing people like andy young and especially our dear friend and colleague, john lewis, be prepared to put their lives on the line for our country, not for themselves. in korea and in most wars, people fight to stay alive and they don't voluntarily put their life on the line, as john lewis and others have done. but what happened was, when they had the first selma march, what we refer to as bloody sunday, years before our beloved congresswoman was born, i saw something that really pained me as an american rather than as a human being. and then they had the second march from selma to montgomery and dr. king pulled that back, and then we had the plea for people from all over the country to come down for the third march. i recalled before, i had bad feet and wasn't thinking about going to selma to do 54 miles, but the inspiration to see people that had been prepared to put their life on the line for me and others like me could not allow me to return to new york. it is very interesting that i have to admit publicly that when i heard the voice of lyndon johnson coming across on radio and television saying, ``we shall overcome,'' i kind of thought, terri, that those were our words. and if a white person was to say it, i never expected to find that accent of the very people that sounded as though they were part of a conspiracy to keep children of slaves from assimilating into the constitutional beliefs that we had since learned to live by and enjoy and hope for. what an historic moment that was. what a revolutionary period that was, because as we review that and look at the picture ``selma,'' we wonder where did all of the people that represented this hatred go, the people who stood in the way of people registering voters; the people who took advantage of the idea that just because of their complexion they were superior; the people that belonged to the ku klux klan; the people who used religion as a sword instead of a shield? did they disappear? what happened to the so-called dixiecrats? but then i am reminded that as a result of the voting rights act and the civil rights act that they didn't go very far, that they threw down their party label but they stayed in the same places, and many of them are doing the same thing--trying to continue to prevent people of color from enjoying their full constitutional voting rights. then when i was honored enough to come down here in 1971 with half a dozen congressional black caucus members, nine, who joined with four of us who had decided to form the congressional black caucus, you could not believe, congressman payne, how it was never our dream that that small group would go from 13 to 26 to 40 to 46 to 47, and reach the historic impact on our policy and on our nation, a group that had no intention of doing anything except to introduce, create, and support policies that could make this great country even stronger for all of us. and true, we have a lot of obstacles to overcome, but i don't think any group of people have been as successful as we have in coming from the pits of slavery in such a short period of time as we are now, and to see how much more work we have to do so that one day our children and our grandchildren will say: why did they have to have a congressional black caucus? why wasn't it just a democratic caucus? why did we need it? {time} 2000 well, because of the intellect, the commitment of individual members of the black caucus, like the rest of the congress, that come from all walks of life and they got here to make this a better country, a more effective congress, soon and very soon, we may hear those words: why were we needed? [[page h690]] until we accomplish these lofty goals, thank god that we have had it. i think that the democrats appreciate the work that we are trying to do, and one day, as so many people who got rid of their sheets, their children and their grandchildren would see that we only were trying to eliminate the pain for all people, regardless of color, to make the red, white, and blue, rather than just whether you are black or white, become the theme that the fathers of this constitution should have been striving for. there is no question in my mind that the things we stand for really and what the country is committed to do, and i am so proud of these last couple of years, that there is not a group of people i would rather spend my time with than with my friends and my colleagues in the congressional black caucus. mr. payne. i thank the gentleman from new york. his kind thoughts and perspective is always, always needed in this house. now, i have the honor and the privilege of yielding to the gentlewoman from alabama (ms. sewell), who represents the city, the town, that is on everybody's breath over the last couple of months. ms. sewell of alabama. mr. speaker, i applaud the cbc for this special order hour, and i commend my colleague from new jersey (mr. payne) and my colleague from illinois (ms. kelly) for choosing such a great topic for tonight's special order hour. selma, lord, selma. i have the great pleasure of standing before you not only as a representative who represents the great city of selma but as a native of selma, alabama, and a lifelong member of the historic brown chapel ame church. i know that the journey i now take, the journey that many others who are here today take, was only made possible because of the courage, fortitude, and determination of those brave men and women on that bridge, bloody sunday, march 7, 1965. we who have the privilege and honor of taking this journey must ask ourselves: what will we do to extend the legacy? what will we do to protect the legacy? selma is the soul of america. it is the place where the struggle for civil rights and voting rights began, the epicenter, if you will, of the voting rights movement. it deserves to be more than just a footnote in the history books. it deserves to take up chapters in the history books, the tactical and strategic voices of martin luther king and those brave men and women of sclc and sncc that had the fortitude and had the intellect to see this as a strategy, to know that they were speaking not only for themselves and their children, but for future generations. only a true visionary could defeat such opposition with little more than a dream, and dr. king held so tightly to his that it forced our country to become a more equal and just nation. some want to forget the painful past. i know many in my district and many in my city would like to forget our painful past, but we cannot turn the pages as if certain chapters were never written; nor can we celebrate how far we have come without first acknowledging where we have been. bloody sunday forced america to confront its own inhumanity. our painful past has ushered in a new day. as i tell my constituents, out of our painful past came the birth of a movement that changed a nation, and from that movement came a human rights movement that changed a world. if we don't write our own history, others will tell it for us, and they may not be so kind, they may not tell our history the way we would tell our history. my father grew up in selma, as did i, and the selma of my childhood was very, very different than the selma of my father's childhood. there has been progress. my father went to segregated schools in selma. my father drank from ``colored only'' fountains in selma. my father's mother never got the chance to vote, though she tried to register several times. the selma that i grew up in had an integrated public high school, a public high school that was 55 percent african american and 45 percent white. yes, across town, there was an all-white private school. i want you to know that the selma i grew up in, in the seventies and eighties, it produced me as its first black valedictorian of selma high school. i know that selma and the journey that we all take now because of selma was only made possible because of the bravery of others. as i stood to give my speech as a valedictorian in 1982 at selma high school, i remember standing up and saying: maybe one day i could join the likes of a charlie rangel, of a john lewis, in the house of congress. i said it as a pious, overly confident teenager probably, but i said it with every vigor because i believed in my heart that i could be and do anything. why? because the people of that community nurtured me, black and white, my teachers, my girl scout troop leaders, my sunday school teachers. yes, i had proud parents who were educators, educated at alabama state university, and because of their education at this wonderful quality institution of higher learning, i had a chance to go to princeton--but i had more than that. i had an obligation to give back, to make sure that others had an opportunity to walk through those same doors. it wasn't enough to be the first. in fact, i was most proud 5 years after i graduated from princeton that april williams from selma high school got to go to princeton. i must have done something right. the voting rights act of 1965 would have never been possible had it not been for the intellect, the mind of these wonderful leaders, some known. all of us know about the contributions of our colleague, john lewis; all of us know about the contributions of the sclc, andy young, and martin luther king. some unknown, like my sixth grade teacher, mrs. richie jean jackson, she was featured in the movie ``selma'' because it was her home, the home that she shared with dr. jackson, the first black dentist in selma, that housed martin luther king and andrew young and all those leaders every time they came to selma because they couldn't stay at the all-white hotel. mrs. jackson was my sixth grade teacher. mrs. jackson did not live to see the movie ``selma,'' but i am proud that this body is seeking to provide a congressional gold medal to the foot soldiers of the movement, so that the richie jacksons, mrs. jacksons of the world, who had the bravery to go and be on that bridge bloody sunday or turnaround tuesday or the ultimate final march from selma to montgomery, that they are acknowledged by this nation for the sacrifices that they made. in closing, i want to remind my colleagues of my guest at the state of the union, january 20, 2015. my special guest was the 103-year-old amelia boynton. amelia boynton was characterized in the movie ``selma'' as the proud african american woman who told coretta scott king: you are prepared. you are the descendants of kings and queens. your heritage is one and your bloodline is one that survived slave ships. you are prepared. amelia boynton is known for her bravery that bloody sunday when she was bludgeoned, but she came back 2 days later on turnaround tuesday and continued to fight in selma long after this march from selma to montgomery. she honored us with her presence, and as person after person came up to her and kissed her on the cheek and said, ``miss boynton, i stand on your shoulders today, thank you,'' miss boynton said something very poignant. she said, ``everybody keeps talking about being on my shoulders. i tell them, get off my shoulders, do your own work, there is plenty of work to be done.'' i want to remind my colleagues that there is plenty of work for us still to do. i want to honor the legacy of amelia boynton, f.d. reese, john lewis, and so many; but we cannot honor their legacy without acknowledging that the voting rights act of 1965, major sections of it, have been invalidated. we owe it to that legacy, the legacy and memory of those who fought so valiantly, that this body should once again work together to make sure that federal protections are there because, as we know, progress is always elusive, all battles become new again, and there is a renewed assault on voting. [[page h691]] it may not be counting how many jelly beans are in a jar or how many county judges there are in the state of alabama; but, nevertheless, we still have modern-day barriers to voting that we must overcome. i hope that we have the courage of our own convictions to see the movie ``selma'' as a beginning of a national conversation about how we can continue to recommit ourselves to the ideals that were fought on that bloody sunday. i know that if we combined our hearts and our minds, both sides of the aisle will see that it is in everyone's best interest that all americans have the right to vote. i thank my colleagues of the cbc for having this special order hour. i invite all of my colleagues from both sides of the aisle to come to selma, to experience the living history, and i hope that we will all come away from the 50th commemoration of the march from selma to montgomery with a renewed vigor to once again provide federal protection for all americans to exercise that sacred right to vote. mr. payne. thank you. mr. speaker, i yield to the gentlewoman from texas (ms. jackson lee). {time} 2015 ms. jackson lee. mr. speaker, this is a very important evening. i thank my colleagues, both mr. payne of new jersey and ms. kelly, for, first of all, taking up a very important challenge of being able to lead the members of the congressional black caucus through this period of challenge to america. i am reflective of the number of members who have had the chance to convey their thoughts, and each one i thank personally: our chairman, mr. g.k. butterfield, for his leadership and his internal knowledge from his walk in life of the civil rights journey; mr. clyburn for living and understanding the civil rights journey and conveying it in his legislative journey; mr. rangel for his service to this nation as a korean war vet and then coming home to be a vet of the civil rights effort; then, of course, the holder of the seat who represents selma for her life story. today, i rise to ask the question, what is our moral standard? and, following the words of dr. martin luther king, why we can't wait. this is a clarion call to my colleagues--democrats and republicans-- that, in fact, this year--of all years--calls for us to act. it calls for us to be able to understand why the nation cannot wait and who is going to lift up the moral standard. the walk from selma to montgomery turned into bloody sunday. it was where a young man by the name of john lewis stood bravely alongside names like hosea williams. it was, of course, a place where the world watched, and it became the stair steps on which the voting rights act was passed. today, we realize that, on the shoulders of that tragic time, violence claimed the life of jimmie lee jackson, beaten by state troopers as he was attempting to protect his mother and others, and that violence claimed the lives of reverend james reeb of boston and of viola liuzzo of detroit at that time as she returned from the selma march--a time when 25,000 strong or more marched across the montgomery bridge. we understand that our job is yet not done. in the wake of the decision by the supreme court that crippled the voting rights act, we as members of the judiciary committee, led by our colleagues mr. clyburn and john conyers, sought to correct that crippling. today, i stand and ask my chairman and the speaker of the house to have us put that fix with the new members, our republicans and democrats--the same body of individuals who president johnson convened--to be able to ensure that that voting rights act of 1965 could be done. it is important to note that we not allow the efforts to go unnoted. mr. speaker, the voter id law in texas needs to be corrected by passing the voting rights amendment act. the terrible oppression of individuals in their walks to the polls has to be corrected by this amendment. of course, we must ensure against the horrors of wealth inequality. the median income of black households is $33,764--a mere 60 percent of the median income for white households. then, of course, we must move to criminal justice reform. i am privileged, mr. speaker, to serve as the ranking member on the crime subcommittee, and i join my colleagues in the commitment to ensure that we, in fact, answer the call of the mothers of so many, such as those of trayvon martin, sean bell, eric garner, michael brown, bobby tolan, jordan baker, and many others, that we have grand jury reform, special prosecutor reform, prison reform--the transitioning of nonviolent offenders to productive lives--law enforcement training and best practices. yes, the bill that i introduced, the build trust act, will not give incentives to towns that rely upon racial profiling and on stopping african americans and other minorities to build their revenue. mr. speaker, tonight, i have the opportunity to remind us that our walk is not done in wealth inequality, in criminal justice reform and, as i know that my colleague mr. green will mention, in the body cameras. all of these--closing the wealth gap and passing the voting rights act--are challenges not to democrats, not to minorities; they are to the nation, to our republicans and our democrats. so i answer the question why we cannot wait: because dr. king left us a prophetic message and a mountain to climb to get to the promised land. tonight, as i close, i call upon all aspects of the beloved community that john lewis so often speaks of--the youth who continue to persist in the streets of america, indicating that black lives and all lives matter; women, the impoverished, the faith community, workers, and many others whose names i have left out. today, i ask for them to join hands and march in the month of march in your own cities and hamlets and counties on an agenda of healing, justice, and equality in commemoration of the march of those who crossed on that bloody day but of those who crossed as well successfully from selma to montgomery. do not sit in your seats. do not sit in your homes. march in the month of march. let me hear your voices. let us see you. let us join you. you call us, and we will join you in those marches to make a difference in this nation. i ask for that to all of my colleagues tonight. mr. payne. thank you. i yield to the gentleman from texas (mr. al green). mr. al green of texas. thank you, mr. payne. mr. speaker, because time is of the essence, please allow me to get right to my message. where were we in 1965? i will relate this to congress. in 1965, when they crossed the edmund pettus bridge, there were five african american members of congress. now there are 48. in 1965, there were four latino members of congress. now there are 38. there were three asian americans in congress. now we have a total of 14. there were 14 women in congress. we now have 104. where were we? we were at a point in our history when it was turning for us, but it was a bloody point in our history because, when president johnson signed the voting rights act, he signed it in ink, but it was written in blood. it was written in the blood of the people who crossed the edmund pettus bridge, in the blood of the people who lived and died so that some of us could have these opportunities to serve in the congress of the united states of america. that is where we were. we have progressed. we have more members of congress, but in a true sense, it is back to the future because we have seen the evisceration of section 4 of the voting rights act, which emasculated section 5 of the voting rights act, meaning you don't have any states or any territories under section 4 so you cannot preclear them under section 5. we are now back to a point wherein we have to find a way to revitalize and to reinstate section 4 of the voting rights act. i am sorry that the time has run out, but i do want to say this: if we with only five members of congress could get a voting rights act passed, one would think that with 48 we can get it reinstated. mr. payne. mr. speaker, i yield back the balance of my time. ms. eddie bernice johnson of texas. mr. speaker, i rise today, along with my colleagues of the congressional black caucus, [[page h692]] to recognize the lasting legacy of the selma marches. 50 years ago, dr. martin luther king, stokely carmichael, congressman john lewis, and a number of other fearless fighters, led the historic marches from selma to montgomery, alabama in protest of discriminatory voting laws. in the years prior to the selma marches, less than 1% of the black voting age population was registered to vote in dallas county, where selma is located. however, more than 80% of dallas county blacks lived below the poverty line. various efforts to get blacks in dallas county registered to vote were met physical violence and economic intimidation. but with the local leadership of the dallas county voters league, and the help of two national organizations, the southern christian leadership conference and the student nonviolence coordinating committee, the selma marches were born. during the first march from selma to montgomery, in what would become known as ``bloody sunday,'' the nation watched in horror as african americans were brutally beaten by police officers, attacked by dogs, and sprayed by fire hoses. their courage, in the face of dehumanizing treatment from law enforcement, thrust the issue of segregation and race relations in the deep south into the national consciousness. it led to president lyndon b. johnson presenting to a joint session of congress what would become the voting rights act of 1965, the most important piece of civil rights legislation in the history of this country. 50 years later, the images of ``bloody sunday'' are permanently etched into our nation's history as a deep and painful reminder of the struggles we triumphantly conquered to get to where we are today. and yet, the deaths of michael brown and eric garner, at the hands of law enforcement, serve as tragic reminders that we still have so far to go. the work of selma is not finished. the work of dr. king, stokely carmichael, and congressman lewis is not finished. but we must remain encouraged and faithful for the progress still left to achieve. while the discriminatory voting laws of the 1960s are no more, we have encountered a new brand of voter disenfranchisement in 2015 that poses a serious threat to the electoral process. and once again, the great citizens of this nation must fight to protect their constitutional right to vote. it is with the painful lessons learned from the marches on selma, and with the same tenacity and fearlessness that we will continue to fight this battle today. ____________________",42047
CREC-2015-02-02-pt1-PgH692,CREC-2015-02-02,114,SELMA TO MONTGOMERY VOTING RIGHTS MARCH,"[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 17 (Monday, February 2, 2015)] [House] [Pages H692-H694] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] SELMA TO MONTGOMERY VOTING RIGHTS MARCH The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. MacArthur). Under the Speaker's announced policy of January 6, 2015, the Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Ohio (Mrs. Beatty) for 30 minutes. Mrs. BEATTY. Mr. Speaker, I would like to join my other colleagues tonight to thank Congresswoman Kelly from Illinois and Congressman Payne from New Jersey for organizing tonight's Congressional Black Caucus Special Order hour. I rise to highlight a pivotal moment in America's history--the Selma voting rights march--that 50 years ago, Mr. Speaker, brought together Americans to march from Selma to Montgomery, Alabama, across the now famous Edmund Pettus Bridge. There were attacks and dogs, beatings and deaths, but still we marched because we as a country knew that all Americans should have the same rights. The 54-mile walk was an effort to demonstrate the desire of Black American citizens to exercise their constitutional right to vote and to be treated equally. Mr. Speaker, although the Civil Rights Act of 1964 legally desegregated the South, discrimination and segregation remained throughout much of the United States. The march led to the passage of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, which, today, continues to be eroded in a threatened bill. The communities across our Nation certainly have threats to their basic rights, and there are certainly injustices. In the words of Dr. Martin Luther King--and they still ring true today when I think about his words--``injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere.'' When I reflect on my recent trip to Ferguson-- where I witnessed firsthand--it seems that we are still reengaging in our unfortunate history and ongoing challenges with voting rights, voter registration, and injustices--and with new vitality and vigor. Mr. Speaker, I will stand with my colleagues--those who are here, along with Congressman John Lewis and Congresswoman Terri Sewell--when we march across that bridge and when we say that we must turn our march toward solutions. If we, Democrats and Republicans, can watch a movie together about Selma, sharing silent moments in tears, sharing stories of our own experiences, surely we can come together to fix voting rights. How long must we wait, Mr. Speaker? How long will it take? Let me end with these words: it is on all of us here in this body to march for voting rights and to march for having voting rights. Mr. Speaker, I yield to my colleague, Congresswoman Robin Kelly. Ms. KELLY of Illinois. I would like to thank the gentlewoman from Ohio for her important remarks. As we come to a close, I thank the distinguished gentleman from the Garden State--my good friend, Representative Donald Payne--for his tremendous leadership and for leading this Congressional Black Caucus Special Order hour. Mr. Speaker, in our hour of power, we have had the opportunity to speak directly to the American people. This is a privilege that I take seriously and a responsibility that the CBC cherishes. Tonight, we strengthen our future by embracing our past. 2015 represents a critical junction in the advancement of our Nation. Fifty years after the Selma to Montgomery march there are strengthened civil rights and improved access to the ballot. Today, we find ourselves with equally important ground to cover in promoting civil rights, in reducing economic and health disparities, and in strengthening voter rights protection. As a legislative body, we have made progress, but as Representatives and as men and women who love this country, our work continues. As we look back, we are comforted by the bridges we have crossed, by the trails we have blazed, and by the future ahead of us that we envision. I want to thank the entire Congressional Black Caucus, especially my fellow coanchor, the gentleman from New Jersey, Congressman Payne. {time} 2030 Fifty years after Selma, the CBC remembers that it exists to promote the public welfare through legislation that meets the needs of millions of neglected citizens. It is that spirit that guides us and many others in Congress. When we see millions of men, women, and children who need help moving forward, we march. When we see obstruction in our path to creating a more perfect Union, we respond. Again, I thank my colleagues. Mrs. BEATTY. Mr. Speaker, at this time I would like to allow my colleague, Congresswoman Yvette Clarke from Brooklyn, who is also the vice president of the Congressional Black Caucus, to share her thoughts with us. (Ms. CLARKE of New York asked and was given permission to revise and extend her remarks.) Ms. CLARKE of New York. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlelady from Ohio (Mrs. Beatty) for extending this time to me, and I want to also thank the gentlelady from Illinois (Ms. Kelly) and the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Payne). Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my colleagues in the Congressional Black Caucus for hosting this evening's Special Order and this extension this evening. Today I proudly rise to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the historic events of the nonviolent protests that took place in Selma, Alabama, and to recognize their importance in igniting and fueling the civil rights movement that brought an end to the practice of Jim Crow racial segregation by law in America and voting rights legislation that guaranteed every American citizen the right to vote. It is a privilege to represent the Ninth District of New York in offering tribute to the historic people of conscience that walked the Edmund Pettus Bridge on March 7, 1965, known as Bloody Sunday. The march from Selma to Montgomery in 1965 included more than 600 women and men who walked from the historic Brown Chapel AME Church to the State capital of Alabama. They marched for the right to vote, the freedom and human dignity that had been denied to them. They marched to end the evil practice of segregation and the violent terrorism to which they were subjected on an everyday basis, to remove from our society [[Page H693]] the poison of racism and racial discrimination. However, at the Edmund Pettus Bridge this peaceful protest was met with tear gas, police batons, police dogs, and hatred and violence. Images of this tragedy were broadcast across America, opening the eyes of millions of citizens to the brutality and injustices that African American communities, especially in the South, had experienced every day. Five months after Bloody Sunday, the Voting Rights Act of 1965 was signed into law on August 6, 1965, by President Lyndon B. Johnson, prohibiting racial discrimination in voting. I was 9 months at that time. Sadly, the right to vote remains under threat in the United States. Just imagine, five decades later, the disparate treatment and discrimination, the trampling of the civil rights and civil liberties of vulnerable communities of color, black and Hispanic, Latino Americans, continues to be a blood-soaked stain on the Star-Spangled Banner in the minds of many Americans. In June 2013, the Supreme Court ruled that section 4(b) of the Voting Rights Act was unconstitutional, effectively undermining our ability to protect the right to vote and ensure unfettered access to the ballot. We, the members of the CBC, will not stand silent and allow the partisanship in this House to reverse these gains made through the bloodshed and the lives martyred to erase from the law books those rights for which many fought and died. Mr. Speaker, while we have made great progress since 1965, it is all relative. As long as systemic racism remains in the hearts and minds of some Americans, there is still much work to be done so that the blood, sweat, and tears shed for the freedom and justice in 1965 and every day since will not have been in vain. The courage it took for our colleague Representative John Lewis and the countless and nameless Americans to face an angry State-sponsored mob so that we can all enjoy the freedoms of our country must never be forgotten. We must remain vigilant and continuously fight for equal rights for all people, regardless of race, gender, sexual orientation, or social background. Until then, Mr. Speaker, the struggle continues. Mrs. BEATTY. Mr. Speaker, as we talk about the struggle continuing, it is my honor to ask my colleague and classmate, Congressman Marc Veasey from Texas, to be our next presenter. Mr. VEASEY. Mr. Speaker, I thank Congresswoman Beatty for yielding. I would also like to thank my colleagues Donald Payne and Robin Kelly for putting together something that we really need to talk about, and I am glad that the theme here is 50 years from Selma, where we are, where we are headed, because I think it is important that we have that discussion. I oftentimes hear people say in conjunction when you talk about civil rights, you know, we need to move on, we need to get over it, it was the past, it happened a long time ago. But we know that we can learn a lot from the past. We know that we can learn a lot about where we are going by studying our history. So I am really glad that during this Black History Month that just started in February that we are able to reconnect and take the opportunity to talk more about our community's past and the challenges that we face, and Selma really provides us with a great vehicle to do that. I think about an event that I attended several years ago when I was in the State legislature, and I was talking to the audience and mentioning some of the schools in the Fort Worth Independent School District and around the State of Texas that were segregated. After I got done talking, I was really dismayed that one of the reporters came up to me that was younger than me but had graduated from school in Fort Worth ISD, had graduated 9 years after I did, and she said: I was raised in Fort Worth, and I graduated from a school in Fort Worth, but I didn't know that the schools were ever segregated here. You see how quickly it is that the history can disappear and fade away if it is not kept alive; and I think that that is one of the reasons why I am really excited about Selma and the opportunity to talk about this more, because we really do need to make sure that we keep our youth reconnected with the past or we know that it will fade away. Then, also, when you start talking about where we are headed, and it has been mentioned tonight, I would like to say that we are headed to someplace more positive, someplace that is for the betterment of all Americans. But we know that there are many mechanisms out there that are being designed and implemented by State legislatures all around the country to impede one's right to vote. You can look no further than the State that I am very proud of, my own State of Texas, but we have some serious issues. I mean, when you look at redistricting in the State of Texas, when you look at the voter ID laws that were passed in the State of Texas, I mean, right now in the State of Texas you cannot vote with a State-issued ID, but you can vote with a concealed handgun license. It is just rules like that that are being implemented and put in place that we know are designed to be a barrier to people voting, the same types of barriers that were put in place, maybe a little bit differently, maybe with a smile on their face, but we know that the goal is to do exactly what was done in Selma 50 years ago, and it is to prevent people from voting. So, again, I want to thank the Congresswoman from Ohio and I want to thank my colleagues from Illinois and from New Jersey for putting this together. We need to talk about history. It is not the past. It really is still the present, something similar to what Faulkner said. We need to continue to have these discussions and share these stories with our young people, but I think more importantly that we need to put them in the perspective from today because many of these battles we know that we are still fighting. So I am glad that I am able to share this with everyone, and I hope that all Members, regardless of where they are from, regardless of what their party is, that they can think about what happened 50 years ago when the walk across the Edmund Pettus Bridge happened, and this is something we can all learn from. I want to thank Mrs. Beatty for allowing me to have a few words. Mrs. BEATTY. Thank you so much to my colleague. Mr. Speaker, at this time it gives me great pleasure to ask Congresswoman Bonnie Watson Coleman--I am very proud to say that she is a part of this 114th freshman class--to say a few words. (Mrs. WATSON COLEMAN asked and was given permission to revise and extend her remarks.) Mrs. WATSON COLEMAN. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the gentlelady from Ohio for yielding to me. I want to thank both the gentlelady from Illinois and the gentleman from New Jersey for providing this opportunity here to speak tonight on something that I think is very important. As a member of the CBC, a very proud member, I am here because we rise to commemorate a slice of American history that speaks to the spirit that is America. We rise to acknowledge the sacrifice and the forethought of a generation whose risks were ultimately America's reward. We rise to recognize the American heroes and sheroes of Selma on the 50th anniversary of this Bloody Sunday. From Selma, we learned that sometimes protests and objections that are deemed un-American today may later be considered the greatest manifestation of American democracy. From Selma, we learned that because of a young person's protests today, he may be called an outside agitator, a troublemaker, or even a provocateur, but that same young person, because of that same activity, may later be called courageous, a hero, or even a Congressman. Yes, from Selma, we learned that ordinary people can do extraordinary things when they are on the side of righteousness. Selma taught us, as Dr. King suggested, that it is always the right time to do what is right. But at the time of that fight, the likelihood that this generation of young dreamers would be successful in transforming an entire society seemed slim. They persevered anyhow. In the [[Page H694]] face of seemingly insurmountable odds, these young people fought for what was right no matter the consequence. Today we must learn from their example; we must persevere in the fight for working families, despite those that believe that there should be no floor for the poor and no ceiling for the rich. We must protect the precious right to vote for all people. We must persevere despite the fact that there is little reward for fighting for people who cannot fight for themselves, and we must fight for what is right and not what is popular. We must remember that it is our legacy to fight on the side of righteousness when we debate giving access to health care, access to education, access to the right to marry, and access to just plain old justice. I look forward to this collective will and this collective commitment of the CBC because I know that we can never forget Selma. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlelady from Ohio. Mrs. BEATTY. Mr. Speaker, in closing remarks, let me thank you for extending our time tonight. We have heard from voices of legends tonight. But tonight I would like to end by giving special recognition to two new voices, two new legends who tonight led us through something more than a Special Order hour. They led us through a Special Order hour in history. To Congressman Donald Payne of New Jersey, thank you for picking this topic and partnering with my colleague and friend, Congresswoman Robin Kelly. Mr. Speaker, tonight they are our voices of the future. Tonight they had the courage to come and manage time on an issue that we think, as members not only of the Congressional Black Caucus, but of this Congress, being the conscience of this Congress. {time} 2045 Hopefully, it will make a difference in this Chamber as we proceed forward. Thank you again, Congressman Payne and Congresswoman Kelly. You are our voices. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 17 (Monday, February 2, 2015)] [House] [Pages H692-H694] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] SELMA TO MONTGOMERY VOTING RIGHTS MARCH The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. MacArthur).

They marched to end the evil practice of segregation and the violent terrorism to which they were subjected on an everyday basis, to remove from our society [[Page H693]] the poison of racism and racial discrimination. However, at the Edmund Pettus Bridge this peaceful protest was met with tear gas, police batons, police dogs, and hatred and violence. Images of this tragedy were broadcast across America, opening the eyes of millions of citizens to the brutality and injustices that African American communities, especially in the South, had experienced every day. Five months after Bloody Sunday, the Voting Rights Act of 1965 was signed into law on August 6, 1965, by President Lyndon B. Johnson, prohibiting racial discrimination in voting. I was 9 months at that time. Sadly, the right to vote remains under threat in the United States. Just imagine, five decades later, the disparate treatment and discrimination, the trampling of the civil rights and civil liberties of vulnerable communities of color, black and Hispanic, Latino Americans, continues to be a blood-soaked stain on the Star-Spangled Banner in the minds of many Americans. In June 2013, the Supreme Court ruled that section 4(b) of the Voting Rights Act was unconstitutional, effectively undermining our ability to protect the right to vote and ensure unfettered access to the ballot. We, the members of the CBC, will not stand silent and allow the partisanship in this House to reverse these gains made through the bloodshed and the lives martyred to erase from the law books those rights for which many fought and died. Mr. Speaker, while we have made great progress since 1965, it is all relative. As long as systemic racism remains in the hearts and minds of some Americans, there is still much work to be done so that the blood, sweat, and tears shed for the freedom and justice in 1965 and every day since will not have been in vain. The courage it took for our colleague Representative John Lewis and the countless and nameless Americans to face an angry State-sponsored mob so that we can all enjoy the freedoms of our country must never be forgotten. We must remain vigilant and continuously fight for equal rights for all people, regardless of race, gender, sexual orientation, or social background. Until then, Mr. Speaker, the struggle continues. Mrs. BEATTY. Mr. Speaker, as we talk about the struggle continuing, it is my honor to ask my colleague and classmate, Congressman Marc Veasey from Texas, to be our next presenter. Mr. VEASEY. Mr. Speaker, I thank Congresswoman Beatty for yielding. I would also like to thank my colleagues Donald Payne and Robin Kelly for putting together something that we really need to talk about, and I am glad that the theme here is 50 years from Selma, where we are, where we are headed, because I think it is important that we have that discussion. I oftentimes hear people say in conjunction when you talk about civil rights, you know, we need to move on, we need to get over it, it was the past, it happened a long time ago. But we know that we can learn a lot from the past. We know that we can learn a lot about where we are going by studying our history. So I am really glad that during this Black History Month that just started in February that we are able to reconnect and take the opportunity to talk more about our community's past and the challenges that we face, and Selma really provides us with a great vehicle to do that. I think about an event that I attended several years ago when I was in the State legislature, and I was talking to the audience and mentioning some of the schools in the Fort Worth Independent School District and around the State of Texas that were segregated. After I got done talking, I was really dismayed that one of the reporters came up to me that was younger than me but had graduated from school in Fort Worth ISD, had graduated 9 years after I did, and she said: I was raised in Fort Worth, and I graduated from a school in Fort Worth, but I didn't know that the schools were ever segregated here. You see how quickly it is that the history can disappear and fade away if it is not kept alive; and I think that that is one of the reasons why I am really excited about Selma and the opportunity to talk about this more, because we really do need to make sure that we keep our youth reconnected with the past or we know that it will fade away. Then, also, when you start talking about where we are headed, and it has been mentioned tonight, I would like to say that we are headed to someplace more positive, someplace that is for the betterment of all Americans. But we know that there are many mechanisms out there that are being designed and implemented by State legislatures all around the country to impede one's right to vote. You can look no further than the State that I am very proud of, my own State of Texas, but we have some serious issues. I mean, when you look at redistricting in the State of Texas, when you look at the voter ID laws that were passed in the State of Texas, I mean, right now in the State of Texas you cannot vote with a State-issued ID, but you can vote with a concealed handgun license. It is just rules like that that are being implemented and put in place that we know are designed to be a barrier to people voting, the same types of barriers that were put in place, maybe a little bit differently, maybe with a smile on their face, but we know that the goal is to do exactly what was done in Selma 50 years ago, and it is to prevent people from voting. So, again, I want to thank the Congresswoman from Ohio and I want to thank my colleagues from Illinois and from New Jersey for putting this together. We need to talk about history. It is not the past. It really is still the present, something similar to what Faulkner said. We need to continue to have these discussions and share these stories with our young people, but I think more importantly that we need to put them in the perspective from today because many of these battles we know that we are still fighting. So I am glad that I am able to share this with everyone, and I hope that all Members, regardless of where they are from, regardless of what their party is, that they can think about what happened 50 years ago when the walk across the Edmund Pettus Bridge happened, and this is something we can all learn from. I want to thank Mrs. Beatty for allowing me to have a few words. Mrs. BEATTY. Thank you so much to my colleague. Mr. Speaker, at this time it gives me great pleasure to ask Congresswoman Bonnie Watson Coleman--I am very proud to say that she is a part of this 114th freshman class--to say a few words. (Mrs. WATSON COLEMAN asked and was given permission to revise and extend her remarks.) Mrs. WATSON COLEMAN. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the gentlelady from Ohio for yielding to me. I want to thank both the gentlelady from Illinois and the gentleman from New Jersey for providing this opportunity here to speak tonight on something that I think is very important. As a member of the CBC, a very proud member, I am here because we rise to commemorate a slice of American history that speaks to the spirit that is America. We rise to acknowledge the sacrifice and the forethought of a generation whose risks were ultimately America's reward. We rise to recognize the American heroes and sheroes of Selma on the 50th anniversary of this Bloody Sunday. From Selma, we learned that sometimes protests and objections that are deemed un-American today may later be considered the greatest manifestation of American democracy. From Selma, we learned that because of a young person's protests today, he may be called an outside agitator, a troublemaker, or even a provocateur, but that same young person, because of that same activity, may later be called courageous, a hero, or even a Congressman. Yes, from Selma, we learned that ordinary people can do extraordinary things when they are on the side of righteousness. Selma taught us, as Dr. King suggested, that it is always the right time to do what is right. But at the time of that fight, the likelihood that this generation of young dreamers would be successful in transforming an entire society seemed slim. They persevered anyhow. In the [[Page H694]] face of seemingly insurmountable odds, these young people fought for what was right no matter the consequence. Today we must learn from their example; we must persevere in the fight for working families, despite those that believe that there should be no floor for the poor and no ceiling for the rich. We must protect the precious right to vote for all people. We must persevere despite the fact that there is little reward for fighting for people who cannot fight for themselves, and we must fight for what is right and not what is popular. We must remember that it is our legacy to fight on the side of righteousness when we debate giving access to health care, access to education, access to the right to marry, and access to just plain old justice. I look forward to this collective will and this collective commitment of the CBC because I know that we can never forget Selma. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlelady from Ohio. Mrs. BEATTY. Mr. Speaker, in closing remarks, let me thank you for extending our time tonight. We have heard from voices of legends tonight. But tonight I would like to end by giving special recognition to two new voices, two new legends who tonight led us through something more than a Special Order hour. They led us through a Special Order hour in history. To Congressman Donald Payne of New Jersey, thank you for picking this topic and partnering with my colleague and friend, Congresswoman Robin Kelly. Mr. Speaker, tonight they are our voices of the future. Tonight they had the courage to come and manage time on an issue that we think, as members not only of the Congressional Black Caucus, but of this Congress, being the conscience of this Congress. {time} 2045 Hopefully, it will make a difference in this Chamber as we proceed forward. Thank you again, Congressman Payne and Congresswoman Kelly. You are our voices. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. ____________________","Congressional Record, Volume 161 Issue 17 (Monday, February 2, 2015) [Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 17 (Monday, February 2, 2015)] [House] [Pages H692-H694] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] SELMA TO MONTGOMERY VOTING RIGHTS MARCH The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. MacArthur). Under the Speaker's announced policy of January 6, 2015, the Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Ohio (Mrs. Beatty) for 30 minutes. Mrs. BEATTY. Mr. Speaker, I would like to join my other colleagues tonight to thank Congresswoman Kelly from Illinois and Congressman Payne from New Jersey for organizing tonight's Congressional Black Caucus Special Order hour. I rise to highlight a pivotal moment in America's history--the Selma voting rights march--that 50 years ago, Mr. Speaker, brought together Americans to march from Selma to Montgomery, Alabama, across the now famous Edmund Pettus Bridge. There were attacks and dogs, beatings and deaths, but still we marched because we as a country knew that all Americans should have the same rights. The 54-mile walk was an effort to demonstrate the desire of Black American citizens to exercise their constitutional right to vote and to be treated equally. Mr. Speaker, although the Civil Rights Act of 1964 legally desegregated the South, discrimination and segregation remained throughout much of the United States. The march led to the passage of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, which, today, continues to be eroded in a threatened bill. The communities across our Nation certainly have threats to their basic rights, and there are certainly injustices. In the words of Dr. Martin Luther King--and they still ring true today when I think about his words--``injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere.'' When I reflect on my recent trip to Ferguson-- where I witnessed firsthand--it seems that we are still reengaging in our unfortunate history and ongoing challenges with voting rights, voter registration, and injustices--and with new vitality and vigor. Mr. Speaker, I will stand with my colleagues--those who are here, along with Congressman John Lewis and Congresswoman Terri Sewell--when we march across that bridge and when we say that we must turn our march toward solutions. If we, Democrats and Republicans, can watch a movie together about Selma, sharing silent moments in tears, sharing stories of our own experiences, surely we can come together to fix voting rights. How long must we wait, Mr. Speaker? How long will it take? Let me end with these words: it is on all of us here in this body to march for voting rights and to march for having voting rights. Mr. Speaker, I yield to my colleague, Congresswoman Robin Kelly. Ms. KELLY of Illinois. I would like to thank the gentlewoman from Ohio for her important remarks. As we come to a close, I thank the distinguished gentleman from the Garden State--my good friend, Representative Donald Payne--for his tremendous leadership and for leading this Congressional Black Caucus Special Order hour. Mr. Speaker, in our hour of power, we have had the opportunity to speak directly to the American people. This is a privilege that I take seriously and a responsibility that the CBC cherishes. Tonight, we strengthen our future by embracing our past. 2015 represents a critical junction in the advancement of our Nation. Fifty years after the Selma to Montgomery march there are strengthened civil rights and improved access to the ballot. Today, we find ourselves with equally important ground to cover in promoting civil rights, in reducing economic and health disparities, and in strengthening voter rights protection. As a legislative body, we have made progress, but as Representatives and as men and women who love this country, our work continues. As we look back, we are comforted by the bridges we have crossed, by the trails we have blazed, and by the future ahead of us that we envision. I want to thank the entire Congressional Black Caucus, especially my fellow coanchor, the gentleman from New Jersey, Congressman Payne. {time} 2030 Fifty years after Selma, the CBC remembers that it exists to promote the public welfare through legislation that meets the needs of millions of neglected citizens. It is that spirit that guides us and many others in Congress. When we see millions of men, women, and children who need help moving forward, we march. When we see obstruction in our path to creating a more perfect Union, we respond. Again, I thank my colleagues. Mrs. BEATTY. Mr. Speaker, at this time I would like to allow my colleague, Congresswoman Yvette Clarke from Brooklyn, who is also the vice president of the Congressional Black Caucus, to share her thoughts with us. (Ms. CLARKE of New York asked and was given permission to revise and extend her remarks.) Ms. CLARKE of New York. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlelady from Ohio (Mrs. Beatty) for extending this time to me, and I want to also thank the gentlelady from Illinois (Ms. Kelly) and the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Payne). Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my colleagues in the Congressional Black Caucus for hosting this evening's Special Order and this extension this evening. Today I proudly rise to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the historic events of the nonviolent protests that took place in Selma, Alabama, and to recognize their importance in igniting and fueling the civil rights movement that brought an end to the practice of Jim Crow racial segregation by law in America and voting rights legislation that guaranteed every American citizen the right to vote. It is a privilege to represent the Ninth District of New York in offering tribute to the historic people of conscience that walked the Edmund Pettus Bridge on March 7, 1965, known as Bloody Sunday. The march from Selma to Montgomery in 1965 included more than 600 women and men who walked from the historic Brown Chapel AME Church to the State capital of Alabama. They marched for the right to vote, the freedom and human dignity that had been denied to them.

was younger than me but had graduated from school in fort worth isd, had graduated 9 years after i did, and she said: i was raised in fort worth, and i graduated from a school in fort worth, but i didn't know that the schools were ever segregated here. you see how quickly it is that the history can disappear and fade away if it is not kept alive; and i think that that is one of the reasons why i am really excited about selma and the opportunity to talk about this more, because we really do need to make sure that we keep our youth reconnected with the past or we know that it will fade away. then, also, when you start talking about where we are headed, and it has been mentioned tonight, i would like to say that we are headed to someplace more positive, someplace that is for the betterment of all americans. but we know that there are many mechanisms out there that are being designed and implemented by state legislatures all around the country to impede one's right to vote. you can look no further than the state that i am very proud of, my own state of texas, but we have some serious issues. i mean, when you look at redistricting in the state of texas, when you look at the voter id laws that were passed in the state of texas, i mean, right now in the state of texas you cannot vote with a state-issued id, but you can vote with a concealed handgun license. it is just rules like that that are being implemented and put in place that we know are designed to be a barrier to people voting, the same types of barriers that were put in place, maybe a little bit differently, maybe with a smile on their face, but we know that the goal is to do exactly what was done in selma 50 years ago, and it is to prevent people from voting. so, again, i want to thank the congresswoman from ohio and i want to thank my colleagues from illinois and from new jersey for putting this together. we need to talk about history. it is not the past. it really is still the present, something similar to what faulkner said. we need to continue to have these discussions and share these stories with our young people, but i think more importantly that we need to put them in the perspective from today because many of these battles we know that we are still fighting. so i am glad that i am able to share this with everyone, and i hope that all members, regardless of where they are from, regardless of what their party is, that they can think about what happened 50 years ago when the walk across the edmund pettus bridge happened, and this is something we can all learn from. i want to thank mrs. beatty for allowing me to have a few words. mrs. beatty. thank you so much to my colleague. mr. speaker, at this time it gives me great pleasure to ask congresswoman bonnie watson coleman--i am very proud to say that she is a part of this 114th freshman class--to say a few words. (mrs. watson coleman asked and was given permission to revise and extend her remarks.) mrs. watson coleman. mr. speaker, i want to thank the gentlelady from ohio for yielding to me. i want to thank both the gentlelady from illinois and the gentleman from new jersey for providing this opportunity here to speak tonight on something that i think is very important. as a member of the cbc, a very proud member, i am here because we rise to commemorate a slice of american history that speaks to the spirit that is america. we rise to acknowledge the sacrifice and the forethought of a generation whose risks were ultimately america's reward. we rise to recognize the american heroes and sheroes of selma on the 50th anniversary of this bloody sunday. from selma, we learned that sometimes protests and objections that are deemed un-american today may later be considered the greatest manifestation of american democracy. from selma, we learned that because of a young person's protests today, he may be called an outside agitator, a troublemaker, or even a provocateur, but that same young person, because of that same activity, may later be called courageous, a hero, or even a congressman. yes, from selma, we learned that ordinary people can do extraordinary things when they are on the side of righteousness. selma taught us, as dr. king suggested, that it is always the right time to do what is right. but at the time of that fight, the likelihood that this generation of young dreamers would be successful in transforming an entire society seemed slim. they persevered anyhow. in the [[page h694]] face of seemingly insurmountable odds, these young people fought for what was right no matter the consequence. today we must learn from their example; we must persevere in the fight for working families, despite those that believe that there should be no floor for the poor and no ceiling for the rich. we must protect the precious right to vote for all people. we must persevere despite the fact that there is little reward for fighting for people who cannot fight for themselves, and we must fight for what is right and not what is popular. we must remember that it is our legacy to fight on the side of righteousness when we debate giving access to health care, access to education, access to the right to marry, and access to just plain old justice. i look forward to this collective will and this collective commitment of the cbc because i know that we can never forget selma. mr. speaker, i thank the gentlelady from ohio. mrs. beatty. mr. speaker, in closing remarks, let me thank you for extending our time tonight. we have heard from voices of legends tonight. but tonight i would like to end by giving special recognition to two new voices, two new legends who tonight led us through something more than a special order hour. they led us through a special order hour in history. to congressman donald payne of new jersey, thank you for picking this topic and partnering with my colleague and friend, congresswoman robin kelly. mr. speaker, tonight they are our voices of the future. tonight they had the courage to come and manage time on an issue that we think, as members not only of the congressional black caucus, but of this congress, being the conscience of this congress. {time} 2045 hopefully, it will make a difference in this chamber as we proceed forward. thank you again, congressman payne and congresswoman kelly. you are our voices. mr. speaker, i yield back the balance of my time. ____________________",16221

Mr. President, in his State of the Union Address, President Obama promised to deliver a budget filled with ``ideas that are practical, not partisan.'' I know many Americans were glad to hear him say that. The American people elected a right-of-center Congress focused on jobs and reform, so it makes sense that a President would want to send commonsense ideas that could pass the Congress that the people actually elected last November. He could have proposed a budget that was balanced. He could have challenged us with serious, innovative reforms aimed at getting spending under control or effective ideas to create jobs and opportunity. There are so many positive things he could have done instead of phoning in another tired tax-and-spend manifesto. We basically see the same thing every year. It focuses on growing the bureaucracy instead of opportunity. It does not balance ever. Because it isn't designed to pass Congress, of course it doesn't pass Congress. The budget is just one symptom of a wider disconnect. Rhetorically, at least, we hear the White House echo Republican calls for policies aimed at helping the middle class, but then we see the White House push more of the same stale, top-down policies favored by political bosses over on the left. As Americans who have lost health plans or who are seeing health costs skyrocket could tell you, the left's priorities often hurt the very people they purport to help. This is the wrong approach. We need fresh ideas. Republicans want the President to join us in fighting for the middle class, so we think he should take opportunities such as the budget [[Page S678]] to actually rally Members of both parties behind serious ideas that can actually pass. We think the country could really benefit from his positive leadership. His next test will come soon as the new Congress works to develop the kind of budget the American people deserve. We are going to focus on growing the economy from the ground up, with more future-oriented reform, more jobs, more opportunity. We are going to pursue ideas that make government leaner, more efficient, and more effective. We are going to honor the hard-working men and women who count on us to spend their dollars wisely, not offload Washington's problems onto them with higher taxes. That is what the American people expect. It is the kind of practical agenda you pursue if you are serious about helping the middle class. It is what I hope the President will now encourage Members of both parties to work toward. The truth is, there is a lot we can achieve with constructive, bipartisan cooperation. The bill we will vote on tomorrow is a great example of that. Members in both parties agree it is time to pursue positive reform for veterans who are hurting. The Clay Hunt Suicide Prevention for American Veterans Act aims to reduce the tragedy that befalls too many of our heroes and the heartbreak that befalls too many of their families. We lose thousands of veterans every year to suicide. Now is the time for practical, bipartisan action to do something about it. The legislation we will vote on tomorrow will provide more of the suicide prevention and mental health support our veterans deserve. It will help veterans transition from Active-Duty service. It will take steps to improve the effectiveness of programs to help heroes in need. This bill has already passed the House unanimously. I hope we can achieve a similar result in the Senate and send this bipartisan legislation to the White House for signature.

Mr. President, in his State of the Union Address, President Obama promised to deliver a budget filled with ``ideas that are practical, not partisan.'' I know many Americans were glad to hear him say that. The American people elected a right-of-center Congress focused on jobs and reform, so it makes sense that a President would want to send commonsense ideas that could pass the Congress that the people actually elected last November. He could have proposed a budget that was balanced. He could have challenged us with serious, innovative reforms aimed at getting spending under control or effective ideas to create jobs and opportunity. There are so many positive things he could have done instead of phoning in another tired tax-and-spend manifesto. We basically see the same thing every year. It focuses on growing the bureaucracy instead of opportunity. It does not balance ever. Because it isn't designed to pass Congress, of course it doesn't pass Congress. The budget is just one symptom of a wider disconnect. Rhetorically, at least, we hear the White House echo Republican calls for policies aimed at helping the middle class, but then we see the White House push more of the same stale, top-down policies favored by political bosses over on the left. As Americans who have lost health plans or who are seeing health costs skyrocket could tell you, the left's priorities often hurt the very people they purport to help. This is the wrong approach. We need fresh ideas. Republicans want the President to join us in fighting for the middle class, so we think he should take opportunities such as the budget [[Page S678]] to actually rally Members of both parties behind serious ideas that can actually pass. We think the country could really benefit from his positive leadership. His next test will come soon as the new Congress works to develop the kind of budget the American people deserve. We are going to focus on growing the economy from the ground up, with more future-oriented reform, more jobs, more opportunity. We are going to pursue ideas that make government leaner, more efficient, and more effective. We are going to honor the hard-working men and women who count on us to spend their dollars wisely, not offload Washington's problems onto them with higher taxes. That is what the American people expect. It is the kind of practical agenda you pursue if you are serious about helping the middle class. It is what I hope the President will now encourage Members of both parties to work toward. The truth is, there is a lot we can achieve with constructive, bipartisan cooperation.

Terrorism is for real. Senator McCaskill said it about the best way I have seen it described. The Republicans are more afraid of the DREAMers than they are of ISIS. By the way, ISIS said they are coming our way. Why should we be dealing with issues that have nothing to do with homeland security? We should pass a homeland security bill with no strings attached to it. That is where we are going to wind up. If the Republican majority in the House and the Senate wants to have a CR for Homeland Security--a continuing resolution--that would cut about $1 billion out of the budget for Homeland Security. Homeland Security was developed after 9/11. It was a bipartisan piece of legislation that consolidated 22 different government agencies.

I am sorry to say that we spent 1 month on a bill calling for the importation of oil from a foreign country and then exporting that oil outside of America. I am glad we were able to work it out so that we had a number of amendments. That was really good. We felt very comfortable with that. I wish we could have done some more, but I am satisfied with what we were able to do. Of course now we await the action of the President, as we should be doing. The work of this Senate is based upon--should be based upon--what we are able to do for the middle class. We are a constructive minority, and we proved that the last month. To show how constructive we are, take for example TRIA, terrorism insurance. It is so important up and down the Las Vegas Strip, Times Square, everyplace in America. That is important to the business community. Yet that was held up in the last Congress by my Republican colleagues. To show our good faith, we were able to pass that in a matter of hours. That is the way it should be. We are going to vote tomorrow on the Clay Hunt bill. That is an important piece of legislation. I have worked hard on suicide prevention. We need to keep working on it. Each year in America 32,000 Americans kill themselves. That does not take into consideration the car accidents that are not reported properly, hunting accidents.

CREC-2015-02-02-pt1-PgS678-7,CREC-2015-02-02,114,DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY FUNDING,"[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 17 (Monday, February 2, 2015)] [Senate] [Pages S678-S680] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY FUNDING Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, of all things, the Department of Homeland [[Page S679]] Security, created to protect America from terrorism, is a Department that is underfunded by Republican design. The Republicans refuse to give the regular budget appropriation to the Department of Homeland Security to protest President Obama's Executive order on immigration. The House of Representatives went so far as to add five riders-- conditions--to the budget for the Department of Homeland Security and send them here. They have said they will not fund this Department unless we join them in what has become an extremely negative and, I believe, hate-filled attack on people across America. Saturday we had a rally in Chicago, and at that rally was Secretary Jeh Johnson of the Department of Homeland Security. Joining us were Congressman Luis Gutierrez of Chicago, the mayor of Chicago, and literally hundreds of people, many of them DREAMers--young people who are now, because of President Obama's Executive order, allowed to go to school and work in America. Remember, these were children--toddlers, infants--brought to America by their families, who are undocumented through no fault of their own. They have lived in America, they have been educated in America, they have pledged allegiance to our flag in their classrooms, and they have no future because we have not changed the immigration law to give them a chance. But President Obama has given them a chance. DACA is a program where, when these young people sign up for it, they can be protected to live in America without fear of deportation--to work here, to go to school here, and to start to realize their dreams. They even want to volunteer for our military. Many of them do. They are trying their best to be part of America's future, and the President gave them that chance. The House of Representatives--the Republican majority--said: We will not fund the Department of Homeland Security to protect America against terrorism unless the Senate will vote to literally deport the DREAMers. At a time, as Senator Reid said, when we are threatened with ISIS, when we are sickened by the images on television of innocent people-- including Americans--being beheaded, at that same time the Republicans on Capitol Hill are telling us: We are not going to properly fund the Department of Homeland Security to protect America unless we can protest what President Obama has done for 600,000 young people protected by DACA. Senator Reid quoted Senator McCaskill, who spoke up at one of our meetings the other day, who said: Apparently the Republicans fear the DREAMers more than they fear the terrorists, more than they fear ISIS. That is wrong. I do not know who cooked up this political strategy. They were not thinking clearly. If they were thinking clearly, we would fund that Department with a clean appropriation--one that is now sitting on the calendar of the Senate that was offered by Senators Jeanne Shaheen and Barbara Mikulski. It is sitting here. By unanimous consent, with the approval of the majority leader, we could pass it today, fund this agency. I asked Secretary Johnson: Well, what difference does it make if you get a temporary funding bill or a regular budget bill? He said: I can't properly run this Department. I am wasting time and money. I am not investing in things that make us safer because of the way Congress--in this case, the House Republicans--insists that they will not properly fund this agency. It funded every other agency of government except for the Department of Homeland Security. What are they thinking? Why would they want to make an object lesson out of this critical Department? I said to Secretary Johnson: So what types of things can't you do? He gave one example. He said: We give grants for research to find ways to make America safer when we are attacked. We can't give those grants now because we are under a continuing resolution. Research to make America safe has stopped. Is that a wise thing for the new Republican majority in the House and Senate to do? Clearly, that is their plan. But we are going to give them an alternative and very quickly. Tomorrow we are going to consider a procedural motion about whether we go to this House bill, which has the five riders on immigration. I believe the Democrats will say: No, we want a clean bill, and we want to move to that bill quickly. And we need to do it not just because we need to keep America safe-- isn't that our first obligation?--but secondly because I do not believe our caucus--and I hope not a majority of the other caucus--has the same hate-filled feelings toward DREAMers that we have seen in the House of Representatives. Mr. President, 600,000 of them have stepped forward. I have come to the floor day after day to tell their stories. They are the most amazing stories of young people who, with no help from the government, finished college and pursued professional degrees, without a penny of assistance from our government, whose only dream is to be part of the future of America. They are our future. They will help our economy. They will reduce our deficit. They will once again reestablish and reaffirm the American dream that people can risk everything to come to this country to make sure their children have a better life. These DREAMers deserve that chance. America deserves the chance to be properly secure in this age of terrorism. This Republican strategy is not going to achieve that. I thank my colleague. Mr. REID. Will my friend yield for a question? Mr. DURBIN. I will be happy to yield for a question. Mr. REID. My friend is modest, my friend the senior Senator from Illinois. But tell those within the sound of our voices how long you have worked on the DREAM Act--you. Mr. DURBIN. I thank the Senator from Nevada, our minority leader. Fourteen years ago I introduced the DREAM Act, and I got into a spat with a Republican Senator, Mr. Hatch, who said: That is my idea. I said: Fine. Then it will be the Hatch-Durbin DREAM Act. And we introduced it 14 years ago, and it has not been enacted into law. Senator Hatch now has some misgivings over this issue, but I have stuck with it for 14 years. And the majority leader joined me in sending a letter to President Obama asking that he create this Executive order of protection. I would like to say a word about Executive orders. Republicans come to the floor and suggest that when a President of the United States issues an Executive order, it is an unconstitutional exercise of power. You hear it over and over again. If you step out of this Chamber and take just a few steps toward the staircase, you will see this magnificent, historic painting of Abraham Lincoln signing the Emancipation Proclamation. It is historic because, with the signature of President Lincoln, 3 million American slaves were freed--an Executive order. And it was an order which had the force of law. It was signed by President Lincoln--an Executive order. It was not the only one. You think back in history to the historic Executive orders, and you have to think of Harry Truman. After World War II Harry Truman stepped up and said: We are going to integrate the Armed Forces of the United States of America, and I will not wait for Congress. Give me the pen and paper to sign the Executive order to achieve it. So if President Lincoln can liberate 3 million American slaves, if President Truman can sign an Executive order integrating the Armed Forces, how can the Republicans come to the floor, one after the other, and say the use of an Executive order by the President is unconstitutional and want to hold President Obama accountable for their misguided thinking? It does not make sense. I might just say--and I thought perhaps the Senator from Nevada was going to say it as well--if none of the Republicans like what President Obama has done on immigration, can I remind them they are now in majority control of the House and the Senate? If they think it is better to have a law enacted--despite the fact that for 2 years the House of Representatives refused to even call the bipartisan comprehensive immigration reform--if they think it is proper and right for a law to be enacted on immigration, the [[Page S680]] American people have given them the majorities in both Houses to do it. So instead of cursing the darkness and failing to fund the Department of Homeland Security, why don't they roll up their sleeves and go to work as Members of the House and Senate and pass immigration reform? I think that is worthy of this great body and the one across the rotunda. But to underfund the Department of Homeland Security that protects us from terrorism? What are they thinking? I thank the Senator from Nevada for returning. It feels great to have you back in your capacity here as our leader on the Democratic side and as my friend. I yield the floor.

The Senator from Georgia. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 17 (Monday, February 2, 2015)] [Senate] [Pages S678-S680] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY FUNDING Mr. DURBIN.

It was signed by President Lincoln--an Executive order. It was not the only one. You think back in history to the historic Executive orders, and you have to think of Harry Truman. After World War II Harry Truman stepped up and said: We are going to integrate the Armed Forces of the United States of America, and I will not wait for Congress. Give me the pen and paper to sign the Executive order to achieve it. So if President Lincoln can liberate 3 million American slaves, if President Truman can sign an Executive order integrating the Armed Forces, how can the Republicans come to the floor, one after the other, and say the use of an Executive order by the President is unconstitutional and want to hold President Obama accountable for their misguided thinking? It does not make sense. I might just say--and I thought perhaps the Senator from Nevada was going to say it as well--if none of the Republicans like what President Obama has done on immigration, can I remind them they are now in majority control of the House and the Senate? If they think it is better to have a law enacted--despite the fact that for 2 years the House of Representatives refused to even call the bipartisan comprehensive immigration reform--if they think it is proper and right for a law to be enacted on immigration, the [[Page S680]] American people have given them the majorities in both Houses to do it. So instead of cursing the darkness and failing to fund the Department of Homeland Security, why don't they roll up their sleeves and go to work as Members of the House and Senate and pass immigration reform? I think that is worthy of this great body and the one across the rotunda. But to underfund the Department of Homeland Security that protects us from terrorism? What are they thinking? I thank the Senator from Nevada for returning. It feels great to have you back in your capacity here as our leader on the Democratic side and as my friend. I yield the floor.

The Senator from Georgia. ____________________",package_114_256.csv,9188,9188,9257,"[congressional record volume 161, number 17 (monday, february 2, 2015)] [senate] [pages s678-s680] from the congressional record online through the government publishing office [ www.gpo.gov ] department of homeland security funding mr. durbin. mr. president, of all things, the department of homeland [[page s679]] security, created to protect america from terrorism, is a department that is underfunded by republican design. the republicans refuse to give the regular budget appropriation to the department of homeland security to protest president obama's executive order on immigration. the house of representatives went so far as to add five riders-- conditions--to the budget for the department of homeland security and send them here. they have said they will not fund this department unless we join them in what has become an extremely negative and, i believe, hate-filled attack on people across america. saturday we had a rally in chicago, and at that rally was secretary jeh johnson of the department of homeland security. joining us were congressman luis gutierrez of chicago, the mayor of chicago, and literally hundreds of people, many of them dreamers--young people who are now, because of president obama's executive order, allowed to go to school and work in america. remember, these were children--toddlers, infants--brought to america by their families, who are undocumented through no fault of their own. they have lived in america, they have been educated in america, they have pledged allegiance to our flag in their classrooms, and they have no future because we have not changed the immigration law to give them a chance. but president obama has given them a chance. daca is a program where, when these young people sign up for it, they can be protected to live in america without fear of deportation--to work here, to go to school here, and to start to realize their dreams. they even want to volunteer for our military. many of them do. they are trying their best to be part of america's future, and the president gave them that chance. the house of representatives--the republican majority--said: we will not fund the department of homeland security to protect america against terrorism unless the senate will vote to literally deport the dreamers. at a time, as senator reid said, when we are threatened with isis, when we are sickened by the images on television of innocent people-- including americans--being beheaded, at that same time the republicans on capitol hill are telling us: we are not going to properly fund the department of homeland security to protect america unless we can protest what president obama has done for 600,000 young people protected by daca. senator reid quoted senator mccaskill, who spoke up at one of our meetings the other day, who said: apparently the republicans fear the dreamers more than they fear the terrorists, more than they fear isis. that is wrong. i do not know who cooked up this political strategy. they were not thinking clearly. if they were thinking clearly, we would fund that department with a clean appropriation--one that is now sitting on the calendar of the senate that was offered by senators jeanne shaheen and barbara mikulski. it is sitting here. by unanimous consent, with the approval of the majority leader, we could pass it today, fund this agency. i asked secretary johnson: well, what difference does it make if you get a temporary funding bill or a regular budget bill? he said: i can't properly run this department. i am wasting time and money. i am not investing in things that make us safer because of the way congress--in this case, the house republicans--insists that they will not properly fund this agency. it funded every other agency of government except for the department of homeland security. what are they thinking? why would they want to make an object lesson out of this critical department? i said to secretary johnson: so what types of things can't you do? he gave one example. he said: we give grants for research to find ways to make america safer when we are attacked. we can't give those grants now because we are under a continuing resolution. research to make america safe has stopped. is that a wise thing for the new republican majority in the house and senate to do? clearly, that is their plan. but we are going to give them an alternative and very quickly. tomorrow we are going to consider a procedural motion about whether we go to this house bill, which has the five riders on immigration. i believe the democrats will say: no, we want a clean bill, and we want to move to that bill quickly. and we need to do it not just because we need to keep america safe-- isn't that our first obligation?--but secondly because i do not believe our caucus--and i hope not a majority of the other caucus--has the same hate-filled feelings toward dreamers that we have seen in the house of representatives. mr. president, 600,000 of them have stepped forward. i have come to the floor day after day to tell their stories. they are the most amazing stories of young people who, with no help from the government, finished college and pursued professional degrees, without a penny of assistance from our government, whose only dream is to be part of the future of america. they are our future. they will help our economy. they will reduce our deficit. they will once again reestablish and reaffirm the american dream that people can risk everything to come to this country to make sure their children have a better life. these dreamers deserve that chance. america deserves the chance to be properly secure in this age of terrorism. this republican strategy is not going to achieve that. i thank my colleague. mr. reid. will my friend yield for a question? mr. durbin. i will be happy to yield for a question. mr. reid. my friend is modest, my friend the senior senator from illinois. but tell those within the sound of our voices how long you have worked on the dream act--you. mr. durbin. i thank the senator from nevada, our minority leader. fourteen years ago i introduced the dream act, and i got into a spat with a republican senator, mr. hatch, who said: that is my idea. i said: fine. then it will be the hatch-durbin dream act. and we introduced it 14 years ago, and it has not been enacted into law. senator hatch now has some misgivings over this issue, but i have stuck with it for 14 years. and the majority leader joined me in sending a letter to president obama asking that he create this executive order of protection. i would like to say a word about executive orders. republicans come to the floor and suggest that when a president of the united states issues an executive order, it is an unconstitutional exercise of power. you hear it over and over again. if you step out of this chamber and take just a few steps toward the staircase, you will see this magnificent, historic painting of abraham lincoln signing the emancipation proclamation. it is historic because, with the signature of president lincoln, 3 million american slaves were freed--an executive order. and it was an order which had the force of law. it was signed by president lincoln--an executive order. it was not the only one. you think back in history to the historic executive orders, and you have to think of harry truman. after world war ii harry truman stepped up and said: we are going to integrate the armed forces of the united states of america, and i will not wait for congress. give me the pen and paper to sign the executive order to achieve it. so if president lincoln can liberate 3 million american slaves, if president truman can sign an executive order integrating the armed forces, how can the republicans come to the floor, one after the other, and say the use of an executive order by the president is unconstitutional and want to hold president obama accountable for their misguided thinking?

CREC-2015-02-02-pt1-PgS680-2,CREC-2015-02-02,114,CLAY HUNT SUICIDE PREVENTION FOR AMERICAN VETERANS ACT,"[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 17 (Monday, February 2, 2015)] [Senate] [Pages S680-S682] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] CLAY HUNT SUICIDE PREVENTION FOR AMERICAN VETERANS ACT Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, I want to give you a stark fact and figure. Every year 8,000 American veterans take their own lives and commit suicide. That is more people, more veterans than were killed in all the conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan. We have a major epidemic in America's Armed Forces because of soft tissue issues of PTSD and TBI. This Congress, both Committees on Veterans' Affairs--in the House and Senate--have acted, and tomorrow this Senate will vote on the Clay Hunt suicide prevention bill. I want to talk about it for a few minutes because it is critically important. When these men and women go overseas and volunteer to serve America and lay their lives on the line for us, many come back with terrible injuries, prosthesis, an inability to walk, some in wheelchairs. But the stealth disease, the one that hurts the most, the one that permeates the most, is PTSD and TBI. We have been doing as much as we could but not enough within veterans health care. Secretary McDonald has committed himself to improving the services of mental health to our veterans. I have committed myself. Senator Blumenthal has committed himself. Senator Boozman from Arkansas, Senator McCain from Arizona, who will speak later--all are committed to see to it that we have a better program for our veterans. What the Clay Hunt suicide prevention bill does is create incentives for more psychiatric professionals to come into the VA health care system because psychiatry is the best physician expertise you need to deal with PTSD and TBI. But it also has external audits of the VA to make sure they are doing what needs to take place in terms of veterans health care and in terms of mental health for our veterans. The tragedies are daily, the tragedies are compounding, and we must find an end to it. A lot of people think these tragedies are with veterans of the gulf war, our Operation Iraqi Freedom, or our battle in Afghanistan. But, quite frankly, a lot of them are our Vietnam veterans. We looked the other way and did not recognize PTSD and TBI for a long time, but now we have recognized it front and center, and it is the major injury from the battles in Afghanistan, Iraq, and other conflicts in the history of the United States of America. We owe it to our veterans to have the best mental health available to them. In my hometown of Atlanta, on August 21, 2013, I called a field hearing at Georgia State University and brought in all the VA experts on suicide prevention because, quite frankly, we had had three suicides in the Atlanta VA within a very short period of time that got high- profile headlines in our newspaper. As it turned out, we found that we really did not have the followup, the follow-through, and the continuum of care that mental health needs and deserves, and we had some veterans who had fallen through the cracks--not just in Atlanta but around the United States of America. In fact, as recently as last week there was a tragic death in Atlanta. We do not know yet the root cause of it, but we know the individual may have had mental health problems and was a veteran of the war in Afghanistan and took their life and the life of their children. We do not know whether PTSD or TBI was the contributing cause or whether we had done anything wrong in terms of veterans health care. But we know this: Four more lives were taken from the stealth disease called tragic brain injury, post-traumatic stress disorder. So I am very pleased as the chairman of the Veterans Affairs' Committee to tell you that the House unanimously passed this bill 3 weeks ago on the floor of the House, the Senate Veterans' Affairs Committee unanimously passed it 2 weeks ago in committee, and the bill we will vote on tomorrow can go directly from the floor of the Senate to the desk of the President of the United States and be signed. Very quickly, I want to make two points for anybody who is listening that remembers last year. This bill failed last year. It failed for two reasons: One, Members questioned whether we could afford it because it had a price tag of $24 million. We have fixed the price problem by taking internally generated funds of the VA to pay the $24 million. That is done. Secondly, some said: Well, this is a duplicative service. We already have mental health services and suicide prevention at the VA. We have some, and we do not have enough. It is not duplicative. It is absolutely necessary and essential that we do what we are doing. Mr. President, I am proud to come to the floor of the Senate on behalf of all of our veterans and tell them: Washington is watching. We are listening. We feel your pain. We understand the problems you have. And we are going to do everything we can to see to it that the Clay Hunt suicide prevention bill becomes the law of the land, that the VA is held accountable for its policies and procedure in mental health, and that we put an end and stem the tide of the tragic number of veteran suicides that take place every single day. I would like to now yield to my ranking member on the Veterans' Affairs Committee, the Senator from Connecticut, who has done an overwhelmingly great job to see this through from beginning to end, Mr. Blumenthal. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut. Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Mr. President, I begin by thanking the chairman of the Veterans' Affairs Committee, Senator Isakson, and really giving him immeasurable credit for his courage and his fortitude in addressing this bill that he could have allowed to languish on the agenda of the Veterans' Affairs Committee. In fact, he made it the very first agenda item--the very first issue--that we would confront on the Veterans' Affairs Committee at our very first meeting, and it passed unanimously through the Veterans' Affairs Committee because of his leadership--and I really mean his leadership in making it happen. So on behalf of the veterans of America, he deserves due credit, and so do my colleagues on the Veterans' Affairs Committee, Senator Boozman and Senator Sanders, who championed this bill, along with Senator Burr. During the last session I was pleased to argue for it on the floor in the closing days of the session, and unfortunately it failed to pass. There is no reason to look back and try to blame others for that failure. What is important is to look forward and to give credit to both sides of the aisle--most especially to my colleague, Senator McCain, who, of course, dwarfs us in his service to our Nation in the Armed Forces. He literally is a giant in his service and sacrifice for our Nation while serving in the Navy. I have felt very privileged and proud to work with him and to introduce this measure, the Clay Hunt Suicide Prevention for American Veterans Act or the Clay Hunt SAV Act, as it is called, that basically provides for suicide prevention [[Page S681]] services and, even more importantly, pioneers and champions mental health care for our VA. I thank all of our colleagues who have worked on this bill over the past year or so because this measure gives us a tremendous opportunity to set a direction for the VA and for the Senate. If I may be so bold and perhaps presumptuous, I say this measure is truly bipartisan. It provides a template for bipartisan action to help our veterans, our military men and women who serve now, and to set a real lodestar for action by this body. Very fittingly, we are on the floor when the Democratic leader, Senator Reid has returned. I am tremendously heartened by his presence here and by the President's budget today, which provides a proposed increase in health care spending and, most especially, mental health care spending, to $7.4 billion from last year's expenditure of $6.7 billion. It is significant, again, in the context of a bipartisan approach to this issue. This legislation is named for Clay Hunt, a marine, a patriot, a veteran who served bravely in Iraq. His mom, Susan Selke, is a real hero. She came before the Veterans' Affairs Committee during the last session. Her testimony was not only as a patriot and an advocate of veterans but as a family member. There have been too many family members forced to grieve the loss of their loved ones who have succumbed to suicide, as did Clay Hunt in March of 2011, after struggling valiantly and courageously with post-traumatic stress and the inadequate care of his local VA hospital. Far too many of Clay Hunt's fellow veterans, 22 per day, have succumbed to suicide, including a friend of mine, Justin Eldridge of southeastern Connecticut. Justin braved mortar fire and sniper attacks in Afghanistan to return to southeastern Connecticut and to his family, his children, and his wife Joanna. Suffering from post-traumatic brain injury and post- traumatic stress, tragically, like so many others, Justin slipped through the cracks of his local VA facility and eventually succumbed in his fight against those inner demons and invisible wounds when he took his own life. As brave as Justin Eldridge was on the battlefield, he could not win that war at home. How Justin and Clay fell into that black hole of depression and despair I certainly will never understand, but we grieve for them and we hope that their example of courage will inspire us to face this issue. All too often, the response to suicide--whether it is among veterans or others--is denial. It is to turn away, to look in the other direction because sometimes it is too painful or there is stigma or shame in mental health needs. We can conquer that stigma and shame. To its credit the military is doing more every day. The VA has raised awareness and is increasing its commitment. This bill is a tremendous opportunity for the VA to be a pioneer and champion in mental health care, just as it has been in other areas of health care, such as amputee rehabilitation, prosthetics, and traumatic brain injury. This bill is a downpayment. It is the beginning--not the end--of our commitment and our solutions to problems. It is a worthwhile measure to take limited, targeted steps--less than we must eventually do--to keep faith with our veterans and their mental health needs. I hope the committee and this Congress will continue in this great, bipartisan spirit. I look forward to a continuing partnership with my friend Senator Isakson, who is such a leader in this area, as we work on these issues and seek to make progress as quickly as possible. As we do so--remember all of our efforts from all of the years of conflict and war in this country--Senator Isakson is absolutely right that post-traumatic stress and mental health needs are hardly limited to the veterans of Iraq and Afghanistan. I have worked hard to help veterans of the Vietnam and Korea eras. In fact, I successfully championed the needs of our veterans of earlier eras when they have been burdened by less-than-honorable discharge resulting from post-traumatic stress, from an era when post-traumatic stress was nonexistent as a diagnosis. Post-traumatic stress was unknown for our Vietnam and Korea veterans. It was not unknown as a condition. It was not nonexistent. It was simply unknown has a diagnosis. It was not called post-traumatic stress. It may have been called shell shock or battle fatigue. But the horror, the nightmares, the cold sweats, the headaches, and the crippling mental issues have plagued many of our veterans over many eras and many wars. Today we take a step to recognize this Nation's obligation to Justin Eldridge, to Clay Hunt, to all of our veterans and to Joanna Eldridge, Susan Selke, and to the countless family members who have struggled and borne that burden side by side when their heroes have awakened at night with the nightmares and the battles they continue to fight against post-traumatic stress, the invisible wounds, and the inner demons that have come back with them from their service. I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. BOOZMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. BOOZMAN. Mr. President, on March 21, 2010, Deborah Johnson of Sherwood, AR, answered a call no parent should ever receive. Her son, 23-year-old Army Private Jeremy Andrew Johnson, was dead from a drug overdose. Private Johnson was diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder after his deployment to Afghanistan. Deborah said she thought he was getting the proper care he needed during the transition out of the military, but when she received a goodbye text from him, she knew he needed more help. The family made his commanders aware of his suicidal thoughts and Private Johnson was put on suicide watch. Three days later Deborah answered that horrible call. Deborah shared her family's story with me in hopes that other families can be spared the anguish of losing a loved one to mental illness. Deborah understands Congress has an opportunity to deliver help to veterans living with mental illness and prevent suicides by passing the Clay Hunt Suicide Prevention for American Veterans Act. This legislation would improve mental health care and suicide prevention resources for veterans by increasing access to mental health programs, providing incentives to recruit and retain psychiatrists to treat veterans and enhancing resources for members of the military transitioning to civilian life. The VA estimates 22 veterans commit suicide every day. This trend is tragic and it is unacceptable. We need to provide the VA with the personnel, services, and proper tools to help veterans facing mental illness struggles. These invisible injuries are why we struggle to identify at-risk individuals. As a member of the Senate Committee on Veterans' Affairs, my colleagues and I are working to fully understand the scope of mental illness in our veteran community. In the meantime, we are paving the way for improvements. Two weeks ago the Veterans' Affairs Committee met for its first order of business in the 114th Congress--approving the Clay Hunt SAV Act. I am proud to say the committee approved this bill with a bipartisan vote of 15 to 0. Our veterans deserve this care. The VA needs to evaluate its mental health programs using metrics common to mental health practitioners to determine the success of its programs. This legislation will do that. It will help the VA more efficiently use the taxpayer funding it receives to support the programs most effective for our veterans. The House approved this bill in January and I am confident the Senate will follow its lead. Deborah Johnson says she wishes Congress would have taken up legislation to improve mental health services years ago. As the President of the Arkansas chapter of Gold Star Mothers, Deborah hears similarities from other families who have suffered a loss because of suicide. She admits that a one-size-fits-all approach [[Page S682]] will not adequately address mental health struggles, but she is hopeful the Clay Hunt SAV Act will help prevent other families from suffering the pain hers lives with. We owe it to Deborah and others like her who have lost loved ones to this battle, as well as servicemembers and veterans coping with mental health issues, to make this one of the first bills the 114th Congress sends to President Obama to sign. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Ms. WARREN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Ms. WARREN. Mr. President, I come to the floor in strong support of the Clay Hunt Suicide Prevention for American Veterans Act. Our men and women in uniform serve our country with honor and courage. They put themselves in harm's way day in and day out to protect us. I have a special appreciation for how much servicemembers and their families contribute to our country, and how important it is that we honor their service. All three of my brothers served in the military, and my oldest brother was career military. He flew 288 combat missions in Vietnam. When you grow up in a family with someone in the military, you know how lucky you are to see them come home safely. But that doesn't mean the sacred trust with our servicemembers ends the moment they step off a plane. We owe our servicemembers the very best, and that means ensuring they always have access to high-quality services and care, including mental health care. The Clay Hunt SAV Act, introduced in the Senate by Senators John McCain and Richard Blumenthal, would strengthen critical mental health care services and suicide prevention resources for our country's veterans. We have heard the deeply troubling statistics. The VA has reported that 22 veterans die each day from suicide. Data collected in the BackHome project shows that while 10 percent of Americans served in the military, veterans make up 20 percent of all suicides in the United States. These statistics tell us something is deeply wrong and that we need to make significant changes. The SAV act calls for an evaluation of the mental health services and suicide prevention efforts of the Department of Veterans Affairs and Department of Defense, and launches a pilot program to provide education loan repayment for psychiatrists who work at the VA. It also helps build stronger partnerships between the VA and nonprofit organizations working with veterans in our communities. The SAV act is named for Clay Hunt, a marine veteran from Texas who served in Iraq and Afghanistan and was a strong advocate for improved services for his fellow veterans. He struggled with post-traumatic stress, and when he was unable to access the care he needed from the VA, he took his own life. As Clay's mother Susan Selke said in her testimony at the Senate Veterans' Affairs Committee hearing last summer: Not one more veteran should have to go through what Clay went through with the VA after returning home from the war. Not one more parent should have to testify before a congressional committee to compel the VA to fulfill its responsibilities to those who served and sacrificed. She went on to say: The reforms, evaluations, and programs directed by this legislation will be critical to helping the VA better serve and treat veterans suffering from mental injuries from war. Had the VA been doing these things all along, it very well may have saved Clay's life. I am proud Massachusetts has taken steps at the State level to help improve suicide prevention resources for veterans, such as establishing the Statewide Advocacy for Veterans' Empowerment Program, or SAVE. The SAVE team is comprised of veterans who work directly in the community to connect veterans and their families to services provided by the Commonwealth and by nonprofits. I have also visited several outstanding community organizations in Massachusetts, such as Veterans Inc. in Worcester, Soldier On in Pittsfield, and the New England Center for Homeless Veterans in Boston, that work tirelessly to help servicemembers access the full range of services they need and deserve, from housing and education to health care. In August, I met with veterans in Framingham, MA, at a mobile vet center. One of the veterans I heard from was Army MAJ Justin Fitch, who was working at the Natick Soldier Research Development and Engineering Center. Justin, who is battling terminal cancer and has had his own struggles with depression, is retiring from the Army just this week, but he is still a powerful and relentless voice fighting to improve care and prevent suicide among veterans fighting depression and psychological stress after returning home from war. Justin told me: Too many veterans are suffering in silence. Twenty-two a day is a lot. One is too many. Justin is right. Our armed service men and women are tough, smart, and courageous. They make huge sacrifices to keep our families safe, and we owe them all a true debt of gratitude for their service. But gratitude isn't enough. We must do more to protect our men and women in uniform who devote their lives to the service of our country. It is clear that Congress has more work to do to bolster our Nation's commitment to supporting veterans and providing the mental health care services they deserve. The Clay Hunt SAV Act is an important part of this effort. I hope my colleagues will join me in voting to pass this legislation in the Senate. Mr. President, I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coats). The clerk will call the roll. The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 17 (Monday, February 2, 2015)] [Senate] [Pages S680-S682] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] CLAY HUNT SUICIDE PREVENTION FOR AMERICAN VETERANS ACT Mr. ISAKSON.

Mr. President, I am proud to come to the floor of the Senate on behalf of all of our veterans and tell them: Washington is watching. We are listening. We feel your pain. We understand the problems you have. And we are going to do everything we can to see to it that the Clay Hunt suicide prevention bill becomes the law of the land, that the VA is held accountable for its policies and procedure in mental health, and that we put an end and stem the tide of the tragic number of veteran suicides that take place every single day. I would like to now yield to my ranking member on the Veterans' Affairs Committee, the Senator from Connecticut, who has done an overwhelmingly great job to see this through from beginning to end, Mr. Blumenthal. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut. Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Mr. President, I begin by thanking the chairman of the Veterans' Affairs Committee, Senator Isakson, and really giving him immeasurable credit for his courage and his fortitude in addressing this bill that he could have allowed to languish on the agenda of the Veterans' Affairs Committee. In fact, he made it the very first agenda item--the very first issue--that we would confront on the Veterans' Affairs Committee at our very first meeting, and it passed unanimously through the Veterans' Affairs Committee because of his leadership--and I really mean his leadership in making it happen. So on behalf of the veterans of America, he deserves due credit, and so do my colleagues on the Veterans' Affairs Committee, Senator Boozman and Senator Sanders, who championed this bill, along with Senator Burr. During the last session I was pleased to argue for it on the floor in the closing days of the session, and unfortunately it failed to pass. There is no reason to look back and try to blame others for that failure. What is important is to look forward and to give credit to both sides of the aisle--most especially to my colleague, Senator McCain, who, of course, dwarfs us in his service to our Nation in the Armed Forces. He literally is a giant in his service and sacrifice for our Nation while serving in the Navy. I have felt very privileged and proud to work with him and to introduce this measure, the Clay Hunt Suicide Prevention for American Veterans Act or the Clay Hunt SAV Act, as it is called, that basically provides for suicide prevention [[Page S681]] services and, even more importantly, pioneers and champions mental health care for our VA. I thank all of our colleagues who have worked on this bill over the past year or so because this measure gives us a tremendous opportunity to set a direction for the VA and for the Senate. If I may be so bold and perhaps presumptuous, I say this measure is truly bipartisan. It provides a template for bipartisan action to help our veterans, our military men and women who serve now, and to set a real lodestar for action by this body. Very fittingly, we are on the floor when the Democratic leader, Senator Reid has returned. I am tremendously heartened by his presence here and by the President's budget today, which provides a proposed increase in health care spending and, most especially, mental health care spending, to $7.4 billion from last year's expenditure of $6.7 billion. It is significant, again, in the context of a bipartisan approach to this issue. This legislation is named for Clay Hunt, a marine, a patriot, a veteran who served bravely in Iraq. His mom, Susan Selke, is a real hero. She came before the Veterans' Affairs Committee during the last session. Her testimony was not only as a patriot and an advocate of veterans but as a family member. There have been too many family members forced to grieve the loss of their loved ones who have succumbed to suicide, as did Clay Hunt in March of 2011, after struggling valiantly and courageously with post-traumatic stress and the inadequate care of his local VA hospital. Far too many of Clay Hunt's fellow veterans, 22 per day, have succumbed to suicide, including a friend of mine, Justin Eldridge of southeastern Connecticut. Justin braved mortar fire and sniper attacks in Afghanistan to return to southeastern Connecticut and to his family, his children, and his wife Joanna. Suffering from post-traumatic brain injury and post- traumatic stress, tragically, like so many others, Justin slipped through the cracks of his local VA facility and eventually succumbed in his fight against those inner demons and invisible wounds when he took his own life. As brave as Justin Eldridge was on the battlefield, he could not win that war at home. How Justin and Clay fell into that black hole of depression and despair I certainly will never understand, but we grieve for them and we hope that their example of courage will inspire us to face this issue. All too often, the response to suicide--whether it is among veterans or others--is denial. It is to turn away, to look in the other direction because sometimes it is too painful or there is stigma or shame in mental health needs. We can conquer that stigma and shame. To its credit the military is doing more every day. The VA has raised awareness and is increasing its commitment. This bill is a tremendous opportunity for the VA to be a pioneer and champion in mental health care, just as it has been in other areas of health care, such as amputee rehabilitation, prosthetics, and traumatic brain injury. This bill is a downpayment. It is the beginning--not the end--of our commitment and our solutions to problems. It is a worthwhile measure to take limited, targeted steps--less than we must eventually do--to keep faith with our veterans and their mental health needs. I hope the committee and this Congress will continue in this great, bipartisan spirit. I look forward to a continuing partnership with my friend Senator Isakson, who is such a leader in this area, as we work on these issues and seek to make progress as quickly as possible. As we do so--remember all of our efforts from all of the years of conflict and war in this country--Senator Isakson is absolutely right that post-traumatic stress and mental health needs are hardly limited to the veterans of Iraq and Afghanistan. I have worked hard to help veterans of the Vietnam and Korea eras. In fact, I successfully championed the needs of our veterans of earlier eras when they have been burdened by less-than-honorable discharge resulting from post-traumatic stress, from an era when post-traumatic stress was nonexistent as a diagnosis. Post-traumatic stress was unknown for our Vietnam and Korea veterans. It was not unknown as a condition. It was not nonexistent. It was simply unknown has a diagnosis. It was not called post-traumatic stress. It may have been called shell shock or battle fatigue. But the horror, the nightmares, the cold sweats, the headaches, and the crippling mental issues have plagued many of our veterans over many eras and many wars. Today we take a step to recognize this Nation's obligation to Justin Eldridge, to Clay Hunt, to all of our veterans and to Joanna Eldridge, Susan Selke, and to the countless family members who have struggled and borne that burden side by side when their heroes have awakened at night with the nightmares and the battles they continue to fight against post-traumatic stress, the invisible wounds, and the inner demons that have come back with them from their service. I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. BOOZMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. BOOZMAN. Mr. President, on March 21, 2010, Deborah Johnson of Sherwood, AR, answered a call no parent should ever receive. Her son, 23-year-old Army Private Jeremy Andrew Johnson, was dead from a drug overdose. Private Johnson was diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder after his deployment to Afghanistan. Deborah said she thought he was getting the proper care he needed during the transition out of the military, but when she received a goodbye text from him, she knew he needed more help. The family made his commanders aware of his suicidal thoughts and Private Johnson was put on suicide watch. Three days later Deborah answered that horrible call. Deborah shared her family's story with me in hopes that other families can be spared the anguish of losing a loved one to mental illness. Deborah understands Congress has an opportunity to deliver help to veterans living with mental illness and prevent suicides by passing the Clay Hunt Suicide Prevention for American Veterans Act. This legislation would improve mental health care and suicide prevention resources for veterans by increasing access to mental health programs, providing incentives to recruit and retain psychiatrists to treat veterans and enhancing resources for members of the military transitioning to civilian life. The VA estimates 22 veterans commit suicide every day. This trend is tragic and it is unacceptable. We need to provide the VA with the personnel, services, and proper tools to help veterans facing mental illness struggles. These invisible injuries are why we struggle to identify at-risk individuals. As a member of the Senate Committee on Veterans' Affairs, my colleagues and I are working to fully understand the scope of mental illness in our veteran community. In the meantime, we are paving the way for improvements. Two weeks ago the Veterans' Affairs Committee met for its first order of business in the 114th Congress--approving the Clay Hunt SAV Act. I am proud to say the committee approved this bill with a bipartisan vote of 15 to 0. Our veterans deserve this care. The VA needs to evaluate its mental health programs using metrics common to mental health practitioners to determine the success of its programs. This legislation will do that. It will help the VA more efficiently use the taxpayer funding it receives to support the programs most effective for our veterans. The House approved this bill in January and I am confident the Senate will follow its lead. Deborah Johnson says she wishes Congress would have taken up legislation to improve mental health services years ago. As the President of the Arkansas chapter of Gold Star Mothers, Deborah hears similarities from other families who have suffered a loss because of suicide. She admits that a one-size-fits-all approach [[Page S682]] will not adequately address mental health struggles, but she is hopeful the Clay Hunt SAV Act will help prevent other families from suffering the pain hers lives with. We owe it to Deborah and others like her who have lost loved ones to this battle, as well as servicemembers and veterans coping with mental health issues, to make this one of the first bills the 114th Congress sends to President Obama to sign. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Ms. WARREN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Ms. WARREN. Mr. President, I come to the floor in strong support of the Clay Hunt Suicide Prevention for American Veterans Act. Our men and women in uniform serve our country with honor and courage. They put themselves in harm's way day in and day out to protect us. I have a special appreciation for how much servicemembers and their families contribute to our country, and how important it is that we honor their service. All three of my brothers served in the military, and my oldest brother was career military. He flew 288 combat missions in Vietnam. When you grow up in a family with someone in the military, you know how lucky you are to see them come home safely. But that doesn't mean the sacred trust with our servicemembers ends the moment they step off a plane. We owe our servicemembers the very best, and that means ensuring they always have access to high-quality services and care, including mental health care. The Clay Hunt SAV Act, introduced in the Senate by Senators John McCain and Richard Blumenthal, would strengthen critical mental health care services and suicide prevention resources for our country's veterans. We have heard the deeply troubling statistics. The VA has reported that 22 veterans die each day from suicide. Data collected in the BackHome project shows that while 10 percent of Americans served in the military, veterans make up 20 percent of all suicides in the United States. These statistics tell us something is deeply wrong and that we need to make significant changes. The SAV act calls for an evaluation of the mental health services and suicide prevention efforts of the Department of Veterans Affairs and Department of Defense, and launches a pilot program to provide education loan repayment for psychiatrists who work at the VA. It also helps build stronger partnerships between the VA and nonprofit organizations working with veterans in our communities. The SAV act is named for Clay Hunt, a marine veteran from Texas who served in Iraq and Afghanistan and was a strong advocate for improved services for his fellow veterans. He struggled with post-traumatic stress, and when he was unable to access the care he needed from the VA, he took his own life. As Clay's mother Susan Selke said in her testimony at the Senate Veterans' Affairs Committee hearing last summer: Not one more veteran should have to go through what Clay went through with the VA after returning home from the war. Not one more parent should have to testify before a congressional committee to compel the VA to fulfill its responsibilities to those who served and sacrificed. She went on to say: The reforms, evaluations, and programs directed by this legislation will be critical to helping the VA better serve and treat veterans suffering from mental injuries from war. Had the VA been doing these things all along, it very well may have saved Clay's life. I am proud Massachusetts has taken steps at the State level to help improve suicide prevention resources for veterans, such as establishing the Statewide Advocacy for Veterans' Empowerment Program, or SAVE. The SAVE team is comprised of veterans who work directly in the community to connect veterans and their families to services provided by the Commonwealth and by nonprofits. I have also visited several outstanding community organizations in Massachusetts, such as Veterans Inc. in Worcester, Soldier On in Pittsfield, and the New England Center for Homeless Veterans in Boston, that work tirelessly to help servicemembers access the full range of services they need and deserve, from housing and education to health care. In August, I met with veterans in Framingham, MA, at a mobile vet center. One of the veterans I heard from was Army MAJ Justin Fitch, who was working at the Natick Soldier Research Development and Engineering Center. Justin, who is battling terminal cancer and has had his own struggles with depression, is retiring from the Army just this week, but he is still a powerful and relentless voice fighting to improve care and prevent suicide among veterans fighting depression and psychological stress after returning home from war. Justin told me: Too many veterans are suffering in silence. Twenty-two a day is a lot. One is too many. Justin is right. Our armed service men and women are tough, smart, and courageous. They make huge sacrifices to keep our families safe, and we owe them all a true debt of gratitude for their service. But gratitude isn't enough. We must do more to protect our men and women in uniform who devote their lives to the service of our country. It is clear that Congress has more work to do to bolster our Nation's commitment to supporting veterans and providing the mental health care services they deserve. The Clay Hunt SAV Act is an important part of this effort. I hope my colleagues will join me in voting to pass this legislation in the Senate. Mr. President, I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coats). The clerk will call the roll. The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. ____________________","Congressional Record, Volume 161 Issue 17 (Monday, February 2, 2015) [Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 17 (Monday, February 2, 2015)] [Senate] [Pages S680-S682] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] CLAY HUNT SUICIDE PREVENTION FOR AMERICAN VETERANS ACT Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, I want to give you a stark fact and figure. Every year 8,000 American veterans take their own lives and commit suicide. That is more people, more veterans than were killed in all the conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan. We have a major epidemic in America's Armed Forces because of soft tissue issues of PTSD and TBI. This Congress, both Committees on Veterans' Affairs--in the House and Senate--have acted, and tomorrow this Senate will vote on the Clay Hunt suicide prevention bill. I want to talk about it for a few minutes because it is critically important. When these men and women go overseas and volunteer to serve America and lay their lives on the line for us, many come back with terrible injuries, prosthesis, an inability to walk, some in wheelchairs. But the stealth disease, the one that hurts the most, the one that permeates the most, is PTSD and TBI. We have been doing as much as we could but not enough within veterans health care. Secretary McDonald has committed himself to improving the services of mental health to our veterans. I have committed myself. Senator Blumenthal has committed himself. Senator Boozman from Arkansas, Senator McCain from Arizona, who will speak later--all are committed to see to it that we have a better program for our veterans. What the Clay Hunt suicide prevention bill does is create incentives for more psychiatric professionals to come into the VA health care system because psychiatry is the best physician expertise you need to deal with PTSD and TBI. But it also has external audits of the VA to make sure they are doing what needs to take place in terms of veterans health care and in terms of mental health for our veterans. The tragedies are daily, the tragedies are compounding, and we must find an end to it. A lot of people think these tragedies are with veterans of the gulf war, our Operation Iraqi Freedom, or our battle in Afghanistan. But, quite frankly, a lot of them are our Vietnam veterans. We looked the other way and did not recognize PTSD and TBI for a long time, but now we have recognized it front and center, and it is the major injury from the battles in Afghanistan, Iraq, and other conflicts in the history of the United States of America. We owe it to our veterans to have the best mental health available to them. In my hometown of Atlanta, on August 21, 2013, I called a field hearing at Georgia State University and brought in all the VA experts on suicide prevention because, quite frankly, we had had three suicides in the Atlanta VA within a very short period of time that got high- profile headlines in our newspaper. As it turned out, we found that we really did not have the followup, the follow-through, and the continuum of care that mental health needs and deserves, and we had some veterans who had fallen through the cracks--not just in Atlanta but around the United States of America. In fact, as recently as last week there was a tragic death in Atlanta. We do not know yet the root cause of it, but we know the individual may have had mental health problems and was a veteran of the war in Afghanistan and took their life and the life of their children. We do not know whether PTSD or TBI was the contributing cause or whether we had done anything wrong in terms of veterans health care. But we know this: Four more lives were taken from the stealth disease called tragic brain injury, post-traumatic stress disorder. So I am very pleased as the chairman of the Veterans Affairs' Committee to tell you that the House unanimously passed this bill 3 weeks ago on the floor of the House, the Senate Veterans' Affairs Committee unanimously passed it 2 weeks ago in committee, and the bill we will vote on tomorrow can go directly from the floor of the Senate to the desk of the President of the United States and be signed. Very quickly, I want to make two points for anybody who is listening that remembers last year. This bill failed last year. It failed for two reasons: One, Members questioned whether we could afford it because it had a price tag of $24 million. We have fixed the price problem by taking internally generated funds of the VA to pay the $24 million. That is done. Secondly, some said: Well, this is a duplicative service. We already have mental health services and suicide prevention at the VA. We have some, and we do not have enough. It is not duplicative. It is absolutely necessary and essential that we do what we are doing. Mr. President, I am proud to come to the floor of the Senate on behalf of all of our veterans and tell them: Washington is watching. We are listening. We feel your pain. We understand the problems you have. And we are going to do everything we can to see to it that the Clay Hunt suicide prevention bill becomes the law of the land, that the VA is held accountable for its policies and procedure in mental health, and that we put an end and stem the tide of the tragic number of veteran suicides that take place every single day. I would like to now yield to my ranking member on the Veterans' Affairs Committee, the Senator from Connecticut, who has done an overwhelmingly great job to see this through from beginning to end, Mr. Blumenthal. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut. Mr. BLUMENTHAL.

Without objection, it is so ordered. ____________________",package_114_256.csv,21220,21220,21289,"[congressional record volume 161, number 17 (monday, february 2, 2015)] [senate] [pages s680-s682] from the congressional record online through the government publishing office [ www.gpo.gov ] clay hunt suicide prevention for american veterans act mr. isakson. mr. president, i want to give you a stark fact and figure. every year 8,000 american veterans take their own lives and commit suicide. that is more people, more veterans than were killed in all the conflicts in iraq and afghanistan. we have a major epidemic in america's armed forces because of soft tissue issues of ptsd and tbi. this congress, both committees on veterans' affairs--in the house and senate--have acted, and tomorrow this senate will vote on the clay hunt suicide prevention bill. i want to talk about it for a few minutes because it is critically important. when these men and women go overseas and volunteer to serve america and lay their lives on the line for us, many come back with terrible injuries, prosthesis, an inability to walk, some in wheelchairs. but the stealth disease, the one that hurts the most, the one that permeates the most, is ptsd and tbi. we have been doing as much as we could but not enough within veterans health care. secretary mcdonald has committed himself to improving the services of mental health to our veterans. i have committed myself. senator blumenthal has committed himself. senator boozman from arkansas, senator mccain from arizona, who will speak later--all are committed to see to it that we have a better program for our veterans. what the clay hunt suicide prevention bill does is create incentives for more psychiatric professionals to come into the va health care system because psychiatry is the best physician expertise you need to deal with ptsd and tbi. but it also has external audits of the va to make sure they are doing what needs to take place in terms of veterans health care and in terms of mental health for our veterans. the tragedies are daily, the tragedies are compounding, and we must find an end to it. a lot of people think these tragedies are with veterans of the gulf war, our operation iraqi freedom, or our battle in afghanistan. but, quite frankly, a lot of them are our vietnam veterans. we looked the other way and did not recognize ptsd and tbi for a long time, but now we have recognized it front and center, and it is the major injury from the battles in afghanistan, iraq, and other conflicts in the history of the united states of america. we owe it to our veterans to have the best mental health available to them. in my hometown of atlanta, on august 21, 2013, i called a field hearing at georgia state university and brought in all the va experts on suicide prevention because, quite frankly, we had had three suicides in the atlanta va within a very short period of time that got high- profile headlines in our newspaper. as it turned out, we found that we really did not have the followup, the follow-through, and the continuum of care that mental health needs and deserves, and we had some veterans who had fallen through the cracks--not just in atlanta but around the united states of america. in fact, as recently as last week there was a tragic death in atlanta. we do not know yet the root cause of it, but we know the individual may have had mental health problems and was a veteran of the war in afghanistan and took their life and the life of their children. we do not know whether ptsd or tbi was the contributing cause or whether we had done anything wrong in terms of veterans health care. but we know this: four more lives were taken from the stealth disease called tragic brain injury, post-traumatic stress disorder. so i am very pleased as the chairman of the veterans affairs' committee to tell you that the house unanimously passed this bill 3 weeks ago on the floor of the house, the senate veterans' affairs committee unanimously passed it 2 weeks ago in committee, and the bill we will vote on tomorrow can go directly from the floor of the senate to the desk of the president of the united states and be signed. very quickly, i want to make two points for anybody who is listening that remembers last year. this bill failed last year. it failed for two reasons: one, members questioned whether we could afford it because it had a price tag of $24 million. we have fixed the price problem by taking internally generated funds of the va to pay the $24 million. that is done. secondly, some said: well, this is a duplicative service. we already have mental health services and suicide prevention at the va. we have some, and we do not have enough. it is not duplicative. it is absolutely necessary and essential that we do what we are doing. mr. president, i am proud to come to the floor of the senate on behalf of all of our veterans and tell them: washington is watching. we are listening. we feel your pain. we understand the problems you have. and we are going to do everything we can to see to it that the clay hunt suicide prevention bill becomes the law of the land, that the va is held accountable for its policies and procedure in mental health, and that we put an end and stem the tide of the tragic number of veteran suicides that take place every single day. i would like to now yield to my ranking member on the veterans' affairs committee, the senator from connecticut, who has done an overwhelmingly great job to see this through from beginning to end, mr. blumenthal. the presiding officer. the senator from connecticut. mr. blumenthal. mr. president, i begin by thanking the chairman of the veterans' affairs committee, senator isakson, and really giving him immeasurable credit for his courage and his fortitude in addressing this bill that he could have allowed to languish on the agenda of the veterans' affairs committee. in fact, he made it the very first agenda item--the very first issue--that we would confront on the veterans' affairs committee at our very first meeting, and it passed unanimously through the veterans' affairs committee because of his leadership--and i really mean his leadership in making it happen. so on behalf of the veterans of america, he deserves due credit, and so do my colleagues on the veterans' affairs committee, senator boozman and senator sanders, who championed this bill, along with senator burr. during the last session i was pleased to argue for it on the floor in the closing days of the session, and unfortunately it failed to pass. there is no reason to look back and try to blame others for that failure. what is important is to look forward and to give credit to both sides of the aisle--most especially to my colleague, senator mccain, who, of course, dwarfs us in his service to our nation in the armed forces. he literally is a giant in his service and sacrifice for our nation while serving in the navy. i have felt very privileged and proud to work with him and to introduce this measure, the clay hunt suicide prevention for american veterans act or the clay hunt sav act, as it is called, that basically provides for suicide prevention [[page s681]] services and, even more importantly, pioneers and champions mental health care for our va. i thank all of our colleagues who have worked on this bill over the past year or so because this measure gives us a tremendous opportunity to set a direction for the va and for the senate. if i may be so bold and perhaps presumptuous, i say this measure is truly bipartisan. it provides a template for bipartisan action to help our veterans, our military men and women who serve now, and to set a real lodestar for action by this body. very fittingly, we are on the floor when the democratic leader, senator reid has returned. i am tremendously heartened by his presence here and by the president's budget today, which provides a proposed increase in health care spending and, most especially, mental health care spending, to $7.4 billion from last year's expenditure of $6.7 billion. it is significant, again, in the context of a bipartisan approach to this issue. this legislation is named for clay hunt, a marine, a patriot, a veteran who served bravely in iraq. his mom, susan selke, is a real hero. she came before the veterans' affairs committee during the last session. her testimony was not only as a patriot and an advocate of veterans but as a family member. there have been too many family members forced to grieve the loss of their loved ones who have succumbed to suicide, as did clay hunt in march of 2011, after struggling valiantly and courageously with post-traumatic stress and the inadequate care of his local va hospital. far too many of clay hunt's fellow veterans, 22 per day, have succumbed to suicide, including a friend of mine, justin eldridge of southeastern connecticut. justin braved mortar fire and sniper attacks in afghanistan to return to southeastern connecticut and to his family, his children, and his wife joanna. suffering from post-traumatic brain injury and post- traumatic stress, tragically, like so many others, justin slipped through the cracks of his local va facility and eventually succumbed in his fight against those inner demons and invisible wounds when he took his own life. as brave as justin eldridge was on the battlefield, he could not win that war at home. how justin and clay fell into that black hole of depression and despair i certainly will never understand, but we grieve for them and we hope that their example of courage will inspire us to face this issue. all too often, the response to suicide--whether it is among veterans or others--is denial. it is to turn away, to look in the other direction because sometimes it is too painful or there is stigma or shame in mental health needs. we can conquer that stigma and shame. to its credit the military is doing more every day. the va has raised awareness and is increasing its commitment. this bill is a tremendous opportunity for the va to be a pioneer and champion in mental health care, just as it has been in other areas of health care, such as amputee rehabilitation, prosthetics, and traumatic brain injury. this bill is a downpayment. it is the beginning--not the end--of our commitment and our solutions to problems. it is a worthwhile measure to take limited, targeted steps--less than we must eventually do--to keep faith with our veterans and their mental health needs. i hope the committee and this congress will continue in this great, bipartisan spirit. i look forward to a continuing partnership with my friend senator isakson, who is such a leader in this area, as we work on these issues and seek to make progress as quickly as possible. as we do so--remember all of our efforts from all of the years of conflict and war in this country--senator isakson is absolutely right that post-traumatic stress and mental health needs are hardly limited to the veterans of iraq and afghanistan. i have worked hard to help veterans of the vietnam and korea eras. in fact, i successfully championed the needs of our veterans of earlier eras when they have been burdened by less-than-honorable discharge resulting from post-traumatic stress, from an era when post-traumatic stress was nonexistent as a diagnosis. post-traumatic stress was unknown for our vietnam and korea veterans. it was not unknown as a condition. it was not nonexistent. it was simply unknown has a diagnosis. it was not called post-traumatic stress. it may have been called shell shock or battle fatigue. but the horror, the nightmares, the cold sweats, the headaches, and the crippling mental issues have plagued many of our veterans over many eras and many wars. today we take a step to recognize this nation's obligation to justin eldridge, to clay hunt, to all of our veterans and to joanna eldridge, susan selke, and to the countless family members who have struggled and borne that burden side by side when their heroes have awakened at night with the nightmares and the battles they continue to fight against post-traumatic stress, the invisible wounds, and the inner demons that have come back with them from their service. i yield the floor. i suggest the absence of a quorum. the presiding officer. the clerk will call the roll. the legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. mr. boozman. mr. president, i ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. the presiding officer. without objection, it is so ordered. mr. boozman. mr. president, on march 21, 2010, deborah johnson of sherwood, ar, answered a call no parent should ever receive. her son, 23-year-old army private jeremy andrew johnson, was dead from a drug overdose. private johnson was diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder after his deployment to afghanistan. deborah said she thought he was getting the proper care he needed during the transition out of the military, but when she received a goodbye text from him, she knew he needed more help. the family made his commanders aware of his suicidal thoughts and private johnson was put on suicide watch. three days later deborah answered that horrible call. deborah shared her family's story with me in hopes that other families can be spared the anguish of losing a loved one to mental illness. deborah understands congress has an opportunity to deliver help to veterans living with mental illness and prevent suicides by passing the clay hunt suicide prevention for american veterans act. this legislation would improve mental health care and suicide prevention resources for veterans by increasing access to mental health programs, providing incentives to recruit and retain psychiatrists to treat veterans and enhancing resources for members of the military transitioning to civilian life. the va estimates 22 veterans commit suicide every day. this trend is tragic and it is unacceptable. we need to provide the va with the personnel, services, and proper tools to help veterans facing mental illness struggles. these invisible injuries are why we struggle to identify at-risk individuals. as a member of the senate committee on veterans' affairs, my colleagues and i are working to fully understand the scope of mental illness in our veteran community. in the meantime, we are paving the way for improvements. two weeks ago the veterans' affairs committee met for its first order of business in the 114th congress--approving the clay hunt sav act. i am proud to say the committee approved this bill with a bipartisan vote of 15 to 0. our veterans deserve this care. the va needs to evaluate its mental health programs using metrics common to mental health practitioners to determine the success of its programs. this legislation will do that. it will help the va more efficiently use the taxpayer funding it receives to support the programs most effective for our veterans. the house approved this bill in january and i am confident the senate will follow its lead. deborah johnson says she wishes congress would have taken up legislation to improve mental health services years ago. as the president of the arkansas chapter of gold star mothers, deborah hears similarities from other families who have suffered a loss because of suicide. she admits that a one-size-fits-all approach [[page s682]] will not adequately address mental health struggles, but she is hopeful the clay hunt sav act will help prevent other families from suffering the pain hers lives with. we owe it to deborah and others like her who have lost loved ones to this battle, as well as servicemembers and veterans coping with mental health issues, to make this one of the first bills the 114th congress sends to president obama to sign. i suggest the absence of a quorum. the presiding officer. the clerk will call the roll. the legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. ms. warren. mr. president, i ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. the presiding officer. without objection, it is so ordered. ms. warren. mr. president, i come to the floor in strong support of the clay hunt suicide prevention for american veterans act. our men and women in uniform serve our country with honor and courage. they put themselves in harm's way day in and day out to protect us. i have a special appreciation for how much servicemembers and their families contribute to our country, and how important it is that we honor their service. all three of my brothers served in the military, and my oldest brother was career military. he flew 288 combat missions in vietnam. when you grow up in a family with someone in the military, you know how lucky you are to see them come home safely. but that doesn't mean the sacred trust with our servicemembers ends the moment they step off a plane. we owe our servicemembers the very best, and that means ensuring they always have access to high-quality services and care, including mental health care. the clay hunt sav act, introduced in the senate by senators john mccain and richard blumenthal, would strengthen critical mental health care services and suicide prevention resources for our country's veterans. we have heard the deeply troubling statistics. the va has reported that 22 veterans die each day from suicide. data collected in the backhome project shows that while 10 percent of americans served in the military, veterans make up 20 percent of all suicides in the united states. these statistics tell us something is deeply wrong and that we need to make significant changes. the sav act calls for an evaluation of the mental health services and suicide prevention efforts of the department of veterans affairs and department of defense, and launches a pilot program to provide education loan repayment for psychiatrists who work at the va. it also helps build stronger partnerships between the va and nonprofit organizations working with veterans in our communities. the sav act is named for clay hunt, a marine veteran from texas who served in iraq and afghanistan and was a strong advocate for improved services for his fellow veterans. he struggled with post-traumatic stress, and when he was unable to access the care he needed from the va, he took his own life. as clay's mother susan selke said in her testimony at the senate veterans' affairs committee hearing last summer: not one more veteran should have to go through what clay went through with the va after returning home from the war. not one more parent should have to testify before a congressional committee to compel the va to fulfill its responsibilities to those who served and sacrificed. she went on to say: the reforms, evaluations, and programs directed by this legislation will be critical to helping the va better serve and treat veterans suffering from mental injuries from war. had the va been doing these things all along, it very well may have saved clay's life. i am proud massachusetts has taken steps at the state level to help improve suicide prevention resources for veterans, such as establishing the statewide advocacy for veterans' empowerment program, or save. the save team is comprised of veterans who work directly in the community to connect veterans and their families to services provided by the commonwealth and by nonprofits. i have also visited several outstanding community organizations in massachusetts, such as veterans inc. in worcester, soldier on in pittsfield, and the new england center for homeless veterans in boston, that work tirelessly to help servicemembers access the full range of services they need and deserve, from housing and education to health care. in august, i met with veterans in framingham, ma, at a mobile vet center. one of the veterans i heard from was army maj justin fitch, who was working at the natick soldier research development and engineering center. justin, who is battling terminal cancer and has had his own struggles with depression, is retiring from the army just this week, but he is still a powerful and relentless voice fighting to improve care and prevent suicide among veterans fighting depression and psychological stress after returning home from war. justin told me: too many veterans are suffering in silence. twenty-two a day is a lot. one is too many. justin is right. our armed service men and women are tough, smart, and courageous. they make huge sacrifices to keep our families safe, and we owe them all a true debt of gratitude for their service. but gratitude isn't enough. we must do more to protect our men and women in uniform who devote their lives to the service of our country. it is clear that congress has more work to do to bolster our nation's commitment to supporting veterans and providing the mental health care services they deserve. the clay hunt sav act is an important part of this effort. i hope my colleagues will join me in voting to pass this legislation in the senate. mr. president, i yield the floor. i suggest the absence of a quorum. the presiding officer (mr. coats). the clerk will call the roll. the legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. mr. whitehouse. mr. president, i ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. the presiding officer. without objection, it is so ordered. ____________________",21220
CREC-2015-02-02-pt1-PgS682,CREC-2015-02-02,114,CLIMATE CHANGE,"[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 17 (Monday, February 2, 2015)] [Senate] [Pages S682-S686] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] CLIMATE CHANGE Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I am here now for the 88th time to urge this body to wake up to the looming threat of climate change. In the last few weeks, my Republican colleagues have talked about climate change here on the floor more than at any other time since I began giving these weekly speeches. We had heard next to nothing from Republicans about climate change since the 2010 Citizens United decision. That decision let loose the fossil fuel industry to cast an ever darker shadow of intimidation across this town. So this minor outbreak of dialogue, although minor, has been significant. All but one of my Republican colleagues is now on the record saying they agree that climate change is real, and 15 voted that it is caused at least in some part by humans. That is some progress. Yet some still persist in their denial. Our scientists now tell us that warming of the climate system is ``unequivocal.'' Yet we equivocate. Scientists are a careful bunch. When they say something is unequivocal, we ought to take note. The senior Senator from Oklahoma, our chairman of the Environmental and Public Works Committee, however, maintains that human-caused climate change is a hoax. He thinks it is arrogant to say that humans could cause the climate to change. What is really arrogant is thinking we can ignore the laws of nature, the laws of physics, the laws of chemistry, the laws of biology. Whose laws do we think those are? Those laws were given to us by our Creator. They came with this world. They are immutable. These laws of nature dictate that carbon dioxide is the byproduct of our burning of fossil fuels. These laws of nature, fresh from the hands of our Creator, explain why carbon traps heat in our atmosphere-- something we have known since Abraham Lincoln was riding around this town in his top hat. Here in the Senate, we have no human power to amend or repeal those laws--and here in the Senate, we shouldn't cherry-pick from the scientific record. That is not fair play. Here on the floor, the EPW chairman paraphrased a 2013 paper from the journal Nature, saying: [[Page S683]] . . . there is considerable uncertainty as to whether [increases in extreme climate variability] is occurring. The author of the paper, Dr. Chris Huntingford of the UK's National Environmental Research Council, took exception to his paper being mischaracterized. He said this: Our Nature paper strictly analyzes only year-to-year variability (fluctuations) in temperature. . . . We do not at any point offer evidence against a general on-going background and upwards warming trend. Detection and attribution statistical studies show that the observed average increasing temperatures are almost certainly a consequence of the burning of fossil fuels. In that same floor speech, my colleague from Oklahoma suggested we could relax about climate change because the Munich Reinsurance Company said weather-related disaster losses have declined as a proportion of GDP worldwide. He neglected to mention testimony before our EPW Committee last July by Munich Re's head of risk accumulation in the United States, Carl Hedde, to wit: Due to our history of insuring natural catastrophe, Munich Re was one of the first companies in the industry to recognize the impact that weather-related events and a changing climate could have on its business model and customers. As a nation, we need to take steps to reduce the societal impact of weather events as we see greater variability and volatility in our climate. The senior Senator from Oklahoma has even resurrected the ghost of Climategate, that faux scandal whipped up a few years ago by the polluters and their allies to suggest climate scientists were colluding to exaggerate global warming data. Turned out it was the cooked-up, phony scandal that was exaggerated and not the data. So-called ClimateGate should actually be accurately called ClimateGate-Gate. Yet years later this zombie falsehood still staggers about the floor of the Senate attempting to cast doubt on human-caused climate change. The polluters have relentlessly made it their business to misconstrue the findings of scientific works and to cling to discredited accusations. We would do well to listen to the overwhelming majority of practicing, publishing climate scientists who agree our carbon pollution is altering the climate. Scientists who conduct experiments, who examine data, who arrive at conclusions, who submit their work through peer review, and who make their data accessible for due diligence by other researchers. It is the best science out there. But I am afraid those scientists don't have the ear of the senior Senator from Oklahoma. He showed us whom he listens to. He brought a chart to the floor showing several dozen ``recognized'' scientists--as he called them--who don't buy the climate consensus. That chart was produced by an outfit called the Heartland Institute. You may remember them for associating climate scientists with the Unabomber--a classy group. Their scientists, so-called, included bloggers, columnists, staff of conservative think tanks, a member of the European Parliament, and many scientists who have been funded by the fossil fuel industry. I will side with the scientists affiliated with the American Association for the Advancement of Science over a bunch of carefully selected bloggers. I will trust NASA and NOAA over scientists who shill for the fossil fuel industry. The Heartland Institute is not alone. It is part of a sophisticated network of climate denial propped up by the carbon-polluting fossil fuel industry. It is a front group fueled by the special interests and their dubious experts. Interestingly, if we go to Oklahoma State University, we will find one of the experts on this. Dr. Riley Dunlap at Oklahoma State could tell his Senator all about it. Professor Dunlap is one of the preeminent researchers into the deliberate and coordinated effort by corporate interests to spread denial propaganda and distort public opinion on climate change--what he calls the ``organized climate-denial machine.'' Dunlap and a colleague found that nearly 90 percent of climate denial books coming out of publishing houses between 1982 and 2010--guess what--had ties to conservative fossil fuel-funded think tanks such as the Heartland Institute. The whole thing is a rigged game and a phony, and there is a very good professor at Oklahoma State University who keeps track of it. I also have a fact sheet from the Oklahoma Climatological Survey, its statement on climate change and its implications for Oklahoma. Here is what it says in plain language: The Earth's climate has warmed during the last 100 years. The Earth's climate will continue to warm for the foreseeable future, and much of the global temperature increases over the last 50 years can be attributed to human activities, particularly increasing greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. That is actually a noncontroversial statement among regular scientists. This is no radical with some political agenda. This is a fact sheet from a State scientific agency. It happens to be Oklahoma's. Here is what the agency expects this means for Oklahoma: earlier maturation of winter wheat and orchard crops, leaving them more vulnerable to late freeze events; drought frequency increases, especially during the summer; drier and warmer conditions increasing the risk of wildfires; rain-free periods lengthening with individual rainfall events becoming more intense, with more runoff and flash flooding occurring. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have this statement printed in the Record. There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows: [From the Oklahoma Climatological Survey] Statement on Climate Change and Its Implications for Oklahoma ``Warming of the climate system is unequivocal, as is now evident from observations of increases in global average air and ocean temperatures, widespread melting of snow and ice, and rising global average sea level.'' --the Fourth Assessment of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). That statement reflects the essence of a vast amount of observational data and climate research: the earth's climate has warmed on average during the last 100 years and will continue to warm through the 21st century. Further, ample evidence from observational data and climate modeling studies indicates that this global-scale warming is not attributable to natural variability. The Oklahoma Climatological Survey (OCS) has been mandated by the Oklahoma legislature to provide climate information and expertise which could be of value to the public, as well as to state policy- and decision-makers. In accordance with that directive, OCS has conducted a review of the current assessments of climate change research and concludes the following to be true: Across the globe, a warming climate will be beneficial to some and detrimental to others. Anticipating how this climatic shift will impact Oklahoma is of vital importance to state decision-makers. One of the greatest impacts will be the exposure of Oklahoma's growing population and economy to water stress. Oklahoma's future requires access to fresh water. Thus, due diligence in protecting our water resources and adapting to future climate variability is paramount if we are to maintain and improve the quality of life and the economy of Oklahoma. The Science of Global Climate Change The earth's climate is always changing. Evidence such as tree ring and ice core studies indicates large and sometimes abrupt climate changes have occurred in the earth's distant past, lasting centuries to millennia. These climate swings are attributed to natural variations, such as changes in the output of the sun or shifts in the earth's orbit. Oklahoma has exhibited distinct climate periods attributable to natural variability in the last 100 years, from the decadal- scale droughts of the 1920s, 1930s and 1950s to an extended period of abundant precipitation during the 1980s and 1990s. Mounting evidence continues to indicate, however, that human activities have begun to impact the earth's climate through the release of greenhouse gases. Ice core studies show carbon dioxide and methane are at their greatest levels within the last 650,000 years. Due to the extended periods required for these gases to be removed from the atmosphere, further emissions during the 21st century will cause additional warming for more than a millennium. In fact, even if greenhouse gas concentrations were held steady since the year 2000, the earth is committed to decades of warming from heat already absorbed by the oceans. Global Climate Change Impacts for Oklahoma The continued warming of the climate averaged across the globe will create a cascade of climatic shifts which could impact Oklahoma's climate. These shifts will not mean an end of year-to-year natural variability--hot years and cold years will continue, as will wet years and dry years. The projected changes will be seen at time scales averaged over a decade or more. Little is known of the effects climate change will have on severe weather. The ingredients required for severe weather involve complex [[Page S684]] combinations that do not exhibit clear changes in a warming climate. Further, global climate models are unable to accurately simulate small scale weather events like thunderstorms or tornadoes. Recommendations OCS recommends that Oklahoma aggressively pursue four initiatives to address the risks of both climate variability and climate change. First, the state should undertake a comprehensive assessment of Oklahoma's social and economic vulnerability to climate variability as well as climate change. Learning to adapt to nature's extremes now will yield benefits in reduced disaster losses, regardless of the future trajectory of climate change. Climate change may also bring economic opportunities that would be identified in such an assessment. Second, OCS recommends immediate funding of the Oklahoma Water Resources Board's Comprehensive Water Plan study to identify existing as well as projected needs for water. Third, OCS encourages efficiency programs to reduce our growing demand for energy. Fourth, OCS recommends investment in renewable energy technology and production. Oklahoma has already demonstrated the successes of wind energy; similar efforts should be undertaken to advance development of solar and sustainable bio-energy as well as fostering further research and development of wind energy. Even if climate does not evolve as expected, these steps will yield long-term benefits to Oklahoma's society and economy through reduced losses to existing climate and weather threats and cost-savings through reduced energy use. If climate does evolve as expected, Oklahoma will be better positioned to adapt to those changes without rapid social upheaval. Furthermore, building resilience to climate and weather events will help position Oklahoma at a relative advantage to neighboring states, especially in attracting businesses that are dependent upon a continuous water supply. This statement is the first in a series issued by OCS which delineates the impacts, both beneficial and detrimental, of a warming climate system on the economy of Oklahoma and the quality of life for Oklahomans. Further statements will illuminate possible impacts to specific industries, such as water management and agriculture. Mr. WHITEHOUSE. The National Climate Assessment estimates that by the end of the century the temperatures in the Southern Great Plains will increase up to 9 degrees. Mark Shafer is a researcher at the Oklahoma Climatological Survey who contributed to the National Climate Assessment. He told the Oklahoman newspaper that in a few decades Oklahoma could see 100-plus temperatures every summer. By century's end, daily temperatures could top 100 degrees for the entire summer. As the climate warms, droughts will probably get worse, both more severe and more frequent. Nine Oklahoma professors from Oral Roberts University, Southern Nazarene University, and the University of Tulsa were among 200 evangelical scientists and academics to sign a 2013 letter to Congress imploring us to address climate change. All of God's Creation . . . is groaning under the weight of our uncontrolled use of fossil fuels. . . . The threat to future generations and global prosperity means we can no longer afford complacency and endless debate. We as a society risk being counted among ``those who destroy the earth.'' Those who know the Bible will know that reference to ``those who destroy the earth'' comes from Revelations. I will quote from Revelations: ``And Thy wrath is come, and the time . . . that thou . . . shouldst destroy them which destroy the earth.'' The letter warns that the way we live harms our neighbors, threatening to create more empty wells, devastated cropland, loss of villages, environmental refugees, and disease. I ask unanimous consent to have that letter from the 200 evangelical scientists printed in the Record. There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows: July 10, 2013. Dear Speaker Boehner, Senate Majority Leader Reid, and Members of the United States Congress: As evangelical scientists and academics, we understand climate change is real and action is urgently needed. All of God's Creation-- humans and our environment--is groaning under the weight of our uncontrolled use of fossil fuels, bringing on a warming planet, melting ice, and rising seas. The negative consequences and burdens of a changing climate will fall disproportionately on those whom Jesus called ``the least of these'': the poor, vulnerable, and oppressed. Our nation has entrusted you with political power; we plead with you to lead on this issue and enact policies this year that will protect our climate and help us all to be better stewards of Creation. Average global temperatures are at their highest level within the measurement record, and we are beginning to see indications of increasingly disturbed weather. For example, 2012 was the hottest year ever recorded for the contiguous United States, and it will go down as one of the most destructive and disruptive years in U.S. history: wildfires, drought, superstorms, and public health outbreaks. This past year is only one example of the patterns of change we expect to see as the climate warms globally. We're already spending billions in emergency aid for the victims of hurricanes and weather disasters, and these expenses will only increase as the ``once in a lifetime'' storms become the new normal. The Bible tells us that ``love does no harm to its neighbor'' (Romans 13:10), yet the way we live now harms our neighbors, both locally and globally. For the world's poorest people, climate change means dried-up wells in Africa, floods in Asia that wash away crops and homes, wildfires in the U.S. and Russia, loss of villages and food species in the Arctic, environmental refugees, and disease. Our changing climate threatens the health, security, and well-being of millions of people who are made in God's image. The threat to future generations and global prosperity means we can no longer afford complacency and endless debate. We as a society risk being counted among ``those who destroy the earth'' (Revelation 11:18). We call on you to pass meaningful legislation during this Congress to reduce carbon emissions and protect our environment, thereby strengthening the long-term outlook for our economy and our children. As Christian scientists and educators, we offer our knowledge, experience, and prayerful witness to assist you and all of our nation's leaders who are willing to address this urgent challenge.

Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Finally, Mr. President, at the University of Oklahoma Berrien Moore III is dean of the College of Atmosphere and Geographic Sciences. He is also Director of the National Weather Center. Dean Moore of the University of Oklahoma was a lead author on an intergovernmental panel on climate change report, which the Senator from Oklahoma is so fond of disparaging. Dr. Moore's work helped the IPCC earn the Nobel Peace Prize in 2007. He has won research accolades from NOAA and from NASA. In 2009 Dr. Moore testified before the House Committee on Science, Space, and Technology. Here is what he had to say about climate change: On the increasing strength of Earth science, we now can state that global warming is ``unequivocal,''-- There is that word again-- but this simply sets the challenge. We need now-- This is 5 years ago, by the way-- to develop the capability to monitor and thereby manage greenhouse gas emissions through this century and beyond. . . . The challenge is growing and will not go away. The effects of climate change are all too real in Oklahoma, in Rhode Island, [[Page S686]] and across the Nation. If you don't believe me, go to Oklahoma State and the University of Oklahoma and talk to the scientists I just mentioned. The outlook for us if we fail to act is increasingly dark. But look again at Oklahoma. The Sooner State is the fourth largest producer of wind power in the country. Wind turbines there make progress toward energy independence and they give Oklahoma farmers steady income as a hedge against droughts and extreme weather. So people farm and they get paid for having a wind turbine located on your farm. It is a win-win. Gary McManus, the Oklahoma State climatologist, has given a number of presentations on climate change and its likely effects on his home State. He often prefaces those talks with this admonition: This is the science. It is up to you to decide what you do with it. You can either ignore it or you can use it. In my view, there will be a high price in harm and in infamy to this democracy if we continue to ignore it. So I say let's use it, but first we will have to wake up. Mr. President, I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa. (The remarks of Mr. Grassley pertaining to the introduction of S. 335 are printed in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced Bills and Joint Resolutions.'') Mr. GRASSLEY. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The absence of a quorum is suggested, and the clerk will call the roll. The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 17 (Monday, February 2, 2015)] [Senate] [Pages S682-S686] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] CLIMATE CHANGE Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I am here now for the 88th time to urge this body to wake up to the looming threat of climate change. In the last few weeks, my Republican colleagues have talked about climate change here on the floor more than at any other time since I began giving these weekly speeches. We had heard next to nothing from Republicans about climate change since the 2010 Citizens United decision. That decision let loose the fossil fuel industry to cast an ever darker shadow of intimidation across this town. So this minor outbreak of dialogue, although minor, has been significant. All but one of my Republican colleagues is now on the record saying they agree that climate change is real, and 15 voted that it is caused at least in some part by humans. That is some progress. Yet some still persist in their denial. Our scientists now tell us that warming of the climate system is ``unequivocal.'' Yet we equivocate. Scientists are a careful bunch. When they say something is unequivocal, we ought to take note. The senior Senator from Oklahoma, our chairman of the Environmental and Public Works Committee, however, maintains that human-caused climate change is a hoax. He thinks it is arrogant to say that humans could cause the climate to change. What is really arrogant is thinking we can ignore the laws of nature, the laws of physics, the laws of chemistry, the laws of biology. Whose laws do we think those are? Those laws were given to us by our Creator. They came with this world. They are immutable. These laws of nature dictate that carbon dioxide is the byproduct of our burning of fossil fuels. These laws of nature, fresh from the hands of our Creator, explain why carbon traps heat in our atmosphere-- something we have known since Abraham Lincoln was riding around this town in his top hat. Here in the Senate, we have no human power to amend or repeal those laws--and here in the Senate, we shouldn't cherry-pick from the scientific record. That is not fair play. Here on the floor, the EPW chairman paraphrased a 2013 paper from the journal Nature, saying: [[Page S683]] . . . there is considerable uncertainty as to whether [increases in extreme climate variability] is occurring. The author of the paper, Dr. Chris Huntingford of the UK's National Environmental Research Council, took exception to his paper being mischaracterized. He said this: Our Nature paper strictly analyzes only year-to-year variability (fluctuations) in temperature. . . . We do not at any point offer evidence against a general on-going background and upwards warming trend. Detection and attribution statistical studies show that the observed average increasing temperatures are almost certainly a consequence of the burning of fossil fuels. In that same floor speech, my colleague from Oklahoma suggested we could relax about climate change because the Munich Reinsurance Company said weather-related disaster losses have declined as a proportion of GDP worldwide. He neglected to mention testimony before our EPW Committee last July by Munich Re's head of risk accumulation in the United States, Carl Hedde, to wit: Due to our history of insuring natural catastrophe, Munich Re was one of the first companies in the industry to recognize the impact that weather-related events and a changing climate could have on its business model and customers. As a nation, we need to take steps to reduce the societal impact of weather events as we see greater variability and volatility in our climate. The senior Senator from Oklahoma has even resurrected the ghost of Climategate, that faux scandal whipped up a few years ago by the polluters and their allies to suggest climate scientists were colluding to exaggerate global warming data. Turned out it was the cooked-up, phony scandal that was exaggerated and not the data. So-called ClimateGate should actually be accurately called ClimateGate-Gate. Yet years later this zombie falsehood still staggers about the floor of the Senate attempting to cast doubt on human-caused climate change. The polluters have relentlessly made it their business to misconstrue the findings of scientific works and to cling to discredited accusations. We would do well to listen to the overwhelming majority of practicing, publishing climate scientists who agree our carbon pollution is altering the climate. Scientists who conduct experiments, who examine data, who arrive at conclusions, who submit their work through peer review, and who make their data accessible for due diligence by other researchers. It is the best science out there. But I am afraid those scientists don't have the ear of the senior Senator from Oklahoma. He showed us whom he listens to. He brought a chart to the floor showing several dozen ``recognized'' scientists--as he called them--who don't buy the climate consensus. That chart was produced by an outfit called the Heartland Institute. You may remember them for associating climate scientists with the Unabomber--a classy group. Their scientists, so-called, included bloggers, columnists, staff of conservative think tanks, a member of the European Parliament, and many scientists who have been funded by the fossil fuel industry. I will side with the scientists affiliated with the American Association for the Advancement of Science over a bunch of carefully selected bloggers. I will trust NASA and NOAA over scientists who shill for the fossil fuel industry. The Heartland Institute is not alone. It is part of a sophisticated network of climate denial propped up by the carbon-polluting fossil fuel industry. It is a front group fueled by the special interests and their dubious experts. Interestingly, if we go to Oklahoma State University, we will find one of the experts on this. Dr. Riley Dunlap at Oklahoma State could tell his Senator all about it. Professor Dunlap is one of the preeminent researchers into the deliberate and coordinated effort by corporate interests to spread denial propaganda and distort public opinion on climate change--what he calls the ``organized climate-denial machine.'' Dunlap and a colleague found that nearly 90 percent of climate denial books coming out of publishing houses between 1982 and 2010--guess what--had ties to conservative fossil fuel-funded think tanks such as the Heartland Institute. The whole thing is a rigged game and a phony, and there is a very good professor at Oklahoma State University who keeps track of it. I also have a fact sheet from the Oklahoma Climatological Survey, its statement on climate change and its implications for Oklahoma. Here is what it says in plain language: The Earth's climate has warmed during the last 100 years. The Earth's climate will continue to warm for the foreseeable future, and much of the global temperature increases over the last 50 years can be attributed to human activities, particularly increasing greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. That is actually a noncontroversial statement among regular scientists. This is no radical with some political agenda. This is a fact sheet from a State scientific agency. It happens to be Oklahoma's. Here is what the agency expects this means for Oklahoma: earlier maturation of winter wheat and orchard crops, leaving them more vulnerable to late freeze events; drought frequency increases, especially during the summer; drier and warmer conditions increasing the risk of wildfires; rain-free periods lengthening with individual rainfall events becoming more intense, with more runoff and flash flooding occurring. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have this statement printed in the Record. There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows: [From the Oklahoma Climatological Survey] Statement on Climate Change and Its Implications for Oklahoma ``Warming of the climate system is unequivocal, as is now evident from observations of increases in global average air and ocean temperatures, widespread melting of snow and ice, and rising global average sea level.'' --the Fourth Assessment of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). That statement reflects the essence of a vast amount of observational data and climate research: the earth's climate has warmed on average during the last 100 years and will continue to warm through the 21st century. Further, ample evidence from observational data and climate modeling studies indicates that this global-scale warming is not attributable to natural variability. The Oklahoma Climatological Survey (OCS) has been mandated by the Oklahoma legislature to provide climate information and expertise which could be of value to the public, as well as to state policy- and decision-makers. In accordance with that directive, OCS has conducted a review of the current assessments of climate change research and concludes the following to be true: Across the globe, a warming climate will be beneficial to some and detrimental to others. Anticipating how this climatic shift will impact Oklahoma is of vital importance to state decision-makers. One of the greatest impacts will be the exposure of Oklahoma's growing population and economy to water stress. Oklahoma's future requires access to fresh water. Thus, due diligence in protecting our water resources and adapting to future climate variability is paramount if we are to maintain and improve the quality of life and the economy of Oklahoma. The Science of Global Climate Change The earth's climate is always changing. Evidence such as tree ring and ice core studies indicates large and sometimes abrupt climate changes have occurred in the earth's distant past, lasting centuries to millennia. These climate swings are attributed to natural variations, such as changes in the output of the sun or shifts in the earth's orbit. Oklahoma has exhibited distinct climate periods attributable to natural variability in the last 100 years, from the decadal- scale droughts of the 1920s, 1930s and 1950s to an extended period of abundant precipitation during the 1980s and 1990s. Mounting evidence continues to indicate, however, that human activities have begun to impact the earth's climate through the release of greenhouse gases. Ice core studies show carbon dioxide and methane are at their greatest levels within the last 650,000 years. Due to the extended periods required for these gases to be removed from the atmosphere, further emissions during the 21st century will cause additional warming for more than a millennium. In fact, even if greenhouse gas concentrations were held steady since the year 2000, the earth is committed to decades of warming from heat already absorbed by the oceans. Global Climate Change Impacts for Oklahoma The continued warming of the climate averaged across the globe will create a cascade of climatic shifts which could impact Oklahoma's climate. These shifts will not mean an end of year-to-year natural variability--hot years and cold years will continue, as will wet years and dry years. The projected changes will be seen at time scales averaged over a decade or more. Little is known of the effects climate change will have on severe weather. The ingredients required for severe weather involve complex [[Page S684]] combinations that do not exhibit clear changes in a warming climate. Further, global climate models are unable to accurately simulate small scale weather events like thunderstorms or tornadoes. Recommendations OCS recommends that Oklahoma aggressively pursue four initiatives to address the risks of both climate variability and climate change. First, the state should undertake a comprehensive assessment of Oklahoma's social and economic vulnerability to climate variability as well as climate change. Learning to adapt to nature's extremes now will yield benefits in reduced disaster losses, regardless of the future trajectory of climate change. Climate change may also bring economic opportunities that would be identified in such an assessment. Second, OCS recommends immediate funding of the Oklahoma Water Resources Board's Comprehensive Water Plan study to identify existing as well as projected needs for water. Third, OCS encourages efficiency programs to reduce our growing demand for energy. Fourth, OCS recommends investment in renewable energy technology and production. Oklahoma has already demonstrated the successes of wind energy; similar efforts should be undertaken to advance development of solar and sustainable bio-energy as well as fostering further research and development of wind energy. Even if climate does not evolve as expected, these steps will yield long-term benefits to Oklahoma's society and economy through reduced losses to existing climate and weather threats and cost-savings through reduced energy use. If climate does evolve as expected, Oklahoma will be better positioned to adapt to those changes without rapid social upheaval. Furthermore, building resilience to climate and weather events will help position Oklahoma at a relative advantage to neighboring states, especially in attracting businesses that are dependent upon a continuous water supply. This statement is the first in a series issued by OCS which delineates the impacts, both beneficial and detrimental, of a warming climate system on the economy of Oklahoma and the quality of life for Oklahomans. Further statements will illuminate possible impacts to specific industries, such as water management and agriculture. Mr. WHITEHOUSE. The National Climate Assessment estimates that by the end of the century the temperatures in the Southern Great Plains will increase up to 9 degrees. Mark Shafer is a researcher at the Oklahoma Climatological Survey who contributed to the National Climate Assessment. He told the Oklahoman newspaper that in a few decades Oklahoma could see 100-plus temperatures every summer. By century's end, daily temperatures could top 100 degrees for the entire summer. As the climate warms, droughts will probably get worse, both more severe and more frequent. Nine Oklahoma professors from Oral Roberts University, Southern Nazarene University, and the University of Tulsa were among 200 evangelical scientists and academics to sign a 2013 letter to Congress imploring us to address climate change. All of God's Creation . . . is groaning under the weight of our uncontrolled use of fossil fuels. . . . The threat to future generations and global prosperity means we can no longer afford complacency and endless debate. We as a society risk being counted among ``those who destroy the earth.'' Those who know the Bible will know that reference to ``those who destroy the earth'' comes from Revelations. I will quote from Revelations: ``And Thy wrath is come, and the time . . . that thou . . . shouldst destroy them which destroy the earth.'' The letter warns that the way we live harms our neighbors, threatening to create more empty wells, devastated cropland, loss of villages, environmental refugees, and disease. I ask unanimous consent to have that letter from the 200 evangelical scientists printed in the Record. There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows: July 10, 2013. Dear Speaker Boehner, Senate Majority Leader Reid, and Members of the United States Congress: As evangelical scientists and academics, we understand climate change is real and action is urgently needed. All of God's Creation-- humans and our environment--is groaning under the weight of our uncontrolled use of fossil fuels, bringing on a warming planet, melting ice, and rising seas. The negative consequences and burdens of a changing climate will fall disproportionately on those whom Jesus called ``the least of these'': the poor, vulnerable, and oppressed. Our nation has entrusted you with political power; we plead with you to lead on this issue and enact policies this year that will protect our climate and help us all to be better stewards of Creation. Average global temperatures are at their highest level within the measurement record, and we are beginning to see indications of increasingly disturbed weather. For example, 2012 was the hottest year ever recorded for the contiguous United States, and it will go down as one of the most destructive and disruptive years in U.S. history: wildfires, drought, superstorms, and public health outbreaks. This past year is only one example of the patterns of change we expect to see as the climate warms globally. We're already spending billions in emergency aid for the victims of hurricanes and weather disasters, and these expenses will only increase as the ``once in a lifetime'' storms become the new normal. The Bible tells us that ``love does no harm to its neighbor'' (Romans 13:10), yet the way we live now harms our neighbors, both locally and globally. For the world's poorest people, climate change means dried-up wells in Africa, floods in Asia that wash away crops and homes, wildfires in the U.S. and Russia, loss of villages and food species in the Arctic, environmental refugees, and disease. Our changing climate threatens the health, security, and well-being of millions of people who are made in God's image. The threat to future generations and global prosperity means we can no longer afford complacency and endless debate. We as a society risk being counted among ``those who destroy the earth'' (Revelation 11:18). We call on you to pass meaningful legislation during this Congress to reduce carbon emissions and protect our environment, thereby strengthening the long-term outlook for our economy and our children. As Christian scientists and educators, we offer our knowledge, experience, and prayerful witness to assist you and all of our nation's leaders who are willing to address this urgent challenge.

Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Finally, Mr. President, at the University of Oklahoma Berrien Moore III is dean of the College of Atmosphere and Geographic Sciences. He is also Director of the National Weather Center. Dean Moore of the University of Oklahoma was a lead author on an intergovernmental panel on climate change report, which the Senator from Oklahoma is so fond of disparaging. Dr. Moore's work helped the IPCC earn the Nobel Peace Prize in 2007. He has won research accolades from NOAA and from NASA. In 2009 Dr. Moore testified before the House Committee on Science, Space, and Technology. Here is what he had to say about climate change: On the increasing strength of Earth science, we now can state that global warming is ``unequivocal,''-- There is that word again-- but this simply sets the challenge. We need now-- This is 5 years ago, by the way-- to develop the capability to monitor and thereby manage greenhouse gas emissions through this century and beyond. . . . The challenge is growing and will not go away. The effects of climate change are all too real in Oklahoma, in Rhode Island, [[Page S686]] and across the Nation. If you don't believe me, go to Oklahoma State and the University of Oklahoma and talk to the scientists I just mentioned. The outlook for us if we fail to act is increasingly dark. But look again at Oklahoma. The Sooner State is the fourth largest producer of wind power in the country. Wind turbines there make progress toward energy independence and they give Oklahoma farmers steady income as a hedge against droughts and extreme weather. So people farm and they get paid for having a wind turbine located on your farm. It is a win-win. Gary McManus, the Oklahoma State climatologist, has given a number of presentations on climate change and its likely effects on his home State. He often prefaces those talks with this admonition: This is the science. It is up to you to decide what you do with it. You can either ignore it or you can use it. In my view, there will be a high price in harm and in infamy to this democracy if we continue to ignore it. So I say let's use it, but first we will have to wake up. Mr. President, I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa. (The remarks of Mr. Grassley pertaining to the introduction of S. 335 are printed in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced Bills and Joint Resolutions.'') Mr. GRASSLEY. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The absence of a quorum is suggested, and the clerk will call the roll. The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. ____________________","Congressional Record, Volume 161 Issue 17 (Monday, February 2, 2015) [Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 17 (Monday, February 2, 2015)] [Senate] [Pages S682-S686] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] CLIMATE CHANGE Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I am here now for the 88th time to urge this body to wake up to the looming threat of climate change. In the last few weeks, my Republican colleagues have talked about climate change here on the floor more than at any other time since I began giving these weekly speeches. We had heard next to nothing from Republicans about climate change since the 2010 Citizens United decision. That decision let loose the fossil fuel industry to cast an ever darker shadow of intimidation across this town. So this minor outbreak of dialogue, although minor, has been significant. All but one of my Republican colleagues is now on the record saying they agree that climate change is real, and 15 voted that it is caused at least in some part by humans. That is some progress. Yet some still persist in their denial. Our scientists now tell us that warming of the climate system is ``unequivocal.'' Yet we equivocate. Scientists are a careful bunch. When they say something is unequivocal, we ought to take note. The senior Senator from Oklahoma, our chairman of the Environmental and Public Works Committee, however, maintains that human-caused climate change is a hoax. He thinks it is arrogant to say that humans could cause the climate to change. What is really arrogant is thinking we can ignore the laws of nature, the laws of physics, the laws of chemistry, the laws of biology. Whose laws do we think those are? Those laws were given to us by our Creator. They came with this world. They are immutable. These laws of nature dictate that carbon dioxide is the byproduct of our burning of fossil fuels. These laws of nature, fresh from the hands of our Creator, explain why carbon traps heat in our atmosphere-- something we have known since Abraham Lincoln was riding around this town in his top hat. Here in the Senate, we have no human power to amend or repeal those laws--and here in the Senate, we shouldn't cherry-pick from the scientific record. That is not fair play. Here on the floor, the EPW chairman paraphrased a 2013 paper from the journal Nature, saying: [[Page S683]] . . . there is considerable uncertainty as to whether [increases in extreme climate variability] is occurring. The author of the paper, Dr. Chris Huntingford of the UK's National Environmental Research Council, took exception to his paper being mischaracterized. He said this: Our Nature paper strictly analyzes only year-to-year variability (fluctuations) in temperature. . . . We do not at any point offer evidence against a general on-going background and upwards warming trend. Detection and attribution statistical studies show that the observed average increasing temperatures are almost certainly a consequence of the burning of fossil fuels. In that same floor speech, my colleague from Oklahoma suggested we could relax about climate change because the Munich Reinsurance Company said weather-related disaster losses have declined as a proportion of GDP worldwide. He neglected to mention testimony before our EPW Committee last July by Munich Re's head of risk accumulation in the United States, Carl Hedde, to wit: Due to our history of insuring natural catastrophe, Munich Re was one of the first companies in the industry to recognize the impact that weather-related events and a changing climate could have on its business model and customers. As a nation, we need to take steps to reduce the societal impact of weather events as we see greater variability and volatility in our climate. The senior Senator from Oklahoma has even resurrected the ghost of Climategate, that faux scandal whipped up a few years ago by the polluters and their allies to suggest climate scientists were colluding to exaggerate global warming data. Turned out it was the cooked-up, phony scandal that was exaggerated and not the data. So-called ClimateGate should actually be accurately called ClimateGate-Gate. Yet years later this zombie falsehood still staggers about the floor of the Senate attempting to cast doubt on human-caused climate change. The polluters have relentlessly made it their business to misconstrue the findings of scientific works and to cling to discredited accusations. We would do well to listen to the overwhelming majority of practicing, publishing climate scientists who agree our carbon pollution is altering the climate. Scientists who conduct experiments, who examine data, who arrive at conclusions, who submit their work through peer review, and who make their data accessible for due diligence by other researchers. It is the best science out there. But I am afraid those scientists don't have the ear of the senior Senator from Oklahoma. He showed us whom he listens to. He brought a chart to the floor showing several dozen ``recognized'' scientists--as he called them--who don't buy the climate consensus. That chart was produced by an outfit called the Heartland Institute. You may remember them for associating climate scientists with the Unabomber--a classy group. Their scientists, so-called, included bloggers, columnists, staff of conservative think tanks, a member of the European Parliament, and many scientists who have been funded by the fossil fuel industry. I will side with the scientists affiliated with the American Association for the Advancement of Science over a bunch of carefully selected bloggers. I will trust NASA and NOAA over scientists who shill for the fossil fuel industry. The Heartland Institute is not alone. It is part of a sophisticated network of climate denial propped up by the carbon-polluting fossil fuel industry. It is a front group fueled by the special interests and their dubious experts. Interestingly, if we go to Oklahoma State University, we will find one of the experts on this. Dr. Riley Dunlap at Oklahoma State could tell his Senator all about it. Professor Dunlap is one of the preeminent researchers into the deliberate and coordinated effort by corporate interests to spread denial propaganda and distort public opinion on climate change--what he calls the ``organized climate-denial machine.'' Dunlap and a colleague found that nearly 90 percent of climate denial books coming out of publishing houses between 1982 and 2010--guess what--had ties to conservative fossil fuel-funded think tanks such as the Heartland Institute. The whole thing is a rigged game and a phony, and there is a very good professor at Oklahoma State University who keeps track of it. I also have a fact sheet from the Oklahoma Climatological Survey, its statement on climate change and its implications for Oklahoma. Here is what it says in plain language: The Earth's climate has warmed during the last 100 years. The Earth's climate will continue to warm for the foreseeable future, and much of the global temperature increases over the last 50 years can be attributed to human activities, particularly increasing greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. That is actually a noncontroversial statement among regular scientists. This is no radical with some political agenda. This is a fact sheet from a State scientific agency. It happens to be Oklahoma's. Here is what the agency expects this means for Oklahoma: earlier maturation of winter wheat and orchard crops, leaving them more vulnerable to late freeze events; drought frequency increases, especially during the summer; drier and warmer conditions increasing the risk of wildfires; rain-free periods lengthening with individual rainfall events becoming more intense, with more runoff and flash flooding occurring. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have this statement printed in the Record. There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows: [From the Oklahoma Climatological Survey] Statement on Climate Change and Its Implications for Oklahoma ``Warming of the climate system is unequivocal, as is now evident from observations of increases in global average air and ocean temperatures, widespread melting of snow and ice, and rising global average sea level.'' --the Fourth Assessment of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). That statement reflects the essence of a vast amount of observational data and climate research: the earth's climate has warmed on average during the last 100 years and will continue to warm through the 21st century. Further, ample evidence from observational data and climate modeling studies indicates that this global-scale warming is not attributable to natural variability. The Oklahoma Climatological Survey (OCS) has been mandated by the Oklahoma legislature to provide climate information and expertise which could be of value to the public, as well as to state policy- and decision-makers. In accordance with that directive, OCS has conducted a review of the current assessments of climate change research and concludes the following to be true: Across the globe, a warming climate will be beneficial to some and detrimental to others. Anticipating how this climatic shift will impact Oklahoma is of vital importance to state decision-makers. One of the greatest impacts will be the exposure of Oklahoma's growing population and economy to water stress. Oklahoma's future requires access to fresh water. Thus, due diligence in protecting our water resources and adapting to future climate variability is paramount if we are to maintain and improve the quality of life and the economy of Oklahoma. The Science of Global Climate Change The earth's climate is always changing. Evidence such as tree ring and ice core studies indicates large and sometimes abrupt climate changes have occurred in the earth's distant past, lasting centuries to millennia. These climate swings are attributed to natural variations, such as changes in the output of the sun or shifts in the earth's orbit. Oklahoma has exhibited distinct climate periods attributable to natural variability in the last 100 years, from the decadal- scale droughts of the 1920s, 1930s and 1950s to an extended period of abundant precipitation during the 1980s and 1990s. Mounting evidence continues to indicate, however, that human activities have begun to impact the earth's climate through the release of greenhouse gases. Ice core studies show carbon dioxide and methane are at their greatest levels within the last 650,000 years. Due to the extended periods required for these gases to be removed from the atmosphere, further emissions during the 21st century will cause additional warming for more than a millennium. In fact, even if greenhouse gas concentrations were held steady since the year 2000, the earth is committed to decades of warming from heat already absorbed by the oceans. Global Climate Change Impacts for Oklahoma The continued warming of the climate averaged across the globe will create a cascade of climatic shifts which could impact Oklahoma's climate. These shifts will not mean an end of year-to-year natural variability--hot years and cold years will continue, as will wet years and dry years. The projected changes will be seen at time scales averaged over a decade or more. Little is known of the effects climate change will have on severe weather. The ingredients required for severe weather involve complex [[Page S684]] combinations that do not exhibit clear changes in a warming climate. Further, global climate models are unable to accurately simulate small scale weather events like thunderstorms or tornadoes. Recommendations OCS recommends that Oklahoma aggressively pursue four initiatives to address the risks of both climate variability and climate change. First, the state should undertake a comprehensive assessment of Oklahoma's social and economic vulnerability to climate variability as well as climate change. Learning to adapt to nature's extremes now will yield benefits in reduced disaster losses, regardless of the future trajectory of climate change. Climate change may also bring economic opportunities that would be identified in such an assessment. Second, OCS recommends immediate funding of the Oklahoma Water Resources Board's Comprehensive Water Plan study to identify existing as well as projected needs for water. Third, OCS encourages efficiency programs to reduce our growing demand for energy. Fourth, OCS recommends investment in renewable energy technology and production. Oklahoma has already demonstrated the successes of wind energy; similar efforts should be undertaken to advance development of solar and sustainable bio-energy as well as fostering further research and development of wind energy. Even if climate does not evolve as expected, these steps will yield long-term benefits to Oklahoma's society and economy through reduced losses to existing climate and weather threats and cost-savings through reduced energy use. If climate does evolve as expected, Oklahoma will be better positioned to adapt to those changes without rapid social upheaval. Furthermore, building resilience to climate and weather events will help position Oklahoma at a relative advantage to neighboring states, especially in attracting businesses that are dependent upon a continuous water supply. This statement is the first in a series issued by OCS which delineates the impacts, both beneficial and detrimental, of a warming climate system on the economy of Oklahoma and the quality of life for Oklahomans. Further statements will illuminate possible impacts to specific industries, such as water management and agriculture. Mr. WHITEHOUSE. The National Climate Assessment estimates that by the end of the century the temperatures in the Southern Great Plains will increase up to 9 degrees. Mark Shafer is a researcher at the Oklahoma Climatological Survey who contributed to the National Climate Assessment. He told the Oklahoman newspaper that in a few decades Oklahoma could see 100-plus temperatures every summer. By century's end, daily temperatures could top 100 degrees for the entire summer. As the climate warms, droughts will probably get worse, both more severe and more frequent. Nine Oklahoma professors from Oral Roberts University, Southern Nazarene University, and the University of Tulsa were among 200 evangelical scientists and academics to sign a 2013 letter to Congress imploring us to address climate change. All of God's Creation . . . is groaning under the weight of our uncontrolled use of fossil fuels. . . . The threat to future generations and global prosperity means we can no longer afford complacency and endless debate. We as a society risk being counted among ``those who destroy the earth.'' Those who know the Bible will know that reference to ``those who destroy the earth'' comes from Revelations. I will quote from Revelations: ``And Thy wrath is come, and the time . . . that thou . . . shouldst destroy them which destroy the earth.'' The letter warns that the way we live harms our neighbors, threatening to create more empty wells, devastated cropland, loss of villages, environmental refugees, and disease. I ask unanimous consent to have that letter from the 200 evangelical scientists printed in the Record. There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows: July 10, 2013. Dear Speaker Boehner, Senate Majority Leader Reid, and Members of the United States Congress: As evangelical scientists and academics, we understand climate change is real and action is urgently needed. All of God's Creation-- humans and our environment--is groaning under the weight of our uncontrolled use of fossil fuels, bringing on a warming planet, melting ice, and rising seas. The negative consequences and burdens of a changing climate will fall disproportionately on those whom Jesus called ``the least of these'': the poor, vulnerable, and oppressed. Our nation has entrusted you with political power; we plead with you to lead on this issue and enact policies this year that will protect our climate and help us all to be better stewards of Creation. Average global temperatures are at their highest level within the measurement record, and we are beginning to see indications of increasingly disturbed weather. For example, 2012 was the hottest year ever recorded for the contiguous United States, and it will go down as one of the most destructive and disruptive years in U.S. history: wildfires, drought, superstorms, and public health outbreaks. This past year is only one example of the patterns of change we expect to see as the climate warms globally. We're already spending billions in emergency aid for the victims of hurricanes and weather disasters, and these expenses will only increase as the ``once in a lifetime'' storms become the new normal. The Bible tells us that ``love does no harm to its neighbor'' (Romans 13:10), yet the way we live now harms our neighbors, both locally and globally. For the world's poorest people, climate change means dried-up wells in Africa, floods in Asia that wash away crops and homes, wildfires in the U.S. and Russia, loss of villages and food species in the Arctic, environmental refugees, and disease. Our changing climate threatens the health, security, and well-being of millions of people who are made in God's image. The threat to future generations and global prosperity means we can no longer afford complacency and endless debate. We as a society risk being counted among ``those who destroy the earth'' (Revelation 11:18). We call on you to pass meaningful legislation during this Congress to reduce carbon emissions and protect our environment, thereby strengthening the long-term outlook for our economy and our children. As Christian scientists and educators, we offer our knowledge, experience, and prayerful witness to assist you and all of our nation's leaders who are willing to address this urgent challenge.

Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Finally, Mr. President, at the University of Oklahoma Berrien Moore III is dean of the College of Atmosphere and Geographic Sciences. He is also Director of the National Weather Center. Dean Moore of the University of Oklahoma was a lead author on an intergovernmental panel on climate change report, which the Senator from Oklahoma is so fond of disparaging. Dr. Moore's work helped the IPCC earn the Nobel Peace Prize in 2007. He has won research accolades from NOAA and from NASA. In 2009 Dr. Moore testified before the House Committee on Science, Space, and Technology. Here is what he had to say about climate change: On the increasing strength of Earth science, we now can state that global warming is ``unequivocal,''-- There is that word again-- but this simply sets the challenge. We need now-- This is 5 years ago, by the way-- to develop the capability to monitor and thereby manage greenhouse gas emissions through this century and beyond. . . . The challenge is growing and will not go away. The effects of climate change are all too real in Oklahoma, in Rhode Island, [[Page S686]] and across the Nation. If you don't believe me, go to Oklahoma State and the University of Oklahoma and talk to the scientists I just mentioned. The outlook for us if we fail to act is increasingly dark. But look again at Oklahoma. The Sooner State is the fourth largest producer of wind power in the country. Wind turbines there make progress toward energy independence and they give Oklahoma farmers steady income as a hedge against droughts and extreme weather. So people farm and they get paid for having a wind turbine located on your farm. It is a win-win. Gary McManus, the Oklahoma State climatologist, has given a number of presentations on climate change and its likely effects on his home State. He often prefaces those talks with this admonition: This is the science. It is up to you to decide what you do with it. You can either ignore it or you can use it. In my view, there will be a high price in harm and in infamy to this democracy if we continue to ignore it. So I say let's use it, but first we will have to wake up. Mr. President, I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa. (The remarks of Mr. Grassley pertaining to the introduction of S. 335 are printed in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced Bills and Joint Resolutions.'') Mr. GRASSLEY. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The absence of a quorum is suggested, and the clerk will call the roll. The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. ____________________",package_114_256.csv,33775,33775,33844,"[congressional record volume 161, number 17 (monday, february 2, 2015)] [senate] [pages s682-s686] from the congressional record online through the government publishing office [ www.gpo.gov ] climate change mr. whitehouse. mr. president, i am here now for the 88th time to urge this body to wake up to the looming threat of climate change. in the last few weeks, my republican colleagues have talked about climate change here on the floor more than at any other time since i began giving these weekly speeches. we had heard next to nothing from republicans about climate change since the 2010 citizens united decision. that decision let loose the fossil fuel industry to cast an ever darker shadow of intimidation across this town. so this minor outbreak of dialogue, although minor, has been significant. all but one of my republican colleagues is now on the record saying they agree that climate change is real, and 15 voted that it is caused at least in some part by humans. that is some progress. yet some still persist in their denial. our scientists now tell us that warming of the climate system is ``unequivocal.'' yet we equivocate. scientists are a careful bunch. when they say something is unequivocal, we ought to take note. the senior senator from oklahoma, our chairman of the environmental and public works committee, however, maintains that human-caused climate change is a hoax. he thinks it is arrogant to say that humans could cause the climate to change. what is really arrogant is thinking we can ignore the laws of nature, the laws of physics, the laws of chemistry, the laws of biology. whose laws do we think those are? those laws were given to us by our creator. they came with this world. they are immutable. these laws of nature dictate that carbon dioxide is the byproduct of our burning of fossil fuels. these laws of nature, fresh from the hands of our creator, explain why carbon traps heat in our atmosphere-- something we have known since abraham lincoln was riding around this town in his top hat. here in the senate, we have no human power to amend or repeal those laws--and here in the senate, we shouldn't cherry-pick from the scientific record. that is not fair play. here on the floor, the epw chairman paraphrased a 2013 paper from the journal nature, saying: [[page s683]] . . . there is considerable uncertainty as to whether [increases in extreme climate variability] is occurring. the author of the paper, dr. chris huntingford of the uk's national environmental research council, took exception to his paper being mischaracterized. he said this: our nature paper strictly analyzes only year-to-year variability (fluctuations) in temperature. . . . we do not at any point offer evidence against a general on-going background and upwards warming trend. detection and attribution statistical studies show that the observed average increasing temperatures are almost certainly a consequence of the burning of fossil fuels. in that same floor speech, my colleague from oklahoma suggested we could relax about climate change because the munich reinsurance company said weather-related disaster losses have declined as a proportion of gdp worldwide. he neglected to mention testimony before our epw committee last july by munich re's head of risk accumulation in the united states, carl hedde, to wit: due to our history of insuring natural catastrophe, munich re was one of the first companies in the industry to recognize the impact that weather-related events and a changing climate could have on its business model and customers. as a nation, we need to take steps to reduce the societal impact of weather events as we see greater variability and volatility in our climate. the senior senator from oklahoma has even resurrected the ghost of climategate, that faux scandal whipped up a few years ago by the polluters and their allies to suggest climate scientists were colluding to exaggerate global warming data. turned out it was the cooked-up, phony scandal that was exaggerated and not the data. so-called climategate should actually be accurately called climategate-gate. yet years later this zombie falsehood still staggers about the floor of the senate attempting to cast doubt on human-caused climate change. the polluters have relentlessly made it their business to misconstrue the findings of scientific works and to cling to discredited accusations. we would do well to listen to the overwhelming majority of practicing, publishing climate scientists who agree our carbon pollution is altering the climate. scientists who conduct experiments, who examine data, who arrive at conclusions, who submit their work through peer review, and who make their data accessible for due diligence by other researchers. it is the best science out there. but i am afraid those scientists don't have the ear of the senior senator from oklahoma. he showed us whom he listens to. he brought a chart to the floor showing several dozen ``recognized'' scientists--as he called them--who don't buy the climate consensus. that chart was produced by an outfit called the heartland institute. you may remember them for associating climate scientists with the unabomber--a classy group. their scientists, so-called, included bloggers, columnists, staff of conservative think tanks, a member of the european parliament, and many scientists who have been funded by the fossil fuel industry. i will side with the scientists affiliated with the american association for the advancement of science over a bunch of carefully selected bloggers. i will trust nasa and noaa over scientists who shill for the fossil fuel industry. the heartland institute is not alone. it is part of a sophisticated network of climate denial propped up by the carbon-polluting fossil fuel industry. it is a front group fueled by the special interests and their dubious experts. interestingly, if we go to oklahoma state university, we will find one of the experts on this. dr. riley dunlap at oklahoma state could tell his senator all about it. professor dunlap is one of the preeminent researchers into the deliberate and coordinated effort by corporate interests to spread denial propaganda and distort public opinion on climate change--what he calls the ``organized climate-denial machine.'' dunlap and a colleague found that nearly 90 percent of climate denial books coming out of publishing houses between 1982 and 2010--guess what--had ties to conservative fossil fuel-funded think tanks such as the heartland institute. the whole thing is a rigged game and a phony, and there is a very good professor at oklahoma state university who keeps track of it. i also have a fact sheet from the oklahoma climatological survey, its statement on climate change and its implications for oklahoma. here is what it says in plain language: the earth's climate has warmed during the last 100 years. the earth's climate will continue to warm for the foreseeable future, and much of the global temperature increases over the last 50 years can be attributed to human activities, particularly increasing greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. that is actually a noncontroversial statement among regular scientists. this is no radical with some political agenda. this is a fact sheet from a state scientific agency. it happens to be oklahoma's. here is what the agency expects this means for oklahoma: earlier maturation of winter wheat and orchard crops, leaving them more vulnerable to late freeze events; drought frequency increases, especially during the summer; drier and warmer conditions increasing the risk of wildfires; rain-free periods lengthening with individual rainfall events becoming more intense, with more runoff and flash flooding occurring. mr. president, i ask unanimous consent to have this statement printed in the record. there being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the record, as follows: [from the oklahoma climatological survey] statement on climate change and its implications for oklahoma ``warming of the climate system is unequivocal, as is now evident from observations of increases in global average air and ocean temperatures, widespread melting of snow and ice, and rising global average sea level.'' --the fourth assessment of the intergovernmental panel on climate change (ipcc). that statement reflects the essence of a vast amount of observational data and climate research: the earth's climate has warmed on average during the last 100 years and will continue to warm through the 21st century. further, ample evidence from observational data and climate modeling studies indicates that this global-scale warming is not attributable to natural variability. the oklahoma climatological survey (ocs) has been mandated by the oklahoma legislature to provide climate information and expertise which could be of value to the public, as well as to state policy- and decision-makers. in accordance with that directive, ocs has conducted a review of the current assessments of climate change research and concludes the following to be true: across the globe, a warming climate will be beneficial to some and detrimental to others. anticipating how this climatic shift will impact oklahoma is of vital importance to state decision-makers. one of the greatest impacts will be the exposure of oklahoma's growing population and economy to water stress. oklahoma's future requires access to fresh water. thus, due diligence in protecting our water resources and adapting to future climate variability is paramount if we are to maintain and improve the quality of life and the economy of oklahoma. the science of global climate change the earth's climate is always changing. evidence such as tree ring and ice core studies indicates large and sometimes abrupt climate changes have occurred in the earth's distant past, lasting centuries to millennia. these climate swings are attributed to natural variations, such as changes in the output of the sun or shifts in the earth's orbit. oklahoma has exhibited distinct climate periods attributable to natural variability in the last 100 years, from the decadal- scale droughts of the 1920s, 1930s and 1950s to an extended period of abundant precipitation during the 1980s and 1990s. mounting evidence continues to indicate, however, that human activities have begun to impact the earth's climate through the release of greenhouse gases. ice core studies show carbon dioxide and methane are at their greatest levels within the last 650,000 years. due to the extended periods required for these gases to be removed from the atmosphere, further emissions during the 21st century will cause additional warming for more than a millennium. in fact, even if greenhouse gas concentrations were held steady since the year 2000, the earth is committed to decades of warming from heat already absorbed by the oceans. global climate change impacts for oklahoma the continued warming of the climate averaged across the globe will create a cascade of climatic shifts which could impact oklahoma's climate. these shifts will not mean an end of year-to-year natural variability--hot years and cold years will continue, as will wet years and dry years. the projected changes will be seen at time scales averaged over a decade or more. little is known of the effects climate change will have on severe weather. the ingredients required for severe weather involve complex [[page s684]] combinations that do not exhibit clear changes in a warming climate. further, global climate models are unable to accurately simulate small scale weather events like thunderstorms or tornadoes. recommendations ocs recommends that oklahoma aggressively pursue four initiatives to address the risks of both climate variability and climate change. first, the state should undertake a comprehensive assessment of oklahoma's social and economic vulnerability to climate variability as well as climate change. learning to adapt to nature's extremes now will yield benefits in reduced disaster losses, regardless of the future trajectory of climate change. climate change may also bring economic opportunities that would be identified in such an assessment. second, ocs recommends immediate funding of the oklahoma water resources board's comprehensive water plan study to identify existing as well as projected needs for water. third, ocs encourages efficiency programs to reduce our growing demand for energy. fourth, ocs recommends investment in renewable energy technology and production. oklahoma has already demonstrated the successes of wind energy; similar efforts should be undertaken to advance development of solar and sustainable bio-energy as well as fostering further research and development of wind energy. even if climate does not evolve as expected, these steps will yield long-term benefits to oklahoma's society and economy through reduced losses to existing climate and weather threats and cost-savings through reduced energy use. if climate does evolve as expected, oklahoma will be better positioned to adapt to those changes without rapid social upheaval. furthermore, building resilience to climate and weather events will help position oklahoma at a relative advantage to neighboring states, especially in attracting businesses that are dependent upon a continuous water supply. this statement is the first in a series issued by ocs which delineates the impacts, both beneficial and detrimental, of a warming climate system on the economy of oklahoma and the quality of life for oklahomans. further statements will illuminate possible impacts to specific industries, such as water management and agriculture. mr. whitehouse. the national climate assessment estimates that by the end of the century the temperatures in the southern great plains will increase up to 9 degrees. mark shafer is a researcher at the oklahoma climatological survey who contributed to the national climate assessment. he told the oklahoman newspaper that in a few decades oklahoma could see 100-plus temperatures every summer. by century's end, daily temperatures could top 100 degrees for the entire summer. as the climate warms, droughts will probably get worse, both more severe and more frequent. nine oklahoma professors from oral roberts university, southern nazarene university, and the university of tulsa were among 200 evangelical scientists and academics to sign a 2013 letter to congress imploring us to address climate change. all of god's creation . . . is groaning under the weight of our uncontrolled use of fossil fuels. . . . the threat to future generations and global prosperity means we can no longer afford complacency and endless debate. we as a society risk being counted among ``those who destroy the earth.'' those who know the bible will know that reference to ``those who destroy the earth'' comes from revelations. i will quote from revelations: ``and thy wrath is come, and the time . . . that thou . . . shouldst destroy them which destroy the earth.'' the letter warns that the way we live harms our neighbors, threatening to create more empty wells, devastated cropland, loss of villages, environmental refugees, and disease. i ask unanimous consent to have that letter from the 200 evangelical scientists printed in the record. there being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the record, as follows: july 10, 2013. dear speaker boehner, senate majority leader reid, and members of the united states congress: as evangelical scientists and academics, we understand climate change is real and action is urgently needed. all of god's creation-- humans and our environment--is groaning under the weight of our uncontrolled use of fossil fuels, bringing on a warming planet, melting ice, and rising seas. the negative consequences and burdens of a changing climate will fall disproportionately on those whom jesus called ``the least of these'': the poor, vulnerable, and oppressed. our nation has entrusted you with political power; we plead with you to lead on this issue and enact policies this year that will protect our climate and help us all to be better stewards of creation. average global temperatures are at their highest level within the measurement record, and we are beginning to see indications of increasingly disturbed weather. for example, 2012 was the hottest year ever recorded for the contiguous united states, and it will go down as one of the most destructive and disruptive years in u.s. history: wildfires, drought, superstorms, and public health outbreaks. this past year is only one example of the patterns of change we expect to see as the climate warms globally. we're already spending billions in emergency aid for the victims of hurricanes and weather disasters, and these expenses will only increase as the ``once in a lifetime'' storms become the new normal. the bible tells us that ``love does no harm to its neighbor'' (romans 13:10), yet the way we live now harms our neighbors, both locally and globally. for the world's poorest people, climate change means dried-up wells in africa, floods in asia that wash away crops and homes, wildfires in the u.s. and russia, loss of villages and food species in the arctic, environmental refugees, and disease. our changing climate threatens the health, security, and well-being of millions of people who are made in god's image. the threat to future generations and global prosperity means we can no longer afford complacency and endless debate. we as a society risk being counted among ``those who destroy the earth'' (revelation 11:18). we call on you to pass meaningful legislation during this congress to reduce carbon emissions and protect our environment, thereby strengthening the long-term outlook for our economy and our children. as christian scientists and educators, we offer our knowledge, experience, and prayerful witness to assist you and all of our nation's leaders who are willing to address this urgent challenge. sincerely, dr. tom ackerman, university of washington, seattle, washington; dr.

accolades from noaa and from nasa. in 2009 dr. moore testified before the house committee on science, space, and technology. here is what he had to say about climate change: on the increasing strength of earth science, we now can state that global warming is ``unequivocal,''-- there is that word again-- but this simply sets the challenge. we need now-- this is 5 years ago, by the way-- to develop the capability to monitor and thereby manage greenhouse gas emissions through this century and beyond. . . . the challenge is growing and will not go away. the effects of climate change are all too real in oklahoma, in rhode island, [[page s686]] and across the nation. if you don't believe me, go to oklahoma state and the university of oklahoma and talk to the scientists i just mentioned. the outlook for us if we fail to act is increasingly dark. but look again at oklahoma. the sooner state is the fourth largest producer of wind power in the country. wind turbines there make progress toward energy independence and they give oklahoma farmers steady income as a hedge against droughts and extreme weather. so people farm and they get paid for having a wind turbine located on your farm. it is a win-win. gary mcmanus, the oklahoma state climatologist, has given a number of presentations on climate change and its likely effects on his home state. he often prefaces those talks with this admonition: this is the science. it is up to you to decide what you do with it. you can either ignore it or you can use it. in my view, there will be a high price in harm and in infamy to this democracy if we continue to ignore it. so i say let's use it, but first we will have to wake up. mr. president, i yield the floor. the presiding officer. the senator from iowa. (the remarks of mr. grassley pertaining to the introduction of s. 335 are printed in today's record under ``statements on introduced bills and joint resolutions.'') mr. grassley. i suggest the absence of a quorum. the presiding officer. the absence of a quorum is suggested, and the clerk will call the roll. the assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. mr. brown. mr. president, i ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. the presiding officer. without objection, it is so ordered. ____________________",33775
CREC-2015-02-02-pt1-PgS687,CREC-2015-02-02,114,DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY FUNDING,"[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 17 (Monday, February 2, 2015)] [Senate] [Pages S687-S690] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY FUNDING Mr. KAINE. Mr. President, I rise today because I wish to speak about the importance of this DHS funding bill that is going to be before the body in the coming days. In particular, I wish to emphasize what I think is the important imperative that we pass what we are calling a clean bill to fund the Department of Homeland Security for the remainder of fiscal year 2015 through the end of September. That clean bill would be a bill that would fund homeland security without attaching additional items to it concerning immigration. The support of this legislation was an initiative we were together on. We negotiated in December as part of a budget process by leaders of both parties in both Chambers, and the funding for DHS would have been an increase to help protect our borders and help protect our security by about $1.2 billion above the enacted level for fiscal year 2014. But at the end of the year the decision was made by the House to not fund that piece and leave it separately and that is why we are now talking about whether we will fund the Nation's homeland security efforts and under what circumstances. All 45 Members on the Democratic side, save only Senator Reid, have written a letter saying let's make sure we fund DHS at the level we have already agreed to between the Houses. Then, let's not play politics over immigration issues; let's take up immigration separately. But the House bill that has been sent to us includes measures to begin to block or unwind actions taken by the President on immigration, and those complicate what all should agree is a national imperative, which is the need to fund homeland security. If we don't pass such a bill, that funding will expire on February 28. I don't need to explain too much why homeland security funding is important, but let me make a few points. This Department was created after the attacks of 9/11, and its stated mission--while it employs an awful lot of people and does many complicated things, the mission is quite simple--let's keep our country safe, secure, and resilient against terrorism and other hazards. We see every day the kinds of terrorism hazards we are dealing with. The horrible shooting in Paris a few weeks ago and the shooting in Quebec a few months ago remind us of the dangers of terrorism, and now that we are in a war against ISIL--a jihadist terrorist enemy that has promised to carry out attacks on the United States--we should be very concerned about the mission the DHS performs and the need to provide funding. The men and women who work for the DHS are quite a wide swath of our Federal employees. They are the TSA personnel who protect our transportation system, the Border Patrol agents who serve on our Nation's front lines, Customs officials who oversee the entrance of nearly 1 million visitors per day who come to the United States, and we need Customs agents to help process those visitors. Our DHS folks include disaster specialists--people who respond to hurricanes and other emergencies. Our Coast Guard, our Secret Service, and many of our cyber security professionals all work for the DHS and they work hard every day to carry out that mission of keeping our Nation safe. Funding DHS is not just critical to the Nation's security, it is also critical to the economy because DHS is the third largest agency in the Federal Government by the number of employees. The impact of any shutdown or cessation of funding would reverberate through the country, from our Southwest border to our Nation's ports to every international airport that brings in either foreign commerce or foreign visitors who want to come and be tourists in our country. Many DHS employees, as the Presiding Officer knows, call Virginia home, and a shutdown would impact their lives and would make it difficult for them to plan not only for their immediate needs but for an unknown period of time. So as we are facing threats--and I think we all would agree--while we sometimes have differences of opinion about how to deal with threats, I think everybody in this body would acknowledge that the threats we are dealing with as a nation are not shrinking, they are growing. The challenges we are facing are not getting fewer in number, they are getting greater in number. To respond to threats, the DHS not only needs a good funding bill at an appropriate level, which we have already agreed to, but they need financial certainty and the flexibility to direct its resources as they can. Let me give one interesting recent example of how DHS employees have [[Page S688]] been very important in Virginia, and how those serving in Virginia have performed a critical role for the Nation. We saw a crisis spring up in 2014 that many of us hadn't paid too much attention to before, and that is the spread of the Ebola virus in Africa. That epidemic that began in 2014 is the largest in history for this kind of virus and it had a significant impact on many West African countries. There were more than 22,000 cases as of January 30, 2015. One of the great things is whenever there is a challenge such as this, the nations of the world turn to the United States and they ask for our help. Many parts of our government responded. We deployed military and health professionals to Africa to try to battle the disease there, but we have also deployed our DHS personnel right here at home to keep us safe. As part of this strategy to stop the spread of Ebola, DHS announced in October that five U.S. airports would begin an advanced screening process for Ebola, and one of those airports is in Virginia, and that is Dulles airport. Shortly after, DHS announced that all travelers from Ebola-affected countries would have to enter the United States from one of these five airports. So using existing resources--using existing resources because we didn't have an Ebola line item in the 2014 budget; this is an emergency that came up--but with existing resources, the DHS employees at Dulles were charged with supervising the entire Ebola screening process, including administering questionnaires, taking travelers' temperatures, and referring potentially infected people to the Centers for Disease Control, while also doing all of their regular duties. These officers in Virginia have gone above and beyond their mission for the sake of keeping every American safe. Since this advanced screening began in October, CBP officers at Dulles have interviewed more than 2,000 visitors to the United States from African countries and they have referred more than 140 people to the CDC. As a result of their work and the work of their colleagues and their ability to react to this emerging threat, the United States has only seen two diagnosed cases of Ebola since advanced screening began at our airports, and both patients recovered. This should be viewed as a huge success. Remember how worried we all were--how worried I was--when this was happening in September and October. Our DHS employees have gone the extra mile to keep us safe. This is the kind of mission that we call upon our DHS employees to carry out for our security. It has nothing to do with congressional debates about immigration policy, but it has everything to do with doing the stated mission of keeping us safe. To limit DHS's access to resources by shutting down the agency or passing another continuing resolution that would keep them running on auto pilot--sort of driving by looking in the rearview mirror rather than looking through the windshield of the challenges to come--would damage the ability of DHS to deal with growing threats. I understand the message from the House. We have agreed on the right funding level for DHS. They are saying, however, that we will only fund DHS, we will only fund the guys who are protecting us from ISIL, or protecting us from Ebola, or protecting our ports from nuclear material being shipped--we will only fund it if we can get an agreement to change policies enacted by the President with immigration. They are threatening to stop funding DHS actions unless we reverse the President's actions on immigration--actions that, in my view, are already helping the economy by bringing families out of the shadows to become productive, taxpaying members of our communities. While I strongly support the President's immigration actions--and most of them I voted for as part of the Senate's comprehensive immigration reform bill that we passed in June of 2013--I can understand there might be Members of the House who may not like those actions. They may want to do something different. And the great thing is they have an ability to do something different. The House, with a significant Republican majority, can pass their own immigration reform bill. They can retract the President's actions. They can express what they want to do about immigration reform. They can pass that bill just as they passed the DHS funding bill, and send it over to the Senate, and we can have a debate about immigration reform. But we can have that debate without holding hostage the funding of the third largest agency in government, without holding hostage the work that agency does every day to keep us safe. I think the good news in all of this is in both the House and Senate there are people who think the immigration system is broken, the immigration system needs to be fixed, and we ought to have a dialogue to do it. Certainly, when the Senate passed an immigration reform bill in June of 2013--nearly 2 years ago--and we sent it to the House, we knew the House was not going to adopt what the Senate passed without changing anything. We were trying to start a dialogue where the House could pass their own bill and then we could sit down in conference and work out a solution to an immigration system that we all think is broken. That is what we should be doing as responsible legislators-- fixing an immigration system, and even those of us who have different views, getting those views on the table and finding a compromise. It is the wrong thing to do to try to hold up funding for the third largest agency in government--this agency that is keeping us safe in so many ways all over this country every day--to try to reverse actions the President took that are well within his legal authority. So I am going to continue to support the President's Executive actions. I am going to continue to encourage the House and others, if they have different ideas about immigration reform, to pass a bill, put their ideas on the table and we will talk about them. But it is wrong to try to hold up protecting our Nation's security as a punishment to the President for using Executive action that was within his legal power to make. Since we have the complete ability to have a discussion about immigration, let's do it. I will conclude and say this, although I wish I didn't have to--and particularly looking at these young pages who are sitting in front of me--it is a dangerous world out there. For the sake of these youngsters and my own kids, I wish it was getting less dangerous. I have a son in the military. I wish it was getting less dangerous, but it is not. It is getting more dangerous. The kinds of threats we have to face abroad and at home are tough, challenging, difficult threats. We have professionals on the front line every day, many of whom are risking their lives for us, to try to stop these threats. Let's not starve their work. Let's not hamper their work. Let's not make them face the threat of a shutdown or losing their salary or losing their livelihood while we wait for Congress to have a meaningful debate about immigration. I appreciate the opportunity to offer those thoughts and to urge funding for a clean DHS bill. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Lankford). The Senator from Utah. Mr. LEE. Mr. President, tomorrow afternoon the Senate will vote to begin consideration of the bill called H.R. 240. This is a bill that authorizes funding for the Department of Homeland Security, or DHS. It would fund DHS through September of this year. This, of course, is a procedural vote we have scheduled for tomorrow, not a substantive one. The only question on the table, the sole question in connection with this particular vote, will be whether the Senate is ready to begin voting and debating on H.R. 240. I am ready--I am eager, in fact--to begin this debate. It does need to begin. That is what this vote is about. Not just because we have only 25 days before the current budget authority for DHS expires but also because this debate will finally allow the American people to see where their elected representatives, right here in the U.S. Senate, stand on President Obama's recent Executive action on immigration. The legislature is the only lawmaking branch within our Federal Government because it is the only deliberative branch in our government. Before Congress enacts a piece of legislation--before it makes a new piece of law--we first debate the merits of that legislation--weighing the various pros and cons of each proposal in a candid and transparent discussion, and allowing the various sides of the issue to make their case. [[Page S689]] Open, robust debate is not merely incidental to the lawmaking process that goes on here, it is the essence of that lawmaking process. It is at the very heart, the very center, the very core of this process that we hold near and dear and was established by our 227-year-old founding document. It is the only way for Members of Congress to fully explore the cost and consequences of a particular policy under consideration. It is the only way for the American people to know exactly where their elected officials stand on an issue; and, just as importantly, why they stand where they stand. When the President of the United States announced in November of last year he was singlehandedly going to rewrite our immigration laws, in effect, he short-circuited this process of debate and of deliberation that is at the very heart of our constitutional lawmaking process. His announcement showed us what it looks like when one person ignores the limits of his office and claims the power to change the law all on his own, just as an expression of his own unilateral will. Policies are written behind closed doors, in consultation with lawyers and special-interest groups, rather than the American people. The law is pronounced from behind a podium as a fait accompli rather than discussed and debated in an open, transparent, fair contest of ideas and open to inspection by 300 million Americans who will be affected by these decisions. This is not how our Republic works. It is not what the American people expect from their elected officials in Washington, DC. Indeed, poll after poll shows most people disapprove of the President's Executive action on immigration--that same action taken just this last November. Even those who agree with the President on policy grounds, even those who think the President's amnesty action would be the kind of policy they would prefer, even those people disagree with the President on the process because the American people understand that the process does matter. Especially among those people who have taken an oath to uphold, protect, and defend the Constitution of the United States--that same document that prescribes the formula by which our laws are made. According to one poll, when asked if the President should ``sidestep Congress and act on his own using Executive orders,'' only 22 percent of the public said he should--22 percent. It is hardly a rousing mandate from the American people. In other words, the American people know what our President seems to have forgotten: that in a constitutional republic the ends don't justify the means. The American people oppose lawmaking by fiat not out of some abstract loyalty to the abstract concept of separation of powers. No, that is not why. Rather, they understand quite intuitively that when a President sidesteps Congress and avoids open, robust debate on a particular policy, it is probably because the public isn't likely to accept and isn't likely to like the substance of that policy. Otherwise, he wouldn't need to take this kind of action. Otherwise, he could do it through the people's duly elected representatives who have been put in office specifically for the purpose of making law through this open, deliberative, transparent process. This is certainly what we have seen in the aftermath of the President's Executive order on immigration. The more the people discover about the content and about the consequences of his policy, the less they like it. For instance, the President claimed that his Executive order would honor the golden rule of American exceptionalism: If you work hard and play by the rules, you can get ahead. We now know his plan subverts this very basic fundamental bargain by paving a path to citizenship for millions of immigrants who have broken the rules and violated the law, and by granting them work permits and benefits such as Social Security and Medicare. Likewise, we were told the President's Executive order would make our immigration system more fair and more functional, more accessible for everyone. But we now know his plan will only exacerbate the problems in our labor market for American workers by giving more power and more money to the dysfunctional U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, or USCIS. This is the agency within the Department of Homeland Security that was recently reported to have given over 900,000 work permits to illegal immigrants since 2009. We know that unless we do something to stop it, unless we do something to reach back and take back our constitutional privilege, our institutional privilege as the lawmaking branch of the Federal Government, the President's Executive order will go into effect at a time when all net job growth in our economy since 2007 has gone to immigrants. These are the kinds of facts and figures that ought to inform the legislative process and ought to not be treated as some sort of afterthought. These are not, coincidentally, exactly the kinds of observations, the kinds of facts and figures, the kinds of details that could have been and should have been and, undoubtedly, inevitably would have been explored had this policy been implemented through the constitutionally prescribed formula. Last November the President may have chosen to ignore these facts and to circumvent debate altogether, but that doesn't mean we have to respond in kind. That certainly doesn't mean we have to capitulate and say, okay, the way he wants to do it is fine. It is not constitutional. It is not legal. It is not what the American people want, but we just have to accept it. No. On the contrary, I believe we have not just a right but we have a duty, we have an affirmative obligation to make every effort to ensure lawmaking by edict does not become the new normal in this country. Not now, not ever, not in the United States of America. Beginning debate on this bill will give us the opportunity to do just that, to make sure this never becomes the new normal. Some have said we shouldn't be debating the President's Executive action on immigration right now. They say it has nothing to do with funding the operations of the Department of Homeland Security. To this I have a very simple reply: If not now, when? If we are not going to do it right now, when are we going to do it? When will there be a better time? When will there be any adequate time for us to respond to this constitutional overreach, this grave injustice? If we don't debate the legality of the President's Executive orders when we are in the very process of authorizing money to the Department that is tasked with carrying out those very orders, then when exactly will we have that debate? The truth is now is the perfect time because it is the only time. It is the only time when we can do this. It is the only time for us to have a meaningful debate on the President's Executive action on immigration. At any other point our debate is more or less hypothetical. Now is the time, when we are exercising our constitutional power of the purse, that our debate has consequences, real consequences. They are consequences the American people can see and feel, consequences that will inure to the betterment or the detriment of the American people. Now is the time when this needs to be debated. The power of the purse is the power to allocate money to fund government operations as well as the power to withhold money from improper or illegitimate government operations. It is what enables Congress--and only Congress, uniquely Congress--to reform dysfunctional government. We like to talk about the power of the purse as a tool that Congress can use, use as a check and a balance against the excesses of an overbearing President. That is absolutely true. There is no doubt about it. But first and foremost, it is a tool for Members of Congress themselves to represent the interests of our constituents and to fix the very things that are broken within our government. Our Constitution grants the legislative branch--this branch, Congress--the power of the purse not simply to achieve some abstract equilibrium or balance of power, but to compel the national government to truly represent the American people and to be faithful stewards of taxpayer funds. At the end of November of last year, President Obama made his choice. It was an unfortunate choice; it was a wrong choice. It was a choice not backed up by law, not backed up by the U.S. Constitution, and flatly inconsistent with the same. President [[Page S690]] Obama made his choice in November. Now it is time for us to make ours. The President chose to sidestep Congress, and in the process to avoid debate and to rewrite our immigration laws on his own. Now we must decide: Are we going to be a deliberative body or are we going to be a rubberstamp for the President's agenda, whoever the President is happens to be in power, whether it is now or years from now? Are we going to be that kind of legislative body that just rubberstamps what the President does, or are we going to exercise our prerogative as an independent coordinate branch of this government to make sure our laws are faithfully and carefully executed in a manner consistent not only with the wishes of the people but also with the formula prescribed by the Constitution? Are we going to acquiesce to an Executive who disregards the boundaries of his office, or are we going to stand up for the rule of law and for the will of the American people? I choose the latter. I urge my colleagues to choose the latter. I hope my colleagues will join me in voting to at least begin debate on H.R. 240. This is a debate the American people have been waiting for Congress to have for far too long. If not now, when? The time is now. We need to get on this bill. We need to debate it. We need to allow our constituents to be heard. The American people have a will, and that will is expressed though regular elections. Those elections choose those people who occupy seats in this Chamber and in the House of Representatives. We must represent them. We must do so in a manner fully consistent with the oath that every one of us has taken as required by article VI of the Constitution. We can begin to do that by voting to proceed to H.R. 240 tomorrow. I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. SULLIVAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 17 (Monday, February 2, 2015)] [Senate] [Pages S687-S690] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY FUNDING Mr. KAINE. Mr. President, I rise today because I wish to speak about the importance of this DHS funding bill that is going to be before the body in the coming days. In particular, I wish to emphasize what I think is the important imperative that we pass what we are calling a clean bill to fund the Department of Homeland Security for the remainder of fiscal year 2015 through the end of September. That clean bill would be a bill that would fund homeland security without attaching additional items to it concerning immigration. The support of this legislation was an initiative we were together on. We negotiated in December as part of a budget process by leaders of both parties in both Chambers, and the funding for DHS would have been an increase to help protect our borders and help protect our security by about $1.2 billion above the enacted level for fiscal year 2014. But at the end of the year the decision was made by the House to not fund that piece and leave it separately and that is why we are now talking about whether we will fund the Nation's homeland security efforts and under what circumstances. All 45 Members on the Democratic side, save only Senator Reid, have written a letter saying let's make sure we fund DHS at the level we have already agreed to between the Houses. Then, let's not play politics over immigration issues; let's take up immigration separately. But the House bill that has been sent to us includes measures to begin to block or unwind actions taken by the President on immigration, and those complicate what all should agree is a national imperative, which is the need to fund homeland security. If we don't pass such a bill, that funding will expire on February 28. I don't need to explain too much why homeland security funding is important, but let me make a few points. This Department was created after the attacks of 9/11, and its stated mission--while it employs an awful lot of people and does many complicated things, the mission is quite simple--let's keep our country safe, secure, and resilient against terrorism and other hazards. We see every day the kinds of terrorism hazards we are dealing with. The horrible shooting in Paris a few weeks ago and the shooting in Quebec a few months ago remind us of the dangers of terrorism, and now that we are in a war against ISIL--a jihadist terrorist enemy that has promised to carry out attacks on the United States--we should be very concerned about the mission the DHS performs and the need to provide funding. The men and women who work for the DHS are quite a wide swath of our Federal employees. They are the TSA personnel who protect our transportation system, the Border Patrol agents who serve on our Nation's front lines, Customs officials who oversee the entrance of nearly 1 million visitors per day who come to the United States, and we need Customs agents to help process those visitors. Our DHS folks include disaster specialists--people who respond to hurricanes and other emergencies. Our Coast Guard, our Secret Service, and many of our cyber security professionals all work for the DHS and they work hard every day to carry out that mission of keeping our Nation safe. Funding DHS is not just critical to the Nation's security, it is also critical to the economy because DHS is the third largest agency in the Federal Government by the number of employees. The impact of any shutdown or cessation of funding would reverberate through the country, from our Southwest border to our Nation's ports to every international airport that brings in either foreign commerce or foreign visitors who want to come and be tourists in our country. Many DHS employees, as the Presiding Officer knows, call Virginia home, and a shutdown would impact their lives and would make it difficult for them to plan not only for their immediate needs but for an unknown period of time. So as we are facing threats--and I think we all would agree--while we sometimes have differences of opinion about how to deal with threats, I think everybody in this body would acknowledge that the threats we are dealing with as a nation are not shrinking, they are growing. The challenges we are facing are not getting fewer in number, they are getting greater in number. To respond to threats, the DHS not only needs a good funding bill at an appropriate level, which we have already agreed to, but they need financial certainty and the flexibility to direct its resources as they can. Let me give one interesting recent example of how DHS employees have [[Page S688]] been very important in Virginia, and how those serving in Virginia have performed a critical role for the Nation. We saw a crisis spring up in 2014 that many of us hadn't paid too much attention to before, and that is the spread of the Ebola virus in Africa. That epidemic that began in 2014 is the largest in history for this kind of virus and it had a significant impact on many West African countries. There were more than 22,000 cases as of January 30, 2015. One of the great things is whenever there is a challenge such as this, the nations of the world turn to the United States and they ask for our help. Many parts of our government responded. We deployed military and health professionals to Africa to try to battle the disease there, but we have also deployed our DHS personnel right here at home to keep us safe. As part of this strategy to stop the spread of Ebola, DHS announced in October that five U.S. airports would begin an advanced screening process for Ebola, and one of those airports is in Virginia, and that is Dulles airport. Shortly after, DHS announced that all travelers from Ebola-affected countries would have to enter the United States from one of these five airports. So using existing resources--using existing resources because we didn't have an Ebola line item in the 2014 budget; this is an emergency that came up--but with existing resources, the DHS employees at Dulles were charged with supervising the entire Ebola screening process, including administering questionnaires, taking travelers' temperatures, and referring potentially infected people to the Centers for Disease Control, while also doing all of their regular duties. These officers in Virginia have gone above and beyond their mission for the sake of keeping every American safe. Since this advanced screening began in October, CBP officers at Dulles have interviewed more than 2,000 visitors to the United States from African countries and they have referred more than 140 people to the CDC. As a result of their work and the work of their colleagues and their ability to react to this emerging threat, the United States has only seen two diagnosed cases of Ebola since advanced screening began at our airports, and both patients recovered. This should be viewed as a huge success. Remember how worried we all were--how worried I was--when this was happening in September and October. Our DHS employees have gone the extra mile to keep us safe. This is the kind of mission that we call upon our DHS employees to carry out for our security. It has nothing to do with congressional debates about immigration policy, but it has everything to do with doing the stated mission of keeping us safe. To limit DHS's access to resources by shutting down the agency or passing another continuing resolution that would keep them running on auto pilot--sort of driving by looking in the rearview mirror rather than looking through the windshield of the challenges to come--would damage the ability of DHS to deal with growing threats. I understand the message from the House. We have agreed on the right funding level for DHS. They are saying, however, that we will only fund DHS, we will only fund the guys who are protecting us from ISIL, or protecting us from Ebola, or protecting our ports from nuclear material being shipped--we will only fund it if we can get an agreement to change policies enacted by the President with immigration. They are threatening to stop funding DHS actions unless we reverse the President's actions on immigration--actions that, in my view, are already helping the economy by bringing families out of the shadows to become productive, taxpaying members of our communities. While I strongly support the President's immigration actions--and most of them I voted for as part of the Senate's comprehensive immigration reform bill that we passed in June of 2013--I can understand there might be Members of the House who may not like those actions. They may want to do something different. And the great thing is they have an ability to do something different. The House, with a significant Republican majority, can pass their own immigration reform bill. They can retract the President's actions. They can express what they want to do about immigration reform. They can pass that bill just as they passed the DHS funding bill, and send it over to the Senate, and we can have a debate about immigration reform. But we can have that debate without holding hostage the funding of the third largest agency in government, without holding hostage the work that agency does every day to keep us safe. I think the good news in all of this is in both the House and Senate there are people who think the immigration system is broken, the immigration system needs to be fixed, and we ought to have a dialogue to do it. Certainly, when the Senate passed an immigration reform bill in June of 2013--nearly 2 years ago--and we sent it to the House, we knew the House was not going to adopt what the Senate passed without changing anything. We were trying to start a dialogue where the House could pass their own bill and then we could sit down in conference and work out a solution to an immigration system that we all think is broken. That is what we should be doing as responsible legislators-- fixing an immigration system, and even those of us who have different views, getting those views on the table and finding a compromise. It is the wrong thing to do to try to hold up funding for the third largest agency in government--this agency that is keeping us safe in so many ways all over this country every day--to try to reverse actions the President took that are well within his legal authority. So I am going to continue to support the President's Executive actions. I am going to continue to encourage the House and others, if they have different ideas about immigration reform, to pass a bill, put their ideas on the table and we will talk about them. But it is wrong to try to hold up protecting our Nation's security as a punishment to the President for using Executive action that was within his legal power to make. Since we have the complete ability to have a discussion about immigration, let's do it. I will conclude and say this, although I wish I didn't have to--and particularly looking at these young pages who are sitting in front of me--it is a dangerous world out there. For the sake of these youngsters and my own kids, I wish it was getting less dangerous. I have a son in the military. I wish it was getting less dangerous, but it is not. It is getting more dangerous. The kinds of threats we have to face abroad and at home are tough, challenging, difficult threats. We have professionals on the front line every day, many of whom are risking their lives for us, to try to stop these threats. Let's not starve their work. Let's not hamper their work. Let's not make them face the threat of a shutdown or losing their salary or losing their livelihood while we wait for Congress to have a meaningful debate about immigration. I appreciate the opportunity to offer those thoughts and to urge funding for a clean DHS bill. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Lankford). The Senator from Utah. Mr. LEE. Mr. President, tomorrow afternoon the Senate will vote to begin consideration of the bill called H.R. 240. This is a bill that authorizes funding for the Department of Homeland Security, or DHS. It would fund DHS through September of this year. This, of course, is a procedural vote we have scheduled for tomorrow, not a substantive one. The only question on the table, the sole question in connection with this particular vote, will be whether the Senate is ready to begin voting and debating on H.R. 240. I am ready--I am eager, in fact--to begin this debate. It does need to begin. That is what this vote is about. Not just because we have only 25 days before the current budget authority for DHS expires but also because this debate will finally allow the American people to see where their elected representatives, right here in the U.S. Senate, stand on President Obama's recent Executive action on immigration. The legislature is the only lawmaking branch within our Federal Government because it is the only deliberative branch in our government. Before Congress enacts a piece of legislation--before it makes a new piece of law--we first debate the merits of that legislation--weighing the various pros and cons of each proposal in a candid and transparent discussion, and allowing the various sides of the issue to make their case. [[Page S689]] Open, robust debate is not merely incidental to the lawmaking process that goes on here, it is the essence of that lawmaking process. It is at the very heart, the very center, the very core of this process that we hold near and dear and was established by our 227-year-old founding document. It is the only way for Members of Congress to fully explore the cost and consequences of a particular policy under consideration. It is the only way for the American people to know exactly where their elected officials stand on an issue; and, just as importantly, why they stand where they stand. When the President of the United States announced in November of last year he was singlehandedly going to rewrite our immigration laws, in effect, he short-circuited this process of debate and of deliberation that is at the very heart of our constitutional lawmaking process. His announcement showed us what it looks like when one person ignores the limits of his office and claims the power to change the law all on his own, just as an expression of his own unilateral will. Policies are written behind closed doors, in consultation with lawyers and special-interest groups, rather than the American people. The law is pronounced from behind a podium as a fait accompli rather than discussed and debated in an open, transparent, fair contest of ideas and open to inspection by 300 million Americans who will be affected by these decisions. This is not how our Republic works. It is not what the American people expect from their elected officials in Washington, DC. Indeed, poll after poll shows most people disapprove of the President's Executive action on immigration--that same action taken just this last November. Even those who agree with the President on policy grounds, even those who think the President's amnesty action would be the kind of policy they would prefer, even those people disagree with the President on the process because the American people understand that the process does matter. Especially among those people who have taken an oath to uphold, protect, and defend the Constitution of the United States--that same document that prescribes the formula by which our laws are made. According to one poll, when asked if the President should ``sidestep Congress and act on his own using Executive orders,'' only 22 percent of the public said he should--22 percent. It is hardly a rousing mandate from the American people. In other words, the American people know what our President seems to have forgotten: that in a constitutional republic the ends don't justify the means. The American people oppose lawmaking by fiat not out of some abstract loyalty to the abstract concept of separation of powers. No, that is not why. Rather, they understand quite intuitively that when a President sidesteps Congress and avoids open, robust debate on a particular policy, it is probably because the public isn't likely to accept and isn't likely to like the substance of that policy. Otherwise, he wouldn't need to take this kind of action. Otherwise, he could do it through the people's duly elected representatives who have been put in office specifically for the purpose of making law through this open, deliberative, transparent process. This is certainly what we have seen in the aftermath of the President's Executive order on immigration. The more the people discover about the content and about the consequences of his policy, the less they like it. For instance, the President claimed that his Executive order would honor the golden rule of American exceptionalism: If you work hard and play by the rules, you can get ahead. We now know his plan subverts this very basic fundamental bargain by paving a path to citizenship for millions of immigrants who have broken the rules and violated the law, and by granting them work permits and benefits such as Social Security and Medicare. Likewise, we were told the President's Executive order would make our immigration system more fair and more functional, more accessible for everyone. But we now know his plan will only exacerbate the problems in our labor market for American workers by giving more power and more money to the dysfunctional U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, or USCIS. This is the agency within the Department of Homeland Security that was recently reported to have given over 900,000 work permits to illegal immigrants since 2009. We know that unless we do something to stop it, unless we do something to reach back and take back our constitutional privilege, our institutional privilege as the lawmaking branch of the Federal Government, the President's Executive order will go into effect at a time when all net job growth in our economy since 2007 has gone to immigrants. These are the kinds of facts and figures that ought to inform the legislative process and ought to not be treated as some sort of afterthought. These are not, coincidentally, exactly the kinds of observations, the kinds of facts and figures, the kinds of details that could have been and should have been and, undoubtedly, inevitably would have been explored had this policy been implemented through the constitutionally prescribed formula. Last November the President may have chosen to ignore these facts and to circumvent debate altogether, but that doesn't mean we have to respond in kind. That certainly doesn't mean we have to capitulate and say, okay, the way he wants to do it is fine. It is not constitutional. It is not legal. It is not what the American people want, but we just have to accept it. No. On the contrary, I believe we have not just a right but we have a duty, we have an affirmative obligation to make every effort to ensure lawmaking by edict does not become the new normal in this country. Not now, not ever, not in the United States of America. Beginning debate on this bill will give us the opportunity to do just that, to make sure this never becomes the new normal. Some have said we shouldn't be debating the President's Executive action on immigration right now. They say it has nothing to do with funding the operations of the Department of Homeland Security. To this I have a very simple reply: If not now, when? If we are not going to do it right now, when are we going to do it? When will there be a better time? When will there be any adequate time for us to respond to this constitutional overreach, this grave injustice? If we don't debate the legality of the President's Executive orders when we are in the very process of authorizing money to the Department that is tasked with carrying out those very orders, then when exactly will we have that debate? The truth is now is the perfect time because it is the only time. It is the only time when we can do this. It is the only time for us to have a meaningful debate on the President's Executive action on immigration. At any other point our debate is more or less hypothetical. Now is the time, when we are exercising our constitutional power of the purse, that our debate has consequences, real consequences. They are consequences the American people can see and feel, consequences that will inure to the betterment or the detriment of the American people. Now is the time when this needs to be debated. The power of the purse is the power to allocate money to fund government operations as well as the power to withhold money from improper or illegitimate government operations. It is what enables Congress--and only Congress, uniquely Congress--to reform dysfunctional government. We like to talk about the power of the purse as a tool that Congress can use, use as a check and a balance against the excesses of an overbearing President. That is absolutely true. There is no doubt about it. But first and foremost, it is a tool for Members of Congress themselves to represent the interests of our constituents and to fix the very things that are broken within our government. Our Constitution grants the legislative branch--this branch, Congress--the power of the purse not simply to achieve some abstract equilibrium or balance of power, but to compel the national government to truly represent the American people and to be faithful stewards of taxpayer funds. At the end of November of last year, President Obama made his choice. It was an unfortunate choice; it was a wrong choice. It was a choice not backed up by law, not backed up by the U.S. Constitution, and flatly inconsistent with the same. President [[Page S690]] Obama made his choice in November. Now it is time for us to make ours. The President chose to sidestep Congress, and in the process to avoid debate and to rewrite our immigration laws on his own. Now we must decide: Are we going to be a deliberative body or are we going to be a rubberstamp for the President's agenda, whoever the President is happens to be in power, whether it is now or years from now? Are we going to be that kind of legislative body that just rubberstamps what the President does, or are we going to exercise our prerogative as an independent coordinate branch of this government to make sure our laws are faithfully and carefully executed in a manner consistent not only with the wishes of the people but also with the formula prescribed by the Constitution? Are we going to acquiesce to an Executive who disregards the boundaries of his office, or are we going to stand up for the rule of law and for the will of the American people? I choose the latter. I urge my colleagues to choose the latter. I hope my colleagues will join me in voting to at least begin debate on H.R. 240. This is a debate the American people have been waiting for Congress to have for far too long. If not now, when? The time is now. We need to get on this bill. We need to debate it. We need to allow our constituents to be heard. The American people have a will, and that will is expressed though regular elections. Those elections choose those people who occupy seats in this Chamber and in the House of Representatives. We must represent them. We must do so in a manner fully consistent with the oath that every one of us has taken as required by article VI of the Constitution. We can begin to do that by voting to proceed to H.R. 240 tomorrow. I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.

Not just because we have only 25 days before the current budget authority for DHS expires but also because this debate will finally allow the American people to see where their elected representatives, right here in the U.S. Senate, stand on President Obama's recent Executive action on immigration. The legislature is the only lawmaking branch within our Federal Government because it is the only deliberative branch in our government. Before Congress enacts a piece of legislation--before it makes a new piece of law--we first debate the merits of that legislation--weighing the various pros and cons of each proposal in a candid and transparent discussion, and allowing the various sides of the issue to make their case. [[Page S689]] Open, robust debate is not merely incidental to the lawmaking process that goes on here, it is the essence of that lawmaking process. It is at the very heart, the very center, the very core of this process that we hold near and dear and was established by our 227-year-old founding document. It is the only way for Members of Congress to fully explore the cost and consequences of a particular policy under consideration. It is the only way for the American people to know exactly where their elected officials stand on an issue; and, just as importantly, why they stand where they stand. When the President of the United States announced in November of last year he was singlehandedly going to rewrite our immigration laws, in effect, he short-circuited this process of debate and of deliberation that is at the very heart of our constitutional lawmaking process. His announcement showed us what it looks like when one person ignores the limits of his office and claims the power to change the law all on his own, just as an expression of his own unilateral will. Policies are written behind closed doors, in consultation with lawyers and special-interest groups, rather than the American people. The law is pronounced from behind a podium as a fait accompli rather than discussed and debated in an open, transparent, fair contest of ideas and open to inspection by 300 million Americans who will be affected by these decisions. This is not how our Republic works. It is not what the American people expect from their elected officials in Washington, DC. Indeed, poll after poll shows most people disapprove of the President's Executive action on immigration--that same action taken just this last November. Even those who agree with the President on policy grounds, even those who think the President's amnesty action would be the kind of policy they would prefer, even those people disagree with the President on the process because the American people understand that the process does matter. Especially among those people who have taken an oath to uphold, protect, and defend the Constitution of the United States--that same document that prescribes the formula by which our laws are made. According to one poll, when asked if the President should ``sidestep Congress and act on his own using Executive orders,'' only 22 percent of the public said he should--22 percent. It is hardly a rousing mandate from the American people. In other words, the American people know what our President seems to have forgotten: that in a constitutional republic the ends don't justify the means. The American people oppose lawmaking by fiat not out of some abstract loyalty to the abstract concept of separation of powers. No, that is not why. Rather, they understand quite intuitively that when a President sidesteps Congress and avoids open, robust debate on a particular policy, it is probably because the public isn't likely to accept and isn't likely to like the substance of that policy. Otherwise, he wouldn't need to take this kind of action. Otherwise, he could do it through the people's duly elected representatives who have been put in office specifically for the purpose of making law through this open, deliberative, transparent process. This is certainly what we have seen in the aftermath of the President's Executive order on immigration. The more the people discover about the content and about the consequences of his policy, the less they like it. For instance, the President claimed that his Executive order would honor the golden rule of American exceptionalism: If you work hard and play by the rules, you can get ahead. We now know his plan subverts this very basic fundamental bargain by paving a path to citizenship for millions of immigrants who have broken the rules and violated the law, and by granting them work permits and benefits such as Social Security and Medicare. Likewise, we were told the President's Executive order would make our immigration system more fair and more functional, more accessible for everyone. But we now know his plan will only exacerbate the problems in our labor market for American workers by giving more power and more money to the dysfunctional U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, or USCIS. This is the agency within the Department of Homeland Security that was recently reported to have given over 900,000 work permits to illegal immigrants since 2009. We know that unless we do something to stop it, unless we do something to reach back and take back our constitutional privilege, our institutional privilege as the lawmaking branch of the Federal Government, the President's Executive order will go into effect at a time when all net job growth in our economy since 2007 has gone to immigrants. These are the kinds of facts and figures that ought to inform the legislative process and ought to not be treated as some sort of afterthought. These are not, coincidentally, exactly the kinds of observations, the kinds of facts and figures, the kinds of details that could have been and should have been and, undoubtedly, inevitably would have been explored had this policy been implemented through the constitutionally prescribed formula. Last November the President may have chosen to ignore these facts and to circumvent debate altogether, but that doesn't mean we have to respond in kind. That certainly doesn't mean we have to capitulate and say, okay, the way he wants to do it is fine. It is not constitutional. It is not legal. It is not what the American people want, but we just have to accept it. No. On the contrary, I believe we have not just a right but we have a duty, we have an affirmative obligation to make every effort to ensure lawmaking by edict does not become the new normal in this country. Not now, not ever, not in the United States of America. Beginning debate on this bill will give us the opportunity to do just that, to make sure this never becomes the new normal. Some have said we shouldn't be debating the President's Executive action on immigration right now. They say it has nothing to do with funding the operations of the Department of Homeland Security. To this I have a very simple reply: If not now, when? If we are not going to do it right now, when are we going to do it? When will there be a better time? When will there be any adequate time for us to respond to this constitutional overreach, this grave injustice? If we don't debate the legality of the President's Executive orders when we are in the very process of authorizing money to the Department that is tasked with carrying out those very orders, then when exactly will we have that debate? The truth is now is the perfect time because it is the only time. It is the only time when we can do this. It is the only time for us to have a meaningful debate on the President's Executive action on immigration. At any other point our debate is more or less hypothetical. Now is the time, when we are exercising our constitutional power of the purse, that our debate has consequences, real consequences. They are consequences the American people can see and feel, consequences that will inure to the betterment or the detriment of the American people. Now is the time when this needs to be debated. The power of the purse is the power to allocate money to fund government operations as well as the power to withhold money from improper or illegitimate government operations. It is what enables Congress--and only Congress, uniquely Congress--to reform dysfunctional government. We like to talk about the power of the purse as a tool that Congress can use, use as a check and a balance against the excesses of an overbearing President. That is absolutely true. There is no doubt about it. But first and foremost, it is a tool for Members of Congress themselves to represent the interests of our constituents and to fix the very things that are broken within our government. Our Constitution grants the legislative branch--this branch, Congress--the power of the purse not simply to achieve some abstract equilibrium or balance of power, but to compel the national government to truly represent the American people and to be faithful stewards of taxpayer funds. At the end of November of last year, President Obama made his choice. It was an unfortunate choice; it was a wrong choice. It was a choice not backed up by law, not backed up by the U.S. Constitution, and flatly inconsistent with the same. President [[Page S690]] Obama made his choice in November. Now it is time for us to make ours. The President chose to sidestep Congress, and in the process to avoid debate and to rewrite our immigration laws on his own. Now we must decide: Are we going to be a deliberative body or are we going to be a rubberstamp for the President's agenda, whoever the President is happens to be in power, whether it is now or years from now? Are we going to be that kind of legislative body that just rubberstamps what the President does, or are we going to exercise our prerogative as an independent coordinate branch of this government to make sure our laws are faithfully and carefully executed in a manner consistent not only with the wishes of the people but also with the formula prescribed by the Constitution? Are we going to acquiesce to an Executive who disregards the boundaries of his office, or are we going to stand up for the rule of law and for the will of the American people? I choose the latter. I urge my colleagues to choose the latter. I hope my colleagues will join me in voting to at least begin debate on H.R. 240. This is a debate the American people have been waiting for Congress to have for far too long. If not now, when? The time is now. We need to get on this bill. We need to debate it. We need to allow our constituents to be heard. The American people have a will, and that will is expressed though regular elections. Those elections choose those people who occupy seats in this Chamber and in the House of Representatives. We must represent them. We must do so in a manner fully consistent with the oath that every one of us has taken as required by article VI of the Constitution. We can begin to do that by voting to proceed to H.R. 240 tomorrow. I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. SULLIVAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. ____________________",package_114_256.csv,23964,23964,24033,"[congressional record volume 161, number 17 (monday, february 2, 2015)] [senate] [pages s687-s690] from the congressional record online through the government publishing office [ www.gpo.gov ] department of homeland security funding mr. kaine. mr. president, i rise today because i wish to speak about the importance of this dhs funding bill that is going to be before the body in the coming days. in particular, i wish to emphasize what i think is the important imperative that we pass what we are calling a clean bill to fund the department of homeland security for the remainder of fiscal year 2015 through the end of september. that clean bill would be a bill that would fund homeland security without attaching additional items to it concerning immigration. the support of this legislation was an initiative we were together on. we negotiated in december as part of a budget process by leaders of both parties in both chambers, and the funding for dhs would have been an increase to help protect our borders and help protect our security by about $1.2 billion above the enacted level for fiscal year 2014. but at the end of the year the decision was made by the house to not fund that piece and leave it separately and that is why we are now talking about whether we will fund the nation's homeland security efforts and under what circumstances. all 45 members on the democratic side, save only senator reid, have written a letter saying let's make sure we fund dhs at the level we have already agreed to between the houses. then, let's not play politics over immigration issues; let's take up immigration separately. but the house bill that has been sent to us includes measures to begin to block or unwind actions taken by the president on immigration, and those complicate what all should agree is a national imperative, which is the need to fund homeland security. if we don't pass such a bill, that funding will expire on february 28. i don't need to explain too much why homeland security funding is important, but let me make a few points. this department was created after the attacks of 9/11, and its stated mission--while it employs an awful lot of people and does many complicated things, the mission is quite simple--let's keep our country safe, secure, and resilient against terrorism and other hazards. we see every day the kinds of terrorism hazards we are dealing with. the horrible shooting in paris a few weeks ago and the shooting in quebec a few months ago remind us of the dangers of terrorism, and now that we are in a war against isil--a jihadist terrorist enemy that has promised to carry out attacks on the united states--we should be very concerned about the mission the dhs performs and the need to provide funding. the men and women who work for the dhs are quite a wide swath of our federal employees. they are the tsa personnel who protect our transportation system, the border patrol agents who serve on our nation's front lines, customs officials who oversee the entrance of nearly 1 million visitors per day who come to the united states, and we need customs agents to help process those visitors. our dhs folks include disaster specialists--people who respond to hurricanes and other emergencies. our coast guard, our secret service, and many of our cyber security professionals all work for the dhs and they work hard every day to carry out that mission of keeping our nation safe. funding dhs is not just critical to the nation's security, it is also critical to the economy because dhs is the third largest agency in the federal government by the number of employees. the impact of any shutdown or cessation of funding would reverberate through the country, from our southwest border to our nation's ports to every international airport that brings in either foreign commerce or foreign visitors who want to come and be tourists in our country. many dhs employees, as the presiding officer knows, call virginia home, and a shutdown would impact their lives and would make it difficult for them to plan not only for their immediate needs but for an unknown period of time. so as we are facing threats--and i think we all would agree--while we sometimes have differences of opinion about how to deal with threats, i think everybody in this body would acknowledge that the threats we are dealing with as a nation are not shrinking, they are growing. the challenges we are facing are not getting fewer in number, they are getting greater in number. to respond to threats, the dhs not only needs a good funding bill at an appropriate level, which we have already agreed to, but they need financial certainty and the flexibility to direct its resources as they can. let me give one interesting recent example of how dhs employees have [[page s688]] been very important in virginia, and how those serving in virginia have performed a critical role for the nation. we saw a crisis spring up in 2014 that many of us hadn't paid too much attention to before, and that is the spread of the ebola virus in africa. that epidemic that began in 2014 is the largest in history for this kind of virus and it had a significant impact on many west african countries. there were more than 22,000 cases as of january 30, 2015. one of the great things is whenever there is a challenge such as this, the nations of the world turn to the united states and they ask for our help. many parts of our government responded. we deployed military and health professionals to africa to try to battle the disease there, but we have also deployed our dhs personnel right here at home to keep us safe. as part of this strategy to stop the spread of ebola, dhs announced in october that five u.s. airports would begin an advanced screening process for ebola, and one of those airports is in virginia, and that is dulles airport. shortly after, dhs announced that all travelers from ebola-affected countries would have to enter the united states from one of these five airports. so using existing resources--using existing resources because we didn't have an ebola line item in the 2014 budget; this is an emergency that came up--but with existing resources, the dhs employees at dulles were charged with supervising the entire ebola screening process, including administering questionnaires, taking travelers' temperatures, and referring potentially infected people to the centers for disease control, while also doing all of their regular duties. these officers in virginia have gone above and beyond their mission for the sake of keeping every american safe. since this advanced screening began in october, cbp officers at dulles have interviewed more than 2,000 visitors to the united states from african countries and they have referred more than 140 people to the cdc. as a result of their work and the work of their colleagues and their ability to react to this emerging threat, the united states has only seen two diagnosed cases of ebola since advanced screening began at our airports, and both patients recovered. this should be viewed as a huge success. remember how worried we all were--how worried i was--when this was happening in september and october. our dhs employees have gone the extra mile to keep us safe. this is the kind of mission that we call upon our dhs employees to carry out for our security. it has nothing to do with congressional debates about immigration policy, but it has everything to do with doing the stated mission of keeping us safe. to limit dhs's access to resources by shutting down the agency or passing another continuing resolution that would keep them running on auto pilot--sort of driving by looking in the rearview mirror rather than looking through the windshield of the challenges to come--would damage the ability of dhs to deal with growing threats. i understand the message from the house. we have agreed on the right funding level for dhs. they are saying, however, that we will only fund dhs, we will only fund the guys who are protecting us from isil, or protecting us from ebola, or protecting our ports from nuclear material being shipped--we will only fund it if we can get an agreement to change policies enacted by the president with immigration. they are threatening to stop funding dhs actions unless we reverse the president's actions on immigration--actions that, in my view, are already helping the economy by bringing families out of the shadows to become productive, taxpaying members of our communities. while i strongly support the president's immigration actions--and most of them i voted for as part of the senate's comprehensive immigration reform bill that we passed in june of 2013--i can understand there might be members of the house who may not like those actions. they may want to do something different. and the great thing is they have an ability to do something different. the house, with a significant republican majority, can pass their own immigration reform bill. they can retract the president's actions. they can express what they want to do about immigration reform. they can pass that bill just as they passed the dhs funding bill, and send it over to the senate, and we can have a debate about immigration reform. but we can have that debate without holding hostage the funding of the third largest agency in government, without holding hostage the work that agency does every day to keep us safe. i think the good news in all of this is in both the house and senate there are people who think the immigration system is broken, the immigration system needs to be fixed, and we ought to have a dialogue to do it. certainly, when the senate passed an immigration reform bill in june of 2013--nearly 2 years ago--and we sent it to the house, we knew the house was not going to adopt what the senate passed without changing anything. we were trying to start a dialogue where the house could pass their own bill and then we could sit down in conference and work out a solution to an immigration system that we all think is broken. that is what we should be doing as responsible legislators-- fixing an immigration system, and even those of us who have different views, getting those views on the table and finding a compromise. it is the wrong thing to do to try to hold up funding for the third largest agency in government--this agency that is keeping us safe in so many ways all over this country every day--to try to reverse actions the president took that are well within his legal authority. so i am going to continue to support the president's executive actions. i am going to continue to encourage the house and others, if they have different ideas about immigration reform, to pass a bill, put their ideas on the table and we will talk about them. but it is wrong to try to hold up protecting our nation's security as a punishment to the president for using executive action that was within his legal power to make. since we have the complete ability to have a discussion about immigration, let's do it. i will conclude and say this, although i wish i didn't have to--and particularly looking at these young pages who are sitting in front of me--it is a dangerous world out there. for the sake of these youngsters and my own kids, i wish it was getting less dangerous. i have a son in the military. i wish it was getting less dangerous, but it is not. it is getting more dangerous. the kinds of threats we have to face abroad and at home are tough, challenging, difficult threats. we have professionals on the front line every day, many of whom are risking their lives for us, to try to stop these threats. let's not starve their work. let's not hamper their work. let's not make them face the threat of a shutdown or losing their salary or losing their livelihood while we wait for congress to have a meaningful debate about immigration. i appreciate the opportunity to offer those thoughts and to urge funding for a clean dhs bill. i yield the floor. the presiding officer (mr. lankford). the senator from utah. mr. lee. mr. president, tomorrow afternoon the senate will vote to begin consideration of the bill called h.r. 240. this is a bill that authorizes funding for the department of homeland security, or dhs. it would fund dhs through september of this year. this, of course, is a procedural vote we have scheduled for tomorrow, not a substantive one. the only question on the table, the sole question in connection with this particular vote, will be whether the senate is ready to begin voting and debating on h.r. 240. i am ready--i am eager, in fact--to begin this debate. it does need to begin. that is what this vote is about. not just because we have only 25 days before the current budget authority for dhs expires but also because this debate will finally allow the american people to see where their elected representatives, right here in the u.s. senate, stand on president obama's recent executive action on immigration.

[[page s689]] open, robust debate is not merely incidental to the lawmaking process that goes on here, it is the essence of that lawmaking process. it is at the very heart, the very center, the very core of this process that we hold near and dear and was established by our 227-year-old founding document. it is the only way for members of congress to fully explore the cost and consequences of a particular policy under consideration. it is the only way for the american people to know exactly where their elected officials stand on an issue; and, just as importantly, why they stand where they

CREC-2015-02-02-pt1-PgS686,CREC-2015-02-02,114,CHIP FUNDING,"[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 17 (Monday, February 2, 2015)] [Senate] [Pages S686-S687] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] CHIP FUNDING Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, 1 year and 1 week ago, on a cold, snowy morning in Cleveland, OH, not much different from what I woke up to this morning in Cleveland, OH, I attended the Dr. Martin Luther King Memorial Breakfast in that city, which is also my hometown. A minister at that breakfast said something that we all know but probably have not thought about and rarely put in such succinct, meaningful words. He said: Your life expectancy is connected to your ZIP Code. Think about that. Whether you grew up on the east side of Cleveland or Gary, IN, or whether you grew up in Appalachia, OH, or southern Indiana, or whether you grew up in a city, suburb, small town, affluent, less affluent, low income, rural, or urban, your ZIP Code often determines whether you have access to quality health care, to a good, solid education, and the social support that is necessary to succeed. It is up to this body to help ensure--not to do it and not to do it alone--that every ZIP Code is one that provides opportunity, not inequality. Ten years ago, the ZIP Code where my wife and I live in the city of Cleveland had the highest foreclosure rate of any ZIP Code in America. Think about what that means for a 12 year-old-child of a family where the father gets laid off from work and the mother has her hours cut back. Even though they were doing everything right, they can't pay their mortgage. They sit down with their 12-year-old daughter and say: Honey, we are going to have to move, but we don't know where we are going yet. We don't know what school district you are going to be in, and we don't know if you will be close enough to be able to stay with your friends. Those kinds of decisions happen far too often. Those kinds of scenarios happen far too often. But we know that in many ways we have made progress. Fifty years ago the poverty rate was 26 percent, and today it is around 15 percent thanks in large part to what people in this institution have done with social insurance programs, such as the Affordable Care Act, Medicaid, and today's Children's Health Insurance Program, so-called CHIP. There was no greater champion in the Senate for children's health care than my predecessor, the Senator from West Virginia who actually sat at this desk on the Senate floor, retired Senator Jay Rockefeller. He helped to write CHIP in 1997. I was a member of the House Health Subcommittee of the Energy and Commerce Committee at that time. I believe the Presiding Officer sat on that committee when he was in the House many years ago. We worked on writing CHIP in 1997 when it was a joint State-Federal health insurance program for low- to moderate- income children and pregnant women. Keep in mind that in most cases the children who are in today's Children's Health Insurance Program have at least one working parent in their family. CHIP provides health insurance to low-income families who fall into a coverage gap: They make too much to qualify for Medicaid, but they don't make enough to qualify for private insurance. Many employers don't offer the insurance. They don't make enough money and are not able to afford to buy the insurance due to the high copays and the high premiums they would typically face. Today's CHIP, the current CHIP program, bridges that gap. I am honored to continue the fight to protect this program and ensure that Congress acts to extend funding for the current program before it expires at the end of September. You may have noticed that I said today's CHIP, the current program. When CHIP started in 1997, it was a good program. It was started in the Senate by Senator Rockefeller, Senator Kennedy, and Senator Hatch. It was very bipartisan, and it passed overwhelmingly. Those of us who worked on it in the House--Congressman Billirakis and I, as leaders on the Health Subcommittee, and others--made sure that it was bipartisan and that it worked very well. But understand that over the 20 years of CHIP, each time it has been reauthorized, we made it better. We extended the benefits because we have seen where the coverage gaps are. We made it more efficient, we made it work better, we have kept the bipartisan nature to it, and that is why I referred to it as today's CHIP, as the current program. Providing health insurance to low-income children is not just the right thing to do, it is the smart thing to do. It is the right thing to do because these are families where the parents are working hard and taking responsibility but simply can't afford health insurance for their child. Today I was in Cleveland with a couple of people--Shonte Saunders and her daughter Amari. Ms. Saunders is a young woman with two children. Amari is 9 years old. Ms. Saunders told me she is working, raising her children, and she is in school studying to become a nurse at Cuyahoga County Community College. She is doing the right thing, but she said: If CHIP expires, I don't want to be in the position where I have to choose between taking my daughter to a doctor for an ear infection versus having to provide enough food to put food on the table, or a more serious illness or injury than that. Why should she be subjected to that? Listen to these numbers. Thanks to CHIP, the number of uninsured children has fallen by half. It went from 14 percent almost 20 years ago when Senator Hatch, Senator Kennedy, and Senator Rockefeller wrote this program in the Senate and Congressman Billirakis and I and others in the House wrote it to a record low of 7 percent. Because of today's CHIP, 10 million children--130,000 children in my State of Ohio alone-- have access to health care they may not have received otherwise. Over the past week I met with parents across Ohio. I met with Jennifer Huit in Cincinnati and listened to her story. In Dayton, I listened to a family talk about what CHIP means to them. Think about this: It provides a sigh of relief for parents like Shonte and Jennifer, and not only for financial reasons. CHIP means better access for preventive and comprehensive care. Too often, if you are right on the edge and making $12 or $13 or less an hour and don't have Medicaid, think about the choices you know you have to make. You can't take your child to the doctor if they are only kind of sick. If you had insurance, you would take her in. But she is kind of sick, and it may get worse, but you will only take her in if it gets worse because you really can't afford those out-of-pocket expenses. Think of the tension and the difficult life that people generally have anyway at that income level. Think of how much more difficult that is. CHIP-- which in Ohio is administered [[Page S687]] through Medicaid--means that a child in Cleveland or Cincinnati or Gallipolis or Troy or Pickaway, OH, can see a family doctor when they need it, thereby preventing a costly ambulance ride and emergency room visit. CHIP means a bunch of things. It means vaccines, shots, dental coverage, and better treatment if kids get sick. Think about this: It is not just the health care. It means they do better in school. It means they miss fewer days in school so they don't fall behind their classmates who perhaps have better health insurance. It means they perform better in school because they feel better. We know the stories of how a hungry or sick child can't focus on what they need to do in the classroom. CHIP means that children from Bowling Green will get the health care they need to become healthy, active adults. We know that the current CHIP--today's 2015 version of CHIP--works not just because of the number of insured children under the program but because of the flexibility it provides States and the quality of care children receive. Ohio's conservative Republican Governor supports CHIP. It is called Healthy Start in Ohio because the Governor and legislature have been given flexibility under CHIP to make it work for that State. The flexibility that CHIP provides States is the result of 20 years of watching, observing, quantifying, and analyzing CHIP. We have had 18 years of experience in seeing what works best, and we have worked together to make improvements. As a result, under the current CHIP program, more children are covered and the coverage they get is better. If we don't act, understand that CHIP--the authorization, the language, the law governing CHIP is in effect until 2019, but the funding for CHIP runs out in September of this year. You have to have both. You have to have the law governing CHIP--how it works, who is eligible, how the States have flexibility--but obviously you also need the money to implement it. If Congress doesn't act now, first of all, Ohio, my State, would lose $146 million in Federal funds in 2016 alone, and the Presiding Officer's State of Indiana would lose tens of millions of dollars in CHIP funding. We know another thing: Whether it is Governor Pence in Indiana or Governor Kasich in my State, they need the flexibility of knowing what Congress is actually going to do. We should not wait until July or August; we should reallocate money for CHIP today. If we don't act, parents like Shonte and Jennifer may not be able to get the quality, affordable care for their children as States would start to roll back CHIP programs. That is why I will soon introduce legislation to protect the program and extend its funding so it runs out at the same time as the authorization--the roadmap, if you will, of how CHIP will work. If we let the program run out of funding, the number of uninsured children will increase, the quality of health care will decrease, and States will see a significant increase in cost-sharing services. Providing health insurance to low-income children isn't just the right thing to do, it is the smart thing to do. If the program works, it works for children, it works for parents, it works for communities, and it works for our great country. I call on my colleagues to work with me to extend funding for the current CHIP program before it is too late. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. KAINE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 17 (Monday, February 2, 2015)] [Senate] [Pages S686-S687] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] CHIP FUNDING Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, 1 year and 1 week ago, on a cold, snowy morning in Cleveland, OH, not much different from what I woke up to this morning in Cleveland, OH, I attended the Dr. Martin Luther King Memorial Breakfast in that city, which is also my hometown. A minister at that breakfast said something that we all know but probably have not thought about and rarely put in such succinct, meaningful words. He said: Your life expectancy is connected to your ZIP Code. Think about that. Whether you grew up on the east side of Cleveland or Gary, IN, or whether you grew up in Appalachia, OH, or southern Indiana, or whether you grew up in a city, suburb, small town, affluent, less affluent, low income, rural, or urban, your ZIP Code often determines whether you have access to quality health care, to a good, solid education, and the social support that is necessary to succeed. It is up to this body to help ensure--not to do it and not to do it alone--that every ZIP Code is one that provides opportunity, not inequality. Ten years ago, the ZIP Code where my wife and I live in the city of Cleveland had the highest foreclosure rate of any ZIP Code in America. Think about what that means for a 12 year-old-child of a family where the father gets laid off from work and the mother has her hours cut back. Even though they were doing everything right, they can't pay their mortgage.

taking responsibility but simply can't afford health insurance for their child. today i was in cleveland with a couple of people--shonte saunders and her daughter amari. ms. saunders is a young woman with two children. amari is 9 years old. ms. saunders told me she is working, raising her children, and she is in school studying to become a nurse at cuyahoga county community college. she is doing the right thing, but she said: if chip expires, i don't want to be in the position where i have to choose between taking my daughter to a doctor for an ear infection versus having to provide enough food to put food on the table, or a more serious illness or injury than that. why should she be subjected to that? listen to these numbers. thanks to chip, the number of uninsured children has fallen by half. it went from 14 percent almost 20 years ago when senator hatch, senator kennedy, and senator rockefeller wrote this program in the senate and congressman billirakis and i and others in the house wrote it to a record low of 7 percent. because of today's chip, 10 million children--130,000 children in my state of ohio alone-- have access to health care they may not have received otherwise. over the past week i met with parents across ohio. i met with jennifer huit in cincinnati and listened to her story. in dayton, i listened to a family talk about what chip means to them. think about this: it provides a sigh of relief for parents like shonte and jennifer, and not only for financial reasons. chip means better access for preventive and comprehensive care. too often, if you are right on the edge and making $12 or $13 or less an hour and don't have medicaid, think about the choices you know you have to make. you can't take your child to the doctor if they are only kind of sick. if you had insurance, you would take her in. but she is kind of sick, and it may get worse, but you will only take her in if it gets worse because you really can't afford those out-of-pocket expenses. think of the tension and the difficult life that people generally have anyway at that income level. think of how much more difficult that is. chip-- which in ohio is administered [[page s687]] through medicaid--means that a child in cleveland or cincinnati or gallipolis or troy or pickaway, oh, can see a family doctor when they need it, thereby preventing a costly ambulance ride and emergency room visit. chip means a bunch of things. it means vaccines, shots, dental coverage, and better treatment if kids get sick. think about this: it is not just the health care. it means they do better in school. it means they miss fewer days in school so they don't fall behind their classmates who perhaps have better health insurance. it means they perform better in school because they feel better. we know the stories of how a hungry or sick child can't focus on what they need to do in the classroom. chip means that children from bowling green will get the health care they need to become healthy, active adults. we know that the current chip--today's 2015 version of chip--works not just because of the number of insured children under the program but because of the flexibility it provides states and the quality of care children receive. ohio's conservative republican governor supports chip. it is called healthy start in ohio because the governor and legislature have been given flexibility under chip to make it work for that state. the flexibility that chip provides states is the result of 20 years of watching, observing, quantifying, and analyzing chip. we have had 18 years of experience in seeing what works best, and we have worked together to make improvements. as a result, under the current chip program, more children are covered and the coverage they get is better. if we don't act, understand that chip--the authorization, the language, the law governing chip is in effect until 2019, but the funding for chip runs out in september of this year. you have to have both. you have to have the law governing chip--how it works, who is eligible, how the states have flexibility--but obviously you also need the money to implement it. if congress doesn't act now, first of all, ohio, my state, would lose $146 million in federal funds in 2016 alone, and the presiding officer's state of indiana would lose tens of millions of dollars in chip funding. we know another thing: whether it is governor pence in indiana or governor kasich in my state, they need the flexibility of knowing what congress is actually going to do. we should not wait until july or august; we should reallocate money for chip today. if we don't act, parents like shonte and jennifer may not be able to get the quality, affordable care for their children as states would start to roll back chip programs. that is why i will soon introduce legislation to protect the program and extend its funding so it runs out at the same time as the authorization--the roadmap, if you will, of how chip will work. if we let the program run out of funding, the number of uninsured children will increase, the quality of health care will decrease, and states will see a significant increase in cost-sharing services. providing health insurance to low-income children isn't just the right thing to do, it is the smart thing to do. if the program works, it works for children, it works for parents, it works for communities, and it works for our great country. i call on my colleagues to work with me to extend funding for the current chip program before it is too late. mr. president, i suggest the absence of a quorum. the presiding officer. the clerk will call the roll. the assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. mr. kaine. mr. president, i ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. the presiding officer. without objection, it is so ordered. ____________________",10528
CREC-2015-02-02-pt1-PgS690,CREC-2015-02-02,114,CLAY HUNT SAV ACT,"[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 17 (Monday, February 2, 2015)] [Senate] [Page S690] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] CLAY HUNT SAV ACT Mr. SULLIVAN. Mr. President, last night tens of millions of Americans watched the Super Bowl, a game that has become a national tradition, something of an American holiday--and for good reason. Competition, grit, and hard work can bring out the best in all of us. But not all Americans were watching. Last night, just like every other night of the year, there were young American men and women, humbly and without complaint, shouldering the burden of protecting their follow citizens from harm. Some were doing this overseas, in places both familiar and unfamiliar to us. Others were here in America doing the hard training that is necessary to hone their warrior skills to protect us. I had the privilege of being with thousands of these fine young Americans last night at the Army's National Training Center, the NTC, at Fort Irwin, CA. Just as in the Super Bowl, they were on the field engaged in fierce competition, force-on-force operations, as part of some of the best, most challenging military training anywhere in the world. But unlike the Super Bowl, there were no winners or losers last night--just winners. Among the participants at NTC are 3,000 soldiers from a battle-hardened Army Stryker brigade based in Fairbanks, AK, along with hundreds of paratroopers from other military bases across Alaska. I felt immense pride in watching them train last night. These young men and women, volunteers all, selflessly stand ready to fight and give their lives for our great country. With all due respect to my distinguished colleagues from New England who are deservedly celebrating today, it is very important to keep in mind that America's true patriots were on the field last night in places such as Fort Irwin, Baghdad, and Kabul. We have an important opportunity to honor their service tomorrow as we prepare to vote on a bipartisan bill to make sure the patriots in our military have the resources and care that can help them fight the despair of suicide. Tomorrow we vote on the Clay Hunt Suicide Prevention for American Veterans Act, which I was proud to cosponsor and help pass out of the Veteran's Affairs Committee. This bill is named for a true American hero, a decorated Marine who fought in Afghanistan and Iraq and who struggled with despair and ultimately took his own life. This bill will start to bring greater awareness and services to the devastation that too many of our finest fall sway to. I encourage all of my distinguished colleagues to vote for this bill tomorrow so we can get it on the President's desk for his signature as soon as possible. A vote tomorrow will be a vote for Clay Hunt, for his courageous family, and for all the families and their loved ones who have lost someone to the national tragedy of suicide. This will be a vote for my State, Alaska, which proudly boasts the highest number of veterans per capita in the United States but, sadly, has the highest rates of suicide in our country. This is also a personal vote for me. It is a story I do not share often or lightly. As an officer in the Marine Corps, both on Active Duty and in the Reserve, I have personally witnessed the struggles, at times tragic, that some of our service men and women undergo. The suicide of a young Alaskan marine under my command still haunts me. You always wonder: Could I have done more? With the proper awareness and resources this marine might be alive today. That is why we need legislation such as the Clay Hunt bill. When I cast my vote tomorrow, it will be a vote for all of our veterans but particularly for the families who have suffered the unspeakable pain of suicide. This is a good bill. It is a good start. As my distinguished colleague from Connecticut calls it, this bill is a downpayment on our debt to our veterans. It will not solve all the problems they face, including rates of suicide among veterans that are far too high in this country. But it is an important beginning. I ask my colleagues to vote for this bill tomorrow. I yield the floor. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 17 (Monday, February 2, 2015)] [Senate] [Page S690] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] CLAY HUNT SAV ACT Mr. SULLIVAN.

With its strong commitment to serving others, Congregation Ner Tamid is an integral and deeply valued part of the Las Vegas community. As the largest Reform synagogue in the State of Nevada, with a membership of more than 600 families, Congregation Ner Tamid is an important center for the Jewish community. For decades, the congregation has provided opportunities for religious education to members of all ages and helped sustain important Jewish traditions that have been practiced for centuries. At the same time, Congregation Ner Tamid has worked to develop strong, interfaith relationships with other communities in southern Nevada. Congregation Ner Tamid hosted the Interfaith Council of Southern Nevada's annual Thanksgiving observance this past November, bringing together people with diverse spiritual views in a unified commitment to mutual understanding and cooperation. In particular, I appreciate the value Congregation Ner Tamid places on serving others and working to improve the Las Vegas community.

If at least three members of the committee desire that a special meeting of the committee be called by the chairman, those members may file in the offices of the committee their written request to the chairman for that special meeting. Immediately upon filing of the request, the chief clerk of the committee shall notify the chairman of the filing of the request. If, within three calendar days after the filing of the request, the chairman does not call the requested special meeting, to be held within seven calendar days after the filing of the request, a majority of the members of the committee may file in the offices of the committee their written notice that a special meeting of the committee will be held, specifying the date and hour of that special meeting. The committee shall meet on that date and hour. Immediately upon the filing of the notice, the clerk shall notify all members of the committee that such special meeting will be held and inform them of its date and hour. (c) Hearings, Selection of Witnesses.--To ensure that the issue which is the subject of the hearing is presented as fully and fairly as possible, whenever a hearing is conducted by the committee or a subcommittee upon any measure or matter, the ranking member of the committee or subcommittee may select and call an equal number of non-governmental witnesses to testify at that hearing. (d) Public Announcement.--The committee, or any subcommittee thereof, shall make public announcement of the date, place, time, and subject matter of any meeting or hearing to be conducted on any measure or matter at least seven calendar days in advance of such meetings or hearings, unless the chairman of the committee, or subcommittee, in consultation with the ranking member, determines that there is good cause to begin such meeting or hearing at an earlier date. (e) Procedure.--Insofar as possible, proceedings of the committee will be conducted without resort to the formalities of parliamentary procedure and with due regard for the views of all members. Issues of procedure which may arise from time to time shall be resolved by decision of the chairman, in consultation with the ranking member. The chairman, in consultation with the ranking member, may also propose special procedures to govern the consideration of particular matters by the committee. (f) Closed Sessions.--Each meeting and hearing of the Committee on Foreign Relations, or any subcommittee thereof shall be open to the public, except that a meeting or hearing or series of meetings or hearings by the committee or a subcommittee on the same subject for a period of no more than 14 calendar days may be closed to the public on a motion made and seconded to go into closed session to discuss only whether the matters enumerated in paragraphs (1) through (6) would require the meeting or hearing to be closed followed immediately by a record vote in open session by a majority of the members of the committee or subcommittee when it is determined that the matters to be discussed or the testimony to be taken at such meeting or hearing or series of meetings or hearings-- (1) will disclose matters necessary to be kept secret in the interests of national defense or the confidential conduct of the foreign relations of the United States; (2) will relate solely to matters of committee staff personnel or internal staff management or procedure; (3) will tend to charge an individual with crime or misconduct; to disgrace or injure the professional standing of an individual, or otherwise to expose an individual to public contempt or obloquy, or will represent a clearly unwarranted invasion of the privacy of an individual; (4) will disclose the identity of any informer or law enforcement agent or will disclose any information relating to the investigation or prosecution of a criminal offense that is required to be kept secret in the interests of effective law enforcement; (5) will disclose information relating to the trade secrets or financial or commercial information pertaining specifically to a given person if-- (A) an Act of Congress requires the information to be kept confidential by government officers and employees; or (B) the information has been obtained by the government on a confidential basis, other than through an application by such person for a specific government financial or other benefit, and is required to be kept secret in order to prevent undue injury to the competitive position of such person, or (6) may divulge matters required to be kept confidential under other provisions of law or government regulations. A closed meeting or hearing may be opened by a majority vote of the committee. (g) Staff Attendance.--A member of the committee may have one member of his or her personal staff, for whom that member assumes personal responsibility, accompany and be seated nearby at committee meetings and hearings. The chairman or ranking member may authorize the attendance and seating of such a staff member at committee meetings and hearings where the member of the committee is not present. Each member of the committee may designate members of his or her personal staff for whom that member assumes personal responsibility, who holds, at a minimum, a top secret security clearance, for the purpose of their eligibility to attend closed sessions of the committee, subject to the same conditions set forth for committee staff under Rules 12, 13, and 14. In addition, the majority leader and the minority leader of the Senate, if they are not otherwise members of the committee, may designate one member of their staff for whom that leader assumes personal responsibility and who holds, at a minimum, a top secret security clearance, to attend closed sessions of the committee, subject to the same conditions set forth for committee staff under Rules 12, 13, and 14. Staff of other Senators who are not members of the committee may not attend closed sessions of the committee. Attendance of committee staff at meetings and hearings shall be limited to those designated by the staff director or the minority staff director. The committee, by majority vote, or the chairman, with the concurrence of the ranking member, may limit staff attendance at specified meetings or hearings. RULE 4--QUORUMS (a) Testimony.--For the purpose of taking sworn or unsworn testimony at any duly scheduled meeting a quorum of the committee and each subcommittee thereof shall consist of one member of such committee or subcommittee.

(c) Reporting.--A majority of the membership of the committee, including at least one member from each party, shall constitute a quorum for reporting any measure or recommendation to the Senate. No measure or recommendation shall be ordered reported from the committee unless a majority of the committee members is physically present, including at least one member from each party, and a majority of those present concurs. RULE 5--PROXIES Proxies must be in writing with the signature of the absent member. Subject to the requirements of Rule 4 for the physical presence of a quorum to report a matter, proxy voting shall be allowed on all measures and matters before the committee. However, proxies shall not be voted on a measure or matter except when the absent member has been informed of the matter on which he is being recorded and has affirmatively requested that he or she be so recorded. RULE 6--WITNESSES (a) General.--The Committee on Foreign Relations will consider requests to testify on any matter or measure pending before the committee. (b) Presentation.--If the chairman so determines, the oral presentation of witnesses shall be limited to 10 minutes. However, written statements of reasonable length may be submitted by witnesses and other interested persons who are unable to testify in person. (c) Filing of Statements.--A witness appearing before the committee, or any subcommittee thereof, shall submit an electronic copy of the written statement of his proposed testimony at least 24 hours prior to his appearance, unless this requirement is waived by the chairman and the ranking member following their determination that there is good cause for failure to file such a statement. (d) Expenses.--Only the chairman may authorize expenditures of funds for the expenses of witnesses appearing before the committee or its subcommittees. (e) Requests.--Any witness called for a hearing may submit a written request to the chairman no later than 24 hours in advance for his testimony to be in closed or open session, or for any other unusual procedure. The chairman shall determine whether to grant any such request and shall notify the committee members of the request and of his decision. RULE 7--SUBPOENAS (a) Authorization.--The chairman or any other member of the committee, when authorized by a majority vote of the committee at a meeting or by proxies, shall have authority to subpoena the attendance of witnesses or the production of memoranda, documents, records, or any other materials. At the request of any member of the committee, the committee shall authorize the issuance of a subpoena only at a meeting of the committee. When the committee authorizes a [[Page S693]] subpoena, it may be issued upon the signature of the chairman or any other member designated by the committee. (b) Return.--A subpoena, or a request to an agency, for documents may be issued whose return shall occur at a time and place other than that of a scheduled committee meeting. A return on such a subpoena or request which is incomplete or accompanied by an objection constitutes good cause for a hearing on shortened notice. Upon such a return, the chairman or any other member designated by him may convene a hearing by giving 4 hours notice by telephone or electronic mail to all other members. One member shall constitute a quorum for such a hearing. The sole purpose of such a hearing shall be to elucidate further information about the return and to rule on the objection. (c) Depositions.--At the direction of the committee, staff is authorized to take depositions from witnesses. RULE 8--REPORTS (a) Filing.--When the committee has ordered a measure or recommendation reported, the report thereon shall be filed in the Senate at the earliest practicable time. (b) Supplemental, Minority and Additional Views.--A member of the committee who gives notice of his intentions to file supplemental, minority, or additional views at the time of final committee approval of a measure or matter, shall be entitled to not less than 3 calendar days in which to file such views, in writing (including by electronic mail), with the chief clerk of the committee, with the 3 days to begin at 11:00 p.m. on the same day that the committee has ordered a measure or matter reported. Such views shall then be included in the committee report and printed in the same volume, as a part thereof, and their inclusion shall be noted on the cover of the report. In the absence of timely notice, the committee report may be filed and printed immediately without such views. (c) Roll Call Votes.--The results of all roll call votes taken in any meeting of the committee on any measure, or amendment thereto, shall be announced in the committee report. The announcement shall include a tabulation of the votes cast in favor and votes cast in opposition to each such measure and amendment by each member of the committee. RULE 9--TREATIES (a) General.--The committee is the only committee of the Senate with jurisdiction to review and report to the Senate on treaties submitted by the President for Senate advice and consent to ratification. Because the House of Representatives has no role in the approval of treaties, the committee is therefore the only congressional committee with responsibility for treaties. (b) Committee Proceedings.--Once submitted by the President for advice and consent, each treaty is referred to the committee and remains on its calendar from Congress to Congress until the committee takes action to report it to the Senate or recommend its return to the President, or until the committee is discharged of the treaty by the Senate. (c) Floor Proceedings.--In accordance with Senate Rule XXX.2, treaties which have been reported to the Senate but not acted on before the end of a Congress ``shall be resumed at the commencement of the next Congress as if no proceedings had previously been had thereon.'' (d) Hearings.--Insofar as possible, the committee should conduct a public hearing on each treaty as soon as possible after its submission by the President. Except in extraordinary circumstances, treaties reported to the Senate shall be accompanied by a written report. RULE 10--NOMINATIONS (a) Waiting Requirement.--Unless otherwise directed by the chairman and the ranking member, the Committee on Foreign Relations shall not consider any nomination until 5 business days after it has been formally submitted to the Senate. (b) Public Consideration.--Nominees for any post who are invited to appear before the committee shall be heard in public session, unless a majority of the committee decrees otherwise, consistent with Rule 3(f). (c) Required Data.--No nomination shall be reported to the Senate unless (1) the nominee has been accorded a security clearance on the basis of a thorough investigation by executive branch agencies; (2) the nominee has filed a financial disclosure report and a related ethics undertaking with the committee; (3) the committee has been assured that the nominee does not have any interests which could conflict with the interests of the government in the exercise of the nominee's proposed responsibilities; (4) for persons nominated to be chief of mission, ambassador-at-large, or minister, the committee has received a complete list of any contributions made by the nominee or members of his immediate family to any Federal election campaign during the year of his or her nomination and for the 4 preceding years; (5) for persons nominated to be chiefs of mission, the report required by Section 304(a)(4) of the Foreign Service Act of 1980 on the demonstrated competence of that nominee to perform the duties of the position to which he or she has been nominated; and (6) the nominee has provided the committee with a signed and notarized copy of the committee questionnaire for executive branch nominees. RULE 11--TRAVEL (a) Foreign Travel.--No member of the Committee on Foreign Relations or its staff shall travel abroad on committee business unless specifically authorized by the chairman, who is required by law to approve vouchers and report expenditures of foreign currencies, and the ranking member. Requests for authorization of such travel shall state the purpose and, when completed, a full substantive and financial report shall be filed with the committee within 30 days. This report shall be furnished to all members of the committee and shall not be otherwise disseminated without authorization of the chairman and the ranking member. Except in extraordinary circumstances, staff travel shall not be approved unless the reporting requirements have been fulfilled for all prior trips. Except for travel that is strictly personal, travel funded by non-U.S. Government sources is subject to the same approval and substantive reporting requirements as U.S. Government-funded travel. In addition, members and staff are reminded to consult the Senate Code of Conduct, and, as appropriate, the Senate Select Committee on Ethics, in the case of travel sponsored by non-U.S. Government sources. Any proposed travel by committee staff for a subcommittee purpose must be approved by the subcommittee chairman and ranking member prior to submission of the request to the chairman and ranking member of the full committee. (b) Domestic Travel.--All official travel in the United States by the committee staff shall be approved in advance by the staff director, or in the case of minority staff, by the minority staff director. (c) Personal Staff Travel.--As a general rule, no more than one member of the personal staff of a member of the committee may travel with that member with the approval of the chairman and the ranking member of the committee. During such travel, the personal staff member shall be considered to be an employee of the committee. (d) PRM Travel.--For the purposes of this rule regarding staff foreign travel, the officially-designated personal representative of the member pursuant to rule 14(b), shall be deemed to have the same rights, duties, and responsibilities as members of the staff of the Committee on Foreign Relations. RULE 12--TRANSCRIPTS AND MATERIALS PROVIDED TO THE COMMITTEE (a) General.--The Committee on Foreign Relations shall keep verbatim transcripts of all committee and subcommittee meetings and hearings and such transcripts shall remain in the custody of the committee, unless a majority of the committee decides otherwise. Transcripts of public hearings by the committee shall be published unless the chairman, with the concurrence of the ranking member, determines otherwise. The committee, through the chief clerk, shall also maintain at least one copy of all materials provided to the committee by the Executive Branch; such copy shall remain in the custody of the committee and be subject to the committee's rules and procedures, including those rules and procedures applicable to the handling of classified materials. Such transcripts and materials shall be made available to all members of the committee, committee staff, and designated personal representatives of members of the committee, except as otherwise provided in these rules. (b) Classified or Restricted Transcripts or Materials.-- (1) The chief clerk of the committee shall have responsibility for the maintenance and security of classified or restricted transcripts or materials, and shall ensure that such transcripts or materials are handled in a manner consistent with the requirements of the United States Senate Security Manual. (2) A record shall be maintained of each use of classified or restricted transcripts or materials as required by the Senate Security Manual. (3) Classified transcripts or materials may not leave the committee offices, or SVC-217 of the Capitol Visitors Center, except for the purpose of declassification or archiving, consistent with these rules. (4) Extreme care shall be exercised to avoid taking notes or quotes from classified transcripts or materials. Their contents may not be divulged to any unauthorized person. (5) Subject to any additional restrictions imposed by the chairman with the concurrence of the ranking member, only the following persons are authorized to have access to classified or restricted transcripts or materials: (A) Members and staff of the committee in the committee offices or in SVC-217 of the Capitol Visitors Center; (B) Designated personal representatives of members of the committee, and of the majority and minority leaders, with appropriate security clearances, in the committee offices or in SVC-217 of the Capitol Visitors Center; (C) Senators not members of the committee, by permission of the chairman, in the committee offices or in SVC-217 of the Capitol Visitors Center; and (D) Officials of the executive departments involved in the meeting, hearing, or matter, with authorization of the chairman, in the committee offices or SVC-217 of the Capitol Visitors Center. (6) Any restrictions imposed by the committee upon access to a meeting or hearing of the committee shall also apply to the transcript of such meeting, except by special [[Page S694]] permission of the chairman and ranking member. (7) In addition to restrictions resulting from the inclusion of any classified information in the transcript of a committee meeting or hearing, members and staff shall not discuss with anyone the proceedings of the committee in closed session or reveal information conveyed or discussed in such a session unless that person would have been permitted to attend the session itself or is a member or staff of a relevant committee or executive branch agency and possess an appropriate security clearance, or unless such communication is specifically authorized by the chairman, the ranking member, or in the case of staff, by the staff director or minority staff director. A record shall be kept of all such authorizations. (c) Declassification.-- (1) All noncurrent records of the committee are governed by Rule XI of the Standing Rules of the Senate and by S. Res. 474 (96th Congress). Any classified transcripts or materials transferred to the National Archives and Records Administration under Rule XI may not be made available for public use unless they have been subject to declassification review in accordance with applicable laws or Executive orders. (2) Any transcript or classified committee report, or any portion thereof, may be declassified, in accordance with applicable laws or Executive orders, sooner than the time period provided for under S. Res. 474 if: (A) the chairman originates such action, with the concurrence of the ranking member; (B) the other current members of the committee who participated in such meeting or report have been notified of the proposed declassification, and have not objected thereto, except that the committee by majority vote may overrule any objections thereby raised to early declassification; and (C) the executive departments that participated in the meeting or originated the classified information have been consulted regarding the declassification. RULE 13--CLASSIFIED INFORMATION (a) General.--The handling of classified information in the Senate is governed by S. Res. 243 (100th Congress), which established the Office of Senate Security. All handling of classified information by the committee shall be consistent with the procedures set forth in the United States Senate Security Manual issued by the Office of Senate Security. (b) Security Manager.--The chief clerk is the security manager for the committee. The chief clerk shall be responsible for implementing the provisions of the Senate Security Manual and for serving as the committee liaison to the Office of Senate Security. The staff director, in consultation with the minority staff director, may appoint an alternate security manager as circumstances warrant. (c) Transportation of Classified Material.--Classified material may only be transported between Senate offices by appropriately cleared staff members who have been specifically authorized to do so by the security manager. (d) Access to Classified Material.--In general, Senators and staff undertake to confine their access to classified information on the basis of a ``need to know'' such information related to their committee responsibilities. (e) Staff Clearances.--The chairman, or, in the case of minority staff, the ranking member, shall designate the members of the committee staff whose assignments require access to classified and compartmented information and shall seek to obtain the requisite security clearances pursuant to Office of Senate Security procedures. (f) PRM Clearances.--For the purposes of this rule regarding security clearances and access to compartmented information, the officially-designated personal representative of the member (PRM) pursuant to rule 14(b), shall be deemed to have the same rights, duties, and responsibilities as members of the staff of the Committee on Foreign Relations. (g) Regulations.--The staff director is authorized to make such administrative regulations as may be necessary to carry out the provisions of this rule. RULE 14--STAFF (a) Responsibilities.-- (1) The staff works for the committee as a whole, under the general supervision of the chairman of the committee, and the immediate direction of the staff director, except that such part of the staff as is designated minority staff shall be under the general supervision of the ranking member and under the immediate direction of the minority staff director. (2) Any member of the committee should feel free to call upon the staff at any time for assistance in connection with committee business. Members of the Senate not members of the committee who call upon the staff for assistance from time to time should be given assistance subject to the overriding responsibility of the staff to the committee. (3) The staff's primary responsibility is with respect to bills, resolutions, treaties, and nominations and other matters within the jurisdiction of the committee. In addition to carrying out assignments from the committee and its individual members, the staff has a responsibility to originate suggestions for committee or subcommittee consideration. The staff also has a responsibility to make suggestions to individual members regarding matters of special interest to such members. (4) It is part of the staff's duty to keep itself as well informed as possible in regard to developments affecting foreign relations and national security and in regard to the administration of foreign programs of the United States. Significant trends or developments which might otherwise escape notice should be called to the attention of the committee, or of individual Senators with particular interests. (5) The staff shall pay due regard to the constitutional separation of powers between the Senate and the executive branch. It therefore has a responsibility to help the committee bring to bear an independent, objective judgment of proposals by the executive branch and when appropriate to originate sound proposals of its own. At the same time, the staff shall avoid impinging upon the day-to-day conduct of foreign affairs. (6) In those instances when committee action requires the expression of minority views, the staff shall assist the minority as fully as the majority to the end that all points of view may be fully considered by members of the committee and of the Senate. The staff shall bear in mind that under our constitutional system it is the responsibility of the elected members of the Senate to determine legislative issues in the light of as full and fair a presentation of the facts as the staff may be able to obtain. (b) Personal Representatives of the Member (PRM).--Each Senator on the committee shall be authorized to designate one personal staff member as the member's personal representative of the member and designee to the committee (PRM) that shall be deemed to have the same rights, duties, and responsibilities as members of the staff of the Committee on Foreign Relations where specifically provided for in these rules. (c) Restrictions.-- (1) The staff shall regard its relationship to the committee as a privileged one, in the nature of the relationship of a lawyer to a client. In order to protect this relationship and the mutual confidence which must prevail if the committee-staff relationship is to be a satisfactory and fruitful one, the following criteria shall apply, unless staff has consulted with and obtained, as appropriate, the approval of the Senate Ethics Committee and advance permission from the staff director (or the minority staff director in the case of minority staff): (A) members of the staff shall not be identified with any special interest group in the field of foreign relations or allow their names to be used by any such group; and (B) members of the staff shall not accept public speaking engagements or write for publication in the field of foreign relations. (2) The staff shall not discuss their private conversations with members of the committee without specific advance permission from the Senator or Senators concerned. (3) The staff shall not discuss with anyone the proceedings of the committee in closed session or reveal information conveyed or discussed in such a session unless that person would have been permitted to attend the session itself or is a member or staff of a relevant committee or executive branch agency and possesses an appropriate security clearance, or unless such communication is specifically authorized by the staff director or minority staff director. Unauthorized disclosure of information from a closed session or of classified information shall be cause for immediate dismissal and may, in certain cases, be grounds for criminal prosecution. RULE 15--STATUS AND AMENDMENT OF RULES (a) Status.--In addition to the foregoing, the Committee on Foreign Relations is governed by the Standing Rules of the Senate, which shall take precedence in the event of a clear inconsistency. In addition, the jurisdiction and responsibilities of the committee with respect to certain matters, as well as the timing and procedure for their consideration in committee, may be governed by statute. (b) Amendment.--These rules may be modified, amended, or repealed by a majority of the committee, provided that a notice in writing (including by electronic mail) of the proposed change has been given to each member at least 72 hours prior to the meeting at which action thereon is to be taken. However, rules of the committee which are based upon Senate rules may not be superseded by committee vote alone. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 17 (Monday, February 2, 2015)] [Senate] [Pages S691-S694] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] COMMITTEE ON FOREIGN RELATIONS ______ RULES OF PROCEDURE Mr. CORKER.

(b) Oversight.--The committee also has a responsibility under Senate Rule XXVI.8(a)(2), which provides that ``. . . . each standing committee . . . shall review and study, on a continuing basis, the application, administration, and execution of those laws or parts of laws, the subject matter of which is within the jurisdiction of the committee.'' (c) ``Advice and Consent'' Clauses.--The committee has a special responsibility to assist the Senate in its constitutional function of providing ``advice and consent'' to all treaties entered into by the United States and all nominations to the principal executive branch positions in the field of foreign policy and diplomacy. RULE 2--SUBCOMMITTEES (a) Creation.--Unless otherwise authorized by law or Senate resolution, subcommittees shall be created by majority vote of the committee and shall deal with such legislation and oversight of programs and policies as the committee directs.

No member of the committee may receive assignment to a second subcommittee until, in order of seniority, all members of the committee have chosen assignments to one subcommittee, and no member shall receive assignments to a third subcommittee until, in order of seniority, all members have chosen assignments to two subcommittees. No member of the committee may serve on more than four subcommittees at any one time. The chairman and ranking member of the committee shall be ex officio members, without vote, of each subcommittee. (c) Hearings.--Except when funds have been specifically made available by the Senate for a subcommittee purpose, no subcommittee of the Committee on Foreign Relations shall hold hearings involving expenses without prior approval of the chairman of the full [[Page S692]] committee or by decision of the full committee. Hearings of subcommittees shall be scheduled after consultation with the chairman of the committee with a view toward avoiding conflicts with hearings of other subcommittees insofar as possible. Hearings of subcommittees shall not be scheduled to conflict with meetings or hearings of the full committee.

(b) Additional Meetings and Hearings.--Additional meetings and hearings of the committee may be called by the chairman as he may deem necessary. If at least three members of the committee desire that a special meeting of the committee be called by the chairman, those members may file in the offices of the committee their written request to the chairman for that special meeting. Immediately upon filing of the request, the chief clerk of the committee shall notify the chairman of the filing of the request. If, within three calendar days after the filing of the request, the chairman does not call the requested special meeting, to be held within seven calendar days after the filing of the request, a majority of the members of the committee may file in the offices of the committee their written notice that a special meeting of the committee will be held, specifying the date and hour of that special meeting. The committee shall meet on that date and hour. Immediately upon the filing of the notice, the clerk shall notify all members of the committee that such special meeting will be held and inform them of its date and hour. (c) Hearings, Selection of Witnesses.--To ensure that the issue which is the subject of the hearing is presented as fully and fairly as possible, whenever a hearing is conducted by the committee or a subcommittee upon any measure or matter, the ranking member of the committee or subcommittee may select and call an equal number of non-governmental witnesses to testify at that hearing. (d) Public Announcement.--The committee, or any subcommittee thereof, shall make public announcement of the date, place, time, and subject matter of any meeting or hearing to be conducted on any measure or matter at least seven calendar days in advance of such meetings or hearings, unless the chairman of the committee, or subcommittee, in consultation with the ranking member, determines that there is good cause to begin such meeting or hearing at an earlier date. (e) Procedure.--Insofar as possible, proceedings of the committee will be conducted without resort to the formalities of parliamentary procedure and with due regard for the views of all members. Issues of procedure which may arise from time to time shall be resolved by decision of the chairman, in consultation with the ranking member. The chairman, in consultation with the ranking member, may also propose special procedures to govern the consideration of particular matters by the committee. (f) Closed Sessions.--Each meeting and hearing of the Committee on Foreign Relations, or any subcommittee thereof shall be open to the public, except that a meeting or hearing or series of meetings or hearings by the committee or a subcommittee on the same subject for a period of no more than 14 calendar days may be closed to the public on a motion made and seconded to go into closed session to discuss only whether the matters enumerated in paragraphs (1) through (6) would require the meeting or hearing to be closed followed immediately by a record vote in open session by a majority of the members of the committee or subcommittee when it is determined that the matters to be discussed or the testimony to be taken at such meeting or hearing or series of meetings or hearings-- (1) will disclose matters necessary to be kept secret in the interests of national defense or the confidential conduct of the foreign relations of the United States; (2) will relate solely to matters of committee staff personnel or internal staff management or procedure; (3) will tend to charge an individual with crime or misconduct; to disgrace or injure the professional standing of an individual, or otherwise to expose an individual to public contempt or obloquy, or will represent a clearly unwarranted invasion of the privacy of an individual; (4) will disclose the identity of any informer or law enforcement agent or will disclose any information relating to the investigation or prosecution of a criminal offense that is required to be kept secret in the interests of effective law enforcement; (5) will disclose information relating to the trade secrets or financial or commercial information pertaining specifically to a given person if-- (A) an Act of Congress requires the information to be kept confidential by government officers and employees; or (B) the information has been obtained by the government on a confidential basis, other than through an application by such person for a specific government financial or other benefit, and is required to be kept secret in order to prevent undue injury to the competitive position of such person, or (6) may divulge matters required to be kept confidential under other provisions of law or government regulations. A closed meeting or hearing may be opened by a majority vote of the committee. (g) Staff Attendance.--A member of the committee may have one member of his or her personal staff, for whom that member assumes personal responsibility, accompany and be seated nearby at committee meetings and hearings. The chairman or ranking member may authorize the attendance and seating of such a staff member at committee meetings and hearings where the member of the committee is not present. Each member of the committee may designate members of his or her personal staff for whom that member assumes personal responsibility, who holds, at a minimum, a top secret security clearance, for the purpose of their eligibility to attend closed sessions of the committee, subject to the same conditions set forth for committee staff under Rules 12, 13, and 14. In addition, the majority leader and the minority leader of the Senate, if they are not otherwise members of the committee, may designate one member of their staff for whom that leader assumes personal responsibility and who holds, at a minimum, a top secret security clearance, to attend closed sessions of the committee, subject to the same conditions set forth for committee staff under Rules 12, 13, and 14. Staff of other Senators who are not members of the committee may not attend closed sessions of the committee. Attendance of committee staff at meetings and hearings shall be limited to those designated by the staff director or the minority staff director. The committee, by majority vote, or the chairman, with the concurrence of the ranking member, may limit staff attendance at specified meetings or hearings. RULE 4--QUORUMS (a) Testimony.--For the purpose of taking sworn or unsworn testimony at any duly scheduled meeting a quorum of the committee and each subcommittee thereof shall consist of one member of such committee or subcommittee.

(c) Reporting.--A majority of the membership of the committee, including at least one member from each party, shall constitute a quorum for reporting any measure or recommendation to the Senate. No measure or recommendation shall be ordered reported from the committee unless a majority of the committee members is physically present, including at least one member from each party, and a majority of those present concurs. RULE 5--PROXIES Proxies must be in writing with the signature of the absent member. Subject to the requirements of Rule 4 for the physical presence of a quorum to report a matter, proxy voting shall be allowed on all measures and matters before the committee. However, proxies shall not be voted on a measure or matter except when the absent member has been informed of the matter on which he is being recorded and has affirmatively requested that he or she be so recorded. RULE 6--WITNESSES (a) General.--The Committee on Foreign Relations will consider requests to testify on any matter or measure pending before the committee. (b) Presentation.--If the chairman so determines, the oral presentation of witnesses shall be limited to 10 minutes. However, written statements of reasonable length may be submitted by witnesses and other interested persons who are unable to testify in person. (c) Filing of Statements.--A witness appearing before the committee, or any subcommittee thereof, shall submit an electronic copy of the written statement of his proposed testimony at least 24 hours prior to his appearance, unless this requirement is waived by the chairman and the ranking member following their determination that there is good cause for failure to file such a statement. (d) Expenses.--Only the chairman may authorize expenditures of funds for the expenses of witnesses appearing before the committee or its subcommittees. (e) Requests.--Any witness called for a hearing may submit a written request to the chairman no later than 24 hours in advance for his testimony to be in closed or open session, or for any other unusual procedure. The chairman shall determine whether to grant any such request and shall notify the committee members of the request and of his decision. RULE 7--SUBPOENAS (a) Authorization.--The chairman or any other member of the committee, when authorized by a majority vote of the committee at a meeting or by proxies, shall have authority to subpoena the attendance of witnesses or the production of memoranda, documents, records, or any other materials. At the request of any member of the committee, the committee shall authorize the issuance of a subpoena only at a meeting of the committee. When the committee authorizes a [[Page S693]] subpoena, it may be issued upon the signature of the chairman or any other member designated by the committee. (b) Return.--A subpoena, or a request to an agency, for documents may be issued whose return shall occur at a time and place other than that of a scheduled committee meeting. A return on such a subpoena or request which is incomplete or accompanied by an objection constitutes good cause for a hearing on shortened notice. Upon such a return, the chairman or any other member designated by him may convene a hearing by giving 4 hours notice by telephone or electronic mail to all other members. One member shall constitute a quorum for such a hearing. The sole purpose of such a hearing shall be to elucidate further information about the return and to rule on the objection. (c) Depositions.--At the direction of the committee, staff is authorized to take depositions from witnesses. RULE 8--REPORTS (a) Filing.--When the committee has ordered a measure or recommendation reported, the report thereon shall be filed in the Senate at the earliest practicable time. (b) Supplemental, Minority and Additional Views.--A member of the committee who gives notice of his intentions to file supplemental, minority, or additional views at the time of final committee approval of a measure or matter, shall be entitled to not less than 3 calendar days in which to file such views, in writing (including by electronic mail), with the chief clerk of the committee, with the 3 days to begin at 11:00 p.m. on the same day that the committee has ordered a measure or matter reported. Such views shall then be included in the committee report and printed in the same volume, as a part thereof, and their inclusion shall be noted on the cover of the report. In the absence of timely notice, the committee report may be filed and printed immediately without such views. (c) Roll Call Votes.--The results of all roll call votes taken in any meeting of the committee on any measure, or amendment thereto, shall be announced in the committee report. The announcement shall include a tabulation of the votes cast in favor and votes cast in opposition to each such measure and amendment by each member of the committee. RULE 9--TREATIES (a) General.--The committee is the only committee of the Senate with jurisdiction to review and report to the Senate on treaties submitted by the President for Senate advice and consent to ratification. Because the House of Representatives has no role in the approval of treaties, the committee is therefore the only congressional committee with responsibility for treaties. (b) Committee Proceedings.--Once submitted by the President for advice and consent, each treaty is referred to the committee and remains on its calendar from Congress to Congress until the committee takes action to report it to the Senate or recommend its return to the President, or until the committee is discharged of the treaty by the Senate. (c) Floor Proceedings.--In accordance with Senate Rule XXX.2, treaties which have been reported to the Senate but not acted on before the end of a Congress ``shall be resumed at the commencement of the next Congress as if no proceedings had previously been had thereon.'' (d) Hearings.--Insofar as possible, the committee should conduct a public hearing on each treaty as soon as possible after its submission by the President. Except in extraordinary circumstances, treaties reported to the Senate shall be accompanied by a written report. RULE 10--NOMINATIONS (a) Waiting Requirement.--Unless otherwise directed by the chairman and the ranking member, the Committee on Foreign Relations shall not consider any nomination until 5 business days after it has been formally submitted to the Senate. (b) Public Consideration.--Nominees for any post who are invited to appear before the committee shall be heard in public session, unless a majority of the committee decrees otherwise, consistent with Rule 3(f). (c) Required Data.--No nomination shall be reported to the Senate unless (1) the nominee has been accorded a security clearance on the basis of a thorough investigation by executive branch agencies; (2) the nominee has filed a financial disclosure report and a related ethics undertaking with the committee; (3) the committee has been assured that the nominee does not have any interests which could conflict with the interests of the government in the exercise of the nominee's proposed responsibilities; (4) for persons nominated to be chief of mission, ambassador-at-large, or minister, the committee has received a complete list of any contributions made by the nominee or members of his immediate family to any Federal election campaign during the year of his or her nomination and for the 4 preceding years; (5) for persons nominated to be chiefs of mission, the report required by Section 304(a)(4) of the Foreign Service Act of 1980 on the demonstrated competence of that nominee to perform the duties of the position to which he or she has been nominated; and (6) the nominee has provided the committee with a signed and notarized copy of the committee questionnaire for executive branch nominees. RULE 11--TRAVEL (a) Foreign Travel.--No member of the Committee on Foreign Relations or its staff shall travel abroad on committee business unless specifically authorized by the chairman, who is required by law to approve vouchers and report expenditures of foreign currencies, and the ranking member. Requests for authorization of such travel shall state the purpose and, when completed, a full substantive and financial report shall be filed with the committee within 30 days. This report shall be furnished to all members of the committee and shall not be otherwise disseminated without authorization of the chairman and the ranking member. Except in extraordinary circumstances, staff travel shall not be approved unless the reporting requirements have been fulfilled for all prior trips. Except for travel that is strictly personal, travel funded by non-U.S. Government sources is subject to the same approval and substantive reporting requirements as U.S. Government-funded travel. In addition, members and staff are reminded to consult the Senate Code of Conduct, and, as appropriate, the Senate Select Committee on Ethics, in the case of travel sponsored by non-U.S. Government sources. Any proposed travel by committee staff for a subcommittee purpose must be approved by the subcommittee chairman and ranking member prior to submission of the request to the chairman and ranking member of the full committee. (b) Domestic Travel.--All official travel in the United States by the committee staff shall be approved in advance by the staff director, or in the case of minority staff, by the minority staff director. (c) Personal Staff Travel.--As a general rule, no more than one member of the personal staff of a member of the committee may travel with that member with the approval of the chairman and the ranking member of the committee. During such travel, the personal staff member shall be considered to be an employee of the committee. (d) PRM Travel.--For the purposes of this rule regarding staff foreign travel, the officially-designated personal representative of the member pursuant to rule 14(b), shall be deemed to have the same rights, duties, and responsibilities as members of the staff of the Committee on Foreign Relations. RULE 12--TRANSCRIPTS AND MATERIALS PROVIDED TO THE COMMITTEE (a) General.--The Committee on Foreign Relations shall keep verbatim transcripts of all committee and subcommittee meetings and hearings and such transcripts shall remain in the custody of the committee, unless a majority of the committee decides otherwise. Transcripts of public hearings by the committee shall be published unless the chairman, with the concurrence of the ranking member, determines otherwise. The committee, through the chief clerk, shall also maintain at least one copy of all materials provided to the committee by the Executive Branch; such copy shall remain in the custody of the committee and be subject to the committee's rules and procedures, including those rules and procedures applicable to the handling of classified materials. Such transcripts and materials shall be made available to all members of the committee, committee staff, and designated personal representatives of members of the committee, except as otherwise provided in these rules. (b) Classified or Restricted Transcripts or Materials.-- (1) The chief clerk of the committee shall have responsibility for the maintenance and security of classified or restricted transcripts or materials, and shall ensure that such transcripts or materials are handled in a manner consistent with the requirements of the United States Senate Security Manual. (2) A record shall be maintained of each use of classified or restricted transcripts or materials as required by the Senate Security Manual. (3) Classified transcripts or materials may not leave the committee offices, or SVC-217 of the Capitol Visitors Center, except for the purpose of declassification or archiving, consistent with these rules. (4) Extreme care shall be exercised to avoid taking notes or quotes from classified transcripts or materials. Their contents may not be divulged to any unauthorized person. (5) Subject to any additional restrictions imposed by the chairman with the concurrence of the ranking member, only the following persons are authorized to have access to classified or restricted transcripts or materials: (A) Members and staff of the committee in the committee offices or in SVC-217 of the Capitol Visitors Center; (B) Designated personal representatives of members of the committee, and of the majority and minority leaders, with appropriate security clearances, in the committee offices or in SVC-217 of the Capitol Visitors Center; (C) Senators not members of the committee, by permission of the chairman, in the committee offices or in SVC-217 of the Capitol Visitors Center; and (D) Officials of the executive departments involved in the meeting, hearing, or matter, with authorization of the chairman, in the committee offices or SVC-217 of the Capitol Visitors Center. (6) Any restrictions imposed by the committee upon access to a meeting or hearing of the committee shall also apply to the transcript of such meeting, except by special [[Page S694]] permission of the chairman and ranking member. (7) In addition to restrictions resulting from the inclusion of any classified information in the transcript of a committee meeting or hearing, members and staff shall not discuss with anyone the proceedings of the committee in closed session or reveal information conveyed or discussed in such a session unless that person would have been permitted to attend the session itself or is a member or staff of a relevant committee or executive branch agency and possess an appropriate security clearance, or unless such communication is specifically authorized by the chairman, the ranking member, or in the case of staff, by the staff director or minority staff director. A record shall be kept of all such authorizations. (c) Declassification.-- (1) All noncurrent records of the committee are governed by Rule XI of the Standing Rules of the Senate and by S. Res. 474 (96th Congress). Any classified transcripts or materials transferred to the National Archives and Records Administration under Rule XI may not be made available for public use unless they have been subject to declassification review in accordance with applicable laws or Executive orders. (2) Any transcript or classified committee report, or any portion thereof, may be declassified, in accordance with applicable laws or Executive orders, sooner than the time period provided for under S. Res. 474 if: (A) the chairman originates such action, with the concurrence of the ranking member; (B) the other current members of the committee who participated in such meeting or report have been notified of the proposed declassification, and have not objected thereto, except that the committee by majority vote may overrule any objections thereby raised to early declassification; and (C) the executive departments that participated in the meeting or originated the classified information have been consulted regarding the declassification. RULE 13--CLASSIFIED INFORMATION (a) General.--The handling of classified information in the Senate is governed by S. Res. 243 (100th Congress), which established the Office of Senate Security. All handling of classified information by the committee shall be consistent with the procedures set forth in the United States Senate Security Manual issued by the Office of Senate Security. (b) Security Manager.--The chief clerk is the security manager for the committee. The chief clerk shall be responsible for implementing the provisions of the Senate Security Manual and for serving as the committee liaison to the Office of Senate Security. The staff director, in consultation with the minority staff director, may appoint an alternate security manager as circumstances warrant. (c) Transportation of Classified Material.--Classified material may only be transported between Senate offices by appropriately cleared staff members who have been specifically authorized to do so by the security manager. (d) Access to Classified Material.--In general, Senators and staff undertake to confine their access to classified information on the basis of a ``need to know'' such information related to their committee responsibilities. (e) Staff Clearances.--The chairman, or, in the case of minority staff, the ranking member, shall designate the members of the committee staff whose assignments require access to classified and compartmented information and shall seek to obtain the requisite security clearances pursuant to Office of Senate Security procedures. (f) PRM Clearances.--For the purposes of this rule regarding security clearances and access to compartmented information, the officially-designated personal representative of the member (PRM) pursuant to rule 14(b), shall be deemed to have the same rights, duties, and responsibilities as members of the staff of the Committee on Foreign Relations. (g) Regulations.--The staff director is authorized to make such administrative regulations as may be necessary to carry out the provisions of this rule. RULE 14--STAFF (a) Responsibilities.-- (1) The staff works for the committee as a whole, under the general supervision of the chairman of the committee, and the immediate direction of the staff director, except that such part of the staff as is designated minority staff shall be under the general supervision of the ranking member and under the immediate direction of the minority staff director. (2) Any member of the committee should feel free to call upon the staff at any time for assistance in connection with committee business. Members of the Senate not members of the committee who call upon the staff for assistance from time to time should be given assistance subject to the overriding responsibility of the staff to the committee. (3) The staff's primary responsibility is with respect to bills, resolutions, treaties, and nominations and other matters within the jurisdiction of the committee. In addition to carrying out assignments from the committee and its individual members, the staff has a responsibility to originate suggestions for committee or subcommittee consideration. The staff also has a responsibility to make suggestions to individual members regarding matters of special interest to such members. (4) It is part of the staff's duty to keep itself as well informed as possible in regard to developments affecting foreign relations and national security and in regard to the administration of foreign programs of the United States. Significant trends or developments which might otherwise escape notice should be called to the attention of the committee, or of individual Senators with particular interests. (5) The staff shall pay due regard to the constitutional separation of powers between the Senate and the executive branch. It therefore has a responsibility to help the committee bring to bear an independent, objective judgment of proposals by the executive branch and when appropriate to originate sound proposals of its own. At the same time, the staff shall avoid impinging upon the day-to-day conduct of foreign affairs. (6) In those instances when committee action requires the expression of minority views, the staff shall assist the minority as fully as the majority to the end that all points of view may be fully considered by members of the committee and of the Senate. The staff shall bear in mind that under our constitutional system it is the responsibility of the elected members of the Senate to determine legislative issues in the light of as full and fair a presentation of the facts as the staff may be able to obtain. (b) Personal Representatives of the Member (PRM).--Each Senator on the committee shall be authorized to designate one personal staff member as the member's personal representative of the member and designee to the committee (PRM) that shall be deemed to have the same rights, duties, and responsibilities as members of the staff of the Committee on Foreign Relations where specifically provided for in these rules. (c) Restrictions.-- (1) The staff shall regard its relationship to the committee as a privileged one, in the nature of the relationship of a lawyer to a client. In order to protect this relationship and the mutual confidence which must prevail if the committee-staff relationship is to be a satisfactory and fruitful one, the following criteria shall apply, unless staff has consulted with and obtained, as appropriate, the approval of the Senate Ethics Committee and advance permission from the staff director (or the minority staff director in the case of minority staff): (A) members of the staff shall not be identified with any special interest group in the field of foreign relations or allow their names to be used by any such group; and (B) members of the staff shall not accept public speaking engagements or write for publication in the field of foreign relations. (2) The staff shall not discuss their private conversations with members of the committee without specific advance permission from the Senator or Senators concerned. (3) The staff shall not discuss with anyone the proceedings of the committee in closed session or reveal information conveyed or discussed in such a session unless that person would have been permitted to attend the session itself or is a member or staff of a relevant committee or executive branch agency and possesses an appropriate security clearance, or unless such communication is specifically authorized by the staff director or minority staff director. Unauthorized disclosure of information from a closed session or of classified information shall be cause for immediate dismissal and may, in certain cases, be grounds for criminal prosecution. RULE 15--STATUS AND AMENDMENT OF RULES (a) Status.--In addition to the foregoing, the Committee on Foreign Relations is governed by the Standing Rules of the Senate, which shall take precedence in the event of a clear inconsistency. In addition, the jurisdiction and responsibilities of the committee with respect to certain matters, as well as the timing and procedure for their consideration in committee, may be governed by statute. (b) Amendment.--These rules may be modified, amended, or repealed by a majority of the committee, provided that a notice in writing (including by electronic mail) of the proposed change has been given to each member at least 72 hours prior to the meeting at which action thereon is to be taken. However, rules of the committee which are based upon Senate rules may not be superseded by committee vote alone. ____________________","Congressional Record, Volume 161 Issue 17 (Monday, February 2, 2015) [Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 17 (Monday, February 2, 2015)] [Senate] [Pages S691-S694] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] COMMITTEE ON FOREIGN RELATIONS ______ RULES OF PROCEDURE Mr. CORKER.

(b) Oversight.--The committee also has a responsibility under Senate Rule XXVI.8(a)(2), which provides that ``. . . . each standing committee . . . shall review and study, on a continuing basis, the application, administration, and execution of those laws or parts of laws, the subject matter of which is within the jurisdiction of the committee.'' (c) ``Advice and Consent'' Clauses.--The committee has a special responsibility to assist the Senate in its constitutional function of providing ``advice and consent'' to all treaties entered into by the United States and all nominations to the principal executive branch positions in the field of foreign policy and diplomacy. RULE 2--SUBCOMMITTEES (a) Creation.--Unless otherwise authorized by law or Senate resolution, subcommittees shall be created by majority vote of the committee and shall deal with such legislation and oversight of programs and policies as the committee directs. Legislative measures or other matters may be referred to a subcommittee for consideration in the discretion of the chairman or by vote of a majority of the committee. If the principal subject matter of a measure or matter to be referred falls within the jurisdiction of more than one subcommittee, the chairman or the committee may refer the matter to two or more subcommittees for joint consideration. (b) Assignments.--Assignments of members to subcommittees shall be made in an equitable fashion. No member of the committee may receive assignment to a second subcommittee until, in order of seniority, all members of the committee have chosen assignments to one subcommittee, and no member shall receive assignments to a third subcommittee until, in order of seniority, all members have chosen assignments to two subcommittees. No member of the committee may serve on more than four subcommittees at any one time. The chairman and ranking member of the committee shall be ex officio members, without vote, of each subcommittee. (c) Hearings.--Except when funds have been specifically made available by the Senate for a subcommittee purpose, no subcommittee of the Committee on Foreign Relations shall hold hearings involving expenses without prior approval of the chairman of the full [[Page S692]] committee or by decision of the full committee. Hearings of subcommittees shall be scheduled after consultation with the chairman of the committee with a view toward avoiding conflicts with hearings of other subcommittees insofar as possible. Hearings of subcommittees shall not be scheduled to conflict with meetings or hearings of the full committee. The proceedings of each subcommittee shall be governed by the rules of the full committee, subject to such authorizations or limitations as the committee may from time to time prescribe. RULE 3--MEETINGS AND HEARINGS (a) Regular Meeting Day.--The regular meeting day of the Committee on Foreign Relations for the transaction of committee business shall be on Tuesday of each week, unless otherwise directed by the chairman. (b) Additional Meetings and Hearings.--Additional meetings and hearings of the committee may be called by the chairman as he may deem necessary. If at least three members of the committee desire that a special meeting of the committee be called by the chairman, those members may file in the offices of the committee their written request to the chairman for that special meeting. Immediately upon filing of the request, the chief clerk of the committee shall notify the chairman of the filing of the request. If, within three calendar days after the filing of the request, the chairman does not call the requested special meeting, to be held within seven calendar days after the filing of the request, a majority of the members of the committee may file in the offices of the committee their written notice that a special meeting of the committee will be held, specifying the date and hour of that special meeting. The committee shall meet on that date and hour. Immediately upon the filing of the notice, the clerk shall notify all members of the committee that such special meeting will be held and inform them of its date and hour. (c) Hearings, Selection of Witnesses.--To ensure that the issue which is the subject of the hearing is presented as fully and fairly as possible, whenever a hearing is conducted by the committee or a subcommittee upon any measure or matter, the ranking member of the committee or subcommittee may select and call an equal number of non-governmental witnesses to testify at that hearing. (d) Public Announcement.--The committee, or any subcommittee thereof, shall make public announcement of the date, place, time, and subject matter of any meeting or hearing to be conducted on any measure or matter at least seven calendar days in advance of such meetings or hearings, unless the chairman of the committee, or subcommittee, in consultation with the ranking member, determines that there is good cause to begin such meeting or hearing at an earlier date. (e) Procedure.--Insofar as possible, proceedings of the committee will be conducted without resort to the formalities of parliamentary procedure and with due regard for the views of all members. Issues of procedure which may arise from time to time shall be resolved by decision of the chairman, in consultation with the ranking member. The chairman, in consultation with the ranking member, may also propose special procedures to govern the consideration of particular matters by the committee. (f) Closed Sessions.--Each meeting and hearing of the Committee on Foreign Relations, or any subcommittee thereof shall be open to the public, except that a meeting or hearing or series of meetings or hearings by the committee or a subcommittee on the same subject for a period of no more than 14 calendar days may be closed to the public on a motion made and seconded to go into closed session to discuss only whether the matters enumerated in paragraphs (1) through (6) would require the meeting or hearing to be closed followed immediately by a record vote in open session by a majority of the members of the committee or subcommittee when it is determined that the matters to be discussed or the testimony to be taken at such meeting or hearing or series of meetings or hearings-- (1) will disclose matters necessary to be kept secret in the interests of national defense or the confidential conduct of the foreign relations of the United States; (2) will relate solely to matters of committee staff personnel or internal staff management or procedure; (3) will tend to charge an individual with crime or misconduct; to disgrace or injure the professional standing of an individual, or otherwise to expose an individual to public contempt or obloquy, or will represent a clearly unwarranted invasion of the privacy of an individual; (4) will disclose the identity of any informer or law enforcement agent or will disclose any information relating to the investigation or prosecution of a criminal offense that is required to be kept secret in the interests of effective law enforcement; (5) will disclose information relating to the trade secrets or financial or commercial information pertaining specifically to a given person if-- (A) an Act of Congress requires the information to be kept confidential by government officers and employees; or (B) the information has been obtained by the government on a confidential basis, other than through an application by such person for a specific government financial or other benefit, and is required to be kept secret in order to prevent undue injury to the competitive position of such person, or (6) may divulge matters required to be kept confidential under other provisions of law or government regulations. A closed meeting or hearing may be opened by a majority vote of the committee. (g) Staff Attendance.--A member of the committee may have one member of his or her personal staff, for whom that member assumes personal responsibility, accompany and be seated nearby at committee meetings and hearings. The chairman or ranking member may authorize the attendance and seating of such a staff member at committee meetings and hearings where the member of the committee is not present. Each member of the committee may designate members of his or her personal staff for whom that member assumes personal responsibility, who holds, at a minimum, a top secret security clearance, for the purpose of their eligibility to attend closed sessions of the committee, subject to the same conditions set forth for committee staff under Rules 12, 13, and 14. In addition, the majority leader and the minority leader of the Senate, if they are not otherwise members of the committee, may designate one member of their staff for whom that leader assumes personal responsibility and who holds, at a minimum, a top secret security clearance, to attend closed sessions of the committee, subject to the same conditions set forth for committee staff under Rules 12, 13, and 14. Staff of other Senators who are not members of the committee may not attend closed sessions of the committee. Attendance of committee staff at meetings and hearings shall be limited to those designated by the staff director or the minority staff director. The committee, by majority vote, or the chairman, with the concurrence of the ranking member, may limit staff attendance at specified meetings or hearings. RULE 4--QUORUMS (a) Testimony.--For the purpose of taking sworn or unsworn testimony at any duly scheduled meeting a quorum of the committee and each subcommittee thereof shall consist of one member of such committee or subcommittee. (b) Business.--A quorum for the transaction of committee or subcommittee business, other than for reporting a measure or recommendation to the Senate or the taking of testimony, shall consist of one-third of the members of the committee or subcommittee, including at least one member from each party. (c) Reporting.--A majority of the membership of the committee, including at least one member from each party, shall constitute a quorum for reporting any measure or recommendation to the Senate. No measure or recommendation shall be ordered reported from the committee unless a majority of the committee members is physically present, including at least one member from each party, and a majority of those present concurs. RULE 5--PROXIES Proxies must be in writing with the signature of the absent member. Subject to the requirements of Rule 4 for the physical presence of a quorum to report a matter, proxy voting shall be allowed on all measures and matters before the committee. However, proxies shall not be voted on a measure or matter except when the absent member has been informed of the matter on which he is being recorded and has affirmatively requested that he or she be so recorded. RULE 6--WITNESSES (a) General.--The Committee on Foreign Relations will consider requests to testify on any matter or measure pending before the committee. (b) Presentation.--If the chairman so determines, the oral presentation of witnesses shall be limited to 10 minutes. However, written statements of reasonable length may be submitted by witnesses and other interested persons who are unable to testify in person. (c) Filing of Statements.--A witness appearing before the committee, or any subcommittee thereof, shall submit an electronic copy of the written statement of his proposed testimony at least 24 hours prior to his appearance, unless this requirement is waived by the chairman and the ranking member following their determination that there is good cause for failure to file such a statement. (d) Expenses.--Only the chairman may authorize expenditures of funds for the expenses of witnesses appearing before the committee or its subcommittees. (e) Requests.--Any witness called for a hearing may submit a written request to the chairman no later than 24 hours in advance for his testimony to be in closed or open session, or for any other unusual procedure. The chairman shall determine whether to grant any such request and shall notify the committee members of the request and of his decision. RULE 7--SUBPOENAS (a) Authorization.--The chairman or any other member of the committee, when authorized by a majority vote of the committee at a meeting or by proxies, shall have authority to subpoena the attendance of witnesses or the production of memoranda, documents, records, or any other materials. At the request of any member of the committee, the committee shall authorize the issuance of a subpoena only at a meeting of the committee. When the committee authorizes a [[Page S693]] subpoena, it may be issued upon the signature of the chairman or any other member designated by the committee. (b) Return.--A subpoena, or a request to an agency, for documents may be issued whose return shall occur at a time and place other than that of a scheduled committee meeting. A return on such a subpoena or request which is incomplete or accompanied by an objection constitutes good cause for a hearing on shortened notice. Upon such a return, the chairman or any other member designated by him may convene a hearing by giving 4 hours notice by telephone or electronic mail to all other members. One member shall constitute a quorum for such a hearing. The sole purpose of such a hearing shall be to elucidate further information about the return and to rule on the objection. (c) Depositions.--At the direction of the committee, staff is authorized to take depositions from witnesses. RULE 8--REPORTS (a) Filing.--When the committee has ordered a measure or recommendation reported, the report thereon shall be filed in the Senate at the earliest practicable time. (b) Supplemental, Minority and Additional Views.--A member of the committee who gives notice of his intentions to file supplemental, minority, or additional views at the time of final committee approval of a measure or matter, shall be entitled to not less than 3 calendar days in which to file such views, in writing (including by electronic mail), with the chief clerk of the committee, with the 3 days to begin at 11:00 p.m. on the same day that the committee has ordered a measure or matter reported. Such views shall then be included in the committee report and printed in the same volume, as a part thereof, and their inclusion shall be noted on the cover of the report. In the absence of timely notice, the committee report may be filed and printed immediately without such views. (c) Roll Call Votes.--The results of all roll call votes taken in any meeting of the committee on any measure, or amendment thereto, shall be announced in the committee report. The announcement shall include a tabulation of the votes cast in favor and votes cast in opposition to each such measure and amendment by each member of the committee. RULE 9--TREATIES (a) General.--The committee is the only committee of the Senate with jurisdiction to review and report to the Senate on treaties submitted by the President for Senate advice and consent to ratification. Because the House of Representatives has no role in the approval of treaties, the committee is therefore the only congressional committee with responsibility for treaties. (b) Committee Proceedings.--Once submitted by the President for advice and consent, each treaty is referred to the committee and remains on its calendar from Congress to Congress until the committee takes action to report it to the Senate or recommend its return to the President, or until the committee is discharged of the treaty by the Senate. (c) Floor Proceedings.--In accordance with Senate Rule XXX.2, treaties which have been reported to the Senate but not acted on before the end of a Congress ``shall be resumed at the commencement of the next Congress as if no proceedings had previously been had thereon.'' (d) Hearings.--Insofar as possible, the committee should conduct a public hearing on each treaty as soon as possible after its submission by the President. Except in extraordinary circumstances, treaties reported to the Senate shall be accompanied by a written report. RULE 10--NOMINATIONS (a) Waiting Requirement.--Unless otherwise directed by the chairman and the ranking member, the Committee on Foreign Relations shall not consider any nomination until 5 business days after it has been formally submitted to the Senate. (b) Public Consideration.--Nominees for any post who are invited to appear before the committee shall be heard in public session, unless a majority of the committee decrees otherwise, consistent with Rule 3(f). (c) Required Data.--No nomination shall be reported to the Senate unless (1) the nominee has been accorded a security clearance on the basis of a thorough investigation by executive branch agencies; (2) the nominee has filed a financial disclosure report and a related ethics undertaking with the committee; (3) the committee has been assured that the nominee does not have any interests which could conflict with the interests of the government in the exercise of the nominee's proposed responsibilities; (4) for persons nominated to be chief of mission, ambassador-at-large, or minister, the committee has received a complete list of any contributions made by the nominee or members of his immediate family to any Federal election campaign during the year of his or her nomination and for the 4 preceding years; (5) for persons nominated to be chiefs of mission, the report required by Section 304(a)(4) of the Foreign Service Act of 1980 on the demonstrated competence of that nominee to perform the duties of the position to which he or she has been nominated; and (6) the nominee has provided the committee with a signed and notarized copy of the committee questionnaire for executive branch nominees. RULE 11--TRAVEL (a) Foreign Travel.--No member of the Committee on Foreign Relations or its staff shall travel abroad on committee business unless specifically authorized by the chairman, who is required by law to approve vouchers and report expenditures of foreign currencies, and the ranking member. Requests for authorization of such travel shall state the purpose and, when completed, a full substantive and financial report shall be filed with the committee within 30 days. This report shall be furnished to all members of the committee and shall not be otherwise disseminated without authorization of the chairman and the ranking member. Except in extraordinary circumstances, staff travel shall not be approved unless the reporting requirements have been fulfilled for all prior trips. Except for travel that is strictly personal, travel funded by non-U.S. Government sources is subject to the same approval and substantive reporting requirements as U.S. Government-funded travel. In addition, members and staff are reminded to consult the Senate Code of Conduct, and, as appropriate, the Senate Select Committee on Ethics, in the case of travel sponsored by non-U.S. Government sources. Any proposed travel by committee staff for a subcommittee purpose must be approved by the subcommittee chairman and ranking member prior to submission of the request to the chairman and ranking member of the full committee. (b) Domestic Travel.--All official travel in the United States by the committee staff shall be approved in advance by the staff director, or in the case of minority staff, by the minority staff director. (c) Personal Staff Travel.--As a general rule, no more than one member of the personal staff of a member of the committee may travel with that member with the approval of the chairman and the ranking member of the committee. During such travel, the personal staff member shall be considered to be an employee of the committee. (d) PRM Travel.--For the purposes of this rule regarding staff foreign travel, the officially-designated personal representative of the member pursuant to rule 14(b), shall be deemed to have the same rights, duties, and responsibilities as members of the staff of the Committee on Foreign Relations. RULE 12--TRANSCRIPTS AND MATERIALS PROVIDED TO THE COMMITTEE (a) General.--The Committee on Foreign Relations shall keep verbatim transcripts of all committee and subcommittee meetings and hearings and such transcripts shall remain in the custody of the committee, unless a majority of the committee decides otherwise. Transcripts of public hearings by the committee shall be published unless the chairman, with the concurrence of the ranking member, determines otherwise. The committee, through the chief clerk, shall also maintain at least one copy of all materials provided to the committee by the Executive Branch; such copy shall remain in the custody of the committee and be subject to the committee's rules and procedures, including those rules and procedures applicable to the handling of classified materials. Such transcripts and materials shall be made available to all members of the committee, committee staff, and designated personal representatives of members of the committee, except as otherwise provided in these rules. (b) Classified or Restricted Transcripts or Materials.-- (1) The chief clerk of the committee shall have responsibility for the maintenance and security of classified or restricted transcripts or materials, and shall ensure that such transcripts or materials are handled in a manner consistent with the requirements of the United States Senate Security Manual. (2) A record shall be maintained of each use of classified or restricted transcripts or materials as required by the Senate Security Manual. (3) Classified transcripts or materials may not leave the committee offices, or SVC-217 of the Capitol Visitors Center, except for the purpose of declassification or archiving, consistent with these rules. (4) Extreme care shall be exercised to avoid taking notes or quotes from classified transcripts or materials. Their contents may not be divulged to any unauthorized person. (5) Subject to any additional restrictions imposed by the chairman with the concurrence of the ranking member, only the following persons are authorized to have access to classified or restricted transcripts or materials: (A) Members and staff of the committee in the committee offices or in SVC-217 of the Capitol Visitors Center; (B) Designated personal representatives of members of the committee, and of the majority and minority leaders, with appropriate security clearances, in the committee offices or in SVC-217 of the Capitol Visitors Center; (C) Senators not members of the committee, by permission of the chairman, in the committee offices or in SVC-217 of the Capitol Visitors Center; and (D) Officials of the executive departments involved in the meeting, hearing, or matter, with authorization of the chairman, in the committee offices or SVC-217 of the Capitol Visitors Center. (6) Any restrictions imposed by the committee upon access to a meeting or hearing of the committee shall also apply to the transcript of such meeting, except by special [[Page S694]] permission of the chairman and ranking member. (7) In addition to restrictions resulting from the inclusion of any classified information in the transcript of a committee meeting or hearing, members and staff shall not discuss with anyone the proceedings of the committee in closed session or reveal information conveyed or discussed in such a session unless that person would have been permitted to attend the session itself or is a member or staff of a relevant committee or executive branch agency and possess an appropriate security clearance, or unless such communication is specifically authorized by the chairman, the ranking member, or in the case of staff, by the staff director or minority staff director. A record shall be kept of all such authorizations. (c) Declassification.-- (1) All noncurrent records of the committee are governed by Rule XI of the Standing Rules of the Senate and by S. Res. 474 (96th Congress). Any classified transcripts or materials transferred to the National Archives and Records Administration under Rule XI may not be made available for public use unless they have been subject to declassification review in accordance with applicable laws or Executive orders. (2) Any transcript or classified committee report, or any portion thereof, may be declassified, in accordance with applicable laws or Executive orders, sooner than the time period provided for under S. Res. 474 if: (A) the chairman originates such action, with the concurrence of the ranking member; (B) the other current members of the committee who participated in such meeting or report have been notified of the proposed declassification, and have not objected thereto, except that the committee by majority vote may overrule any objections thereby raised to early declassification; and (C) the executive departments that participated in the meeting or originated the classified information have been consulted regarding the declassification. RULE 13--CLASSIFIED INFORMATION (a) General.--The handling of classified information in the Senate is governed by S. Res. 243 (100th Congress), which established the Office of Senate Security. All handling of classified information by the committee shall be consistent with the procedures set forth in the United States Senate Security Manual issued by the Office of Senate Security. (b) Security Manager.--The chief clerk is the security manager for the committee. The chief clerk shall be responsible for implementing the provisions of the Senate Security Manual and for serving as the committee liaison to the Office of Senate Security. The staff director, in consultation with the minority staff director, may appoint an alternate security manager as circumstances warrant. (c) Transportation of Classified Material.--Classified material may only be transported between Senate offices by appropriately cleared staff members who have been specifically authorized to do so by the security manager. (d) Access to Classified Material.--In general, Senators and staff undertake to confine their access to classified information on the basis of a ``need to know'' such information related to their committee responsibilities. (e) Staff Clearances.--The chairman, or, in the case of minority staff, the ranking member, shall designate the members of the committee staff whose assignments require access to classified and compartmented information and shall seek to obtain the requisite security clearances pursuant to Office of Senate Security procedures. (f) PRM Clearances.--For the purposes of this rule regarding security clearances and access to compartmented information, the officially-designated personal representative of the member (PRM) pursuant to rule 14(b), shall be deemed to have the same rights, duties, and responsibilities as members of the staff of the Committee on Foreign Relations. (g) Regulations.--The staff director is authorized to make such administrative regulations as may be necessary to carry out the provisions of this rule. RULE 14--STAFF (a) Responsibilities.-- (1) The staff works for the committee as a whole, under the general supervision of the chairman of the committee, and the immediate direction of the staff director, except that such part of the staff as is designated minority staff shall be under the general supervision of the ranking member and under the immediate direction of the minority staff director. (2) Any member of the committee should feel free to call upon the staff at any time for assistance in connection with committee business. Members of the Senate not members of the committee who call upon the staff for assistance from time to time should be given assistance subject to the overriding responsibility of the staff to the committee. (3) The staff's primary responsibility is with respect to bills, resolutions, treaties, and nominations and other matters within the jurisdiction of the committee. In addition to carrying out assignments from the committee and its individual members, the staff has a responsibility to originate suggestions for committee or subcommittee consideration. The staff also has a responsibility to make suggestions to individual members regarding matters of special interest to such members. (4) It is part of the staff's duty to keep itself as well informed as possible in regard to developments affecting foreign relations and national security and in regard to the administration of foreign programs of the United States. Significant trends or developments which might otherwise escape notice should be called to the attention of the committee, or of individual Senators with particular interests. (5) The staff shall pay due regard to the constitutional separation of powers between the Senate and the executive branch. It therefore has a responsibility to help the committee bring to bear an independent, objective judgment of proposals by the executive branch and when appropriate to originate sound proposals of its own. At the same time, the staff shall avoid impinging upon the day-to-day conduct of foreign affairs. (6) In those instances when committee action requires the expression of minority views, the staff shall assist the minority as fully as the majority to the end that all points of view may be fully considered by members of the committee and of the Senate. The staff shall bear in mind that under our constitutional system it is the responsibility of the elected members of the Senate to determine legislative issues in the light of as full and fair a presentation of the facts as the staff may be able to obtain. (b) Personal Representatives of the Member (PRM).--Each Senator on the committee shall be authorized to designate one personal staff member as the member's personal representative of the member and designee to the committee (PRM) that shall be deemed to have the same rights, duties, and responsibilities as members of the staff of the Committee on Foreign Relations where specifically provided for in these rules. (c) Restrictions.-- (1) The staff shall regard its relationship to the committee as a privileged one, in the nature of the relationship of a lawyer to a client. In order to protect this relationship and the mutual confidence which must prevail if the committee-staff relationship is to be a satisfactory and fruitful one, the following criteria shall apply, unless staff has consulted with and obtained, as appropriate, the approval of the Senate Ethics Committee and advance permission from the staff director (or the minority staff director in the case of minority staff): (A) members of the staff shall not be identified with any special interest group in the field of foreign relations or allow their names to be used by any such group; and (B) members of the staff shall not accept public speaking engagements or write for publication in the field of foreign relations. (2) The staff shall not discuss their private conversations with members of the committee without specific advance permission from the Senator or Senators concerned. (3) The staff shall not discuss with anyone the proceedings of the committee in closed session or reveal information conveyed or discussed in such a session unless that person would have been permitted to attend the session itself or is a member or staff of a relevant committee or executive branch agency and possesses an appropriate security clearance, or unless such communication is specifically authorized by the staff director or minority staff director. Unauthorized disclosure of information from a closed session or of classified information shall be cause for immediate dismissal and may, in certain cases, be grounds for criminal prosecution. RULE 15--STATUS AND AMENDMENT OF RULES (a) Status.--In addition to the foregoing, the Committee on Foreign Relations is governed by the Standing Rules of the Senate, which shall take precedence in the event of a clear inconsistency. In addition, the jurisdiction and responsibilities of the committee with respect to certain matters, as well as the timing and procedure for their consideration in committee, may be governed by statute. (b) Amendment.--These rules may be modified, amended, or repealed by a majority of the committee, provided that a notice in writing (including by electronic mail) of the proposed change has been given to each member at least 72 hours prior to the meeting at which action thereon is to be taken. However, rules of the committee which are based upon Senate rules may not be superseded by committee vote alone. ____________________",package_114_256.csv,35639,35639,35708,"[congressional record volume 161, number 17 (monday, february 2, 2015)] [senate] [pages s691-s694] from the congressional record online through the government publishing office [ www.gpo.gov ] committee on foreign relations ______ rules of procedure mr. corker. mr. president, the committee on foreign relations has adopted rules governing its procedures for the 114th congress. pursuant to rule xxvi, paragraph 2, of the standing rules of the senate, on behalf of myself and senator menendez, i ask unanimous consent that a copy of the committee rules be printed in the record. there being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the record, as follows: rules of the committee on foreign relations rule 1--jurisdiction (a) substantive.--in accordance with senate rule xxv.1(j)(1), the jurisdiction of the committee shall extend to all proposed legislation, messages, petitions, memorials, and other matters relating to the following subjects: 1. acquisition of land and buildings for embassies and legations in foreign countries. 2. boundaries of the united states. 3. diplomatic service. 4. foreign economic, military, technical, and humanitarian assistance. 5. foreign loans. 6. international activities of the american national red cross and the international committee of the red cross. 7. international aspects of nuclear energy, including nuclear transfer policy. 8. international conferences and congresses. 9. international law as it relates to foreign policy. 10. international monetary fund and other international organizations established primarily for international monetary purposes (except that, at the request of the committee on banking, housing, and urban affairs, any proposed legislation relating to such subjects reported by the committee on foreign relations shall be referred to the committee on banking, housing, and urban affairs). 11. intervention abroad and declarations of war. 12. measures to foster commercial intercourse with foreign nations and to safeguard american business interests abroad. 13. national security and international aspects of trusteeships of the united states. 14. ocean and international environmental and scientific affairs as they relate to foreign policy. 15. protection of united states citizens abroad and expatriation. 16. relations of the united states with foreign nations generally. 17. treaties and executive agreements, except reciprocal trade agreements. 18. united nations and its affiliated organizations. 19. world bank group, the regional development banks, and other international organizations established primarily for development assistance purposes. the committee is also mandated by senate rule xxv.1(j)(2) to study and review, on a comprehensive basis, matters relating to the national security policy, foreign policy, and international economic policy as it relates to foreign policy of the united states, and matters relating to food, hunger, and nutrition in foreign countries, and report thereon from time to time.

(6) any restrictions imposed by the committee upon access to a meeting or hearing of the committee shall also apply to the transcript of such meeting, except by special [[page s694]] permission of the chairman and ranking member. (7) in addition to restrictions resulting from the inclusion of any classified information in the transcript of a committee meeting or hearing, members and staff shall not discuss with anyone the proceedings of the committee in closed session or reveal information conveyed or discussed in such a session unless that person would have been permitted to attend the session itself or is a member or staff of a relevant committee or executive branch agency and possess an appropriate security clearance, or unless such communication is specifically authorized by the chairman, the ranking member, or in the case of staff, by the staff director or minority staff director. a record shall be kept of all such authorizations. (c) declassification.-- (1) all noncurrent records of the committee are governed by rule xi of the standing rules of the senate and by s. res. 474 (96th congress). any classified transcripts or materials transferred to the national archives and records administration under rule xi may not be made available for public use unless they have been subject to declassification review in accordance with applicable laws or executive orders. (2) any transcript or classified committee report, or any portion thereof, may be declassified, in accordance with applicable laws or executive orders, sooner than the time period provided for under s. res. 474 if: (a) the chairman originates such action, with the concurrence of the ranking member; (b) the other current members of the committee who participated in such meeting or report have been notified of the proposed declassification, and have not objected thereto, except that the committee by majority vote may overrule any objections thereby raised to early declassification; and (c) the executive departments that participated in the meeting or originated the classified information have been consulted regarding the declassification. rule 13--classified information (a) general.--the handling of classified information in the senate is governed by s. res. 243 (100th congress), which established the office of senate security. all handling of classified information by the committee shall be consistent with the procedures set forth in the united states senate security manual issued by the office of senate security. (b) security manager.--the chief clerk is the security manager for the committee. the chief clerk shall be responsible for implementing the provisions of the senate security manual and for serving as the committee liaison to the office of senate security. the staff director, in consultation with the minority staff director, may appoint an alternate security manager as circumstances warrant. (c) transportation of classified material.--classified material may only be transported between senate offices by appropriately cleared staff members who have been specifically authorized to do so by the security manager. (d) access to classified material.--in general, senators and staff undertake to confine their access to classified information on the basis of a ``need to know'' such information related to their committee responsibilities. (e) staff clearances.--the chairman, or, in the case of minority staff, the ranking member, shall designate the members of the committee staff whose assignments require access to classified and compartmented information and shall seek to obtain the requisite security clearances pursuant to office of senate security procedures. (f) prm clearances.--for the purposes of this rule regarding security clearances and access to compartmented information, the officially-designated personal representative of the member (prm) pursuant to rule 14(b), shall be deemed to have the same rights, duties, and responsibilities as members of the staff of the committee on foreign relations. (g) regulations.--the staff director is authorized to make such administrative regulations as may be necessary to carry out the provisions of this rule. rule 14--staff (a) responsibilities.-- (1) the staff works for the committee as a whole, under the general supervision of the chairman of the committee, and the immediate direction of the staff director, except that such part of the staff as is designated minority staff shall be under the general supervision of the ranking member and under the immediate direction of the minority staff director. (2) any member of the committee should feel free to call upon the staff at any time for assistance in connection with committee business. members of the senate not members of the committee who call upon the staff for assistance from time to time should be given assistance subject to the overriding responsibility of the staff to the committee. (3) the staff's primary responsibility is with respect to bills, resolutions, treaties, and nominations and other matters within the jurisdiction of the committee. in addition to carrying out assignments from the committee and its individual members, the staff has a responsibility to originate suggestions for committee or subcommittee consideration. the staff also has a responsibility to make suggestions to individual members regarding matters of special interest to such members. (4) it is part of the staff's duty to keep itself as well informed as possible in regard to developments affecting foreign relations and national security and in regard to the administration of foreign programs of the united states. significant trends or developments which might otherwise escape notice should be called to the attention of the committee, or of individual senators with particular interests. (5) the staff shall pay due regard to the constitutional separation of powers between the senate and the executive branch. it therefore has a responsibility to help the committee bring to bear an independent, objective judgment of proposals by the executive branch and when appropriate to originate sound proposals of its own. at the same time, the staff shall avoid impinging upon the day-to-day conduct of foreign affairs. (6) in those instances when committee action requires the expression of minority views, the staff shall assist the minority as fully as the majority to the end that all points of view may be fully considered by members of the committee and of the senate. the staff shall bear in mind that under our constitutional system it is the responsibility of the elected members of the senate to determine legislative issues in the light of as full and fair a presentation of the facts as the staff may be able to obtain. (b) personal representatives of the member (prm).--each senator on the committee shall be authorized to designate one personal staff member as the member's personal representative of the member and designee to the committee (prm) that shall be deemed to have the same rights, duties, and responsibilities as members of the staff of the committee on foreign relations where specifically provided for in these rules. (c) restrictions.-- (1) the staff shall regard its relationship to the committee as a privileged one, in the nature of the relationship of a lawyer to a client. in order to protect this relationship and the mutual confidence which must prevail if the committee-staff relationship is to be a satisfactory and fruitful one, the following criteria shall apply, unless staff has consulted with and obtained, as appropriate, the approval of the senate ethics committee and advance permission from the staff director (or the minority staff director in the case of minority staff): (a) members of the staff shall not be identified with any special interest group in the field of foreign relations or allow their names to be used by any such group; and (b) members of the staff shall not accept public speaking engagements or write for publication in the field of foreign relations. (2) the staff shall not discuss their private conversations with members of the committee without specific advance permission from the senator or senators concerned. (3) the staff shall not discuss with anyone the proceedings of the committee in closed session or reveal information conveyed or discussed in such a session unless that person would have been permitted to attend the session itself or is a member or staff of a relevant committee or executive branch agency and possesses an appropriate security clearance, or unless such communication is specifically authorized by the staff director or minority staff director. unauthorized disclosure of information from a closed session or of classified information shall be cause for immediate dismissal and may, in certain cases, be grounds for criminal prosecution. rule 15--status and amendment of rules (a) status.--in addition to the foregoing, the committee on foreign relations is governed by the standing rules of the senate, which shall take precedence in the event of a clear inconsistency. in addition, the jurisdiction and responsibilities of the committee with respect to certain matters, as well as the timing and procedure for their consideration in committee, may be governed by statute. (b) amendment.--these rules may be modified, amended, or repealed by a majority of the committee, provided that a notice in writing (including by electronic mail) of the proposed change has been given to each member at least 72 hours prior to the meeting at which action thereon is to be taken. however, rules of the committee which are based upon senate rules may not be superseded by committee vote alone. ____________________",35639
CREC-2015-02-02-pt1-PgS690-3,CREC-2015-02-02,114,LAND AND WATER CONSERVATION FUND,"[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 17 (Monday, February 2, 2015)] [Senate] [Pages S690-S691] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] LAND AND WATER CONSERVATION FUND Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to engage in a colloquy with Senator Wyden. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. [[Page S691]] Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, I rise for the purpose of entering into a colloquy with the senior senator from Oregon and ranking member of the Finance Committee in regards to the Land and Water Conservation Fund. As the senior senator from Oregon knows, the Land and Water Conservation Fund was created in a bipartisan manner to help safeguard national parks, rivers, lakes and critical habitats for wildlife in all fifty States. Over the years, the Land and Water Conservation Fund has helped protect some of our Nation's most treasured places. Two such places are located in Delaware. They are the Bombay Hook National Wildlife Refuge and the Prime Hook National Wildlife Refuge. Now that Delaware has a new national park--the First State National Historical Park--the State has even more opportunities to take advantage of the Land and Water Conservation Fund. As you know, every year, some of the royalties from drilling for oil and gas on public lands are paid into the Land and Water Conservation Fund. Despite over $900 million coming into the fund every year, only about one-third of that amount actually goes toward conservation. The funding is diverted elsewhere, despite the huge unmet need across our country to safeguard national parks, national forests, national wildlife refuges, rivers, lakes, and critical wildlife habitat. Two weeks ago, I sought to bring an amendment up for a vote on S. 1, the Keystone XL Pipeline Act, in an effort to address some of the Land and Water Conservation Fund funding issues. Critical habitats are impacted every year by the building of pipelines like the Keystone pipeline. Therefore, increasing funding for the Land and Water Conservation Fund to help counter these impacts seemed like a relevant issue to debate and vote on. Unfortunately, my amendment was tabled, along with other Democratic amendments, and we were not able to have that debate and vote. Although I am disappointed we were not able to address this issue on this piece of legislation, I am determined to continue to work on this issue. Let me say to my colleague, our ranking member, I know you have been a long-time champion for the Land and Water Conservation Fund. I would welcome the opportunity to work with you and your staff on legislation that not only reauthorizes the program, but also better ensures that the revenues credited to the Land and Water Conservation Fund each year are no longer diverted, but are used instead to meet more of our Nation's critical conservation needs. Would the Senator be willing to work with my staff and me? Mr. WYDEN. I want to thank the senior Senator from Delaware for raising this important issue. I would be happy to work with him on this issue because, as my friend and colleague from Delaware knows, the Land and Water Conservation Fund is not only good for the environment but good for local economies. Economists have determined that communities that are near or part of protected natural resources have better and more sustainable economic outlooks than communities that are not. In addition to the Land and Water Conservation Fund, I have been working on longer term solutions to the need to reauthorize the Secure Rural Schools and Community Self-Determination Act, as well as the need to consistently fund Payments in Lieu of Taxes. These programs share a similar, though not identical, vision as the Land and Water Conservation Fund in that they seek to support the rural communities that house some of our most important conservation-based treasures. I know the Senator seeks to support these sorts of American communities and so, while we are working on ensuring the stable continuation of the Land and Water Conservation Fund, we can also work together on these funds. Mr. CARPER. I thank the Senator. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 17 (Monday, February 2, 2015)] [Senate] [Pages S690-S691] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] LAND AND WATER CONSERVATION FUND Mr. CARPER.

Mr. President, I am humbled to recognize Mr. Odell Lumont Price, and especially during Black History Month. As a constituent, I can say he has encouraged all who are familiar with his story. Mr. Price exemplifies the words of the late Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.--he has truly lived a life in which he has been ``judged by the content of his character rather than the color of his skin.'' He grew up in Liberty Hill, a small part of North Charleston, and was among the first to graduate from all-white North Charleston High in 1967. Upon graduation, he volunteered to join the U.S. Marines at the age of 17 because he lacked the finances to attend college. He also served to show his [[Page S695]] love and respect for his country and family. He saw much during his time in battle, and quickly became a squad leader of the 3rd Marine Division. After leaving the military, he used the GI Bill to further his education. Mr. Price believes that the opportunity to further his education played a huge part in his success working at the Charleston Naval Shipyard. Mr. Price is an example of everything that has allowed me to stand before you today. His values of faith, family and freedom have granted me the chance to stand on his shoulders and continue helping our beloved country march forward. Please join me in a heartfelt ``Thanks'' to not only a fellow South Carolinian but someone who deserves the title of ``Hero'' for his service to our country. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 17 (Monday, February 2, 2015)] [Senate] [Pages S694-S695] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS ______ TRIBUTE TO ODELL LUMONT PRICE Mr. SCOTT.

CREC-2015-02-02-pt1-PgS695-2,CREC-2015-02-02,114,BUDGET OF THE UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT FOR FISCAL YEAR 2016--PM 3,"[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 17 (Monday, February 2, 2015)] [Senate] [Pages S695-S697] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] BUDGET OF THE UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT FOR FISCAL YEAR 2016--PM 3 The PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate the following message from the President of the United States, together with an accompanying report; which was referred jointly, pursuant to the order of January 30, 1975 as modified by the order of April 11, 1986; to the Committees on Appropriations; and the Budget: To the Congress of the United States: After a breakthrough year for America, our economy is growing and creating jobs at the fastest pace since 1999, and in 58 months we have created over 11 million jobs. Our unemployment rate is now lower than it was before the financial crisis. More of our kids are graduating than ever before. More of our people are insured than ever before. We are as free from the grip of foreign oil as we've been in almost 30 years. Thanks to the hard work, resilience, and determination of the American people over the last six years, the shadow of crisis has passed. With a growing economy, shrinking deficits, bustling industry, and booming energy production, we have risen from recession freer to write our own future than any other Nation on Earth. It's now up to us to choose what kind of country we want to be over the next 15 years, and for decades to come. Will we accept an economy where prosperity belongs to a few and opportunity remains out of reach for too many? Or will we commit ourselves to an economy that generates rising incomes and chances for everyone who makes the effort? Over the last six years, we've seen that middle-class economic works. We've reaffirmed one of our most fundamental values as Americans: that this country does best when everyone gets their fair shot, does their fair share, and plays by the same set of rules. The ideas I offer in this Budget are designed to bring middle-class economic into the 21st Century. These proposals are practical, not partisan. They'll help working families feel more secure with paychecks that go further, help American workers upgrade their skills, so they can compete for higher-paying jobs, and help create the conditions for our businesses to keep generating good new jobs for our workers to fill. The Budget will do these things while fulfilling our most basic responsibility to keep Americans safe. We will make these investments and end the harmful spending cuts known as sequestration, by cutting inefficient spending, and closing tax loopholes. We will also put our Nation on a more sustainable fiscal path by achieving $1.8 trillion in deficit reduction, primarily from reforms in health programs, our tax code, and immigration. First, middle-class economics means helping working families afford the cornerstones of economic security: child care, college, health care, a home, and retirement. We will help working families tackle the high costs of child care and make ends meet by tripling the maximum child care credit for middle-class families with young children, increasing it to up to $3,000 per child, expanding child care assistance to all eligible low-income families with children under four by the end of 10 years, and making preschool available to all four- year-olds. The Budget also provides middle-class families more flexibility at work by encouraging States to develop paid family leave programs. Today, we're the only advanced country on Earth that doesn't guarantee paid sick leave or paid maternity leave to our workers. Forty-three million workers have no paid sick leave, which forces too many parents to make the gut-wrenching choice between a paycheck and a sick kid at home. It's time to change that. For many families in today's economy, having both parents in the workforce isn't a luxury, it's an economic necessity. Second, middle-class economics means making sure more Americans have the chance to learn the skills and education they need to keep earning higher wages down the road. The Budget calls for new investments and innovation that will expand preschool and invest in high-quality early education for America's youngest learners, provide more help to disadvantaged students and the schools that serve them, better prepare and support teachers, and transform our high schools so they help all students graduate prepared for college and career. In a 21st Century economy that rewards knowledge more than ever, our efforts must reach higher than high school. By the end of this decade, two-thirds of job openings will require some higher education, and no American should be priced out of the education they need. Over the course of my Administration, we have increased Pell Grants, and the Budget continues to ensure that they will keep pace with inflation over time. The Budget also includes a bold new plan to bring down the cost of community college tuition for responsible students, to zero. Forty percent of college students attend community college; some to learn a particular skill, others as a path to a four-year degree. It is time for two years of college to become as free and universal in America as high school is today. Even as we help give our students the chance to succeed, we also must work together to give our workers the chance to retool. Last year, the Congress came together and passed important improvements to the Nation's job training system with the bipartisan Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act. To build on this progress, the proposals in this Budget support more in-person career counseling for unemployed workers and double the number of workers receiving training through the workforce development system. My plan would also expand the successful ``learn-as-you-earn'' approaches that our European counterparts use successfully by investing in the expansion of registered apprenticeships that allow workers to learn new skills while they are earning a paycheck. The Budget would also ensure that training leads to high-quality jobs by investing in projects that feature strong employer partnerships, include work-based learning, and develop new employer- validated credentials. As we welcome home a new generation of returning heroes, the Budget makes sure they have the chance to live the American Dream they helped defend. It invests in the five pillars I have outlined to support our Nation's [[Page S696]] veterans: providing the resources and funding they deserve; ensuring high-quality and timely health care; getting veterans their earned benefits quickly and efficiently; ending veteran homelessness; and helping veterans and their families get good jobs, education, and access to affordable housing. Third, middle-class economics means creating the kind of environment that helps businesses start here, stay here, and hire here. We want to build on the growth we have seen in the manufacturing sector, where more than 750,000 new jobs have been created over the last 58 months. To create jobs, continue growth in the industry, and strengthen America's leadership in advanced manufacturing technology, the Budget funds a national network of 45 manufacturing institutes, building on the nine already funded through 2015, As part of the manufacturing initiative, the Budget also launches a Scale-Up Fund, funded through a public-private partnership to help ensure that if a technology is invented in the United States, it can be made in the United States. The Budget proposes an investment fund to help startup companies produce the goods they have developed. Taken together, these investments will help ensure that America keeps making things the rest of the world wants to buy and will also help create manufacturing jobs for the future. Our Nation thrives when we are leading the world with cutting-edge technology in manufacturing, infrastructure, clean energy, and other growing fields. That is why the Budget includes investments in cutting- edge advanced manufacturing research--to make sure we are leading the way in creating technology that supports our manufacturing sector; biomedical research--like our BRAIN initiative, which studies the brain to offer new insight into diseases like Alzheimer's, and Precision Medicine, which can improve health outcomes and better treat diseases; or, agricultural research--looking at climate resilience and sustainability. These investments have the potential to create high- wage jobs, improve lives, and open the door to new industries, resulting in sustainable economic growth. As our economy continues to grow, our Nation's businesses and workers also need a stronger infrastructure that works in the new economy-- modern ports, stronger bridges, better roads, faster trains, and better broadband. The Budget proposes to build a 21st Century infrastructure that creates jobs for thousands of construction workers and engineers, connects hardworking Americans to their jobs, and makes it easier for businesses to transport goods. The Budget would do more to repair and modernize our existing roads and bridges, while expanding transit systems to link communities and support workers. These proposals will put more money in middle-class pockets, raise wages, and bring more high-paying jobs to America. To pay for them, the Budget will cut inefficient spending and close tax loopholes to make sure that everyone pays their fair share. The Budget closes loopholes that punish businesses investing domestically and reward companies that keep profits abroad, and uses some of the savings created to rebuild our aging infrastructure. The Budget closes loopholes that perpetuate inequality by allowing the top one percent of Americans to avoid paying any taxes on their accumulated wealth and uses that money to help more young people go to college. The Budget simplifies the system so that a small business owner can file based on her actual bank statement, instead of the number of accountants she can afford. It is time for tax reform that at its core is about helping working families afford child care and college, and plan for retirement, and above all, get a leg up in the new economy. Of course, we cannot separate our work here at home from challenges beyond our shores. By winding down the wars overseas and lowering war spending, we've strengthened our economy and shrunk our deficits. But we still face threats to our security that we must address. The Budget supports our efforts to degrade and ultimately destroy ISIL. We are leading over 60 partners in a global effort that will take time and steady resolve. As I made clear in my State of the Union address, I am calling on the Congress to show the world that we are united in this mission by passing a bill to authorize the use of force against ISIL. The Budget supports our efforts to counter Russian pressure and aggressive actions in concert with our European allies, by funding support for Ukraine's democracy and efforts to reassure our NATO allies. We also must look beyond the issues that have consumed us in the past to shape the coming century. This Budget provides the resources we need to defend the Nation against cyber-attacks. No foreign nation, no hacker, should be able to shut down our networks, steal our trade secrets, or invade the privacy of American families. In addition to increasing funding to protect our Nation against cyber-attacks, I continue to urge the Congress to finally pass the legislation we need to meet this evolving threat. The Budget invests in our efforts to confront the threat posed by infectious diseases like Ebola--here at home, and internationally. It provides resources to support the Global Health Security Agenda, increases funding to eradicate polio and other global health challenges, and creates a new Impact Fund for targeted global HIV/AIDS efforts. In addition, the Budget increases funding for domestic preparedness efforts to more effectively and efficiently respond to potential, future outbreaks here at home and dedicates funding for States to develop HIV Plans to help them reach the goals of the National HIV/AIDS Strategy. The Budget also capitalizes on historic opportunities in Asia and the Pacific--where we are modernizing alliances, opening new markets, and making sure that other nations play by the rules--in how they trade, resolve disputes, and do their part to confront the biggest challenges we face. No challenge poses a greater threat to future generations than climate change. Fourteen of our planet's 15 warmest years on record have all fallen in the first 15 years of this century. The world's best scientists are telling us that our activities are changing the climate, and if we do not act forcefully, we'll continue to see rising oceans, longer, hotter heat waves, dangerous droughts and floods, and massive disruptions that can trigger greater migration, conflict, and hunger around the globe. The Pentagon says that climate change poses immediate risks to our national security. And as discussed in the Budget, the significant costs to inaction on climate change hit the Federal Government's bottom-line directly, as worsening climate impacts create Government liabilities. That's why this Budget takes action on climate by supporting the Climate Action Plan that I released in 2013 with investments to accelerate carbon pollution reductions, to build on-the- ground partnerships with local communities and help them put in place strategies for greater resilience to climate change impacts, and to support America's leadership abroad on this important moral and fiscal issue. Beyond these critical investments, the Budget also supports my Management Agenda, which seeks to create a Government for the future that is more efficient, effective, and supportive of economic growth. The Budget includes initiatives to improve the service we provide to the American public; to leverage the Federal Government's buying power to bring more value and efficiency to how we use taxpayer dollars; to open Government data and research to the private sector to drive innovation and economic growth; to promote smarter information technology; and, to attract and retain the best talent in the Federal workforce. The Budget includes proposals to consolidate and reorganize Government agencies to make them leaner and more efficient, and it increases the use of evidence and evaluation to ensure that taxpayer dollars are spent wisely on programs that work. The Congress can also help grow the economy, reduce deficits, and strengthen Social Security by passing comprehensive immigration reform. Last year, I took a series of executive actions to crack down on illegal immigration at the border; prioritize deporting felons, not families; and allow certain undocumented immigrants who register and pass criminal and national security background checks to start paying their fair share of taxes and stay in the United States without fear of deportation. I also took action to [[Page S697]] streamline the legal immigration system for talented STEM students, entrepreneurs, and business. These actions will raise average wages for all American workers and reduce the deficit. But this is only a first step toward real reform, and as I have said before, the Congress should act on the more comprehensive reform that only changes in the law can provide. Independent economists say immigration reform will grow our economy and shrink our deficits by almost $1 trillion over 20 years. It is time to fix our broken system and help grow our economy by passing comprehensive immigration reform. The Budget also builds on the progress we have made ensuring that every American has the peace of mind that comes with quality, affordable health insurance. The Affordable Care Act has helped to provide millions more Americans get covered. It has forced insurance companies to play by the rules by prohibiting discrimination for pre- existing conditions and eliminating lifetime insurance caps. It has also helped to put our Nation on a more sustainable fiscal path by slowing the growth of health care costs. The Budget includes additional reforms and cost saving proposals to continue encouraging high-quality and efficient health care. This Budget shows what we can do if we invest in America's future and commit ourselves to an economy that rewards hard work, generates rising incomes, and allows everyone to share in the prosperity of a growing America. It lays out a strategy to strengthen our middle class, and help America's hard-working families get ahead in a time of relentless economic and technological change. Fifteen years into this new century, and six years after the darkest days of the financial crisis, we have picked ourselves up, dusted ourselves off, and begun again the work of remaking America. We've laid a new foundation. A brighter future is ours to write. This Budget will help us begin this new chapter together. Barack Obama.

It is time for tax reform that at its core is about helping working families afford child care and college, and plan for retirement, and above all, get a leg up in the new economy. Of course, we cannot separate our work here at home from challenges beyond our shores. By winding down the wars overseas and lowering war spending, we've strengthened our economy and shrunk our deficits. But we still face threats to our security that we must address. The Budget supports our efforts to degrade and ultimately destroy ISIL. We are leading over 60 partners in a global effort that will take time and steady resolve. As I made clear in my State of the Union address, I am calling on the Congress to show the world that we are united in this mission by passing a bill to authorize the use of force against ISIL. The Budget supports our efforts to counter Russian pressure and aggressive actions in concert with our European allies, by funding support for Ukraine's democracy and efforts to reassure our NATO allies. We also must look beyond the issues that have consumed us in the past to shape the coming century. This Budget provides the resources we need to defend the Nation against cyber-attacks. No foreign nation, no hacker, should be able to shut down our networks, steal our trade secrets, or invade the privacy of American families. In addition to increasing funding to protect our Nation against cyber-attacks, I continue to urge the Congress to finally pass the legislation we need to meet this evolving threat. The Budget invests in our efforts to confront the threat posed by infectious diseases like Ebola--here at home, and internationally. It provides resources to support the Global Health Security Agenda, increases funding to eradicate polio and other global health challenges, and creates a new Impact Fund for targeted global HIV/AIDS efforts. In addition, the Budget increases funding for domestic preparedness efforts to more effectively and efficiently respond to potential, future outbreaks here at home and dedicates funding for States to develop HIV Plans to help them reach the goals of the National HIV/AIDS Strategy. The Budget also capitalizes on historic opportunities in Asia and the Pacific--where we are modernizing alliances, opening new markets, and making sure that other nations play by the rules--in how they trade, resolve disputes, and do their part to confront the biggest challenges we face. No challenge poses a greater threat to future generations than climate change. Fourteen of our planet's 15 warmest years on record have all fallen in the first 15 years of this century. The world's best scientists are telling us that our activities are changing the climate, and if we do not act forcefully, we'll continue to see rising oceans, longer, hotter heat waves, dangerous droughts and floods, and massive disruptions that can trigger greater migration, conflict, and hunger around the globe. The Pentagon says that climate change poses immediate risks to our national security. And as discussed in the Budget, the significant costs to inaction on climate change hit the Federal Government's bottom-line directly, as worsening climate impacts create Government liabilities. That's why this Budget takes action on climate by supporting the Climate Action Plan that I released in 2013 with investments to accelerate carbon pollution reductions, to build on-the- ground partnerships with local communities and help them put in place strategies for greater resilience to climate change impacts, and to support America's leadership abroad on this important moral and fiscal issue. Beyond these critical investments, the Budget also supports my Management Agenda, which seeks to create a Government for the future that is more efficient, effective, and supportive of economic growth. The Budget includes initiatives to improve the service we provide to the American public; to leverage the Federal Government's buying power to bring more value and efficiency to how we use taxpayer dollars; to open Government data and research to the private sector to drive innovation and economic growth; to promote smarter information technology; and, to attract and retain the best talent in the Federal workforce. The Budget includes proposals to consolidate and reorganize Government agencies to make them leaner and more efficient, and it increases the use of evidence and evaluation to ensure that taxpayer dollars are spent wisely on programs that work. The Congress can also help grow the economy, reduce deficits, and strengthen Social Security by passing comprehensive immigration reform. Last year, I took a series of executive actions to crack down on illegal immigration at the border; prioritize deporting felons, not families; and allow certain undocumented immigrants who register and pass criminal and national security background checks to start paying their fair share of taxes and stay in the United States without fear of deportation. I also took action to [[Page S697]] streamline the legal immigration system for talented STEM students, entrepreneurs, and business. These actions will raise average wages for all American workers and reduce the deficit. But this is only a first step toward real reform, and as I have said before, the Congress should act on the more comprehensive reform that only changes in the law can provide. Independent economists say immigration reform will grow our economy and shrink our deficits by almost $1 trillion over 20 years. It is time to fix our broken system and help grow our economy by passing comprehensive immigration reform. The Budget also builds on the progress we have made ensuring that every American has the peace of mind that comes with quality, affordable health insurance. The Affordable Care Act has helped to provide millions more Americans get covered. It has forced insurance companies to play by the rules by prohibiting discrimination for pre- existing conditions and eliminating lifetime insurance caps. It has also helped to put our Nation on a more sustainable fiscal path by slowing the growth of health care costs. The Budget includes additional reforms and cost saving proposals to continue encouraging high-quality and efficient health care. This Budget shows what we can do if we invest in America's future and commit ourselves to an economy that rewards hard work, generates rising incomes, and allows everyone to share in the prosperity of a growing America. It lays out a strategy to strengthen our middle class, and help America's hard-working families get ahead in a time of relentless economic and technological change. Fifteen years into this new century, and six years after the darkest days of the financial crisis, we have picked ourselves up, dusted ourselves off, and begun again the work of remaking America. We've laid a new foundation. A brighter future is ours to write. This Budget will help us begin this new chapter together. Barack Obama. The White House, February 2, 2015. ____________________","Congressional Record, Volume 161 Issue 17 (Monday, February 2, 2015) [Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 17 (Monday, February 2, 2015)] [Senate] [Pages S695-S697] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] BUDGET OF THE UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT FOR FISCAL YEAR 2016--PM 3 The PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate the following message from the President of the United States, together with an accompanying report; which was referred jointly, pursuant to the order of January 30, 1975 as modified by the order of April 11, 1986; to the Committees on Appropriations; and the Budget: To the Congress of the United States: After a breakthrough year for America, our economy is growing and creating jobs at the fastest pace since 1999, and in 58 months we have created over 11 million jobs. Our unemployment rate is now lower than it was before the financial crisis. More of our kids are graduating than ever before. More of our people are insured than ever before. We are as free from the grip of foreign oil as we've been in almost 30 years. Thanks to the hard work, resilience, and determination of the American people over the last six years, the shadow of crisis has passed. With a growing economy, shrinking deficits, bustling industry, and booming energy production, we have risen from recession freer to write our own future than any other Nation on Earth. It's now up to us to choose what kind of country we want to be over the next 15 years, and for decades to come. Will we accept an economy where prosperity belongs to a few and opportunity remains out of reach for too many? Or will we commit ourselves to an economy that generates rising incomes and chances for everyone who makes the effort? Over the last six years, we've seen that middle-class economic works. We've reaffirmed one of our most fundamental values as Americans: that this country does best when everyone gets their fair shot, does their fair share, and plays by the same set of rules. The ideas I offer in this Budget are designed to bring middle-class economic into the 21st Century. These proposals are practical, not partisan. They'll help working families feel more secure with paychecks that go further, help American workers upgrade their skills, so they can compete for higher-paying jobs, and help create the conditions for our businesses to keep generating good new jobs for our workers to fill. The Budget will do these things while fulfilling our most basic responsibility to keep Americans safe. We will make these investments and end the harmful spending cuts known as sequestration, by cutting inefficient spending, and closing tax loopholes. We will also put our Nation on a more sustainable fiscal path by achieving $1.8 trillion in deficit reduction, primarily from reforms in health programs, our tax code, and immigration. First, middle-class economics means helping working families afford the cornerstones of economic security: child care, college, health care, a home, and retirement. We will help working families tackle the high costs of child care and make ends meet by tripling the maximum child care credit for middle-class families with young children, increasing it to up to $3,000 per child, expanding child care assistance to all eligible low-income families with children under four by the end of 10 years, and making preschool available to all four- year-olds. The Budget also provides middle-class families more flexibility at work by encouraging States to develop paid family leave programs. Today, we're the only advanced country on Earth that doesn't guarantee paid sick leave or paid maternity leave to our workers. Forty-three million workers have no paid sick leave, which forces too many parents to make the gut-wrenching choice between a paycheck and a sick kid at home. It's time to change that. For many families in today's economy, having both parents in the workforce isn't a luxury, it's an economic necessity. Second, middle-class economics means making sure more Americans have the chance to learn the skills and education they need to keep earning higher wages down the road. The Budget calls for new investments and innovation that will expand preschool and invest in high-quality early education for America's youngest learners, provide more help to disadvantaged students and the schools that serve them, better prepare and support teachers, and transform our high schools so they help all students graduate prepared for college and career. In a 21st Century economy that rewards knowledge more than ever, our efforts must reach higher than high school. By the end of this decade, two-thirds of job openings will require some higher education, and no American should be priced out of the education they need. Over the course of my Administration, we have increased Pell Grants, and the Budget continues to ensure that they will keep pace with inflation over time. The Budget also includes a bold new plan to bring down the cost of community college tuition for responsible students, to zero. Forty percent of college students attend community college; some to learn a particular skill, others as a path to a four-year degree. It is time for two years of college to become as free and universal in America as high school is today. Even as we help give our students the chance to succeed, we also must work together to give our workers the chance to retool. Last year, the Congress came together and passed important improvements to the Nation's job training system with the bipartisan Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act. To build on this progress, the proposals in this Budget support more in-person career counseling for unemployed workers and double the number of workers receiving training through the workforce development system. My plan would also expand the successful ``learn-as-you-earn'' approaches that our European counterparts use successfully by investing in the expansion of registered apprenticeships that allow workers to learn new skills while they are earning a paycheck. The Budget would also ensure that training leads to high-quality jobs by investing in projects that feature strong employer partnerships, include work-based learning, and develop new employer- validated credentials. As we welcome home a new generation of returning heroes, the Budget makes sure they have the chance to live the American Dream they helped defend. It invests in the five pillars I have outlined to support our Nation's [[Page S696]] veterans: providing the resources and funding they deserve; ensuring high-quality and timely health care; getting veterans their earned benefits quickly and efficiently; ending veteran homelessness; and helping veterans and their families get good jobs, education, and access to affordable housing. Third, middle-class economics means creating the kind of environment that helps businesses start here, stay here, and hire here. We want to build on the growth we have seen in the manufacturing sector, where more than 750,000 new jobs have been created over the last 58 months. To create jobs, continue growth in the industry, and strengthen America's leadership in advanced manufacturing technology, the Budget funds a national network of 45 manufacturing institutes, building on the nine already funded through 2015, As part of the manufacturing initiative, the Budget also launches a Scale-Up Fund, funded through a public-private partnership to help ensure that if a technology is invented in the United States, it can be made in the United States. The Budget proposes an investment fund to help startup companies produce the goods they have developed. Taken together, these investments will help ensure that America keeps making things the rest of the world wants to buy and will also help create manufacturing jobs for the future. Our Nation thrives when we are leading the world with cutting-edge technology in manufacturing, infrastructure, clean energy, and other growing fields. That is why the Budget includes investments in cutting- edge advanced manufacturing research--to make sure we are leading the way in creating technology that supports our manufacturing sector; biomedical research--like our BRAIN initiative, which studies the brain to offer new insight into diseases like Alzheimer's, and Precision Medicine, which can improve health outcomes and better treat diseases; or, agricultural research--looking at climate resilience and sustainability. These investments have the potential to create high- wage jobs, improve lives, and open the door to new industries, resulting in sustainable economic growth. As our economy continues to grow, our Nation's businesses and workers also need a stronger infrastructure that works in the new economy-- modern ports, stronger bridges, better roads, faster trains, and better broadband. The Budget proposes to build a 21st Century infrastructure that creates jobs for thousands of construction workers and engineers, connects hardworking Americans to their jobs, and makes it easier for businesses to transport goods. The Budget would do more to repair and modernize our existing roads and bridges, while expanding transit systems to link communities and support workers. These proposals will put more money in middle-class pockets, raise wages, and bring more high-paying jobs to America. To pay for them, the Budget will cut inefficient spending and close tax loopholes to make sure that everyone pays their fair share. The Budget closes loopholes that punish businesses investing domestically and reward companies that keep profits abroad, and uses some of the savings created to rebuild our aging infrastructure. The Budget closes loopholes that perpetuate inequality by allowing the top one percent of Americans to avoid paying any taxes on their accumulated wealth and uses that money to help more young people go to college. The Budget simplifies the system so that a small business owner can file based on her actual bank statement, instead of the number of accountants she can afford. It is time for tax reform that at its core is about helping working families afford child care and college, and plan for retirement, and above all, get a leg up in the new economy. Of course, we cannot separate our work here at home from challenges beyond our shores.

As I made clear in my State of the Union address, I am calling on the Congress to show the world that we are united in this mission by passing a bill to authorize the use of force against ISIL. The Budget supports our efforts to counter Russian pressure and aggressive actions in concert with our European allies, by funding support for Ukraine's democracy and efforts to reassure our NATO allies. We also must look beyond the issues that have consumed us in the past to shape the coming century. This Budget provides the resources we need to defend the Nation against cyber-attacks. No foreign nation, no hacker, should be able to shut down our networks, steal our trade secrets, or invade the privacy of American families.

mind that comes with quality, affordable health insurance. the affordable care act has helped to provide millions more americans get covered. it has forced insurance companies to play by the rules by prohibiting discrimination for pre- existing conditions and eliminating lifetime insurance caps. it has also helped to put our nation on a more sustainable fiscal path by slowing the growth of health care costs. the budget includes additional reforms and cost saving proposals to continue encouraging high-quality and efficient health care. this budget shows what we can do if we invest in america's future and commit ourselves to an economy that rewards hard work, generates rising incomes, and allows everyone to share in the prosperity of a growing america. it lays out a strategy to strengthen our middle class, and help america's hard-working families get ahead in a time of relentless economic and technological change. fifteen years into this new century, and six years after the darkest days of the financial crisis, we have picked ourselves up, dusted ourselves off, and begun again the work of remaking america. we've laid a new foundation. a brighter future is ours to write. this budget will help us begin this new chapter together. barack obama. the white house, february 2, 2015. ____________________",17039

CREC-2015-02-02-pt1-PgS698-3,CREC-2015-02-02,114,STATEMENTS ON INTRODUCED BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS,"[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 17 (Monday, February 2, 2015)] [Senate] [Pages S698-S702] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] STATEMENTS ON INTRODUCED BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS By Mr. Grassley (for himself, Mr. Casey, Mr. Burr, Mr. Warner, Mr. Roberts, and Mr. Cardin): S. 335. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to improve 529 plans; to the Committee on Finance. Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I am glad to be joined by Senator Casey of Pennsylvania in introducing bipartisan legislation to improve upon the already immensely successful college 529 savings programs. Those are savings plans to go to college. The 529 plans have helped millions earn a college degree without piling up a mountain of debt. These plans have long had strong bipartisan support, and I am glad the introduction of this bill today continues that tradition. Given the bipartisan nature of 529 plans, it came as a shock to me, and I am sure to most of my colleagues, when the President put forth a proposal that would undermine years of hard work toward making savings for college as accessible as it is today. College savings vehicles, we now know by the Tax Code section--that is where section 529 comes from--were first started by States in the late 1980s. However, it was only after a bipartisan effort led by then-Senator Bob Graham of Florida and Senator McConnell, [[Page S699]] now our majority leader, in 1996 that these savings plans were finally enshrined in section 529 of the Tax Code. By recognizing college savings plans in the Tax Code, States and participants could now be certain about the favorable tax treatment they would receive and thus the plans flourished. During this time, individuals' parents and grandparents were able to contribute to savings plans with certainty that the college savings for themselves and their loved ones would accumulate tax free. However, while 529 plans could accumulate interest tax free, tax was still owed once money was distributed to pay for college. So in 2001, as chairman of the Finance Committee, I worked with Senator Baucus of Montana and others to advance a proposal to further enhance college savings by excluding distributions from 529 plans from income tax so long as the money was used to pay for college education costs. We were then successful in making this provision permanent in the tax law as part of the Pension Protection Act of 2006. This change helped 529 plans take off to even new heights. From 2001 to 2002 assets in these plans doubled from $13 billion to $26 billion and totalled nearly $245 billion by July last year. The total number of accounts also nearly doubled. The number of accounts increased from 2.4 million in 2001 to 4.4 million in 2002 and increased to nearly 12 million by July of last year. The misguided proposal put forth in the President's State of the Union Address has a potential to reverse these gains by once again subjecting distributions to tax. The policy rationale given by the President was that too much of the benefit for 529 plans went to more affluent households and individuals. I believe a big reason the President's proposal was met with bipartisan disapproval is that we all know firsthand through communications with our constituents back home that the typical family with a 529 account is one with only modest means. We hear about how they have scrimped and pinched pennies so they could put money away for their child's college. They have a dream of sending their child to college and graduating without a crushing amount of debt holding them back as they start their new career post-college. Data from the College Savings Plans Network backs up this anecdotal evidence that we receive at the grassroots from our constituents. On a national basis the average account balance is under $21,000 and for Iowans the average balance is slightly lower than $17,878. This is obviously hard evidence that a typical family contributing to a 529 account is far from being part of the wealthy elite the President wants us to believe they are. A private study commissioned by the College Savings Foundation further demonstrates that these accounts are largely held by middle- class families. According to this study, about 10 percent of 529 accounts are owned by households with income below $50,000, over 70 percent are owned by households with income below $150,000, and almost 95 percent of 529 accounts are in households with incomes below $250,000. The bill I introduced today with Democratic Senator Casey will help build on the success that has so far been achieved by increasing the attractiveness of 529 plans. This bill has three primary provisions: The first provision recognizes the reality that in today's world a computer is just as much a necessary educational tool--and the expense associated with it--as a required class textbook. As such, this bill allows 529 funds to purchase a computer on the same tax payroll basis as other required materials. The second provision eliminates an outdated and unnecessary aggregation rule that increases paperwork and costs for plan administrators. The final provision provides tax and penalty relief in instances where a student may have to withdraw from school for illness or other reasons. Under current law, any refunds from the college are subject to immediate taxation and a 10-percent tax penalty. This provision eliminates this tax and penalty if the refund is redeposited in a 529 account. This permits a family to set the refund aside to pay for the student's education should that student be able to return to college or to use it for another family member. The reforms in 529 plans included in Senator Casey's and my bill are very modest but will help keep administrative costs low and provide a little extra incentive for parents to put money away for their child's education. The bill further demonstrates a renewed bipartisan commitment to 529 plans that will hopefully help erase concerns some may have in contributing to 529s given the President's misguided proposal. I hope Congress will act on this legislation and speak with a loud bipartisan voice on its commitment to college savings. ______ By Mr. CORNYN (for himself, Mr. Leahy, and Mr. Grassley): S. 337.

Mr. President, I am proud to once again join with Senator Cornyn to introduce the FOIA Improvement Act, a bipartisan bill that will make our Federal government more accountable to all Americans by strengthening the Freedom of Information Act, FOIA. Senator Cornyn and I introduced an almost identical bill last year, and despite it passing the Senate unanimously, the House failed to act. This was deeply disappointing, and was a missed opportunity for Congress. But Senator Cornyn and I have worked together for more than a decade to make our government more open, through Democratic and Republican administrations and Republican and Democratic-led Congresses. We have a strong partnership, and we will not quit. We are determined to make progress on creating a more open and transparent government for all Americans. The FOIA Improvement Act of 2015 codifies what President Obama laid out in his historic 2009 memorandum by requiring Federal agencies to adopt a ``Presumption of Openness'' when considering the release of government information under FOIA. Under this bill, when considering FOIA requests Federal agencies must find a reasonable foreseeable harm in order to invoke a discretionary exemption and withhold information from the public. The government should always err on the side of disclosure. Our legislation also provides additional independence to the Office of Government Information Services, OGIS, an office created by the Leahy-Cornyn OPEN Government Act in 2007 that helps mediate disputes between the Federal Government and FOIA requesters. Finally, our legislation will limit the use of Exemption 5 by placing a 25 year limitation on information covered by the exemption. I have fought for years to make our government more open and transparent. Senator Cornyn has been an important partner in these efforts, and our collaboration has resulted in the enactment of several improvements to FOIA including the OPEN Government Act, the first major reform to FOIA in more than a decade; the OPEN FOIA Act, which increased the transparency of legislative exemptions to FOIA; and the Faster FOIA Act, which responded to the concerns of FOIA requestors and addressed agency delays in processing requests. After four decades in the Senate, I appreciate that legislating requires compromise. The FOIA Improvement Act of 2015 reflects the input of both sides of the aisle, the open government community, the administration, and many other stakeholders. It is the product of nearly a year of careful negotiations on behalf of Senator Cornyn and me. It is supported by more than 70 public interest groups that advocate for government transparency and it had the unanimous support of the Judiciary Committee and the full Senate last year. Above all, it marks an historic step forward in our continued effort to open the government by codifying what President Obama set out to achieve in 2009 when he said ``In the face of doubt, openness prevails.'' This is common sense, and so I urge the Senate to quickly take up and pass this bill and for the House to follow suit so we can show the American people, in a bipartisan fashion, that we are committed to advancing their interests [[Page S702]] above special interests, no matter who holds control of Congress or the White House. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 17 (Monday, February 2, 2015)] [Senate] [Pages S698-S702] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] STATEMENTS ON INTRODUCED BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS By Mr. Grassley (for himself, Mr. Casey, Mr. Burr, Mr. Warner, Mr. Roberts, and Mr. Cardin): S. 335.

The reforms in 529 plans included in Senator Casey's and my bill are very modest but will help keep administrative costs low and provide a little extra incentive for parents to put money away for their child's education. The bill further demonstrates a renewed bipartisan commitment to 529 plans that will hopefully help erase concerns some may have in contributing to 529s given the President's misguided proposal. I hope Congress will act on this legislation and speak with a loud bipartisan voice on its commitment to college savings. ______ By Mr. CORNYN (for himself, Mr. Leahy, and Mr. Grassley): S. 337.

Mr. President, I am proud to once again join with Senator Cornyn to introduce the FOIA Improvement Act, a bipartisan bill that will make our Federal government more accountable to all Americans by strengthening the Freedom of Information Act, FOIA. Senator Cornyn and I introduced an almost identical bill last year, and despite it passing the Senate unanimously, the House failed to act. This was deeply disappointing, and was a missed opportunity for Congress. But Senator Cornyn and I have worked together for more than a decade to make our government more open, through Democratic and Republican administrations and Republican and Democratic-led Congresses. We have a strong partnership, and we will not quit. We are determined to make progress on creating a more open and transparent government for all Americans. The FOIA Improvement Act of 2015 codifies what President Obama laid out in his historic 2009 memorandum by requiring Federal agencies to adopt a ``Presumption of Openness'' when considering the release of government information under FOIA. Under this bill, when considering FOIA requests Federal agencies must find a reasonable foreseeable harm in order to invoke a discretionary exemption and withhold information from the public. The government should always err on the side of disclosure. Our legislation also provides additional independence to the Office of Government Information Services, OGIS, an office created by the Leahy-Cornyn OPEN Government Act in 2007 that helps mediate disputes between the Federal Government and FOIA requesters. Finally, our legislation will limit the use of Exemption 5 by placing a 25 year limitation on information covered by the exemption. I have fought for years to make our government more open and transparent. Senator Cornyn has been an important partner in these efforts, and our collaboration has resulted in the enactment of several improvements to FOIA including the OPEN Government Act, the first major reform to FOIA in more than a decade; the OPEN FOIA Act, which increased the transparency of legislative exemptions to FOIA; and the Faster FOIA Act, which responded to the concerns of FOIA requestors and addressed agency delays in processing requests. After four decades in the Senate, I appreciate that legislating requires compromise. The FOIA Improvement Act of 2015 reflects the input of both sides of the aisle, the open government community, the administration, and many other stakeholders. It is the product of nearly a year of careful negotiations on behalf of Senator Cornyn and me. It is supported by more than 70 public interest groups that advocate for government transparency and it had the unanimous support of the Judiciary Committee and the full Senate last year. Above all, it marks an historic step forward in our continued effort to open the government by codifying what President Obama set out to achieve in 2009 when he said ``In the face of doubt, openness prevails.'' This is common sense, and so I urge the Senate to quickly take up and pass this bill and for the House to follow suit so we can show the American people, in a bipartisan fashion, that we are committed to advancing their interests [[Page S702]] above special interests, no matter who holds control of Congress or the White House. ____________________","Congressional Record, Volume 161 Issue 17 (Monday, February 2, 2015) [Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 17 (Monday, February 2, 2015)] [Senate] [Pages S698-S702] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] STATEMENTS ON INTRODUCED BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS By Mr. Grassley (for himself, Mr. Casey, Mr. Burr, Mr. Warner, Mr. Roberts, and Mr. Cardin): S. 335. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to improve 529 plans; to the Committee on Finance. Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I am glad to be joined by Senator Casey of Pennsylvania in introducing bipartisan legislation to improve upon the already immensely successful college 529 savings programs. Those are savings plans to go to college. The 529 plans have helped millions earn a college degree without piling up a mountain of debt. These plans have long had strong bipartisan support, and I am glad the introduction of this bill today continues that tradition. Given the bipartisan nature of 529 plans, it came as a shock to me, and I am sure to most of my colleagues, when the President put forth a proposal that would undermine years of hard work toward making savings for college as accessible as it is today. College savings vehicles, we now know by the Tax Code section--that is where section 529 comes from--were first started by States in the late 1980s. However, it was only after a bipartisan effort led by then-Senator Bob Graham of Florida and Senator McConnell, [[Page S699]] now our majority leader, in 1996 that these savings plans were finally enshrined in section 529 of the Tax Code. By recognizing college savings plans in the Tax Code, States and participants could now be certain about the favorable tax treatment they would receive and thus the plans flourished. During this time, individuals' parents and grandparents were able to contribute to savings plans with certainty that the college savings for themselves and their loved ones would accumulate tax free. However, while 529 plans could accumulate interest tax free, tax was still owed once money was distributed to pay for college. So in 2001, as chairman of the Finance Committee, I worked with Senator Baucus of Montana and others to advance a proposal to further enhance college savings by excluding distributions from 529 plans from income tax so long as the money was used to pay for college education costs. We were then successful in making this provision permanent in the tax law as part of the Pension Protection Act of 2006. This change helped 529 plans take off to even new heights. From 2001 to 2002 assets in these plans doubled from $13 billion to $26 billion and totalled nearly $245 billion by July last year. The total number of accounts also nearly doubled. The number of accounts increased from 2.4 million in 2001 to 4.4 million in 2002 and increased to nearly 12 million by July of last year. The misguided proposal put forth in the President's State of the Union Address has a potential to reverse these gains by once again subjecting distributions to tax. The policy rationale given by the President was that too much of the benefit for 529 plans went to more affluent households and individuals. I believe a big reason the President's proposal was met with bipartisan disapproval is that we all know firsthand through communications with our constituents back home that the typical family with a 529 account is one with only modest means. We hear about how they have scrimped and pinched pennies so they could put money away for their child's college. They have a dream of sending their child to college and graduating without a crushing amount of debt holding them back as they start their new career post-college. Data from the College Savings Plans Network backs up this anecdotal evidence that we receive at the grassroots from our constituents. On a national basis the average account balance is under $21,000 and for Iowans the average balance is slightly lower than $17,878. This is obviously hard evidence that a typical family contributing to a 529 account is far from being part of the wealthy elite the President wants us to believe they are. A private study commissioned by the College Savings Foundation further demonstrates that these accounts are largely held by middle- class families. According to this study, about 10 percent of 529 accounts are owned by households with income below $50,000, over 70 percent are owned by households with income below $150,000, and almost 95 percent of 529 accounts are in households with incomes below $250,000. The bill I introduced today with Democratic Senator Casey will help build on the success that has so far been achieved by increasing the attractiveness of 529 plans. This bill has three primary provisions: The first provision recognizes the reality that in today's world a computer is just as much a necessary educational tool--and the expense associated with it--as a required class textbook. As such, this bill allows 529 funds to purchase a computer on the same tax payroll basis as other required materials. The second provision eliminates an outdated and unnecessary aggregation rule that increases paperwork and costs for plan administrators. The final provision provides tax and penalty relief in instances where a student may have to withdraw from school for illness or other reasons. Under current law, any refunds from the college are subject to immediate taxation and a 10-percent tax penalty. This provision eliminates this tax and penalty if the refund is redeposited in a 529 account. This permits a family to set the refund aside to pay for the student's education should that student be able to return to college or to use it for another family member. The reforms in 529 plans included in Senator Casey's and my bill are very modest but will help keep administrative costs low and provide a little extra incentive for parents to put money away for their child's education. The bill further demonstrates a renewed bipartisan commitment to 529 plans that will hopefully help erase concerns some may have in contributing to 529s given the President's misguided proposal. I hope Congress will act on this legislation and speak with a loud bipartisan voice on its commitment to college savings. ______ By Mr. CORNYN (for himself, Mr. Leahy, and Mr. Grassley): S. 337.

Mr. President, I am proud to once again join with Senator Cornyn to introduce the FOIA Improvement Act, a bipartisan bill that will make our Federal government more accountable to all Americans by strengthening the Freedom of Information Act, FOIA. Senator Cornyn and I introduced an almost identical bill last year, and despite it passing the Senate unanimously, the House failed to act. This was deeply disappointing, and was a missed opportunity for Congress. But Senator Cornyn and I have worked together for more than a decade to make our government more open, through Democratic and Republican administrations and Republican and Democratic-led Congresses. We have a strong partnership, and we will not quit. We are determined to make progress on creating a more open and transparent government for all Americans. The FOIA Improvement Act of 2015 codifies what President Obama laid out in his historic 2009 memorandum by requiring Federal agencies to adopt a ``Presumption of Openness'' when considering the release of government information under FOIA. Under this bill, when considering FOIA requests Federal agencies must find a reasonable foreseeable harm in order to invoke a discretionary exemption and withhold information from the public. The government should always err on the side of disclosure. Our legislation also provides additional independence to the Office of Government Information Services, OGIS, an office created by the Leahy-Cornyn OPEN Government Act in 2007 that helps mediate disputes between the Federal Government and FOIA requesters. Finally, our legislation will limit the use of Exemption 5 by placing a 25 year limitation on information covered by the exemption. I have fought for years to make our government more open and transparent. Senator Cornyn has been an important partner in these efforts, and our collaboration has resulted in the enactment of several improvements to FOIA including the OPEN Government Act, the first major reform to FOIA in more than a decade; the OPEN FOIA Act, which increased the transparency of legislative exemptions to FOIA; and the Faster FOIA Act, which responded to the concerns of FOIA requestors and addressed agency delays in processing requests. After four decades in the Senate, I appreciate that legislating requires compromise. The FOIA Improvement Act of 2015 reflects the input of both sides of the aisle, the open government community, the administration, and many other stakeholders. It is the product of nearly a year of careful negotiations on behalf of Senator Cornyn and me. It is supported by more than 70 public interest groups that advocate for government transparency and it had the unanimous support of the Judiciary Committee and the full Senate last year. Above all, it marks an historic step forward in our continued effort to open the government by codifying what President Obama set out to achieve in 2009 when he said ``In the face of doubt, openness prevails.'' This is common sense, and so I urge the Senate to quickly take up and pass this bill and for the House to follow suit so we can show the American people, in a bipartisan fashion, that we are committed to advancing their interests [[Page S702]] above special interests, no matter who holds control of Congress or the White House. ____________________",package_114_256.csv,29638,29638,29707,"[congressional record volume 161, number 17 (monday, february 2, 2015)] [senate] [pages s698-s702] from the congressional record online through the government publishing office [ www.gpo.gov ] statements on introduced bills and joint resolutions by mr. grassley (for himself, mr. casey, mr. burr, mr. warner, mr. roberts, and mr. cardin): s. 335. a bill to amend the internal revenue code of 1986 to improve 529 plans; to the committee on finance. mr. grassley. mr. president, i am glad to be joined by senator casey of pennsylvania in introducing bipartisan legislation to improve upon the already immensely successful college 529 savings programs. those are savings plans to go to college. the 529 plans have helped millions earn a college degree without piling up a mountain of debt. these plans have long had strong bipartisan support, and i am glad the introduction of this bill today continues that tradition. given the bipartisan nature of 529 plans, it came as a shock to me, and i am sure to most of my colleagues, when the president put forth a proposal that would undermine years of hard work toward making savings for college as accessible as it is today. college savings vehicles, we now know by the tax code section--that is where section 529 comes from--were first started by states in the late 1980s. however, it was only after a bipartisan effort led by then-senator bob graham of florida and senator mcconnell, [[page s699]] now our majority leader, in 1996 that these savings plans were finally enshrined in section 529 of the tax code. by recognizing college savings plans in the tax code, states and participants could now be certain about the favorable tax treatment they would receive and thus the plans flourished. during this time, individuals' parents and grandparents were able to contribute to savings plans with certainty that the college savings for themselves and their loved ones would accumulate tax free. however, while 529 plans could accumulate interest tax free, tax was still owed once money was distributed to pay for college. so in 2001, as chairman of the finance committee, i worked with senator baucus of montana and others to advance a proposal to further enhance college savings by excluding distributions from 529 plans from income tax so long as the money was used to pay for college education costs. we were then successful in making this provision permanent in the tax law as part of the pension protection act of 2006. this change helped 529 plans take off to even new heights. from 2001 to 2002 assets in these plans doubled from $13 billion to $26 billion and totalled nearly $245 billion by july last year. the total number of accounts also nearly doubled. the number of accounts increased from 2.4 million in 2001 to 4.4 million in 2002 and increased to nearly 12 million by july of last year. the misguided proposal put forth in the president's state of the union address has a potential to reverse these gains by once again subjecting distributions to tax. the policy rationale given by the president was that too much of the benefit for 529 plans went to more affluent households and individuals. i believe a big reason the president's proposal was met with bipartisan disapproval is that we all know firsthand through communications with our constituents back home that the typical family with a 529 account is one with only modest means. we hear about how they have scrimped and pinched pennies so they could put money away for their child's college. they have a dream of sending their child to college and graduating without a crushing amount of debt holding them back as they start their new career post-college. data from the college savings plans network backs up this anecdotal evidence that we receive at the grassroots from our constituents. on a national basis the average account balance is under $21,000 and for iowans the average balance is slightly lower than $17,878. this is obviously hard evidence that a typical family contributing to a 529 account is far from being part of the wealthy elite the president wants us to believe they are. a private study commissioned by the college savings foundation further demonstrates that these accounts are largely held by middle- class families. according to this study, about 10 percent of 529 accounts are owned by households with income below $50,000, over 70 percent are owned by households with income below $150,000, and almost 95 percent of 529 accounts are in households with incomes below $250,000. the bill i introduced today with democratic senator casey will help build on the success that has so far been achieved by increasing the attractiveness of 529 plans. this bill has three primary provisions: the first provision recognizes the reality that in today's world a computer is just as much a necessary educational tool--and the expense associated with it--as a required class textbook. as such, this bill allows 529 funds to purchase a computer on the same tax payroll basis as other required materials. the second provision eliminates an outdated and unnecessary aggregation rule that increases paperwork and costs for plan administrators. the final provision provides tax and penalty relief in instances where a student may have to withdraw from school for illness or other reasons. under current law, any refunds from the college are subject to immediate taxation and a 10-percent tax penalty. this provision eliminates this tax and penalty if the refund is redeposited in a 529 account. this permits a family to set the refund aside to pay for the student's education should that student be able to return to college or to use it for another family member. the reforms in 529 plans included in senator casey's and my bill are very modest but will help keep administrative costs low and provide a little extra incentive for parents to put money away for their child's education. the bill further demonstrates a renewed bipartisan commitment to 529 plans that will hopefully help erase concerns some may have in contributing to 529s given the president's misguided proposal. i hope congress will act on this legislation and speak with a loud bipartisan voice on its commitment to college savings. ______ by mr.

CREC-2015-02-02-pt1-PgS698-4,CREC-2015-02-02,114,Introductory Statement on S. 335,"[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 17 (Monday, February 2, 2015)] [Senate] [Pages S698-S699] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] By Mr. Grassley (for himself, Mr. Casey, Mr. Burr, Mr. Warner, Mr. Roberts, and Mr. Cardin): S. 335. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to improve 529 plans; to the Committee on Finance. Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I am glad to be joined by Senator Casey of Pennsylvania in introducing bipartisan legislation to improve upon the already immensely successful college 529 savings programs. Those are savings plans to go to college. The 529 plans have helped millions earn a college degree without piling up a mountain of debt. These plans have long had strong bipartisan support, and I am glad the introduction of this bill today continues that tradition. Given the bipartisan nature of 529 plans, it came as a shock to me, and I am sure to most of my colleagues, when the President put forth a proposal that would undermine years of hard work toward making savings for college as accessible as it is today. College savings vehicles, we now know by the Tax Code section--that is where section 529 comes from--were first started by States in the late 1980s. However, it was only after a bipartisan effort led by then-Senator Bob Graham of Florida and Senator McConnell, [[Page S699]] now our majority leader, in 1996 that these savings plans were finally enshrined in section 529 of the Tax Code. By recognizing college savings plans in the Tax Code, States and participants could now be certain about the favorable tax treatment they would receive and thus the plans flourished. During this time, individuals' parents and grandparents were able to contribute to savings plans with certainty that the college savings for themselves and their loved ones would accumulate tax free. However, while 529 plans could accumulate interest tax free, tax was still owed once money was distributed to pay for college. So in 2001, as chairman of the Finance Committee, I worked with Senator Baucus of Montana and others to advance a proposal to further enhance college savings by excluding distributions from 529 plans from income tax so long as the money was used to pay for college education costs. We were then successful in making this provision permanent in the tax law as part of the Pension Protection Act of 2006. This change helped 529 plans take off to even new heights. From 2001 to 2002 assets in these plans doubled from $13 billion to $26 billion and totalled nearly $245 billion by July last year. The total number of accounts also nearly doubled. The number of accounts increased from 2.4 million in 2001 to 4.4 million in 2002 and increased to nearly 12 million by July of last year. The misguided proposal put forth in the President's State of the Union Address has a potential to reverse these gains by once again subjecting distributions to tax. The policy rationale given by the President was that too much of the benefit for 529 plans went to more affluent households and individuals. I believe a big reason the President's proposal was met with bipartisan disapproval is that we all know firsthand through communications with our constituents back home that the typical family with a 529 account is one with only modest means. We hear about how they have scrimped and pinched pennies so they could put money away for their child's college. They have a dream of sending their child to college and graduating without a crushing amount of debt holding them back as they start their new career post-college. Data from the College Savings Plans Network backs up this anecdotal evidence that we receive at the grassroots from our constituents. On a national basis the average account balance is under $21,000 and for Iowans the average balance is slightly lower than $17,878. This is obviously hard evidence that a typical family contributing to a 529 account is far from being part of the wealthy elite the President wants us to believe they are. A private study commissioned by the College Savings Foundation further demonstrates that these accounts are largely held by middle- class families. According to this study, about 10 percent of 529 accounts are owned by households with income below $50,000, over 70 percent are owned by households with income below $150,000, and almost 95 percent of 529 accounts are in households with incomes below $250,000. The bill I introduced today with Democratic Senator Casey will help build on the success that has so far been achieved by increasing the attractiveness of 529 plans. This bill has three primary provisions: The first provision recognizes the reality that in today's world a computer is just as much a necessary educational tool--and the expense associated with it--as a required class textbook. As such, this bill allows 529 funds to purchase a computer on the same tax payroll basis as other required materials. The second provision eliminates an outdated and unnecessary aggregation rule that increases paperwork and costs for plan administrators. The final provision provides tax and penalty relief in instances where a student may have to withdraw from school for illness or other reasons. Under current law, any refunds from the college are subject to immediate taxation and a 10-percent tax penalty. This provision eliminates this tax and penalty if the refund is redeposited in a 529 account. This permits a family to set the refund aside to pay for the student's education should that student be able to return to college or to use it for another family member. The reforms in 529 plans included in Senator Casey's and my bill are very modest but will help keep administrative costs low and provide a little extra incentive for parents to put money away for their child's education. The bill further demonstrates a renewed bipartisan commitment to 529 plans that will hopefully help erase concerns some may have in contributing to 529s given the President's misguided proposal. I hope Congress will act on this legislation and speak with a loud bipartisan voice on its commitment to college savings. ______","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 17 (Monday, February 2, 2015)] [Senate] [Pages S698-S699] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] By Mr. Grassley (for himself, Mr. Casey, Mr. Burr, Mr. Warner, Mr. Roberts, and Mr. Cardin): S. 335.

post-college. data from the college savings plans network backs up this anecdotal evidence that we receive at the grassroots from our constituents. on a national basis the average account balance is under $21,000 and for iowans the average balance is slightly lower than $17,878. this is obviously hard evidence that a typical family contributing to a 529 account is far from being part of the wealthy elite the president wants us to believe they are. a private study commissioned by the college savings foundation further demonstrates that these accounts are largely held by middle- class families. according to this study, about 10 percent of 529 accounts are owned by households with income below $50,000, over 70 percent are owned by households with income below $150,000, and almost 95 percent of 529 accounts are in households with incomes below $250,000. the bill i introduced today with democratic senator casey will help build on the success that has so far been achieved by increasing the attractiveness of 529 plans. this bill has three primary provisions: the first provision recognizes the reality that in today's world a computer is just as much a necessary educational tool--and the expense associated with it--as a required class textbook. as such, this bill allows 529 funds to purchase a computer on the same tax payroll basis as other required materials. the second provision eliminates an outdated and unnecessary aggregation rule that increases paperwork and costs for plan administrators. the final provision provides tax and penalty relief in instances where a student may have to withdraw from school for illness or other reasons. under current law, any refunds from the college are subject to immediate taxation and a 10-percent tax penalty. this provision eliminates this tax and penalty if the refund is redeposited in a 529 account. this permits a family to set the refund aside to pay for the student's education should that student be able to return to college or to use it for another family member. the reforms in 529 plans included in senator casey's and my bill are very modest but will help keep administrative costs low and provide a little extra incentive for parents to put money away for their child's education. the bill further demonstrates a renewed bipartisan commitment to 529 plans that will hopefully help erase concerns some may have in contributing to 529s given the president's misguided proposal. i hope congress will act on this legislation and speak with a loud bipartisan voice on its commitment to college savings. ______",6182

The requirements of this Act and the amendments made by this Act shall be carried out using amounts otherwise authorized or appropriated. Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am proud to once again join with Senator Cornyn to introduce the FOIA Improvement Act, a bipartisan bill that will make our Federal government more accountable to all Americans by strengthening the Freedom of Information Act, FOIA. Senator Cornyn and I introduced an almost identical bill last year, and despite it passing the Senate unanimously, the House failed to act. This was deeply disappointing, and was a missed opportunity for Congress. But Senator Cornyn and I have worked together for more than a decade to make our government more open, through Democratic and Republican administrations and Republican and Democratic-led Congresses. We have a strong partnership, and we will not quit. We are determined to make progress on creating a more open and transparent government for all Americans. The FOIA Improvement Act of 2015 codifies what President Obama laid out in his historic 2009 memorandum by requiring Federal agencies to adopt a ``Presumption of Openness'' when considering the release of government information under FOIA. Under this bill, when considering FOIA requests Federal agencies must find a reasonable foreseeable harm in order to invoke a discretionary exemption and withhold information from the public. The government should always err on the side of disclosure. Our legislation also provides additional independence to the Office of Government Information Services, OGIS, an office created by the Leahy-Cornyn OPEN Government Act in 2007 that helps mediate disputes between the Federal Government and FOIA requesters. Finally, our legislation will limit the use of Exemption 5 by placing a 25 year limitation on information covered by the exemption. I have fought for years to make our government more open and transparent. Senator Cornyn has been an important partner in these efforts, and our collaboration has resulted in the enactment of several improvements to FOIA including the OPEN Government Act, the first major reform to FOIA in more than a decade; the OPEN FOIA Act, which increased the transparency of legislative exemptions to FOIA; and the Faster FOIA Act, which responded to the concerns of FOIA requestors and addressed agency delays in processing requests. After four decades in the Senate, I appreciate that legislating requires compromise. The FOIA Improvement Act of 2015 reflects the input of both sides of the aisle, the open government community, the administration, and many other stakeholders. It is the product of nearly a year of careful negotiations on behalf of Senator Cornyn and me. It is supported by more than 70 public interest groups that advocate for government transparency and it had the unanimous support of the Judiciary Committee and the full Senate last year. Above all, it marks an historic step forward in our continued effort to open the government by codifying what President Obama set out to achieve in 2009 when he said ``In the face of doubt, openness prevails.'' This is common sense, and so I urge the Senate to quickly take up and pass this bill and for the House to follow suit so we can show the American people, in a bipartisan fashion, that we are committed to advancing their interests [[Page S702]] above special interests, no matter who holds control of Congress or the White House. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 17 (Monday, February 2, 2015)] [Senate] [Pages S699-S702] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] By Mr. CORNYN (for himself, Mr. Leahy, and Mr. Grassley): S. 337.

Mr. President, I am proud to once again join with Senator Cornyn to introduce the FOIA Improvement Act, a bipartisan bill that will make our Federal government more accountable to all Americans by strengthening the Freedom of Information Act, FOIA. Senator Cornyn and I introduced an almost identical bill last year, and despite it passing the Senate unanimously, the House failed to act. This was deeply disappointing, and was a missed opportunity for Congress. But Senator Cornyn and I have worked together for more than a decade to make our government more open, through Democratic and Republican administrations and Republican and Democratic-led Congresses. We have a strong partnership, and we will not quit. We are determined to make progress on creating a more open and transparent government for all Americans. The FOIA Improvement Act of 2015 codifies what President Obama laid out in his historic 2009 memorandum by requiring Federal agencies to adopt a ``Presumption of Openness'' when considering the release of government information under FOIA. Under this bill, when considering FOIA requests Federal agencies must find a reasonable foreseeable harm in order to invoke a discretionary exemption and withhold information from the public. The government should always err on the side of disclosure. Our legislation also provides additional independence to the Office of Government Information Services, OGIS, an office created by the Leahy-Cornyn OPEN Government Act in 2007 that helps mediate disputes between the Federal Government and FOIA requesters. Finally, our legislation will limit the use of Exemption 5 by placing a 25 year limitation on information covered by the exemption. I have fought for years to make our government more open and transparent. Senator Cornyn has been an important partner in these efforts, and our collaboration has resulted in the enactment of several improvements to FOIA including the OPEN Government Act, the first major reform to FOIA in more than a decade; the OPEN FOIA Act, which increased the transparency of legislative exemptions to FOIA; and the Faster FOIA Act, which responded to the concerns of FOIA requestors and addressed agency delays in processing requests. After four decades in the Senate, I appreciate that legislating requires compromise. The FOIA Improvement Act of 2015 reflects the input of both sides of the aisle, the open government community, the administration, and many other stakeholders. It is the product of nearly a year of careful negotiations on behalf of Senator Cornyn and me. It is supported by more than 70 public interest groups that advocate for government transparency and it had the unanimous support of the Judiciary Committee and the full Senate last year. Above all, it marks an historic step forward in our continued effort to open the government by codifying what President Obama set out to achieve in 2009 when he said ``In the face of doubt, openness prevails.'' This is common sense, and so I urge the Senate to quickly take up and pass this bill and for the House to follow suit so we can show the American people, in a bipartisan fashion, that we are committed to advancing their interests [[Page S702]] above special interests, no matter who holds control of Congress or the White House. ____________________","Congressional Record, Volume 161 Issue 17 (Monday, February 2, 2015) [Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 17 (Monday, February 2, 2015)] [Senate] [Pages S699-S702] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] By Mr. CORNYN (for himself, Mr. Leahy, and Mr. Grassley): S. 337.

CREC-2015-02-02-pt1-PgS703-2,CREC-2015-02-02,114,DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY FUNDING,"[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 17 (Monday, February 2, 2015)] [Senate] [Pages S703-S705] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY FUNDING Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, tomorrow we will vote on whether to proceed to the Department of Homeland Security appropriations bill, which fully funds the Department of Homeland Security and includes the law enforcement priorities that were agreed to on a bipartisan basis in the House. It is indeed a clean bill. The House of Representatives has voted to fund fully homeland security, as the President has requested. Now, it is not a perfect bill. Republicans and Democrats and individuals on both sides have different priorities on some matters, but they did come to an agreement to fund all of the programs of the Department of Homeland Security and on how much they were funded-- activities and actions that are authorized, however, by the laws of the United States. So this bill will not deny a penny of funding. In fact, it says: Mr. President, spend the money on enforcing and following the law. Spend the money on enforcing the Immigration and Nationality Act as passed by Congress--that is the law of the United States of America. Spend the money to let our law enforcement officers carry out their duties as prescribed by the laws. Yet our Democratic colleagues say they are going to block this bill-- that they will all stick together and not even let it come to the floor of the Senate. Why? Why would they do that? Because, they say, they want to give the President the funds, apparently, to spend on his unconstitutional and unlawful Executive amnesty. They will not allow the bill to even be voted on, and without a vote in the Senate, the funding for Homeland Security does not go forward. They are not going to allow it to be voted on because they want to protect the President in his assertion of an unconstitutional and illegal power to order duly-constituted enforcement officers of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security to carry out unlawful activity. The President is not entitled to spend taxpayer dollars to implement a system of immigration that Congress--representing the American people's wishes, let me add--rejected just last year. Surely our Democratic colleagues will not block the Senate from proceeding to this bill to fund the Department of Homeland Security. If they are unhappy with the language of the bill of the House of Representatives, if they think the President wrongfully or rightfully, using legitimate powers, could direct them to provide Social Security numbers, Medicare participation, earned income tax credit money from the Federal Government and the right to work in the United States when the law says they are not entitled to be employed in the United States, then they can offer an amendment to the bill and bring it up on the floor of the Senate to strike that language if they think it is so bad. Of course, if you think about it, that would be a stunning event; would it not be--the Senate taking language from a bill or striking language from a bill that restores the separation of powers as properly understood by the Framers and preventing the President from violating law and the constitution. They are going to vote against that? Maybe that is why they choose not to have this bill go forward. Maybe they do not want to confront the issue. I am going to quote Senator Reid in a moment because he said we ought to confront the issue square-on. All right, let's do so. I suspect Senator Reid, though, and his team are not so interested in having votes and being held accountable for their votes. Our colleagues would have the right to offer amendments. Senator McConnell is allowing amendments. He is going out of his way to allow amendments and changing the terrible state the Senate had found itself in under the leadership of Senator Reid. Consistent with the rules of the Senate, those amendments can be brought up, and a motion to strike this language is certainly appropriate. It is an untenable position--untenable constitutionally, untenable because it is contrary to the will of the Members of the House and Senate who oppose the President's action--Republicans and Democrats. Perhaps most importantly, it is untenable politically because the American people strongly reject it. So why would any Senator--Democrat or Republican--when the very integrity of the Congress is under assault by an overreaching executive branch, not want to assert congressional authority at this point? We are coequal branches of government, and the President does not have the authority to enforce a law that was never passed--indeed, a law that was explicitly rejected by the Congress of the United States-- and grant amnesty to people who are unlawfully here, provide them work authorizations, a photo ID allowing them to apply for any job in America, with Social Security numbers and the right to participate in Social Security and Medicare. That is what the President's actions are going to do. This is not prosecutorial discretion--nowhere close to prosecutorial discretion. It is an Executive fiat. It is an imperial act. As the President himself said repeatedly: I am not a king; I am not an emperor. When dealing with this very issue, he told people over a period of years--20 times--that he did not have the power to do this. But then he changed his mind. Under pressure from certain political interest groups and because he couldn't get Congress to vote for the bill he wanted, he just decided to do it on his own. This is an unthinkable overreach. It is a matter of great national importance. The American people were engaged in this. They were following this issue. The President couldn't get the constitutional process to give him the power he wanted, so he just did it anyway. Why can't it be stopped? I get asked that. What is the matter with you people in Congress? Well, we had seven Members on the Democratic side of the aisle, still in this Senate today, who said the President overreached. They said he shouldn't have done this, and it should have been done by the legislature, by the Congress, not by the President. Yet are all seven of them going to vote with Senator Reid and become part of [[Page S704]] the palace guard that protects the President in his unlawful act so the President can't be challenged? That is what it amounts to. There is no doubt about it. That is precisely what it amounts to--a palace guard circling around the White House to protect the President, even though Members of this Senate have said he overreached and what he did was wrong. They are, apparently, going to continue to vote for it. Out of what--party loyalty? Out of loyalty to Senator Reid, the minority leader in the Senate? Well, they say--and the media even is saying sometimes--Democrats and others are sometimes saying that the bill contains controversial new immigration riders, and therefore, it ought to be blocked. It contains unconstitutional or controversial new immigration riders, and that is bad. That is why it ought to be blocked. What new policy is in the bill? What new expenditure is in the bill that is not consistent with the laws of the United States? Not one. The bill passed by the House carries out the essential functions in the normal orderly way of Homeland Security. It doesn't add any pork, and it doesn't add any special expenditures for some controversial project. It doesn't do any of that. So if the President says that he will deploy his Border Patrol officers--no longer at the Mexican border where we have large flows of illegal labor--to Montana or Maine, where we have very few people, in effect, he is saying we are no longer going to enforce the border there or even attempt to, and he is going to reassign them. He is saying: I am the President. They work for me. I can do such things. Well, would it be a controversial rider for the Senate, or for the House of Representatives, to say no, we prohibit funds to do that? We are going to fund the officers' duty at the border with our Mexican neighbors where they need to be. The point is who is creating the controversy--not the House of Representatives. It is the President of the United States. He has overreached, without any doubt, and the situation is very grave. What if the next President of the United States decides to do something else? Senator Cruz, at the hearing for the Attorney General nominee, Ms. Lynch, asked her: What if Mr. Cornyn--whom he was sitting by, at the time, the Senator from Texas--were President and he didn't like certain labor laws that applied to people in Texas and he told his bureaucrats--who in effect work for the President of the United States--don't enforce labor laws in Texas? So Senator Cruz asked the nominee, Loretta Lynch, who wants to be Attorney General of the United States of America, whether under President Obama's Executive amnesty theory, the next President could do that and bar the enforcement of labor laws in the State of Texas. She said she would have to review it. She wasn't sure. Of course that is blatantly unconstitutional. It shouldn't have taken her 5 seconds to say of course a President can't do that. Have we gotten such a confused understanding of law in America that we are at that point that universal laws of labor are subject to the whim of a President of the United States, and even the Attorney General will not say it is wrong and even the Congress will not say no to the President on this? Well, the House did say no. They passed a perfectly responsible funding bill for Homeland Security. They said: We are not going to allow you to spend money to advocate a policy which we have rejected-- which they can do just that way: We don't like this action. We are not going to fund this action. The Executive of this country--the President--cannot act on it if he is prevented from spending money on it. It goes to the very core of the legislative process. It is what the American Revolution was about. It is what happened in England. They wrested this power from the King, and we adopted it in terms of the President and put the power in Congress. They had the power in Parliament. It is a big deal. I don't think we are at a point where we need to back down on this. It is not an overreach. Those great leaders, some at Homeland Security, so confident in their wisdom and policy ideas, having forgotten what the rule of law is, suggest that Congress should just roll over and forget it and go on and let it happen and not be controversial by standing up to it. Now, look. I like Senator Reid. We battle a lot. He is pugnacious, as this Politico article said, but I can live with that. I am glad he is back and I hope he is doing better and I hope he recovers fully, and I am confident he will. A Politico article by Mr. Burgess Everett earlier today quoted Senator Reid as saying: Why should we be dealing with issues that have nothing to do with homeland security? Nothing to do with homeland security, Senator Reid said. If my Republican colleagues have some problems with something the President has done on immigration, for example, hit it head on. Don't hide it in homeland security. Well, the problem is Homeland Security. The President has directed the officials of Homeland Security to take money that has been authorized and appropriated for them to enforce the immigration laws of this country and to use those funds to carry out a scheme Congress has rejected. Under the laws of the United States it is illegal to hire somebody unlawfully in the country. There is no doubt about that. People unlawfully in the country are not entitled to participate in Social Security or Medicare. How could it be otherwise? So he told the Homeland Security officials to create a new office, a new building across the river in Crystal City. He directed them to hire 1,000 new employees to process applications under his Executive amnesty, a policy Congress rejected. It is breathtaking. It is going to cost tens of millions of dollars just for that one office. That just begins to suggest how much money will have to be spent to execute his vision for immigration that the American people rejected. So how do we deal with it directly? How do we hit it on the head openly and directly? The Congress has the power of the purse. No money can be spent by this President that Congress hasn't authorized. So the House discussed this. They went into some detail about it, worked at it for some time, and the House decided they would not fund this action that contradicted laws they passed and execute a policy they didn't agree with. I think that is confronting it head on--no doubt about that--and it absolutely deals with homeland security. My goodness. So this is the kind of logic and weak arguments that are being put forth here. We will talk about a lot of things as we go forward with this debate that evidences the bankruptcy of the policies carried out by this administration. One of the things that came out today as part of the President's budget was his assumption that if his immigration policies are passed, we would save lots of money for the U.S. Treasury. Why would it save money? It would save money because we would collect more Social Security benefits, and this would create more revenue for the government and put us in a sound position to help balance the budget. We are not going to balance the budget. We are not going to come close to it, but he said a substantial amount of money would come from it. Colleagues, we have to understand what a misrepresentation of colossal enormity is at stake in that statement. Everybody knows Social Security and Medicare are on unsustainable financial courses. Anybody who knows anything about Medicare and Social Security knows the fundamental problem is people are not putting in enough money to take care of those who retire, and so the flow is not enough. Over time it is going to get worse. We are just now beginning to go into deficit for Social Security. The disability portion is in critical shape. It is in very bad shape, but what this calculation is based on is the next 10 years. So it says we will have more income in the next 10 years, and that may be so. But every person who goes on Social Security today--and even more so in the future--are, under law, projected to take out more than they put in plus interest. So obviously add 5 million new people to the Social Security rolls and no change in the amount of money that they pay in, they make the long-term strength of Social Security even more weak. It makes the hole even deeper that we have to dig our way out of. There is no other way to analyze it. [[Page S705]] It is just unbelievable to me that they would make such a statement. Those of us in the Congress need to be thinking about the long-term financial course of America. We need to be trying to put not just short-term benefits here so Congress can spend more money, but also we need to be thinking about how to place this country on a sound long- term path. Adding more people to Social Security--particularly lower income people as most of these are, who will draw out even more than the higher income people draw out as a percentage on the basis of what they paid in--is not a way to save Social Security. In a December 1, 2014 article in Investor's Business Daily entitled, ``Obama's Amnesty will create a Fiscal Nightmare for Entitlements,'' Merrill Matthews, resident scholar at the Institute for Policy Innovation, and Mark E. Litow, retired actuary and past chairman of the Social Insurance Public Finance Section of the Society of Actuaries, wrote this: Obama's amnesty action greatly exacerbates the problem, because retirees get back far more than they pay in. That is as plain and as simple as daylight following dark. They go on to write: But millions of Obama's newly legalized are working-age adults with children, so many could be in their 40s or older. Thus, they could pay FICA taxes for the next, say, 15 or 20 years--less than the average American worker--and be eligible for the full array of Social Security and Medicare benefits. This is going to be devastating to Social Security and Medicare. It is going to hammer those programs. It is going to make it harder for us to save them, which we have an obligation to do. There is no obligation to give Social Security and Medicare to persons who enter the United States unlawfully. People aren't entitled to come into the country unlawfully and demand the benefits of the country. The first thing we should do to confront unlawful immigration is not to subsidize it with taxpayer money. The article goes on to say: Using a basic simulation model, we believe the government will receive about $500 billion in payroll tax revenue (including Part B and drug premiums) and expect it to pay out some $2 trillion in benefits over several decades. So they pay in $500 billion, but we are going to pay out $2 trillion--four times as much. How does this make America more financially stable? On December 4 of last year, in an article in the Atlantic magazine entitled ``The Cost of Amnesty,'' senior editor David Frum wrote this: In the 2011 tax year, the average EITC payment to a family with children was $2,905, according to the Center for Budget and Policy Priorities. The Additional Child Tax Credit works in much the same way, paying an average of $1,800 to qualifying households. Earned-income tax credit--that sounds like some sort of deduction you might have, but it is not. So many of the persons who will be given this legal status will be eligible for the earned-income tax credit because they have a family--presumably--that is what the President tells us; these are for families--and their income is at a rate that entitles them to draw earned-income tax credit. But go to the budget of the United States of America and how the Congressional Budget Office calculates this--they don't calculate earned-income tax credit as some sort of tax deduction. They calculate it as an expenditure of the United States of America, and it absolutely is. The way it works is your income is so low you have a family of such that you don't owe any income tax, and they send you a credit and they call it an earned-income tax credit, and a tax credit is a cash payment to you. It looks something like a tax matter, but it is really a direct check from the United States of America to lower-income families. So this is going to be qualifying for large numbers of people that will be given a legal status. Citing the Center for Immigration Studies, Mr. Frum in the Atlantic article explains: About 14.5 percent of the native-born population of the United States earns little enough to qualify for the EITC. Almost twice as great a portion of the total immigrant population, 29.7 percent, qualifies. But the specific immigrant groups most likely to benefit from the President's actions earned even less. So you have, on a percentage basis, twice as many in the immigrant population eligible for EITC as the average native-born American would be to qualify to receive that check from the United States. Mr. Frum goes on to say, ``The EITC will cost a shade over $70 billion in fiscal year 2015.'' That is a lot of money--$70 billion. A Federal highway bill is $40 billion, moving up to $50 billion. This is $70 billion. The refundable portion of the child tax credit will cost about $33 billion. That's $100 billion in total. Together, they cost 10 times as much as traditional cash welfare. Soon they will cost much, much more. He goes on to note: Quaintly enough, U.S. immigration law still forbids the president to grant residency to aliens likely to become ``a public charge.'' The list of exceptions, however, overwhelms the rule. Here are the benefits that are ``not intended for income maintenance'' and therefore exempt, according to the Citizenship and Immigration Services. . . . And they list a whole lot of taxes. Well, I just want to wrap up by saying the House of Representatives can do time and order, pass the bill that fully funds the United States, and it does not contain riders and it does not contain pork spending. Well, maybe it contains it, but it is not being complained about at this time, and it is before the Senate. To fund the Department of Homeland Security the Senate has to pass the same bill with the same expenditures to do so. So all we have to do is fund the Department of Homeland Security but not approve the President's desire to transmit funds in Homeland Security to an illegal, unlawful policy of amnesty that Congress opposes and the American people oppose. Who do we represent? Since 2009, we learned today, the Obama administration issued 5.5 million extra work permits--double the normal expected flow by over almost a million a year. We understood it to be 700,000. Now we understand there are so many more that have not been calculated in the numbers. His Executive amnesty will issue 5 million more. Since 2009 family incomes are down $4,000. There is no doubt about it, colleagues, that this incredibly large flow of immigrants into America exceeds the ability of the American economy to absorb them. It is pulling down wages. It is moving people out of the workplace. It is making it very difficult for lawful immigrants to get jobs in America because there will always be a new group coming in willing to work for less. It is eroding the middle class and middle-class values. So we are going to talk about this as we go forward. I believe this country will continue to be a nation that allows immigration. We don't dislike or hate or demean people that want to come to America and work here. But we need to send a clear message: If you are not coming lawfully, don't come. And if you come unlawfully, you are not going to be given amnesty. You are not going to be given Social Security, Medicare, earned income tax credits, and the right to go to any hospital in America and demand health care. We are just not going to do that. If we do that with clarity, colleagues, what will happen? The people who are coming here unlawfully will stop coming. The numbers will fall dramatically, and we will be in a position, then, to reestablish a lawful system of immigration that the American people have pleaded with us to establish--one that we can be proud of, that is just and fair where people apply and wait their turn and are accepted or not accepted based on the merits. If we do that, we will have served the American people with what they have asked us to do. I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 17 (Monday, February 2, 2015)] [Senate] [Pages S703-S705] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY FUNDING Mr. SESSIONS.

Those great leaders, some at Homeland Security, so confident in their wisdom and policy ideas, having forgotten what the rule of law is, suggest that Congress should just roll over and forget it and go on and let it happen and not be controversial by standing up to it. Now, look. I like Senator Reid. We battle a lot. He is pugnacious, as this Politico article said, but I can live with that. I am glad he is back and I hope he is doing better and I hope he recovers fully, and I am confident he will. A Politico article by Mr. Burgess Everett earlier today quoted Senator Reid as saying: Why should we be dealing with issues that have nothing to do with homeland security? Nothing to do with homeland security, Senator Reid said. If my Republican colleagues have some problems with something the President has done on immigration, for example, hit it head on. Don't hide it in homeland security. Well, the problem is Homeland Security. The President has directed the officials of Homeland Security to take money that has been authorized and appropriated for them to enforce the immigration laws of this country and to use those funds to carry out a scheme Congress has rejected. Under the laws of the United States it is illegal to hire somebody unlawfully in the country. There is no doubt about that. People unlawfully in the country are not entitled to participate in Social Security or Medicare. How could it be otherwise? So he told the Homeland Security officials to create a new office, a new building across the river in Crystal City. He directed them to hire 1,000 new employees to process applications under his Executive amnesty, a policy Congress rejected. It is breathtaking. It is going to cost tens of millions of dollars just for that one office. That just begins to suggest how much money will have to be spent to execute his vision for immigration that the American people rejected. So how do we deal with it directly? How do we hit it on the head openly and directly? The Congress has the power of the purse. No money can be spent by this President that Congress hasn't authorized. So the House discussed this. They went into some detail about it, worked at it for some time, and the House decided they would not fund this action that contradicted laws they passed and execute a policy they didn't agree with. I think that is confronting it head on--no doubt about that--and it absolutely deals with homeland security. My goodness. So this is the kind of logic and weak arguments that are being put forth here. We will talk about a lot of things as we go forward with this debate that evidences the bankruptcy of the policies carried out by this administration. One of the things that came out today as part of the President's budget was his assumption that if his immigration policies are passed, we would save lots of money for the U.S. Treasury. Why would it save money? It would save money because we would collect more Social Security benefits, and this would create more revenue for the government and put us in a sound position to help balance the budget. We are not going to balance the budget. We are not going to come close to it, but he said a substantial amount of money would come from it. Colleagues, we have to understand what a misrepresentation of colossal enormity is at stake in that statement. Everybody knows Social Security and Medicare are on unsustainable financial courses. Anybody who knows anything about Medicare and Social Security knows the fundamental problem is people are not putting in enough money to take care of those who retire, and so the flow is not enough. Over time it is going to get worse. We are just now beginning to go into deficit for Social Security. The disability portion is in critical shape. It is in very bad shape, but what this calculation is based on is the next 10 years. So it says we will have more income in the next 10 years, and that may be so. But every person who goes on Social Security today--and even more so in the future--are, under law, projected to take out more than they put in plus interest. So obviously add 5 million new people to the Social Security rolls and no change in the amount of money that they pay in, they make the long-term strength of Social Security even more weak. It makes the hole even deeper that we have to dig our way out of. There is no other way to analyze it. [[Page S705]] It is just unbelievable to me that they would make such a statement. Those of us in the Congress need to be thinking about the long-term financial course of America. We need to be trying to put not just short-term benefits here so Congress can spend more money, but also we need to be thinking about how to place this country on a sound long- term path. Adding more people to Social Security--particularly lower income people as most of these are, who will draw out even more than the higher income people draw out as a percentage on the basis of what they paid in--is not a way to save Social Security. In a December 1, 2014 article in Investor's Business Daily entitled, ``Obama's Amnesty will create a Fiscal Nightmare for Entitlements,'' Merrill Matthews, resident scholar at the Institute for Policy Innovation, and Mark E. Litow, retired actuary and past chairman of the Social Insurance Public Finance Section of the Society of Actuaries, wrote this: Obama's amnesty action greatly exacerbates the problem, because retirees get back far more than they pay in. That is as plain and as simple as daylight following dark. They go on to write: But millions of Obama's newly legalized are working-age adults with children, so many could be in their 40s or older. Thus, they could pay FICA taxes for the next, say, 15 or 20 years--less than the average American worker--and be eligible for the full array of Social Security and Medicare benefits. This is going to be devastating to Social Security and Medicare. It is going to hammer those programs. It is going to make it harder for us to save them, which we have an obligation to do. There is no obligation to give Social Security and Medicare to persons who enter the United States unlawfully. People aren't entitled to come into the country unlawfully and demand the benefits of the country. The first thing we should do to confront unlawful immigration is not to subsidize it with taxpayer money. The article goes on to say: Using a basic simulation model, we believe the government will receive about $500 billion in payroll tax revenue (including Part B and drug premiums) and expect it to pay out some $2 trillion in benefits over several decades. So they pay in $500 billion, but we are going to pay out $2 trillion--four times as much. How does this make America more financially stable? On December 4 of last year, in an article in the Atlantic magazine entitled ``The Cost of Amnesty,'' senior editor David Frum wrote this: In the 2011 tax year, the average EITC payment to a family with children was $2,905, according to the Center for Budget and Policy Priorities. The Additional Child Tax Credit works in much the same way, paying an average of $1,800 to qualifying households. Earned-income tax credit--that sounds like some sort of deduction you might have, but it is not. So many of the persons who will be given this legal status will be eligible for the earned-income tax credit because they have a family--presumably--that is what the President tells us; these are for families--and their income is at a rate that entitles them to draw earned-income tax credit. But go to the budget of the United States of America and how the Congressional Budget Office calculates this--they don't calculate earned-income tax credit as some sort of tax deduction. They calculate it as an expenditure of the United States of America, and it absolutely is. The way it works is your income is so low you have a family of such that you don't owe any income tax, and they send you a credit and they call it an earned-income tax credit, and a tax credit is a cash payment to you. It looks something like a tax matter, but it is really a direct check from the United States of America to lower-income families. So this is going to be qualifying for large numbers of people that will be given a legal status. Citing the Center for Immigration Studies, Mr. Frum in the Atlantic article explains: About 14.5 percent of the native-born population of the United States earns little enough to qualify for the EITC. Almost twice as great a portion of the total immigrant population, 29.7 percent, qualifies. But the specific immigrant groups most likely to benefit from the President's actions earned even less. So you have, on a percentage basis, twice as many in the immigrant population eligible for EITC as the average native-born American would be to qualify to receive that check from the United States. Mr. Frum goes on to say, ``The EITC will cost a shade over $70 billion in fiscal year 2015.'' That is a lot of money--$70 billion. A Federal highway bill is $40 billion, moving up to $50 billion. This is $70 billion. The refundable portion of the child tax credit will cost about $33 billion. That's $100 billion in total. Together, they cost 10 times as much as traditional cash welfare. Soon they will cost much, much more. He goes on to note: Quaintly enough, U.S. immigration law still forbids the president to grant residency to aliens likely to become ``a public charge.'' The list of exceptions, however, overwhelms the rule. Here are the benefits that are ``not intended for income maintenance'' and therefore exempt, according to the Citizenship and Immigration Services. . . . And they list a whole lot of taxes. Well, I just want to wrap up by saying the House of Representatives can do time and order, pass the bill that fully funds the United States, and it does not contain riders and it does not contain pork spending. Well, maybe it contains it, but it is not being complained about at this time, and it is before the Senate. To fund the Department of Homeland Security the Senate has to pass the same bill with the same expenditures to do so. So all we have to do is fund the Department of Homeland Security but not approve the President's desire to transmit funds in Homeland Security to an illegal, unlawful policy of amnesty that Congress opposes and the American people oppose. Who do we represent? Since 2009, we learned today, the Obama administration issued 5.5 million extra work permits--double the normal expected flow by over almost a million a year. We understood it to be 700,000. Now we understand there are so many more that have not been calculated in the numbers. His Executive amnesty will issue 5 million more. Since 2009 family incomes are down $4,000. There is no doubt about it, colleagues, that this incredibly large flow of immigrants into America exceeds the ability of the American economy to absorb them. It is pulling down wages. It is moving people out of the workplace. It is making it very difficult for lawful immigrants to get jobs in America because there will always be a new group coming in willing to work for less. It is eroding the middle class and middle-class values. So we are going to talk about this as we go forward. I believe this country will continue to be a nation that allows immigration. We don't dislike or hate or demean people that want to come to America and work here. But we need to send a clear message: If you are not coming lawfully, don't come. And if you come unlawfully, you are not going to be given amnesty. You are not going to be given Social Security, Medicare, earned income tax credits, and the right to go to any hospital in America and demand health care. We are just not going to do that. If we do that with clarity, colleagues, what will happen? The people who are coming here unlawfully will stop coming. The numbers will fall dramatically, and we will be in a position, then, to reestablish a lawful system of immigration that the American people have pleaded with us to establish--one that we can be proud of, that is just and fair where people apply and wait their turn and are accepted or not accepted based on the merits. If we do that, we will have served the American people with what they have asked us to do. I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor. ____________________","Congressional Record, Volume 161 Issue 17 (Monday, February 2, 2015) [Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 17 (Monday, February 2, 2015)] [Senate] [Pages S703-S705] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY FUNDING Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, tomorrow we will vote on whether to proceed to the Department of Homeland Security appropriations bill, which fully funds the Department of Homeland Security and includes the law enforcement priorities that were agreed to on a bipartisan basis in the House. It is indeed a clean bill. The House of Representatives has voted to fund fully homeland security, as the President has requested. Now, it is not a perfect bill. Republicans and Democrats and individuals on both sides have different priorities on some matters, but they did come to an agreement to fund all of the programs of the Department of Homeland Security and on how much they were funded-- activities and actions that are authorized, however, by the laws of the United States. So this bill will not deny a penny of funding. In fact, it says: Mr. President, spend the money on enforcing and following the law. Spend the money on enforcing the Immigration and Nationality Act as passed by Congress--that is the law of the United States of America. Spend the money to let our law enforcement officers carry out their duties as prescribed by the laws. Yet our Democratic colleagues say they are going to block this bill-- that they will all stick together and not even let it come to the floor of the Senate. Why? Why would they do that? Because, they say, they want to give the President the funds, apparently, to spend on his unconstitutional and unlawful Executive amnesty. They will not allow the bill to even be voted on, and without a vote in the Senate, the funding for Homeland Security does not go forward. They are not going to allow it to be voted on because they want to protect the President in his assertion of an unconstitutional and illegal power to order duly-constituted enforcement officers of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security to carry out unlawful activity. The President is not entitled to spend taxpayer dollars to implement a system of immigration that Congress--representing the American people's wishes, let me add--rejected just last year. Surely our Democratic colleagues will not block the Senate from proceeding to this bill to fund the Department of Homeland Security. If they are unhappy with the language of the bill of the House of Representatives, if they think the President wrongfully or rightfully, using legitimate powers, could direct them to provide Social Security numbers, Medicare participation, earned income tax credit money from the Federal Government and the right to work in the United States when the law says they are not entitled to be employed in the United States, then they can offer an amendment to the bill and bring it up on the floor of the Senate to strike that language if they think it is so bad. Of course, if you think about it, that would be a stunning event; would it not be--the Senate taking language from a bill or striking language from a bill that restores the separation of powers as properly understood by the Framers and preventing the President from violating law and the constitution. They are going to vote against that? Maybe that is why they choose not to have this bill go forward. Maybe they do not want to confront the issue. I am going to quote Senator Reid in a moment because he said we ought to confront the issue square-on. All right, let's do so. I suspect Senator Reid, though, and his team are not so interested in having votes and being held accountable for their votes. Our colleagues would have the right to offer amendments. Senator McConnell is allowing amendments. He is going out of his way to allow amendments and changing the terrible state the Senate had found itself in under the leadership of Senator Reid. Consistent with the rules of the Senate, those amendments can be brought up, and a motion to strike this language is certainly appropriate. It is an untenable position--untenable constitutionally, untenable because it is contrary to the will of the Members of the House and Senate who oppose the President's action--Republicans and Democrats. Perhaps most importantly, it is untenable politically because the American people strongly reject it. So why would any Senator--Democrat or Republican--when the very integrity of the Congress is under assault by an overreaching executive branch, not want to assert congressional authority at this point? We are coequal branches of government, and the President does not have the authority to enforce a law that was never passed--indeed, a law that was explicitly rejected by the Congress of the United States-- and grant amnesty to people who are unlawfully here, provide them work authorizations, a photo ID allowing them to apply for any job in America, with Social Security numbers and the right to participate in Social Security and Medicare. That is what the President's actions are going to do. This is not prosecutorial discretion--nowhere close to prosecutorial discretion. It is an Executive fiat. It is an imperial act. As the President himself said repeatedly: I am not a king; I am not an emperor. When dealing with this very issue, he told people over a period of years--20 times--that he did not have the power to do this. But then he changed his mind. Under pressure from certain political interest groups and because he couldn't get Congress to vote for the bill he wanted, he just decided to do it on his own. This is an unthinkable overreach. It is a matter of great national importance. The American people were engaged in this. They were following this issue. The President couldn't get the constitutional process to give him the power he wanted, so he just did it anyway. Why can't it be stopped? I get asked that. What is the matter with you people in Congress? Well, we had seven Members on the Democratic side of the aisle, still in this Senate today, who said the President overreached. They said he shouldn't have done this, and it should have been done by the legislature, by the Congress, not by the President. Yet are all seven of them going to vote with Senator Reid and become part of [[Page S704]] the palace guard that protects the President in his unlawful act so the President can't be challenged? That is what it amounts to. There is no doubt about it. That is precisely what it amounts to--a palace guard circling around the White House to protect the President, even though Members of this Senate have said he overreached and what he did was wrong. They are, apparently, going to continue to vote for it. Out of what--party loyalty? Out of loyalty to Senator Reid, the minority leader in the Senate? Well, they say--and the media even is saying sometimes--Democrats and others are sometimes saying that the bill contains controversial new immigration riders, and therefore, it ought to be blocked. It contains unconstitutional or controversial new immigration riders, and that is bad. That is why it ought to be blocked. What new policy is in the bill? What new expenditure is in the bill that is not consistent with the laws of the United States? Not one. The bill passed by the House carries out the essential functions in the normal orderly way of Homeland Security. It doesn't add any pork, and it doesn't add any special expenditures for some controversial project. It doesn't do any of that. So if the President says that he will deploy his Border Patrol officers--no longer at the Mexican border where we have large flows of illegal labor--to Montana or Maine, where we have very few people, in effect, he is saying we are no longer going to enforce the border there or even attempt to, and he is going to reassign them. He is saying: I am the President. They work for me. I can do such things. Well, would it be a controversial rider for the Senate, or for the House of Representatives, to say no, we prohibit funds to do that? We are going to fund the officers' duty at the border with our Mexican neighbors where they need to be. The point is who is creating the controversy--not the House of Representatives. It is the President of the United States. He has overreached, without any doubt, and the situation is very grave. What if the next President of the United States decides to do something else? Senator Cruz, at the hearing for the Attorney General nominee, Ms. Lynch, asked her: What if Mr. Cornyn--whom he was sitting by, at the time, the Senator from Texas--were President and he didn't like certain labor laws that applied to people in Texas and he told his bureaucrats--who in effect work for the President of the United States--don't enforce labor laws in Texas? So Senator Cruz asked the nominee, Loretta Lynch, who wants to be Attorney General of the United States of America, whether under President Obama's Executive amnesty theory, the next President could do that and bar the enforcement of labor laws in the State of Texas. She said she would have to review it. She wasn't sure. Of course that is blatantly unconstitutional. It shouldn't have taken her 5 seconds to say of course a President can't do that. Have we gotten such a confused understanding of law in America that we are at that point that universal laws of labor are subject to the whim of a President of the United States, and even the Attorney General will not say it is wrong and even the Congress will not say no to the President on this? Well, the House did say no. They passed a perfectly responsible funding bill for Homeland Security. They said: We are not going to allow you to spend money to advocate a policy which we have rejected-- which they can do just that way: We don't like this action. We are not going to fund this action. The Executive of this country--the President--cannot act on it if he is prevented from spending money on it. It goes to the very core of the legislative process. It is what the American Revolution was about. It is what happened in England. They wrested this power from the King, and we adopted it in terms of the President and put the power in Congress. They had the power in Parliament. It is a big deal. I don't think we are at a point where we need to back down on this. It is not an overreach. Those great leaders, some at Homeland Security, so confident in their wisdom and policy ideas, having forgotten what the rule of law is, suggest that Congress should just roll over and forget it and go on and let it happen and not be controversial by standing up to it. Now, look. I like Senator Reid. We battle a lot. He is pugnacious, as this Politico article said, but I can live with that. I am glad he is back and I hope he is doing better and I hope he recovers fully, and I am confident he will. A Politico article by Mr. Burgess Everett earlier today quoted Senator Reid as saying: Why should we be dealing with issues that have nothing to do with homeland security? Nothing to do with homeland security, Senator Reid said. If my Republican colleagues have some problems with something the President has done on immigration, for example, hit it head on. Don't hide it in homeland security. Well, the problem is Homeland Security. The President has directed the officials of Homeland Security to take money that has been authorized and appropriated for them to enforce the immigration laws of this country and to use those funds to carry out a scheme Congress has rejected. Under the laws of the United States it is illegal to hire somebody unlawfully in the country. There is no doubt about that. People unlawfully in the country are not entitled to participate in Social Security or Medicare. How could it be otherwise? So he told the Homeland Security officials to create a new office, a new building across the river in Crystal City. He directed them to hire 1,000 new employees to process applications under his Executive amnesty, a policy Congress rejected. It is breathtaking. It is going to cost tens of millions of dollars just for that one office. That just begins to suggest how much money will have to be spent to execute his vision for immigration that the American people rejected. So how do we deal with it directly? How do we hit it on the head openly and directly? The Congress has the power of the purse. No money can be spent by this President that Congress hasn't authorized. So the House discussed this. They went into some detail about it, worked at it for some time, and the House decided they would not fund this action that contradicted laws they passed and execute a policy they didn't agree with. I think that is confronting it head on--no doubt about that--and it absolutely deals with homeland security. My goodness. So this is the kind of logic and weak arguments that are being put forth here. We will talk about a lot of things as we go forward with this debate that evidences the bankruptcy of the policies carried out by this administration. One of the things that came out today as part of the President's budget was his assumption that if his immigration policies are passed, we would save lots of money for the U.S. Treasury. Why would it save money? It would save money because we would collect more Social Security benefits, and this would create more revenue for the government and put us in a sound position to help balance the budget. We are not going to balance the budget. We are not going to come close to it, but he said a substantial amount of money would come from it. Colleagues, we have to understand what a misrepresentation of colossal enormity is at stake in that statement. Everybody knows Social Security and Medicare are on unsustainable financial courses. Anybody who knows anything about Medicare and Social Security knows the fundamental problem is people are not putting in enough money to take care of those who retire, and so the flow is not enough. Over time it is going to get worse. We are just now beginning to go into deficit for Social Security. The disability portion is in critical shape. It is in very bad shape, but what this calculation is based on is the next 10 years. So it says we will have more income in the next 10 years, and that may be so. But every person who goes on Social Security today--and even more so in the future--are, under law, projected to take out more than they put in plus interest. So obviously add 5 million new people to the Social Security rolls and no change in the amount of money that they pay in, they make the long-term strength of Social Security even more weak. It makes the hole even deeper that we have to dig our way out of. There is no other way to analyze it. [[Page S705]] It is just unbelievable to me that they would make such a statement. Those of us in the Congress need to be thinking about the long-term financial course of America. We need to be trying to put not just short-term benefits here so Congress can spend more money, but also we need to be thinking about how to place this country on a sound long- term path. Adding more people to Social Security--particularly lower income people as most of these are, who will draw out even more than the higher income people draw out as a percentage on the basis of what they paid in--is not a way to save Social Security. In a December 1, 2014 article in Investor's Business Daily entitled, ``Obama's Amnesty will create a Fiscal Nightmare for Entitlements,'' Merrill Matthews, resident scholar at the Institute for Policy Innovation, and Mark E. Litow, retired actuary and past chairman of the Social Insurance Public Finance Section of the Society of Actuaries, wrote this: Obama's amnesty action greatly exacerbates the problem, because retirees get back far more than they pay in. That is as plain and as simple as daylight following dark. They go on to write: But millions of Obama's newly legalized are working-age adults with children, so many could be in their 40s or older. Thus, they could pay FICA taxes for the next, say, 15 or 20 years--less than the average American worker--and be eligible for the full array of Social Security and Medicare benefits. This is going to be devastating to Social Security and Medicare. It is going to hammer those programs. It is going to make it harder for us to save them, which we have an obligation to do. There is no obligation to give Social Security and Medicare to persons who enter the United States unlawfully. People aren't entitled to come into the country unlawfully and demand the benefits of the country. The first thing we should do to confront unlawful immigration is not to subsidize it with taxpayer money. The article goes on to say: Using a basic simulation model, we believe the government will receive about $500 billion in payroll tax revenue (including Part B and drug premiums) and expect it to pay out some $2 trillion in benefits over several decades. So they pay in $500 billion, but we are going to pay out $2 trillion--four times as much. How does this make America more financially stable? On December 4 of last year, in an article in the Atlantic magazine entitled ``The Cost of Amnesty,'' senior editor David Frum wrote this: In the 2011 tax year, the average EITC payment to a family with children was $2,905, according to the Center for Budget and Policy Priorities. The Additional Child Tax Credit works in much the same way, paying an average of $1,800 to qualifying households. Earned-income tax credit--that sounds like some sort of deduction you might have, but it is not. So many of the persons who will be given this legal status will be eligible for the earned-income tax credit because they have a family--presumably--that is what the President tells us; these are for families--and their income is at a rate that entitles them to draw earned-income tax credit. But go to the budget of the United States of America and how the Congressional Budget Office calculates this--they don't calculate earned-income tax credit as some sort of tax deduction. They calculate it as an expenditure of the United States of America, and it absolutely is. The way it works is your income is so low you have a family of such that you don't owe any income tax, and they send you a credit and they call it an earned-income tax credit, and a tax credit is a cash payment to you. It looks something like a tax matter, but it is really a direct check from the United States of America to lower-income families. So this is going to be qualifying for large numbers of people that will be given a legal status. Citing the Center for Immigration Studies, Mr. Frum in the Atlantic article explains: About 14.5 percent of the native-born population of the United States earns little enough to qualify for the EITC. Almost twice as great a portion of the total immigrant population, 29.7 percent, qualifies. But the specific immigrant groups most likely to benefit from the President's actions earned even less. So you have, on a percentage basis, twice as many in the immigrant population eligible for EITC as the average native-born American would be to qualify to receive that check from the United States. Mr. Frum goes on to say, ``The EITC will cost a shade over $70 billion in fiscal year 2015.'' That is a lot of money--$70 billion. A Federal highway bill is $40 billion, moving up to $50 billion. This is $70 billion. The refundable portion of the child tax credit will cost about $33 billion. That's $100 billion in total. Together, they cost 10 times as much as traditional cash welfare. Soon they will cost much, much more. He goes on to note: Quaintly enough, U.S. immigration law still forbids the president to grant residency to aliens likely to become ``a public charge.'' The list of exceptions, however, overwhelms the rule. Here are the benefits that are ``not intended for income maintenance'' and therefore exempt, according to the Citizenship and Immigration Services. . . . And they list a whole lot of taxes. Well, I just want to wrap up by saying the House of Representatives can do time and order, pass the bill that fully funds the United States, and it does not contain riders and it does not contain pork spending. Well, maybe it contains it, but it is not being complained about at this time, and it is before the Senate. To fund the Department of Homeland Security the Senate has to pass the same bill with the same expenditures to do so. So all we have to do is fund the Department of Homeland Security but not approve the President's desire to transmit funds in Homeland Security to an illegal, unlawful policy of amnesty that Congress opposes and the American people oppose. Who do we represent? Since 2009, we learned today, the Obama administration issued 5.5 million extra work permits--double the normal expected flow by over almost a million a year. We understood it to be 700,000. Now we understand there are so many more that have not been calculated in the numbers. His Executive amnesty will issue 5 million more. Since 2009 family incomes are down $4,000. There is no doubt about it, colleagues, that this incredibly large flow of immigrants into America exceeds the ability of the American economy to absorb them. It is pulling down wages. It is moving people out of the workplace. It is making it very difficult for lawful immigrants to get jobs in America because there will always be a new group coming in willing to work for less. It is eroding the middle class and middle-class values. So we are going to talk about this as we go forward. I believe this country will continue to be a nation that allows immigration. We don't dislike or hate or demean people that want to come to America and work here. But we need to send a clear message: If you are not coming lawfully, don't come. And if you come unlawfully, you are not going to be given amnesty. You are not going to be given Social Security, Medicare, earned income tax credits, and the right to go to any hospital in America and demand health care. We are just not going to do that. If we do that with clarity, colleagues, what will happen? The people who are coming here unlawfully will stop coming. The numbers will fall dramatically, and we will be in a position, then, to reestablish a lawful system of immigration that the American people have pleaded with us to establish--one that we can be proud of, that is just and fair where people apply and wait their turn and are accepted or not accepted based on the merits. If we do that, we will have served the American people with what they have asked us to do. I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor. ____________________",package_114_256.csv,22673,22673,22742,"[congressional record volume 161, number 17 (monday, february 2, 2015)] [senate] [pages s703-s705] from the congressional record online through the government publishing office [ www.gpo.gov ] department of homeland security funding mr. sessions. mr. president, tomorrow we will vote on whether to proceed to the department of homeland security appropriations bill, which fully funds the department of homeland security and includes the law enforcement priorities that were agreed to on a bipartisan basis in the house. it is indeed a clean bill. the house of representatives has voted to fund fully homeland security, as the president has requested. now, it is not a perfect bill. republicans and democrats and individuals on both sides have different priorities on some matters, but they did come to an agreement to fund all of the programs of the department of homeland security and on how much they were funded-- activities and actions that are authorized, however, by the laws of the united states. so this bill will not deny a penny of funding. in fact, it says: mr. president, spend the money on enforcing and following the law. spend the money on enforcing the immigration and nationality act as passed by congress--that is the law of the united states of america. spend the money to let our law enforcement officers carry out their duties as prescribed by the laws. yet our democratic colleagues say they are going to block this bill-- that they will all stick together and not even let it come to the floor of the senate. why? why would they do that? because, they say, they want to give the president the funds, apparently, to spend on his unconstitutional and unlawful executive amnesty. they will not allow the bill to even be voted on, and without a vote in the senate, the funding for homeland security does not go forward. they are not going to allow it to be voted on because they want to protect the president in his assertion of an unconstitutional and illegal power to order duly-constituted enforcement officers of the u.s. department of homeland security to carry out unlawful activity. the president is not entitled to spend taxpayer dollars to implement a system of immigration that congress--representing the american people's wishes, let me add--rejected just last year. surely our democratic colleagues will not block the senate from proceeding to this bill to fund the department of homeland security. if they are unhappy with the language of the bill of the house of representatives, if they think the president wrongfully or rightfully, using legitimate powers, could direct them to provide social security numbers, medicare participation, earned income tax credit money from the federal government and the right to work in the united states when the law says they are not entitled to be employed in the united states, then they can offer an amendment to the bill and bring it up on the floor of the senate to strike that language if they think it is so bad. of course, if you think about it, that would be a stunning event; would it not be--the senate taking language from a bill or striking language from a bill that restores the separation of powers as properly understood by the framers and preventing the president from violating law and the constitution. they are going to vote against that? maybe that is why they choose not to have this bill go forward. maybe they do not want to confront the issue. i am going to quote senator reid in a moment because he said we ought to confront the issue square-on. all right, let's do so. i suspect senator reid, though, and his team are not so interested in having votes and being held accountable for their votes. our colleagues would have the right to offer amendments. senator mcconnell is allowing amendments. he is going out of his way to allow amendments and changing the terrible state the senate had found itself in under the leadership of senator reid. consistent with the rules of the senate, those amendments can be brought up, and a motion to strike this language is certainly appropriate. it is an untenable position--untenable constitutionally, untenable because it is contrary to the will of the members of the house and senate who oppose the president's action--republicans and democrats. perhaps most importantly, it is untenable politically because the american people strongly reject it. so why would any senator--democrat or republican--when the very integrity of the congress is under assault by an overreaching executive branch, not want to assert congressional authority at this point? we are coequal branches of government, and the president does not have the authority to enforce a law that was never passed--indeed, a law that was explicitly rejected by the congress of the united states-- and grant amnesty to people who are unlawfully here, provide them work authorizations, a photo id allowing them to apply for any job in america, with social security numbers and the right to participate in social security and medicare. that is what the president's actions are going to do. this is not prosecutorial discretion--nowhere close to prosecutorial discretion. it is an executive fiat. it is an imperial act. as the president himself said repeatedly: i am not a king; i am not an emperor. when dealing with this very issue, he told people over a period of years--20 times--that he did not have the power to do this. but then he changed his mind. under pressure from certain political interest groups and because he couldn't get congress to vote for the bill he wanted, he just decided to do it on his own. this is an unthinkable overreach. it is a matter of great national importance. the american people were engaged in this. they were following this issue. the president couldn't get the constitutional process to give him the power he wanted, so he just did it anyway. why can't it be stopped? i get asked that. what is the matter with you people in congress? well, we had seven members on the democratic side of the aisle, still in this senate today, who said the president overreached. they said he shouldn't have done this, and it should have been done by the legislature, by the congress, not by the president. yet are all seven of them going to vote with senator reid and become part of [[page s704]] the palace guard that protects the president in his unlawful act so the president can't be challenged? that is what it amounts to. there is no doubt about it. that is precisely what it amounts to--a palace guard circling around the white house to protect the president, even though members of this senate have said he overreached and what he did was wrong. they are, apparently, going to continue to vote for it. out of what--party loyalty? out of loyalty to senator reid, the minority leader in the senate? well, they say--and the media even is saying sometimes--democrats and others are sometimes saying that the bill contains controversial new immigration riders, and therefore, it ought to be blocked. it contains unconstitutional or controversial new immigration riders, and that is bad. that is why it ought to be blocked. what new policy is in the bill? what new expenditure is in the bill that is not consistent with the laws of the united states? not one. the bill passed by the house carries out the essential functions in the normal orderly way of homeland security. it doesn't add any pork, and it doesn't add any special expenditures for some controversial project. it doesn't do any of that. so if the president says that he will deploy his border patrol officers--no longer at the mexican border where we have large flows of illegal labor--to montana or maine, where we have very few people, in effect, he is saying we are no longer going to enforce the border there or even attempt to, and he is going to reassign them. he is saying: i am the president. they work for me. i can do such things. well, would it be a controversial rider for the senate, or for the house of representatives, to say no, we prohibit funds to do that? we are going to fund the officers' duty at the border with our mexican neighbors where they need to be. the point is who is creating the controversy--not the house of representatives. it is the president of the united states. he has overreached, without any doubt, and the situation is very grave. what if the next president of the united states decides to do something else? senator cruz, at the hearing for the attorney general nominee, ms. lynch, asked her: what if mr. cornyn--whom he was sitting by, at the time, the senator from texas--were president and he didn't like certain labor laws that applied to people in texas and he told his bureaucrats--who in effect work for the president of the united states--don't enforce labor laws in texas? so senator cruz asked the nominee, loretta lynch, who wants to be attorney general of the united states of america, whether under president obama's executive amnesty theory, the next president could do that and bar the enforcement of labor laws in the state of texas. she said she would have to review it. she wasn't sure. of course that is blatantly unconstitutional. it shouldn't have taken her 5 seconds to say of course a president can't do that. have we gotten such a confused understanding of law in america that we are at that point that universal laws of labor are subject to the whim of a president of the united states, and even the attorney general will not say it is wrong and even the congress will not say no to the president on this? well, the house did say no. they passed a perfectly responsible funding bill for homeland security. they said: we are not going to allow you to spend money to advocate a policy which we have rejected-- which they can do just that way: we don't like this action. we are not going to fund this action. the executive of this country--the president--cannot act on it if he is prevented from spending money on it. it goes to the very core of the legislative process. it is what the american revolution was about. it is what happened in england. they wrested this power from the king, and we adopted it in terms of the president and put the power in congress. they had the power in parliament. it is a big deal. i don't think we are at a point where we need to back down on this. it is not an overreach. those great leaders, some at homeland security, so confident in their wisdom and policy ideas, having forgotten what the rule of law is, suggest that congress should just roll over and forget it and go on and let it happen and not be controversial by standing up to it. now, look. i like senator reid. we battle a lot. he is pugnacious, as this politico article said, but i can live with that. i am glad he is back and i hope he is doing better and i hope he recovers fully, and i am confident he will. a politico article by mr. burgess everett earlier today quoted senator reid as saying: why should we be dealing with issues that have nothing to do with homeland security? nothing to do with homeland security, senator reid said. if my republican colleagues have some problems with something the president has done on immigration, for example, hit it head on. don't hide it in homeland security. well, the problem is homeland security. the president has directed the officials of homeland security to take money that has been authorized and appropriated for them to enforce the immigration laws of this country and to use those funds to carry out a scheme congress has rejected. under the laws of the united states it is illegal to hire somebody unlawfully in the country. there is no doubt about that. people unlawfully in the country are not entitled to participate in social security or medicare. how could it be otherwise? so he told the homeland security officials to create a new office, a new building across the river in crystal city. he directed them to hire 1,000 new employees to process applications under his executive amnesty, a policy congress rejected. it is breathtaking. it is going to cost tens of millions of dollars just for that one office. that just begins to suggest how much money will have to be spent to execute his vision for immigration that the american people rejected. so how do we deal with it directly? how do we hit it on the head openly and directly? the congress has the power of the purse. no money can be spent by this president that congress hasn't authorized. so the house discussed this. they went into some detail about it, worked at it for some time, and the house decided they would not fund this action that contradicted laws they passed and execute a policy they didn't agree with. i think that is confronting it head on--no doubt about that--and it absolutely deals with homeland security. my goodness. so this is the kind of logic and weak arguments that are being put forth here. we will talk about a lot of things as we go forward with this debate that evidences the bankruptcy of the policies carried out by this administration. one of the things that came out today as part of the president's budget was his assumption that if his immigration policies are passed, we would save lots of money for the u.s. treasury. why would it save money? it would save money because we would collect more social security benefits, and this would create more revenue for the government and put us in a sound position to help balance the budget. we are not going to balance the budget. we are not going to come close to it, but he said a substantial amount of money would come from it. colleagues, we have to understand what a misrepresentation of colossal enormity is at stake in that statement. everybody knows social security and medicare are on unsustainable financial courses. anybody who knows anything about medicare and social security knows the fundamental problem is people are not putting in enough money to take care of those who retire, and so the flow is not enough. over time it is going to get worse. we are just now beginning to go into deficit for social security. the disability portion is in critical shape. it is in very bad shape, but what this calculation is based on is the next 10 years. so it says we will have more income in the next 10 years, and that may be so. but every person who goes on social security today--and even more so in the future--are, under law, projected to take out more than they put in plus interest. so obviously add 5 million new people to the social security rolls and no change in the amount of money that they pay in, they make the long-term strength of social security even more weak. it makes the hole even deeper that we have to dig our way out of. there is no other way to analyze it. [[page s705]] it is just unbelievable to me that they would make such a statement. those of us in the congress need to be thinking about the long-term financial course of america. we need to be trying to put not just short-term benefits here so congress can spend more money, but also we need to be thinking about how to place this country on a sound long- term path. adding more people to social security--particularly lower income people as most of these are, who will draw out even more than the higher income people draw out as a percentage on the basis of what they paid in--is not a way to save social security. in a december 1, 2014 article in investor's business daily entitled, ``obama's amnesty will create a fiscal nightmare for entitlements,'' merrill matthews, resident scholar at the institute for policy innovation, and mark e. litow, retired actuary and past chairman of the social insurance public finance section of the society of actuaries, wrote this: obama's amnesty action greatly exacerbates the problem, because retirees get back far more than they pay in. that is as plain and as simple as daylight following dark. they go on to write: but millions of obama's newly legalized are working-age adults with children, so many could be in their 40s or older. thus, they could pay fica taxes for the next, say, 15 or 20 years--less than the average american worker--and be eligible for the full array of social security and medicare benefits. this is going to be devastating to social security and medicare. it is going to hammer those programs. it is going to make it harder for us to save them, which we have an obligation to do. there is no obligation to give social security and medicare to persons who enter the united states unlawfully. people aren't entitled to come into the country unlawfully and demand the benefits of the country. the first thing we should do to confront unlawful immigration is not to subsidize it with taxpayer money. the article goes on to say: using a basic simulation model, we believe the government will receive about $500 billion in payroll tax revenue (including part b and drug premiums) and expect it to pay out some $2 trillion in benefits over several decades. so they pay in $500 billion, but we are going to pay out $2 trillion--four times as much. how does this make america more financially stable? on december 4 of last year, in an article in the atlantic magazine entitled ``the cost of amnesty,'' senior editor david frum wrote this: in the 2011 tax year, the average eitc payment to a family with children was $2,905, according to the center for budget and policy priorities. the additional child tax credit works in much the same way, paying an average of $1,800 to qualifying households. earned-income tax credit--that sounds like some sort of deduction you might have, but it is not. so many of the persons who will be given this legal status will be eligible for the earned-income tax credit because they have a family--presumably--that is what the president tells us; these are for families--and their income is at a rate that entitles them to draw earned-income tax credit. but go to the budget of the united states of america and how the congressional budget office calculates this--they don't calculate earned-income tax credit as some sort of tax deduction. they calculate it as an expenditure of the united states of america, and it absolutely is. the way it works is your income is so low you have a family of such that you don't owe any income tax, and they send you a credit and they call it an earned-income tax credit, and a tax credit is a cash payment to you. it looks something like a tax matter, but it is really a direct check from the united states of america to lower-income families. so this is going to be qualifying for large numbers of people that will be given a legal status. citing the center for immigration studies, mr. frum in the atlantic article explains: about 14.5 percent of the native-born population of the united states earns little enough to qualify for the eitc. almost twice as great a portion of the total immigrant population, 29.7 percent, qualifies. but the specific immigrant groups most likely to benefit from the president's actions earned even less. so you have, on a percentage basis, twice as many in the immigrant population eligible for eitc as the average native-born american would be to qualify to receive that check from the united states. mr. frum goes on to say, ``the eitc will cost a shade over $70 billion in fiscal year 2015.'' that is a lot of money--$70 billion. a federal highway bill is $40 billion, moving up to $50 billion. this is $70 billion. the refundable portion of the child tax credit will cost about $33 billion. that's $100 billion in total. together, they cost 10 times as much as traditional cash welfare. soon they will cost much, much more. he goes on to note: quaintly enough, u.s. immigration law still forbids the president to grant residency to aliens likely to become ``a public charge.'' the list of exceptions, however, overwhelms the rule. here are the benefits that are ``not intended for income maintenance'' and therefore exempt, according to the citizenship and immigration services. . . . and they list a whole lot of taxes. well, i just want to wrap up by saying the house of representatives can do time and order, pass the bill that fully funds the united states, and it does not contain riders and it does not contain pork spending. well, maybe it contains it, but it is not being complained about at this time, and it is before the senate. to fund the department of homeland security the senate has to pass the same bill with the same expenditures to do so. so all we have to do is fund the department of homeland security but not approve the president's desire to transmit funds in homeland security to an illegal, unlawful policy of amnesty that congress opposes and the american people oppose. who do we represent? since 2009, we learned today, the obama administration issued 5.5 million extra work permits--double the normal expected flow by over almost a million a year. we understood it to be 700,000. now we understand there are so many more that have not been calculated in the numbers. his executive amnesty will issue 5 million more. since 2009 family incomes are down $4,000. there is no doubt about it, colleagues, that this incredibly large flow of immigrants into america exceeds the ability of the american economy to absorb them. it is pulling down wages. it is moving people out of the workplace. it is making it very difficult for lawful immigrants to get jobs in america because there will always be a new group coming in willing to work for less. it is eroding the middle class and middle-class values. so we are going to talk about this as we go forward. i believe this country will continue to be a nation that allows immigration. we don't dislike or hate or demean people that want to come to america and work here. but we need to send a clear message: if you are not coming lawfully, don't come. and if you come unlawfully, you are not going to be given amnesty. you are not going to be given social security, medicare, earned income tax credits, and the right to go to any hospital in america and demand health care. we are just not going to do that. if we do that with clarity, colleagues, what will happen? the people who are coming here unlawfully will stop coming. the numbers will fall dramatically, and we will be in a position, then, to reestablish a lawful system of immigration that the american people have pleaded with us to establish--one that we can be proud of, that is just and fair where people apply and wait their turn and are accepted or not accepted based on the merits. if we do that, we will have served the american people with what they have asked us to do. i thank the chair, and i yield the floor. ____________________",22673

PETER J. VISCLOSKY of indiana in the house of representatives Monday, February 2, 2015 Mr. VISCLOSKY. Mr. Speaker, it is with great respect and sincere admiration that I rise today to celebrate Black History Month and its 2015 theme--A Century of Black Life, History, and Culture. This year's theme reflects on the extraordinary contributions of African Americans in the arts, literature, music, history, sports, science, and pop culture. In celebration of this year's theme, we reflect on several of the important milestones that helped form the cornerstone of African American culture and tradition. Part of the African American fight for freedom included the struggle to ensure that their ideas and talents mattered in American culture and history. In the 20th century, the rise of jazz music can be linked to African Americans of the post World War I generation.

In celebration of this year's theme, we reflect on several of the important milestones that helped form the cornerstone of African American culture and tradition. Part of the African American fight for freedom included the struggle to ensure that their ideas and talents mattered in American culture and history.

JERROLD NADLER of new york in the house of representatives Monday, February 2, 2015 Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, I rise to join the people of New York's tenth congressional district in recognition of Barnard College for 125 years of dedication and commitment to providing a rigorous liberal arts education to talented women from all over the world. On October 26, 2014, Barnard opened its campus to the community, and the entire City of New York, in celebration of its 125th anniversary, sharing the ``Barnard experience'' with all who visit. In 125 years of education and service, Barnard has established an incomparable legacy and has become an integral part of its community, as well as the entire city beyond its historic Morningside Heights campus. Since its founding in 1889, the College has produced many distinguished alumni who have gone on to be leaders in nearly every field of endeavor. Today's students are following in their footsteps by impacting not just their campus or New York City, but the entire world. In commemoration of the 125th anniversary, the Barnard women have again chosen outreach as their most important message and have pledged to perform 125 Days of Service in New York City and beyond. Over the years, I have been proud to work with the College in some of its many pursuits of supporting and developing collaborations between the College and many on- and off-campus constituencies. Through these efforts, Barnard has made a positive impact throughout the city, particularly in the Morningside Heights and Harlem communities. Barnard participates in numerous community partnerships and initiatives, both through [[Page E142]] annual contributions as well as organizing volunteer opportunities with local organizations like Morningside-Area Alliance, Community Impact, the Friends of Morningside Park, the Friends of Riverside Park, and the Broadway Mall Group. It has also worked to provide educational opportunities to young people in its community, working together with groups like St. John the Divine's ACT summer camp program, Tompkins Hall, and the Learning Center. And through an annual bike-a-thon, it raises funds for Columbia Community Service, with donations and participation increasing every year. In addition to its foundational commitment of educating promising young women, the College has historically reached out to those students who may be otherwise hindered by a lack of access to opportunities, which I commend. This has resulted in a diverse and inclusive student body, faculty, and staff. For all this and more, I would like to honor Barnard College for 125 years of significant and enduring contributions to the civic life of our community and the scholarship of our Nation. I wish the College the best of luck in its future endeavors, as I know it will continue to impact the lives of its students and its fellow community members throughout New York City and the world. I ask my colleagues to please join me in recognizing Barnard College's efforts. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 17 (Monday, February 2, 2015)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Pages E141-E142] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] BARNARD COLLEGE FOUNDERS DAY--125TH ANNIVERSARY ______ HON.

Mr. Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to Robert ``Bob'' Craves, who recently passed away at the age of 72. I would like to honor Bob Craves, a founding officer of Costco, for his support of students throughout Washington state in their pursuit of a college degree. In 2000, Mr. Craves started the College Success Foundation, which provides scholarships and mentoring to low-income and first-generation Washington students. Mr. Craves served as CEO of the foundation until his retirement in 2013, and thereafter remained with the organization as a member of the Board of Directors. His efforts to make higher education accessible were not isolated to Washington state. The foundation estimates that 5,000 students across the country are currently enrolled in college due to the generosity of Craves' work. The organization has raised an estimated $600 million, and now includes a branch in Washington, DC. Scholarship recipients continue to vocally express the meaningful impact Mr. Craves had on their lives by providing them with the opportunity to attend college. Several have gone back to work with the non-profit upon graduation to offer career training services and help graduates find jobs. I would like to commemorate Bob Craves on his lifetime of achievements. He will be remembered by his uplifting demeanor and unfailing optimism, and as a committed community servant whose significant work will continue to echo in years to come. My thoughts go out to his wife, Gerry, and all of his family and friends. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 17 (Monday, February 2, 2015)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E142] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] COMMEMORATING THE LIFE OF MR.

FORREST WELLS--RECIPIENT OF THE BRONZE STAR MEDAL (POSTHUMOUS) ______ HON. SCOTT DesJARLAIS of tennessee in the house of representatives Monday, February 2, 2015 Mr. DesJARLAIS. Mr. Speaker, it is with great pride that I rise today to honor the life and service of Private First Class (PFC) Forrest Wells upon his receipt of the Bronze Star Medal. PFC Wells landed on the shores of Normandy in June of 1944, as a member of the 113th Field Artillery of the 30th Infantry Division, nicknamed ``Old Hickory.'' During their deployment to Europe, the 30th Infantry Division assisted in the liberation of Saint-Lo, fought off the German counter- attack at Mortain, was the first infantry division to enter Belgium and the Netherlands, and was instrumental in halting the German offensive near Malmedy during the ``Battle of the Bulge.'' On July 29, 1944, while serving as a member of a gun section outside of Hebecrevon, France, PFC Wells' battery was subjected to a heavy aerial attack. During this bombardment, the gunpowder surrounding one of the units 155 mm howitzers was set ablaze. Without hesitation, PFC Wells left his sheltered position and rushed over to extinguish the flames, thereby eliminating the danger it posed to his fellow soldiers and saving valuable materials from destruction. In recognition of his service, Brigadier General James M Lewis, Commanding Officer 30th Infantry Division, awarded PFC Wells with a certificate of merit in the days following the incident. More than 70 years later, the United States Army, by order of the Secretary of the Army, announced that PFC Forrest Wells would posthumously receive the Bronze Star Medal for meritorious achievement in active ground combat. Long overdue, this recognition is certainly well-deserved and is a testament to the heroism and dedication to duty that marked PFC Wells' exemplary service during World War II. I wish to extend to the Wells family my sincere congratulations upon receiving this award, as well as my heartfelt thanks for Private Wells' outstanding service to our great country. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 17 (Monday, February 2, 2015)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E142] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] TRIBUTE TO MR.

Mr. Speaker, I would like to commemorate the opening of BayCare Health System's St. Joseph's Hospital-South in Riverview, Florida. This $225 million project will forever change healthcare in South Hillsborough County, and I am excited to see the positive impact the hospital will have on the Riverview community. Community-owned BayCare Health System consistently upholds a standard of excellence in Florida. From private rooms with full bathrooms and in-room family areas to patient entertainment centers and Internet access, St. Joseph's-South is bringing the newest innovations in healthcare to South Hillsborough County.

Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the work of the Bravo 369 Flight Foundation and their current project, ``Warplanes to Siberia.'' Additionally, I want to recognize the efforts of the project's co-founders, Craig Lang and Jeff Geer. Mr. Geer, who serves as the President and Chairman of the Bravo 369 Flight Foundation, will pilot his own plane as part of the project. I applaud their work to educate and inspire the next generation of aviation enthusiasts. ``Warplanes to Siberia'' is a historical re-creation of the Alaska- Siberia air route (ALSIB) with both American and Russian pilots flying together in formation to celebrate the end of World War II. It will commence in 2015 and follow the exact flight route from Great Falls, Montana to Krasnoyarsk to Moscow, flying the same types of aircraft used 70 years ago. The project is intended to pay tribute to the men and women of the United States, Russia, and Canada who were involved in this effort during the war, and to bring awareness to the significance of their work. The Alaska-Siberia air route was used to deliver warplanes to the Eastern Front of the war effort as part of President Roosevelt's Lend- Lease policy, and contributed to the success of the Allies in World War II. The re-creation of the flight route will be documented for educational and broadcasting purposes, and accompanied with school, airport, and museum visits.

CHRIS VAN HOLLEN of maryland in the house of representatives Wednesday, January 28, 2015 Mr. VAN HOLLEN. Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to H.R. 351, which would create arbitrary and rigid deadlines for Department of Energy (DOE) approval of LNG exports. Rather than speeding up the approval process, this unnecessary legislation would likely force the Department to deny projects because they will not have the time to fully consider their impacts. The Department of Energy is one of two agencies that must approve LNG export terminals. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission must first approve the terminal infrastructure, and then DOE must consider whether or not each facility's exports are in the national interest. That DOE review encompasses a number of considerations, including the environmental and domestic energy price impacts. DOE has been working to refine this process and has approved several terminals, dramatically increasing the amount of LNG that will be exported from the United States. This shift in U.S. energy policy, from import to export, requires a complete review of the cumulative impact. For example, we should carefully monitor and control methane leakage along the natural gas supply chain, which has a potent impact on climate change. And a number of domestic manufacturers have expressed concern about the impact of exports on energy prices here at home. I am not opposed to some responsible expansion of LNG exports, but it must be done in a way that protects the environment and American taxpayers. The Department of Energy has been charged, rightly, with protecting the public interest in this process. We should not arbitrarily short-circuit that critical effort. I urge a no vote. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 17 (Monday, February 2, 2015)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E143] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] LNG PERMITTING CERTAINTY AND TRANSPARENCY ACT ______ speech of HON.

ELIOT L. ENGEL of new york in the house of representatives Monday, February 2, 2015 Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, it is important to pay homage to those who have left an indelible mark on the community and the country as a whole. Former Congressman Vito Marcantonio, whose distinguished career in office spanned 3 decades, is most deserving of posthumous commemoration. Vito was born on December 10, 1902 to Italian parents in East Harlem. After graduating from NYU Law School in 1924, Vito became Fiorello LaGuardia's campaign manager and protege till 1934, when he was first elected to congress, filling LaGuardia's vacant seat in the House of Representatives. Following defeat in 1937, Vito was reelected to the House in 1939 and served his East Harlem community in the House till 1950. His long- standing neighborhood presence, accessibility and responsiveness made him an extremely popular figure with the public. This powerful bond allowed Vito to build a strong coalition with a diverse political constituency. As a legislator, Vito was a staunch defender of the civil rights of Italian Americans during World War II and of African Americans in the 40's and 50's. Vito advocated for the desegregation of Washington D.C. and in 1945 introduced a House resolution directing the Secretary of Commerce to investigate the employment practices of major league baseball clubs to determine if they were discriminating against African Americans. He was also known as the ``de facto'' representative of Puerto Rico in the House and led the drive to try to defeat the anti- union Taft-Hartley Act. Vito passed away in 1954 and was buried in the Historic Woodlawn Cemetery in the Bronx. He now rests there next to his beloved wife and community activist, Miriam Sanders. On Saturday, August 9th, 2014 the Vito Marcantonio Forum hosted a commemorative event on the 60th anniversary of his passing at the gravesite. Their remembrance was important and well deserved.

LUKE MESSER of indiana in the house of representatives Monday, February 2, 2015 Mr. MESSER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life of a man who had a tremendous impact on my life, William Lee Edwards. Bill was a treasured member of the Greensburg community and served in many different leadership roles at both Greensburg Junior High School and Greensburg High School over the past 40 years. Bill Edwards was also a devoted husband to his wife of 46 years, Joyce. Together, they were the proud parents of three sons and grandparents to four grandchildren. Bill was an avid fisherman and loved spending his free time outdoors. In addition to his family, Bill's lifelong passions revolved around education and sports. Bill served as the Greensburg Junior High Athletic Director for 27 years, coaching both the boys and girls track team, the football team, and the basketball team. Bill then moved on to become the face of Greensburg sports as the Athletic Director for Greensburg High School. Mr. Edwards, as I always called him, played a significant role in the lives of literally thousands of young people in his decades of service to Greensburg. I was one of them. He was my seventh grade Social Studies teacher and my eighth grade football coach. He was an outstanding teacher, who brought energy to the classroom. And, decades later, now as a Member of Congress, I still recall his lessons on Israel and Vietnam. He was a great coach, who pushed us to excel and coached many undefeated seasons. But, maybe most importantly, he taught us that anything was possible if you worked hard, followed a plan and believed. Mr. Edwards, I will always be grateful for those lessons. I know I speak for generations of young people in Greensburg when I thank you for your career. You will be missed by those you helped to smile, succeed and empower. May God bless you, your family, and all the people of Greensburg who you touched through your work. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 17 (Monday, February 2, 2015)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E144] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] HONORING WILLIAM LEE EDWARDS ______ HON.

ELIOT L. ENGEL of new york in the house of representatives Monday, February 2, 2015 Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, financial service organizations have the ability to change lives and lift up entire communities. Such has been the case with SUMA Federal Credit Union, which celebrated its 50th anniversary in 2014 at their Jubilee Banquet. SUMA was organized by a small contingent of Ukrainian immigrants who settled in Yonkers after World War II. Citing the growing need for financial services in order to improve the quality of life for their families, they developed a credit union whereby financial resources would be pooled to help obtain less expensive loans and insurance. To comply with National Credit Union Association requirements, they chose to support the Ukrainian American Youth Association, Yonkers branch, as their sponsor. Using shoe boxes to store cash reserves, the credit union opened for business in September of 1964, and in four short months had accumulated over $25,000 in assets from 82 members. For the next several decades, the SUMA Credit Union continued to grow and expand, establishing branch offices in Spring Valley, New York as well as Stamford, Connecticut. Today, SUMA has a membership base of over 7,000 and over $286,000,000 in total assets. But their impact goes beyond the financial wellbeing of its members; it has lifted up an entire community and provided incredible support to the excellent works of the Ukrainian American Youth Organization. The SUMA Federal Credit Union is a testament to the power of the financial sector and its ability to positively impact communities. I am proud to represent such a fine organization in the House of Representatives and wish them nothing but continued success in their next 50 years. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 17 (Monday, February 2, 2015)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E144] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] HONORING SUMA FEDERAL CREDIT UNION'S 50TH ANNIVERSARY ______ HON.

Mr. Speaker, those who selflessly give of themselves to serve the general good are the heartbeat of every community. Such is the case with Dr. Nader J. Sayegh, a lawyer and educator by profession who has done a great deal to give back to society. Dr. Sayegh worked in education in many different capacities for more than 40 years, holding various titles and roles ranging from teacher and principal to superintendant. In that time he also received a law degree from Pace University, and has practiced every kind of law from personal injury and criminal to real estate and immigration for over 23 years. But Dr. Sayegh's true passion is community involvement. Giving back to society was always an important tenet of his philosophy in life. He has served as Trustee for Yonkers Public Schools, a Liaison for the Westchester-Putnam School Boards Association, and a member of Yonker's Mayor Mike Spano's Education Re-Design Team, which looks for positive ways to reform the way we teach our kids. He serves as Chairman of the Charter Revision Committee, the President of the Yonkers Board of Education, and if all of that wasn't impressive enough, he is also multi-lingual. Dr. Sayegh's work has been recognized and honored by many incredible organizations focused on civic engagement, including the NAACP, the March of Dimes, and the Red Cross. On October 9th, 2014 another great organization, the Salvation Army, honored Dr. Sayegh at their annual dinner.

CREC-2015-02-02-pt1-PgE145-2,CREC-2015-02-02,114,TRIBUTE TO RICHARD D. ``DICK'' GILROY,"[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 17 (Monday, February 2, 2015)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E145] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] TRIBUTE TO RICHARD D. ``DICK'' GILROY ______ HON. TODD ROKITA of indiana in the house of representatives Monday, February 2, 2015 Mr. ROKITA. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Richard D. ``Dick'' Gilroy, a great Hoosier and valued friend who passed away on January 25, 2015. On that Sunday evening we lost a committed husband and father, as well as a dedicated community servant. I consider the words recorded on the floor of this House to be the official record of our nation. As such, please allow me to submit the following: After law school, Dick Gilroy joined the office of former Indianapolis Mayor, Richard G. Lugar, where he served the citizens of the city admirably and where he met Sue Anne Starnes, who he would marry in 1973. Having been a member of the United States Army Reserve, Dick Gilroy was a patriot who cared deeply for our nation and the ideals of American Exceptionalism. As one who believed deeply in the sacred American principle of ``innocent until proven guilty,'' Dick continued to serve the people of Indianapolis as a public defender, and later as a Magistrate Judge. Always close to politics and public service, Dick Gilroy was the perfect spouse ``behind the scenes'' as his cherished wife ran for statewide office and served two celebrated terms as Indiana's 58th Secretary of State. Mr. Speaker, we live in an age when the spouse of an elected official may often times play an integral role in the success of the official's public service. The unelected spouse will often share the work and time commitment of his/her partner. Dick Gilroy understood the significance of this role and executed it faithfully always supporting the efforts of his wife and understanding her commitment to public service. For that reason he was a tremendous asset to Sue Anne and her staff alike. In that role he greatly served the state and country he loved so much. Dick believed in using his talents and passion to improve the lives of those in his church and community. He created Young Life basketball and tutoring program through Tabernacle Presbyterian Church and led the ministry for ten years. The program influenced the lives of those who participated and the volunteers who supported it. Dick is still referred to as ``Coach Gilroy'' by those who participated in the program. As another Gilroy family friend recently remarked, Dick Gilroy was the ``salt-of-the-earth'' and one of the ``best'' human beings anyone would come across. Those of us who were lucky enough to ``experience'' Dick Gilroy, whether we are former Gilroy staffers, personal friends, professional colleagues, or community leaders, could not be more in agreement with these statements. He was a caring and strong father, a loving husband, and a great mentor to young lawyers and public servants like me. Aside from coaching troubled kids, he played a great deal of sports himself, including hockey. I remember Dick telling me one time when I was playing as an adult that ``the only appropriate beverage after a hockey game is a LaBatt's Blue.'' Growing up in Detroit, and being so close to our northern neighbor, Dick was always allowed this one indiscretion. Dick Gilroy leaves his wife of 41 years, who along with him, serves as a mentor and friend to Kathy and me. He also leaves his son, Grant, and two granddaughters. Dick has finally been reunited with the Gilroy's beloved daughter, Emily, who preceded him in death. While leaders always lead, and the leadership that the Gilroy family has provided Indiana for so many years will certainly continue on, Hoosiers experienced a setback in losing Dick Gilroy so unexpectedly. Because so many of us gained so much from him and the quiet leadership he provided, he will always be cherished, missed, and emulated. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 17 (Monday, February 2, 2015)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E145] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] TRIBUTE TO RICHARD D. ``DICK'' GILROY ______ HON.

For that reason he was a tremendous asset to Sue Anne and her staff alike. In that role he greatly served the state and country he loved so much. Dick believed in using his talents and passion to improve the lives of those in his church and community. He created Young Life basketball and tutoring program through Tabernacle Presbyterian Church and led the ministry for ten years. The program influenced the lives of those who participated and the volunteers who supported it. Dick is still referred to as ``Coach Gilroy'' by those who participated in the program. As another Gilroy family friend recently remarked, Dick Gilroy was the ``salt-of-the-earth'' and one of the ``best'' human beings anyone would come across. Those of us who were lucky enough to ``experience'' Dick Gilroy, whether we are former Gilroy staffers, personal friends, professional colleagues, or community leaders, could not be more in agreement with these statements. He was a caring and strong father, a loving husband, and a great mentor to young lawyers and public servants like me. Aside from coaching troubled kids, he played a great deal of sports himself, including hockey. I remember Dick telling me one time when I was playing as an adult that ``the only appropriate beverage after a hockey game is a LaBatt's Blue.'' Growing up in Detroit, and being so close to our northern neighbor, Dick was always allowed this one indiscretion. Dick Gilroy leaves his wife of 41 years, who along with him, serves as a mentor and friend to Kathy and me. He also leaves his son, Grant, and two granddaughters. Dick has finally been reunited with the Gilroy's beloved daughter, Emily, who preceded him in death. While leaders always lead, and the leadership that the Gilroy family has provided Indiana for so many years will certainly continue on, Hoosiers experienced a setback in losing Dick Gilroy so unexpectedly. Because so many of us gained so much from him and the quiet leadership he provided, he will always be cherished, missed, and emulated. ____________________",package_114_256.csv,3981,3981,4050,"[congressional record volume 161, number 17 (monday, february 2, 2015)] [extensions of remarks] [page e145] from the congressional record online through the government publishing office [ www.gpo.gov ] tribute to richard d. ``dick'' gilroy ______ hon. todd rokita of indiana in the house of representatives monday, february 2, 2015 mr. rokita. mr. speaker, i rise today to honor richard d. ``dick'' gilroy, a great hoosier and valued friend who passed away on january 25, 2015. on that sunday evening we lost a committed husband and father, as well as a dedicated community servant. i consider the words recorded on the floor of this house to be the official record of our nation. as such, please allow me to submit the following: after law school, dick gilroy joined the office of former indianapolis mayor, richard g. lugar, where he served the citizens of the city admirably and where he met sue anne starnes, who he would marry in 1973. having been a member of the united states army reserve, dick gilroy was a patriot who cared deeply for our nation and the ideals of american exceptionalism. as one who believed deeply in the sacred american principle of ``innocent until proven guilty,'' dick continued to serve the people of indianapolis as a public defender, and later as a magistrate judge. always close to politics and public service, dick gilroy was the perfect spouse ``behind the scenes'' as his cherished wife ran for statewide office and served two celebrated terms as indiana's 58th secretary of state. mr. speaker, we live in an age when the spouse of an elected official may often times play an integral role in the success of the official's public service. the unelected spouse will often share the work and time commitment of his/her partner. dick gilroy understood the significance of this role and executed it faithfully always supporting the efforts of his wife and understanding her commitment to public service. for that reason he was a tremendous asset to sue anne and her staff alike. in that role he greatly served the state and country he loved so much. dick believed in using his talents and passion to improve the lives of those in his church and community. he created young life basketball and tutoring program through tabernacle presbyterian church and led the ministry for ten years. the program influenced the lives of those who participated and the volunteers who supported it. dick is still referred to as ``coach gilroy'' by those who participated in the program. as another gilroy family friend recently remarked, dick gilroy was the ``salt-of-the-earth'' and one of the ``best'' human beings anyone would come across. those of us who were lucky enough to ``experience'' dick gilroy, whether we are former gilroy staffers, personal friends, professional colleagues, or community leaders, could not be more in agreement with these statements. he was a caring and strong father, a loving husband, and a great mentor to young lawyers and public servants like me. aside from coaching troubled kids, he played a great deal of sports himself, including hockey. i remember dick telling me one time when i was playing as an adult that ``the only appropriate beverage after a hockey game is a labatt's blue.'' growing up in detroit, and being so close to our northern neighbor, dick was always allowed this one indiscretion. dick gilroy leaves his wife of 41 years, who along with him, serves as a mentor and friend to kathy and me. he also leaves his son, grant, and two granddaughters. dick has finally been reunited with the gilroy's beloved daughter, emily, who preceded him in death. while leaders always lead, and the leadership that the gilroy family has provided indiana for so many years will certainly continue on, hoosiers experienced a setback in losing dick gilroy so unexpectedly. because so many of us gained so much from him and the quiet leadership he provided, he will always be cherished, missed, and emulated. ____________________",3981

LUCILLE ROYBAL-ALLARD of california in the house of representatives Monday, February 2, 2015 Ms. ROYBAL-ALLARD. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the three Homeland Security bills under consideration today. H.R. 615, the DHS Interoperable Communications Act, is a bipartisan bill which would improve communication between the many components of the Department of Homeland Security. It is critical for our [[Page E146]] Homeland Security Department to have a state-of-the-art communications infrastructure. The Department needs that infrastructure to ensure the smooth functioning of everything from routine daily operations to terrorism response efforts. To understand the importance of a strong communications network, we only need to look back a few weeks ago, when radio communications failed in a Washington Metro tunnel as emergency officials worked to rescue passengers trapped aboard a smoke-filled train. H.R. 361, the Medical Preparedness Allowable Use Act, would use grant funding to enhance our nation's preparedness for chemical and biological events. It is an unfortunate fact of modern life that our nation faces genuine threats from chemical and biological attacks. It makes sense for us to take precautions which will put us in a position to deal with such attacks if they occur. Finally, H.R. 623, the Social Media Working Group Act of 2015, would authorize the Department of Homeland Security to establish a social media working group, which would offer guidance to the emergency preparedness and response community on how to use social media. I have spent years using social media to communicate with my constituents, and have found it extremely effective in rapidly disseminating important information to a wide audience. Emergency services need to be taught how they can best use social media to quickly and effectively communicate with Americans in the period surrounding a terrorist attack or other crisis. All three of these bills take sensible steps to further protect the American people against threats to their well-being. I urge the House to pass these bills. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 17 (Monday, February 2, 2015)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Pages E145-E146] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] HOMELAND SECURITY BILLS ______ HON.

ELIOT L. ENGEL of new york in the house of representatives Monday, February 2, 2015 Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, the people who devote their lives so selflessly to public service are the ones who transform and change entire communities. Such has been the case with Aurelia Greene, my longtime friend and partner in government, whose distinguished career of public service has made a positive, lasting impact on the Bronx and far beyond. A native Bronxite, Aurelia is a graduate of Livingston College at Rutgers University, where she majored in Community Development. Following school she became a Public Agency Administrator, a prelude to her eventual calling in government. She was elected female district leader for the 76th district before winning the Assembly seat in the Bronx's 77th district in 1981. For the next 27 years, Aurelia served in the Assembly with distinction, using her urban planning skills to negotiate for affordable housing, healthcare, a quality education and employment opportunities for all New Yorkers. She regularly sponsored educational and informational seminars to aid her constituents on issues of concern, and worked hard to bring economic development and businesses to her district. Aurelia's legislative achievements are many, as she introduced and passed a number of important bills in the State Legislature during her time as Assemblywoman. Rising through the ranks, she became the Speaker Pro Tempore of the Assembly in 2006, the first African-American to hold the prestigious position which oversees the chamber in the absence of the Assembly Speaker. She also chaired the Assembly's Bronx delegation as the longest serving member in the Assembly from the Bronx. In 2009, Aurelia was asked to serve as Deputy Borough President by newly elected Borough President Ruben Diaz Jr. She has been a steady voice and excellent confidant for the borough president ever since. Aurelia celebrated her 80th birthday in October, 2014 at a gala brunch hosted in her honor. As I was in attendance, I had the great pleasure of wishing her nothing but the very best on the occasion, and thanked her for all of her amazing service to the public good. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 17 (Monday, February 2, 2015)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E146] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] HONORING AURELIA GREENE ______ HON.

Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Marcie Waldron, who has been named the City of Sonoma's 2015 Alcaldessa, or Honorary Mayor. The title ``Alcalde,'' or ``Alcaldessa'' when referring to a woman, is the Spanish word for ``mayor.'' While the Alcalde was the primary civil authority during the Spanish colonial period in California, in modern times, it is an honorary title bestowed upon invaluable members of the community. Ms. Waldron has lived in Sonoma for 12 years, where she has given back to the community as a leader and member of community organizations. She is the president of the Vintage House board, a non- profit organization that promotes the well-being of elderly citizens by encouraging independence and involvement in community life. Ms. Waldron also serves as the interim president of the WillMar Family Grief and Healing Center, which provides support to families grieving the loss of a loved one or living with family members with a life-altering illness. Outside of her leadership roles with these non-profit organizations, Ms. Waldron serves as a board member of the Sonoma Community Center and Kiwanis of Sonoma Plaza. In addition to her involvement in community organizations, Ms. Waldron works to raise awareness about organ donation. Herself a double transplant recipient, Ms. Waldron speaks to schools and organizations honoring donors and stressing the importance of organ donation. Ms. Waldron also works to recognize donors through her ``LifeStar'' program, which gives donors hand-made silver LifeStar pendants in appreciation for their gift of life.

The Yonkers Kiwanis Club received its Charter on November 11, 1929, and has been an integral part of the community for decades. Since its founding, the Yonkers Kiwanis Club [[Page E147]] has helped foster local youth through a wide variety of projects and programs, including scholarships for High School Seniors, book donations to reading programs, and holiday food baskets for people in need. The Yonkers Kiwanis Club has also sponsored local children's service clubs, Teacher of the Year awards, and programs focusing on services and facilities for children with special needs. The Yonkers Kiwanis club has also worked in partnership with many organizations to provide service to the community, including Toys for Tots and the Red Cross.

Mr. Speaker, it is with great pride that I rise today to extend my warmest congratulations to Local 34 of the Federation of University Employees, UNITE HERE as they celebrate their 30th Anniversary--a remarkable milestone for this wonderful organization! Representing over 3400 clerical and technical employees at Yale University, Local 34 has given a strong voice to its membership over the last three decades. Their members perform a broad spectrum of duties that make Yale University a world-class institution of teaching, research and medical care. Local 34's efforts have ensured fair salaries and guaranteed raises, healthcare benefits, workplace health and safety protections, as well as good pensions and fully paid retiree medical benefits for members and their spouses. Local 34 can be proud of the work they do on behalf of their members and the role the union plays in making Yale a great place to work. The organization of Local 34 holds a special place in my memory--it is hard to believe that 30 years have already passed. As the organization effort grew, my husband and I were glad to support them and our basement housed the phone-bank effort. Our home became a base of operation throughout the creation of Local 34 and it was a proud moment when the day of the vote came and Local 34 became a reality. Over the course of the last three decades, Local 34 has played a unique role in our community, not only representing the interests of their members, but also in strengthening the town-gown relationship between Yale University and the City of New Haven. Understanding the connection between strong communities and healthy employment, in the 1990's Local 34 created the New Haven Resident's Training Program--one of the few job training initiatives in the entire country that led to a commitment to hire locally. Today, as New Haven and the country emerge from challenging economic times, Local 34 has doubled-down on this effort with the creation of a jobs pipeline--New Haven Works--an organization committed to providing employers with a trained and qualified workforce and connecting New Haven residents to good jobs. Last year alone they placed over 300 individuals in new jobs and the effort is only growing. From its origins as a ``pink-collar'' union of secretaries--little sister to the blue-collar Local 35--Local 34 has grown into a labor powerhouse. I am honored to have this opportunity to extend my heartfelt congratulations to Local 34 President Laurie Kennington, the union's executive leadership, and each of its more than 3400 members as they celebrate this very special anniversary.

MYERS ______ HON. TODD ROKITA of indiana in the house of representatives Monday, February 2, 2015 Mr. ROKITA. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Congressman John T. Myers, an American patriot, a dedicated public servant and a great Hoosier who passed away on January 27, 2015. I consider the words recorded on the floor of this House to be the official record of our nation. As such, please allow me to submit the following: John Myers was born and raised in Covington, Indiana and graduated from Covington High School. His service to our Nation began immediately after his high school graduation when he joined the United States Army. He later earned his B.S. at Indiana State University in 1951 and also attended Eastern Illinois University where he was a member of Sigma Pi. Though working in the Indiana banking industry, Myers never abandoned his farming roots as he continued to work a farm in Fountain County. Before long however, Myers returned his attention to public service becoming a member of this honorable House of Representatives. He first took office in 1967, winning fifteen consecutive elections and continuing his admirable public service for 30 years before retiring in 1997. During his tenure representing Indiana's 7th District in the United States Congress. Mr. Myers became known locally as an essential player in the Lafayette Railroad Relocation Project, a three decades long project that moved the trains from city streets and into a dedicated corridor. The Main Street Bridge was in fact renamed in his honor after the pedestrian bridge was opened as part of the rail relocation project. As Indiana Governor Pence noted while paying tribute to Congressman Myers, ``The legacy of public service he leaves behind is unmatched, and we do well to strive to emulate his example.'' [[Page E148]] Congressman Myers passed away in his Covington home leaving behind his wife Carol, daughters Carol Ann Myers and Lori Jan Kerns, seven grandchildren and several nieces and nephews. I offer my sincerest condolences to the Myers family. We grieve with you as we mourn the loss of a great Hoosier who lived a life of servant leadership while humbly representing our district in the U.S. House of Representatives for three decades. Congressman Myers legacy will not be forgotten. His example is a challenge to all of us to rededicate ourselves to serving in our communities and working with our neighbors. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 17 (Monday, February 2, 2015)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Pages E147-E148] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] TRIBUTE TO CONGRESSMAN JOHN T.

ELIOT L. ENGEL of new york in the house of representatives Monday, February 2, 2015 Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, when organizations are able to ingratiate themselves with the community through good works, they often become a cornerstone of the neighborhood. Such is the case with Wartburg in Westchester, which celebrated its 150th Anniversary at the Wartburg Fall Festival on October 11th, 2014. For over a century, Wartburg has offered integrated, comprehensive senior care services to both residents and people in their own homes. Their programs, from independent, assisted living to nursing home care and rehabilitation have become so renowned that U.S. News & World Report has named Wartburg one of the ``Best Nursing Homes in New York State'' for three consecutive years. Their skilled Nursing facility, Licensed Home Health Care and Adult Day Services programs accept all patients, regardless of their income or their ability to pay. Wartburg's status as a not-for-profit has also allowed them to reinvest heavily in the community, with initiatives that include over $7 million in uncompensated care each year for the aging population. Wartburg's impact on the community is also economic in nature. They are the largest employer in the Mt. Vernon area and generate an estimated $80 million annually in direct and indirect activity for the surrounding communities. Last year's Wartburg Fall Festival once again took place on the institution's beautiful, 34-acre wooded campus, which was founded in 1865 by Reverend William A. Passavant. I count myself fortunate to have such an exceptional organization housed within my district and I am honored to represent them in Congress. Congratulations again to Wartburg on 150 years of great work for the community. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 17 (Monday, February 2, 2015)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E148] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] HONORING WARTBURG'S 150TH ANNIVERSARY ______ HON.

Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to this unnecessary legislation, which would place arbitrary deadlines on Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) decisions, potentially forcing them to deny applications because they simply do not have enough information to make a credible determination. FERC has received high marks from the Government Accountability Office for its predictable and consistent application process. This bill would needlessly disrupt what is already working, forcing FERC to abide by rigid deadlines no matter how large or complex a project happens to be. If other agencies with permitting authority on a project fail to report to FERC within the bill's timeline, FERC would become a kind of ``super-permitting'' agency, with the ability to issue permits on the agencies' behalf without the expertise necessary to make those decisions. By rushing a functioning and important process, this bill jeopardizes the environment and public health. With a number of high-profile pipeline spills requiring costly clean-up across the country, we should not needlessly short-circuit the process that is intended to make sure pipelines are built safely.

KENNY MARCHANT of texas in the house of representatives Monday, February 2, 2015 Mr. MARCHANT. Mr. Speaker, I am honored today to congratulate my friend, Mrs. Lillian Pinkus, on her being selected as the next president of the American Israeli Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC). I am confident that she will contribute greatly to AIPAC's mission ``to strengthen, protect and promote the U.S.-Israel relationship in ways that enhance the security of Israel and the United States.'' Lillian was born in upstate New York to parents who were survivors of the Holocaust. Even after being liberated from the atrocities of that time, her parents spent additional years in a deportation camp in Germany, awaiting the opportunity to emigrate to another country. As a result, Lillian grew up in a family that instilled within her a sense of appreciation for the blessings of freedom and opportunity that she and her siblings enjoy in the United States. She also developed an understanding of the immense importance of a safe and free homeland for the Jewish people. A tireless advocate for the security and strength of Israel, the U.S., and the alliance between them, Lillian has served AIPAC with years of dedication. Prior to being selected president at the most recent annual Board meeting in Israel, she was a National Board Member. She also has been honored by Israel Bonds, an organization that allows Americans to invest in building up the modern State of Israel. Lillian has now lived in Dallas with her husband, Jon, for over forty years. Together they have two married sons, Jared and his wife Samantha, and Aaron and his wife Pamela. She will become president- elect this March and take office as president during AIPAC's annual policy conference in March, 2016. I have enjoyed working with Lillian over the years on our common goal of ensuring the security of our ally, Israel; and I look forward to continuing our strong working relationship into the future. Mr. Speaker, it is my honor to ask all of my distinguished colleagues to join me in congratulating and wishing well Lillian Pinkus as she begins to serve as the president of AIPAC. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 17 (Monday, February 2, 2015)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E148] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] CONGRATULATING LILLIAN PINKUS ON BEING SELECTED PRESIDENT OF AIPAC ______ HON.

G. K. BUTTERFIELD of north carolina in the house of representatives Monday, February 2, 2015 Mr. BUTTERFIELD. Mr. Speaker, it is with great pride that I rise in recognition of the 130th Anniversary of the Town of Princeville, North Carolina--the oldest town in the United States incorporated by African Americans. Princeville is located in Edgecombe County in my Congressional District and was originally known as Freedom Hill when it was founded at the close of the Civil War in 1865 by newly-freed slaves who sought protection in the Union Army encampments there. Following the departure of the Union soldiers, many of the former slaves stayed behind and formed a free community in Freedom Hill. The settlement grew and was incorporated on February 20, 1885, as Princeville in honor of Turner Prince, a former slave who used his carpentry skills to build many homes in the free community for his family and others who sought refuge there. The Town of Princeville and its residents have endured much over its 130 year history. Whether it was racial prejudice, social and economic isolation, or Hurricane Floyd that nearly destroyed Princeville, the Town and its proud residents remain resilient and dedicated to building for the future. Today, the Town has well over 2,000 residents and continues to grow. The Town of Princeville serves as a symbol of the self-determination, endurance, and fearlessness of the African Americans who braved the unimaginable horrors of slavery to reclaim their lives and build a lasting community for future generations. Today we celebrate Princeville's incredible survival and its unique place in African American culture and United States History. Princeville's story deserves recognition so that the historical and social significance of the [[Page E149]] Town and the unwavering spirit of its people are widely known. Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in recognizing and congratulating the Town of Princeville, North Carolina for 130 years of perseverance and for being a symbol of African American strength and resilience. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 17 (Monday, February 2, 2015)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Pages E148-E149] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] IN RECOGNITION OF PRINCEVILLE, NORTH CAROLINA'S 130TH ANNIVERSARY ______ HON.

ELIOT L. ENGEL of new york in the house of representatives Monday, February 2, 2015 Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, sometimes a simple civic organization intended to help and improve a small community can turn into a pillar of hope for an entire city. That has undoubtedly been the case with Regional Aid for Interim Needs, or R.A.I.N. R.A.I.N. was founded in 1964 by Beatrice Castiglia-Catullo to serve those in need as a multi-social service agency. It provides an array of invaluable services to the senior community of the Bronx, many of whom are handicapped, home bound, or otherwise incapable of providing themselves with certain necessities. R.A.I.N. has full-service neighborhood senior centers, home-delivered meals, transportation services, assistance with benefits and entitlements, case management and elder abuse services, in addition to community-based mobile meals for homeless and hungry persons. Their commitment to helping the elderly population has also led to the sponsorship of two residential housing projects for low-income seniors and an affiliated home attendant program that provides in-home attendant and care services. Building off their incredible success in the Bronx, R.A.I.N. has recently expanded its services to Manhattan and has licensed to provide Home Health Care in all five New York City boroughs as well as Westchester County. Today, R.A.I.N. has funding that accounts for 1,600 meals on wheels, 325 daily meals to the hungry and homeless, and 11 senior centers providing quality programming to over 100 seniors at each site every day. Thousands of New Yorkers have come to rely on R.A.I.N. as a lifeline, and as a Congressman representing parts of the Bronx it is always heart-warming and comforting to see one of R.A.I.N.'s trucks on a block in my district. R.A.I.N. celebrated their 50th Anniversary on October 30th 2014. I want to personally thank their Board for all of the years of great service to the community. The work done by R.A.I.N. has literally saved lives and I am so proud to have such a caring organization operating in my district.

Their commitment to helping the elderly population has also led to the sponsorship of two residential housing projects for low-income seniors and an affiliated home attendant program that provides in-home attendant and care services. Building off their incredible success in the Bronx, R.A.I.N. has recently expanded its services to Manhattan and has licensed to provide Home Health Care in all five New York City boroughs as well as Westchester County. Today, R.A.I.N. has funding that accounts for 1,600 meals on wheels, 325 daily meals to the hungry and homeless, and 11 senior centers providing quality programming to over 100 seniors at each site every day. Thousands of New Yorkers have come to rely on R.A.I.N. as a lifeline, and as a Congressman representing parts of the Bronx it is always heart-warming and comforting to see one of R.A.I.N.'s trucks on a block in my district. R.A.I.N. celebrated their 50th Anniversary on October 30th 2014. I want to personally thank their Board for all of the years of great service to the community.

ELIOT L. ENGEL of new york in the house of representatives Monday, February 2, 2015 Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, religious institutions have the power to shape and bind a community in ways that can forever change their neighborhood for the better. That has been the case with the Mount Carmel Pentecostal Church in the Bronx, which celebrated its 30th Anniversary in 2014. The Mt. Carmel Pentecostal Church has been a beacon of hope and source of strength for its parishioners for so long because of the incredible commitment made by its leaders, Pastors Moulton and Judith Esdaille, who have served their community unselfishly for over 30 years. Their work to advance and grow the church they loved started in roles like Sunday School Teacher, Choir Director and Evangelist among others. Over time, Pastors Moulton and Judith began working to expand their congregation by developing outreach programs. Driven by their creed, ``Each One, Win One,'' Pastors Moulton and Judith have made it their mission to help those in need. They created the Bronx Park East Home for the Aging Outreach program, the Mount Carmel Pentecostal Church Partners with Feed the Hungry program, a youth mentorship program, a monthly tract program to increase spiritual awareness in the community and a series of enrichment classes to uplift parishioners. They have also been able to partner their church with Mission to Africa and Haiti organizations, sending food, clothing and supplies to areas of the globe that are in dire need of assistance. In addition to all Pastors Moulton and Judith have achieved for their church, they are also loving parents who have managed to juggle three children and family responsibilities with two full-time secular jobs by day. They are truly an impressive combination of leaders, who have done incredible work to reach out and touch the lives of countless people all throughout the world. In 2014 the Mt. Carmel Pentecostal Church honored Pastors Moulton and Judith Esdaille for all of their fantastic accomplishments and contributions. I'd like to echo the congratulations of the church and thank Moulton and Judith for all they've accomplished and done for the Bronx community and beyond. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 17 (Monday, February 2, 2015)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E149] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] HONORING PASTORS MOULTON AND JUDITH ESDAILLE ______ HON.

ELIOT L. ENGEL of new york in the house of representatives Monday, February 2, 2015 Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, a thriving community can only be achieved when its members strive to better their surroundings. For several decades, the Riverdale neighborhood has benefitted from the hard work and dedication of Susan Goldy, one of the northwest Bronx's most respected citizens and my dear friend. Susan's work in Riverdale began in earnest in 1981 when she established her own agency, Susan E Goldy Inc., which specialized in the sale and rental of residential property. Her company immediately earned high marks for its professionalism, courtesy, integrity and reliability. As Susan's agency grew she began to enhance her involvement in other real estate related ventures, including the Bronx Manhattan North Association of Realtors, an organization which she served as President of in 1995 and 1996. Later, Susan became a member of the New York State Association of Realtors (NYSAR) serving on and chairing many committees within NYSAR focused on growing communities through real estate interests. Not surprisingly in 2012, Susan was elected President of NYSAR, an obvious reflection of her outstanding work ethic and accomplishments within the organization and beyond. Susan has been recognized over the years with numerous awards and honors from different community groups and organizations, including the YMCA, the Kingsbridge Riverdale Van Cortlandt Development Corporation and the New York State Legislature. She has also done a great deal of volunteerism in this community and beyond, working with the Red Cross and Habitat for Humanity to help those who were impacted by Hurricanes Katrina and Sandy. Susan moved to Riverdale in 1972 to raise her children, Jason and Lauren. The entire Riverdale community is fortunate that she did. I have known Susan for many years and I absolutely treasure the friendship we have developed over that time. In 2014, the Riverdale Neighborhood House honored Susan at their annual benefit, and they could not have found a more deserving honoree.
