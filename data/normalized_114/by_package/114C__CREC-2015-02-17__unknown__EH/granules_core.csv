I also saw my former student Blanca after she met with President Obama to talk about the positive impact the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program has had on her life.

Thanks to the Deferred Action for Parental Accountability (DAPA) program, Aida and Norma's families no longer live in constant fear of separation. And because of DACA, Blanca can continue to pursue her American Dream without the threat of deportation. But unfortunately, Republicans are waging a war against immigrants. They are actively working to repeal DACA and DAPA and strip away these critical protections for DREAMers and their families. They refuse to consider comprehensive immigration reform. They are wasting time suing the President for taking executive action to prevent the separation of families. And they are jeopardizing national security by tying anti- immigrant riders to the DHS funding bill. By refusing to work with House Democrats to find a long-term, comprehensive fix to our broken immigration system, Republicans are turning their backs on women like Aida, Norma, and Blanca. They are keeping people in the shadows and costing our economy over $800 billion. They'd rather attack families than terrorists. I urge Republicans to immediately stop waging their morally indefensible, economically foolish, and physically dangerous war on undocumented families, listen to the American people, and immediately pass the immigration reform we need. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 27 (Tuesday, February 17, 2015)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E223] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] THE REPUBLICANS' WAR ON IMMIGRANTS ______ HON.

JOHN SHEA, JR.","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 27 (Tuesday, February 17, 2015)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E223] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] HONORING THE LIFE AND MEDICAL CONTRIBUTIONS OF DR. JOHN SHEA, JR. ______ HON. STEVE COHEN of tennessee in the house of representatives Tuesday, February 17, 2015 Mr. COHEN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life and medical contributions of renowned surgeon, innovator and ``father of middle-ear surgery,'' Memphian Dr. John Shea, Jr. A graduate of the University of Notre Dame and Harvard Medical School, Dr. Shea served in the Korean War before returning to Memphis and taking over his father's medical practice in 1952. Two years later, he traveled to Vienna, Austria where he began extensive research into otosclerosis that would lead to his inventing the world's first prosthetic stapes--the tiny stirrup-shaped bone in the middle ear--and performing the groundbreaking stapedectomy procedure, which has since been used by doctors world-wide. While in Vienna, he read German manuscripts on otosclerosis, which is a condition of the inner ear that causes calcification of the stapes and is considered a leading cause of deafness. Although the medical community ended surgical attempts to address this condition 50 years earlier, Dr. Shea had a vision to combat this cause of deafness in middle-aged adults by replacing the calcified bone with a prosthetic. While many of his colleagues questioned the procedure as dangerous, Dr. Shea was convinced through his research that the revolutionary surgery would work. On May 1, 1956, he successfully performed the first stapedectomy and went on to repeat the procedure nearly 50,000 times during his career before retiring in 2011. In addition to inventing the prosthetic stapes and developing the stapedectomy, Dr. Shea contributed to otology surgical instruments including drills and microscopes, and intratympanic perfusion treatment for Meniere's disease or spontaneous vertigo. His ingenuity earned him a spot on the London Times list of ``1,000 Makers of the Twentieth Century'' and a 1962 featured cover article in LIFE magazine as one of five people who were recognized as part of ``The Takeover Generation.'' In 2013, he donated 406 papers, including over 300 published articles, documenting his life's work to the local Memphis Public Library's Memphis Room. Dr. Shea belonged to more than 50 scientific societies, and was a clinical professor in the otolaryngology departments of the University of Tennessee, the University of Mississippi, the University of North Carolina and Tulane University. Additionally, he received honorary doctorates from Memphis schools Christian Brothers University and Rhodes College, and an honorary fellowship from the Australian and English Royal College of Surgeons. My father, Dr. Morris D. Cohen, knew Dr. Shea and his father as he, too, was a physician and operated the Children's Clinic at 1155 Madison, down the street from Dr. Shea, Sr.'s Ear Nose and Throat Hospital. He told me about the hospital and spoke admiringly of Dr. Shea and his father. Memphis has long been home to many great medical institutions, including Campbell Clinic, the University of Tennessee Health Science Center, the Elvis Presley Trauma Center at Regional One Health (formerly The Med) and the Shea Ear Clinic. Many Memphis physicians have received national acclaim but none have been more renowned than Dr. John Shea, Jr., In 1985, Dr. Shea opened the Shea Ear Clinic at Poplar and Ridgeway in Memphis where his son, Dr. Paul Shea continues the family practice today. Dr. Shea, Jr. was a pioneer in the field of otology and a legendary doctor who helped usher in a new era of treatment. He came from one family of physicians and leaves behind another. Memphis will miss John Shea, Jr., and I send my condolences to his wife Lynda Lee Mead; sons Paul and Dr. John Shea III (private practice otologist); daughters Susanna Shea and Wendy Canarios; seven grandchildren and three great grandchildren; and his friends and loved ones.

Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life and medical contributions of renowned surgeon, innovator and ``father of middle-ear surgery,'' Memphian Dr. John Shea, Jr. A graduate of the University of Notre Dame and Harvard Medical School, Dr. Shea served in the Korean War before returning to Memphis and taking over his father's medical practice in 1952. Two years later, he traveled to Vienna, Austria where he began extensive research into otosclerosis that would lead to his inventing the world's first prosthetic stapes--the tiny stirrup-shaped bone in the middle ear--and performing the groundbreaking stapedectomy procedure, which has since been used by doctors world-wide. While in Vienna, he read German manuscripts on otosclerosis, which is a condition of the inner ear that causes calcification of the stapes and is considered a leading cause of deafness. Although the medical community ended surgical attempts to address this condition 50 years earlier, Dr. Shea had a vision to combat this cause of deafness in middle-aged adults by replacing the calcified bone with a prosthetic. While many of his colleagues questioned the procedure as dangerous, Dr. Shea was convinced through his research that the revolutionary surgery would work.
