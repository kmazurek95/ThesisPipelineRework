The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Jolly) for 5 minutes. Mr. JOLLY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor an exceptional group of young men in Pinellas County, Florida, the honor guard at Fuguitt Elementary School in Largo. Last week, I had the pleasure of visiting with 21 young men of Fuguitt's honor guard who have recognized the importance of respect, discipline, commitment, and speaking out against bullying. These are remarkable young men in third, fourth, and fifth grade. The honor guard program at Fuguitt was started by former Principal Michael Moss; teacher Rhonda Correa; and her husband, Frank Correa, a Marine Corps veteran. The Correas have continued to lead the program today under the leadership of Fuguitt's principal, Dr. Kathi Bentley. The purpose of the honor guard is to develop structure, discipline, and leadership in young students who otherwise might face academic or behavioral challenges. Each student signs the honor guard pledge, which reads: ``As a Fuguitt honor guard member, I am a student leader of this school. As a member, I promise to be truthful, respectful, helpful, and hardworking. I will act like an honorable gentleman and respect and honor the flag of the United States of America. I understand my success is my Nation's success.'' Each day, the honor guard opens the school with the presentation of colors and the Pledge of Allegiance. Mr. Speaker, the young men committed to this program represent future leaders both in Pinellas County and also in our Nation, and they deserve the recognition and encouragement of this body. I am honored to recognize Fuguitt Elementary School's honor guard members today: in third grade--Romeo Greene, Sean Lange, Blake Logan, Levita Maafu, Troy Mason, George Mercado, Walit Morton, Daniel Mattrass, Micah Timberlake, and Bryce Young; in fourth grade--Domenic Barclay, Johnnie Chattman, Ari Davis, Matthew Kosinski, and Tyrek Tripp; and in fifth grade--Jon Dameron, Anthony Gonzalez, William Maafu, William Muscu, Steven Suero, and Andra Witchard. Today, these young men serve as role models to the rest of Fuguitt Elementary School and are held to a high standard, both academically and behaviorally. I rise today to recognize their efforts and commend the leadership at Fuguitt who are committed to the mission to help these students grow into future leaders. In closing, I would like to share the honor guard's poem that they recited to me at the end of my visit with them. It is a fitting tribute from 21 young men to the exceptionalism of our Nation. ``We are the beacon of light, the hope of mankind, that shining city on a hill, the most beautiful, the most bountiful, the most generous people in the history of the world, the country that has birthed the great titans of science and industry, the country that put a man on the Moon, the country that has liberated tens of millions from the clutches of evil, the home of the brave, the undisputed champion of freedom, the great Republic, the United States of America.'' I thank the Fuguitt honor guard for serving as an inspiration to so many, including to this Member of Congress. May God bless each of them and their families, and may God bless these United States. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 31 (Tuesday, February 24, 2015)] [House] [Page H1089] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] HONORING THE FUGUITT ELEMENTARY SCHOOL HONOR GUARD The SPEAKER pro tempore.

CREC-2015-02-24-pt1-PgH1087-4,CREC-2015-02-24,114,CONGRESS OF CLIFFS,"[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 31 (Tuesday, February 24, 2015)] [House] [Pages H1087-H1088] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] CONGRESS OF CLIFFS The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Oregon (Mr. Blumenauer) for 5 minutes. Mr. BLUMENAUER. Mr. Speaker, there is a lot of talk of cliffs here in our Nation's Capital. We have fiscal cliffs that we faced with the debt ceiling. There was the sequestration cliff. We had, obviously, the cliffs surrounding the government shutdown. This week, we face a Homeland Security cliff. Because our Republican friends have been unable to reach agreement and have held hostage the budget of the Department of Homeland Security, we face a situation where we will either shut down those operations or, hopefully, people will come to their senses and take action. But, again, it is government by cliff. In March, we are facing the SGR cliff. If the government doesn't move forward to deal with a meaningful solution to the sustainable growth rate, we are going to see a dramatic reduction in government reimbursement under Medicare to providers. And looming in the background--something that we talked about last summer because Congress refused to deal meaningfully with transportation funding--there will be another cliff May 31 as the transportation fund loses its ability to fund. Already, there are programs around the country in local and State government that are trying to factor in reductions of important construction work that they aren't certain they can do this summer. Well, we are putting in the background another cliff. It is one that will probably not get the attention that it deserves, but one that deserves people to focus on because it will impact 11 million of our most vulnerable citizens. Over the course of the years, there have been opportunities within the trust fund that funds retirement and disability, which are basically, for most people, synonymous--they are paid for by the same tax on our earnings and that our employers pay, but they have been segregated into two accounts, one dealing with disability and one dealing with retirement. Over the history of these two programs they have spent at different rates. Eleven times in the past, under Republican and Democratic Presidents alike, Congress has moved to shift money from one trust fund to another to be able to even it out and not run out of the ability to pay benefits. The last adjustment was made in 1994, but the disability account was only adjusted for about 20 years. At the time, it was understood that there would be a need for more action dealing with disability because of a very fundamental demographic change: we have a lot more women in the workforce and the baby boom generation is moving into the years in their careers where they are more prone to disability claims. And, sure enough, that projection is right. Around December of next year, we will no longer be able to pay full disability payments unless there is an adjustment. Well, the fix that has been done 11 times over the years, on a bipartisan basis, has been made infinitely more difficult because of a rule change that our friends on the Republican side have adopted for this Congress. Under what they have approved, it will be impossible to make that simple adjustment that we have done time and time again if a single Member of the House of Representatives objects. This is setting up an artificial crisis. There is a need to adjust funding for both Social Security and disability because, combined, in about 2033 or 2034 they will not be able to pay out full benefits. That is why it is important for Congress to be able to step forward and deal with it meaningfully, but it is not something you do in a crisis, and it is not something that should be done by picking out the one area in which 11 million citizens rely on these for disability payments. It should be done thoughtfully and carefully. If people are concerned about fraud and misuse, I would suggest that my Republican friends look at what they did in the budget process. Over the last 3 years, they have cut 7 percent out of the budget for the Social Security Administration that could have gone to deal with enforcement and that could have gone to deal with fraud and abuse. It could have gone to make sure that the program is operating properly. Instead, we have set up a crisis to try and force reductions in benefits for [[Page H1088]] some of our most vulnerable. I think it is not the way we should go. We shouldn't be having government by cliff, but we also ought to be dealing with it in a thoughtful and reasonable fashion to make the adjustments that make it sustainable. In the meantime, the Republican leadership ought to waive that rule-- like they routinely do for things that they care about, like passing billions of dollars of unfunded tax cuts--to be able to allow the rebalancing to occur and the decisionmaking to be made in a thoughtful and reasonable fashion. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 31 (Tuesday, February 24, 2015)] [House] [Pages H1087-H1088] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] CONGRESS OF CLIFFS The SPEAKER pro tempore.

(tuesday, february 24, 2015)] [house] [pages h1087-h1088] from the congressional record online through the government publishing office [ www.gpo.gov ] congress of cliffs the speaker pro tempore. the chair recognizes the gentleman from oregon (mr. blumenauer) for 5 minutes. mr. blumenauer. mr. speaker, there is a lot of talk of cliffs here in our nation's capital. we have fiscal cliffs that we faced with the debt ceiling. there was the sequestration cliff. we had, obviously, the cliffs surrounding the government shutdown. this week, we face a homeland security cliff. because our republican friends have been unable to reach agreement and have held hostage the budget of the department of homeland security, we face a situation where we will either shut down those operations or, hopefully, people will come to their senses and take action. but, again, it is government by cliff. in march, we are facing the sgr cliff. if the government doesn't move forward to deal with a meaningful solution to the sustainable growth rate, we are going to see a dramatic reduction in government reimbursement under medicare to providers. and looming in the background--something that we talked about last summer because congress refused to deal meaningfully with transportation funding--there will be another cliff may 31 as the transportation fund loses its ability to fund. already, there are programs around the country in local and state government that are trying to factor in reductions of important construction work that they aren't certain they can do this summer. well, we are putting in the background another cliff. it is one that will probably not get the attention that it deserves, but one that deserves people to focus on because it will impact 11 million of our most vulnerable citizens. over the course of the years, there have been opportunities within the trust fund that funds retirement and disability, which are basically, for most people, synonymous--they are paid for by the same tax on our earnings and that our employers pay, but they have been segregated into two accounts, one dealing with disability and one dealing with retirement. over the history of these two programs they have spent at different rates. eleven times in the past, under republican and democratic presidents alike, congress has moved to shift money from one trust fund to another to be able to even it out and not run out of the ability to pay benefits. the last adjustment was made in 1994, but the disability account was only adjusted for about 20 years. at the time, it was understood that there would be a need for more action dealing with disability because of a very fundamental demographic change: we have a lot more women in the workforce and the baby boom generation is moving into the years in their careers where they are more prone to disability claims. and, sure enough, that projection is right. around december of next year, we will no longer be able to pay full disability payments unless there is an adjustment. well, the fix that has been done 11 times over the years, on a bipartisan basis, has been made infinitely more difficult because of a rule change that our friends on the republican side have adopted for this congress. under what they have approved, it will be impossible to make that simple adjustment that we have done time and time again if a single member of the house of representatives objects. this is setting up an artificial crisis. there is a need to adjust funding for both social security and disability because, combined, in about 2033 or 2034 they will not be able to pay out full benefits. that is why it is important for congress to be able to step forward and deal with it meaningfully, but it is not something you do in a crisis, and it is not something that should be done by picking out the one area in which 11 million citizens rely on these for disability payments. it should be done thoughtfully and carefully. if people are concerned about fraud and misuse, i would suggest that my republican friends look at what they did in the budget process. over the last 3 years, they have cut 7 percent out of the budget for the social security administration that could have gone to deal with enforcement and that could have gone to deal with fraud and abuse. it could have gone to make sure that the program is operating properly. instead, we have set up a crisis to try and force reductions in benefits for [[page h1088]] some of our most vulnerable. i think it is not the way we should go. we shouldn't be having government by cliff, but we also ought to be dealing with it in a thoughtful and reasonable fashion to make the adjustments that make it sustainable. in the meantime, the republican leadership ought to waive that rule-- like they routinely do for things that they care about, like passing billions of dollars of unfunded tax cuts--to be able to allow the rebalancing to occur and the decisionmaking to be made in a thoughtful and reasonable fashion. ____________________",5063

The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. Hoyer) for 5 minutes. Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, I appreciate what the gentleman has just said about those challenges and threats, along with the undermining of our national security, but it is further at risk this week by our own hand; that is, the Congress of the United States. The Department of Homeland Security will not be funded. There are 230,000 people who work at that Department, and 30,000 of them, mostly administrative personnel, will be laid off. The others, known as critically important--essential employees who are on the front line-- will work, but they won't get paid. We can lament what others have done to undermine our national security and share--I think in a bipartisan way--the conclusion that we ought not to further those enterprises, but as I said, Mr. Speaker, by our own hand we are about to shut down the Department of Homeland Security. We have but 4 days to pass a bill continuing its funding. I will say with all due respect, Mr. Speaker, to my friends on the other side of the aisle, shutting down the government is a strategy they have employed on a number of occasions. In 1995, we shut it down twice, for almost a month, maybe a little longer. {time} 1215 Just a few months ago, we shut it down again as a strategy--not as a happenstance, but as a strategy. Again, Mr. Speaker, there are those who are saying in this House: Well, it won't matter if we shut down the Department of Homeland Security. Some of the folks are funded on fees, others will be required to work anyway, so let's just keep playing this Russian roulette with America's security and the safety of Americans. Mr. Speaker, we are approaching the eleventh hour, and the House has not yet been given the opportunity to vote on a bill that, essentially, was agreed to by the Republican Appropriations Committee and reported to this floor, and we essentially passed it, but we passed it for a short period of time. There was no debate on funding levels, Mr. Speaker. There was no debate on whether this provision and that provision should or should not be in the bill. We passed it. Then the Republicans, Mr. Speaker, to accomplish another objective, have done what they said in the pledge to America they would not do, and that is put two different issues in the same bill. Well, they have put a poison pill in this bill. If we fail to act and send the President a bill he can and will sign, a bill free from partisan policy riders, then thousands of our Homeland Security agents will be furloughed, and almost--as I said--200,000 others will be forced to work without pay. Is that what America has come to? Surely not--the impact on our border security, law enforcement, and homeland security will be serious and make our country more vulnerable to threats. I came to the rostrum after a gentleman on the other side of the aisle correctly expressed concerns about the threats that confront us. I would hope he would join me in advocating and urging the Republican leadership to bring to the floor a clean--and by clean, I simply mean a bill on which both parties have essentially agreed. Chairman Mike McCaul, the Republican who leads the House Committee [[Page H1089]] on Homeland Security said yesterday--Mr. Speaker, this is the Republican chairman of the Homeland Security Committee: ``I fully believe we should not be playing politics with the national security agency like the Department of Homeland Security, particularly given the high threat environment that we're in right now.'' What American would say it makes sense to play politics with Homeland Security in light of what the gentleman has just referenced and which all of us know to be the case? We have people who want to harm us as a people and as a nation. Mr. Speaker, this body has a responsibility to the American people to do everything we can to make them as secure as we can and to make our country as secure as we can. Senator Lindsey Graham, with whom I served in this body who now represents South Carolina and is a Republican Member of the Senate and an expert on national security, he told his Republican colleagues this--and, again, I quote: ``The worst possible outcome for this Nation is to defund the Department of Homeland Security, given the multiple threats we face to our homeland, and I will not be part of it.'' None of us ought to be part of it. 435 of us ought to vote to fund the Homeland Security Department starting on Friday. I urge the Republican majority to heed this advice of Mr. McCaul, of Mr. Graham, and, frankly, countless other Republicans in the Senate and some in the House to do the responsible thing and let this House work its will on the single subject of our national security. If a clean Homeland Security appropriation bill were to come to the floor, I am confident--and I tell my friend and the majority leader, Mr. Speaker, every Democrat will vote for it. We are 188 strong. Surely, there are 30 responsible Republicans who care more about our national security than their politics who would join us in voting for that bill--I am confident of that--many more, I think, than 30, but at least 30 would be needed, with 188, to get to the 218, and we would fund the Department of Homeland Security, and we could do it tomorrow. We could probably do it today by unanimous consent--well, no, I don't think we could do it by unanimous consent because there are some who continue to play politics with our national security. If the majority is dissatisfied with our immigration policy which they articulate and legitimately can have an alternative view to express and to try to enact, that is the democratic process. Offer a bill to change that which they do not like, not hold hostage the Department of Homeland Security until hopefully, from their standpoint, the President is bludgeoned into signing a bill that he does not agree with and he does not believe is good for our country and believes is bad for our economy. If the majority is dissatisfied, bring a bill to the floor. Former Homeland Security Secretary Tom Ridge, also a Republican with whom I have served when he was a Representative from Pennsylvania, subsequently the Governor of Pennsylvania and then our first Secretary of Homeland Security, I want to quote him as well as I have quoted the other two Republicans that I have quoted. ``Political folly'' and ``bad policy,'' that is Tom Ridge, former Republican Governor and mentioned for President. He went on to say: ``I think the political repercussions could be severe. And, on top of that, the men and women of Homeland Security deserve better.'' Who wants to work for an employer that simply takes them hostage every few months and says to them: You may or may not get paid, you may or may not be able to come to work, you may or may not be able to do your job. It depends upon whether or not our political ends are served. I urge Republican leaders to keep the pledge they made to the American people to consider issues one at a time. Bring a comprehensive immigration reform bill. If you don't like what the President has done, bring a bill that changes that. We have the power to do that. Do it. We can work in a bipartisan way to change our immigration policies through legislation and fix what everybody in this body believes is a broken system. Bring a clean appropriation bill to the floor to fund the Department of Homeland Security, and then, as well, bring a bill to the floor on comprehensive immigration reform or the bill that our Republican friends think is the appropriate bill to fix a broken system, and we will vote and debate on that. But let the Department of Homeland Security do its job for America, for Americans. Let's exercise responsible, adult legislating this time. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 31 (Tuesday, February 24, 2015)] [House] [Pages H1088-H1089] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] HOMELAND SECURITY FUNDING The SPEAKER pro tempore.

surely not--the impact on our border security, law enforcement, and homeland security will be serious and make our country more vulnerable to threats. i came to the rostrum after a gentleman on the other side of the aisle correctly expressed concerns about the threats that confront us. i would hope he would join me in advocating and urging the republican leadership to bring to the floor a clean--and by clean, i simply mean a bill on which both parties have essentially agreed. chairman mike mccaul, the republican who leads the house committee [[page h1089]] on homeland security said yesterday--mr. speaker, this is the republican chairman of the homeland security committee: ``i fully believe we should not be playing politics with the national security agency like the department of homeland security, particularly given the high threat environment that we're in right now.'' what american would say it makes sense to play politics with homeland security in light of what the gentleman has just referenced and which all of us know to be the case? we have people who want to harm us as a people and as a nation. mr. speaker, this body has a responsibility to the american people to do everything we can to make them as secure as we can and to make our country as secure as we can. senator lindsey graham, with whom i served in this body who now represents south carolina and is a republican member of the senate and an expert on national security, he told his republican colleagues this--and, again, i quote: ``the worst possible outcome for this nation is to defund the department of homeland security, given the multiple threats we face to our homeland, and i will not be part of it.'' none of us ought to be part of it. 435 of us ought to vote to fund the homeland security department starting on friday. i urge the republican majority to heed this advice of mr. mccaul, of mr. graham, and, frankly, countless other republicans in the senate and some in the house to do the responsible thing and let this house work its will on the single subject of our national security. if a clean homeland security appropriation bill were to come to the floor, i am confident--and i tell my friend and the majority leader, mr. speaker, every democrat will vote for it. we are 188 strong. surely, there are 30 responsible republicans who care more about our national security than their politics who would join us in voting for that bill--i am confident of that--many more, i think, than 30, but at least 30 would be needed, with 188, to get to the 218, and we would fund the department of homeland security, and we could do it tomorrow. we could probably do it today by unanimous consent--well, no, i don't think we could do it by unanimous consent because there are some who continue to play politics with our national security. if the majority is dissatisfied with our immigration policy which they articulate and legitimately can have an alternative view to express and to try to enact, that is the democratic process. offer a bill to change that which they do not like, not hold hostage the department of homeland security until hopefully, from their standpoint, the president is bludgeoned into signing a bill that he does not agree with and he does not believe is good for our country and believes is bad for our economy. if the majority is dissatisfied, bring a bill to the floor. former homeland security secretary tom ridge, also a republican with whom i have served when he was a representative from pennsylvania, subsequently the governor of pennsylvania and then our first secretary of homeland security, i want to quote him as well as i have quoted the other two republicans that i have quoted. ``political folly'' and ``bad policy,'' that is tom ridge, former republican governor and mentioned for president. he went on to say: ``i think the political repercussions could be severe. and, on top of that, the men and women of homeland security deserve better.'' who wants to work for an employer that simply takes them hostage every few months and says to them: you may or may not get paid, you may or may not be able to come to work, you may or may not be able to do your job. it depends upon whether or not our political ends are served. i urge republican leaders to keep the pledge they made to the american people to consider issues one at a time. bring a comprehensive immigration reform bill. if you don't like what the president has done, bring a bill that changes that. we have the power to do that. do it. we can work in a bipartisan way to change our immigration policies through legislation and fix what everybody in this body believes is a broken system. bring a clean appropriation bill to the floor to fund the department of homeland security, and then, as well, bring a bill to the floor on comprehensive immigration reform or the bill that our republican friends think is the appropriate bill to fix a broken system, and we will vote and debate on that. but let the department of homeland security do its job for america, for americans. let's exercise responsible, adult legislating this time. ____________________",8050

The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Poe) for 5 minutes. Mr. POE of Texas. Mr. Speaker, this week we learned that three British school girls between the ages of 15 and 16 left their families and have gone to fight with ISIS in Syria. How were they recruited to join? Well, apparently through social media. And they are not alone. Terrorists have used Twitter to radicalize thousands of young impressionable minds throughout the world and recruit new jihadists. They have also used it as a way to fundraise millions of dollars for their reign of terror. ISIS also uses Twitter to broadcast its barbaric acts and propaganda to the world. On February 3, ISIS tweeted a video of its evil, horrific burning of a captured Jordanian pilot. Last August, when ISIS released a gruesome beheading of American journalist James Foley, it did so on, yes, Twitter. There are many more examples. All of these groups--ISIS, AQAP, AQIM--are officially listed as designated Foreign Terrorist Organizations by our government. Federal law prohibits giving aid or helping a designated Foreign Terrorist Organization. These FTOs use Twitter, an American company, as a tool, and no one is stopping them. Why are American companies and the U.S. Government allowing social media platforms to be hijacked by terrorists? Some suggest that if the U.S. Government were to shut down terrorists' social media accounts, such measures would be violating terrorists' free speech rights. They are wrong. There are no constitutional protections to those who incite violence. No one supports the Bill of Rights more than I do, but free speech has its limitations, just as there are no constitutional protections for child pornography. Terrorists should not have access to an American-controlled social media platform so they can kill, rape, pillage, and burn. There is precedence for this position. The Supreme Court has already ruled and held in the case of Holder v. Humanitarian Law Project that if someone has aided a designated Foreign Terrorist Organization, they do not have constitutional protections of free speech. Twitter has argued that the Feds do not want the terrorists' Twitter accounts taken down because they, the Feds, want to track the bad guys. However, keeping these Twitter accounts up has neither stopped nor slowed the terrorists' recruitment, propaganda, calls for violence, or fundraising efforts. Instead, allowing the terrorists to continue using Twitter has helped radicalize hundreds of foreign fighters and raised millions of dollars for them. The sad reality is that today, there are more terrorists using social media than ever before. Private American companies should not be operating as the propaganda mouthpiece of designated foreign terrorist organizations. Mr. Speaker, during World War II, we never would have allowed America's foreign enemies to take out ads in The New York Times recruiting Americans to join the Nazis and go abroad and fight and kill Americans. Today is no different. Social media companies need to do more. Private companies not only have a public responsibility but a legal obligation to be proactive. Section 219 of the Immigration and Nationality Act states that it is unlawful to provide a designated Foreign Terrorist Organization--like ISIS--with ``material support or resources,'' including ``any property, tangible or intangible, or services.'' That is about as comprehensive as you can get. You don't need to be a law school professor to understand this law actually applies to Twitter. It is mind-boggling to think that those who behead and burn others alive are able to use our own companies against us to further their cause. This is nutty. But that is exactly what is occurring. As a result, there are more than 15,000 foreign fighters, many of whom have been radicalized online, now fighting in Iraq and Syria. That is more than there were in the 14 years of war in Afghanistan. Designated Foreign Terrorist Organizations should not be allowed to use private American companies to reach billions of people with their violent hate propaganda and recruitment. It is time to put a stop to this. It is time for Twitter to take down terrorists' accounts.

The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from [[Page H1090]] California (Ms. Roybal-Allard) for 5 minutes. Ms. ROYBAL-ALLARD. Mr. Speaker, in December of 2014, as leverage against the President's immigration executive order, the Republican leadership irresponsibly decided to hold hostage the 2015 funding for the Department of Homeland Security. We are now 147 days in fiscal year 2015, just 4 days away from February 28, when the continuing resolution currently funding the Department will expire. The serious consequence of inaction by the Republican leadership is that it will leave the Department without the funds needed to effectively fulfill its mission of protecting our homeland. It is unbelievable that given the urgency of our national security, House Republicans continue failing to put forward a realistic plan to fund the Department of Homeland Security. Mistakenly, some Republicans believe the Department is doing just fine under the continuing resolution. Some even say it is okay to let DHS funding expire. Other Republicans suggest the preliminary Texas district court injunction, which blocks implementation of the President's executive action on immigration, is reason enough to continue holding hostage the funding for Homeland Security. These are dangerously wrong conclusions. Secretary Johnson and agency heads have warned that if the CR is allowed to expire, national security operations will be disrupted, and essential personnel will be required to work without pay. They also warn passing another CR will not address the uncertainty of being able to meet our long-term national security needs. Our national security cannot wait for the unrelated issue of the President's executive actions on immigration to work its way through the judicial process which, at best, is likely to take several months. By contrast, Democrats have a responsible solution. Two weeks ago, Appropriations Committee Ranking Member Nita Lowey and I introduced H.R. 861. It is a clean appropriations bill that funds the Department of Homeland Security for the remainder of fiscal year 2015. It is not a Democratic bill. If it were, it would more closely reflect Democratic priorities. Rather, H.R. 861 contains the precise language of the November 2014 bipartisan bill negotiated in good faith by chairs and ranking members of the House and Senate Homeland Security Appropriations Subcommittees. This is the bill that was intended to be part of the 2015 omnibus legislation that funded the rest of the Federal Government. It is the bill that will enable the Department of Homeland Security to address our Nation's current and most pressing security needs. I am pleased that H.R. 861 is cosponsored by every Democrat in the House, and we urge our Republican colleagues to join us. {time} 1230 This bipartisan, bicameral bill will pass the House, pass the Senate, and be signed into law by the President. All it needs is for the Republican leadership to bring the bill to the floor for a vote. Surely our Nation need not experience attacks like those in Paris and Copenhagen before we show our resolve to fund our Department of Homeland Security. Let us not wait around and hope Senate Republicans do the responsible thing. House Republicans should lead by bringing H.R. 861 for a vote and making it clear to the American people that our Nation's security takes priority over political and unrelated policy debates. Failure to do so and letting funding for Homeland Security expire or taking the easy way out by kicking a viable solution down the road with a continuing resolution represents a failure in fulfilling our most basic responsibility as Members of Congress: to protect the American people and our country from harm.

By contrast, Democrats have a responsible solution. Two weeks ago, Appropriations Committee Ranking Member Nita Lowey and I introduced H.R. 861. It is a clean appropriations bill that funds the Department of Homeland Security for the remainder of fiscal year 2015. It is not a Democratic bill. If it were, it would more closely reflect Democratic priorities. Rather, H.R. 861 contains the precise language of the November 2014 bipartisan bill negotiated in good faith by chairs and ranking members of the House and Senate Homeland Security Appropriations Subcommittees. This is the bill that was intended to be part of the 2015 omnibus legislation that funded the rest of the Federal Government. It is the bill that will enable the Department of Homeland Security to address our Nation's current and most pressing security needs. I am pleased that H.R. 861 is cosponsored by every Democrat in the House, and we urge our Republican colleagues to join us. {time} 1230 This bipartisan, bicameral bill will pass the House, pass the Senate, and be signed into law by the President. All it needs is for the Republican leadership to bring the bill to the floor for a vote. Surely our Nation need not experience attacks like those in Paris and Copenhagen before we show our resolve to fund our Department of Homeland Security. Let us not wait around and hope Senate Republicans do the responsible thing. House Republicans should lead by bringing H.R. 861 for a vote and making it clear to the American people that our Nation's security takes priority over political and unrelated policy debates. Failure to do so and letting funding for Homeland Security expire or taking the easy way out by kicking a viable solution down the road with a continuing resolution represents a failure in fulfilling our most basic responsibility as Members of Congress: to protect the American people and our country from harm.

We all had the opportunity for the first time this session to go back home last week for our district workweek, and I had an opportunity to speak about this particular issue at the Honolulu International Airport, where many of our DHS officials and employees are very concerned about this lapse of funding. Although some DHS employees would continue to work in the event of a shutdown, they would be forced to do so without pay, creating a significant distraction and dealing a significant blow to morale. Every single House Democrat has cosponsored clean legislation to fund DHS, and it is clear that there are a sufficient amount of votes to pass this bill now. Keeping America's families safe is the first responsibility and priority of this Congress. We need to put aside the political gridlock that has plagued this House for too long and fund DHS now. An impasse in funding would close down the bulk of DHS' management and support of Homeland Security infrastructure that was built following the 9/11 terrorist attacks. Essential funding for the Department of Homeland Security is no place for grandstanding against immigration reform that strengthens our economy and our country. Let's remember: it was the inability of this House to act on the Senate's comprehensive immigration reform bill that forced the President to take executive action on immigration in the first place. I came to Congress telling my constituents that I do not support government shutdowns, Federal furloughs, or sequestration, and now some in this body think they can fix this with further inaction, with further furloughs and further government shutdowns.

The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from North Carolina (Ms. Foxx) for 5 minutes. Ms. FOXX. Mr. Speaker, today I rise to recognize a pioneering school in Wilkesboro, North Carolina. Established in 2009, Wilkes Early College High School is a partnership between Wilkes County Schools and Wilkes Community College. The school provides a small learning community of students the opportunity to earn both a high school diploma and an associate degree. It is a 5-year school which enrolls approximately 60 ninth graders each year and is located on the campus of Wilkes Community College where students are enrolled in both honors-level high school classes and college courses. The mission of Wilkes Early College High School is to provide a personalized program of study that will empower students to be lifelong, community-oriented learners who possess the technical and leadership skills needed for personal and professional success in a global community. The $40 annual fee, which covers textbooks and enrollment, is an extremely affordable way to help students reach their education goals, especially when you consider that the average tuition and fees was $2,305 for a public 2-year institution in North Carolina this year and $6,677 for a public 4-year institution. And those costs have increased 30 percent over the last 5 years. Many of the students who attend Wilkes Early College High School are the first in their family to attend college. As a result, Principal Dion Stocks and his staff are working hard to outline expectations and guide students through the process of applying to a 4-year institution. Seminar classes are provided to assist students with understanding college expectations, the application process, and financial aid. Last year, 21 students earned their associate degree in the school's first official graduating class, and 20 students are expected to earn their degree this year. Wilkes Early College High School provides an advanced educational experience that equips students for success in college, career, and life. America needs more of this type of innovative learning. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 31 (Tuesday, February 24, 2015)] [House] [Page H1090] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] WILKES EARLY COLLEGE HIGH SCHOOL The SPEAKER pro tempore.

The Chair recognizes the gentleman from California (Mr. Denham) for 5 minutes. Mr. DENHAM. Madam Speaker, I rise today to acknowledge and honor the life of a beloved community leader and friend from Victor Valley College. Willie Davis Pringle, also known as Big Will, was a beloved father, grandfather, brother, uncle, and coach. He died at the age of 62 on Tuesday, January 6, of this year. Willie began his career at Victor Valley College, where he worked for 33 years. He was an active member of his community, and he advocated for students, the disabled, and the disadvantaged. While at VVC, Willie also met the woman and coworker who later became his wife, Mary. Willie was a member of the Victor Valley Elementary School Board for 16 years. He assisted the disabled through job opportunities and benefits, served on the Hesperia Truancy Board, and was a member of the City of Victorville Advisory Board and Planning Commission. He also served as a member of the supervisory committee for the Victor Valley Federal Credit Union and was currently serving as president of the board of directors for Excelsior Charter School. For many years, Willie would help serve meals to the homeless with the Salvation Army. Recently, he was recognized by the Los Angeles County Alliance, the California Alliance, and the National Alliance of Black School Educators for his service as a school board member. In 2009, Victor Valley Community College presented him with the Distinguished Service Award. Willie was a lot more than that to many of us students. In the 33 years that he spent there, he was a friend; he was a mentor; he would talk to you as you walked through the campus; he would recognize if you weren't in class that day. Many times, he would seek you out in the community to make sure that you were staying out of trouble. This mentor meant so much to so many of us, and he is going to be sorely missed. In December, Victor Valley College officials hosted a dedication ceremony in honor of the 33-year college employee, naming the college's athletic training room after him. Pringle served as the Rams' head football coach and athletic director, and he later became the director of student services before retiring. He gave a lot of advice to many of us, encouraging us to seek out other opportunities. For me, I became student body president. And we had many other football players that followed in those same footsteps, at Willie's request. He kept us busy. He mentored us. He got us involved and engaged. Madam Speaker, please join me in honoring and recognizing Willie Davis Pringle for his unwavering leadership and many accomplishments and contributions. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 31 (Tuesday, February 24, 2015)] [House] [Page H1091] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] REMEMBERING WILLIE DAVIS ``BIG WILL'' PRINGLE The SPEAKER pro tempore (Ms. Foxx).

Madam Speaker, in 3 short days, absent congressional action, funding for the Department of Homeland Security will lapse and the Department will be forced to shut down. Should this be allowed, the vast majority of the DHS workforce will be required to work without pay until a funding agreement is reached. The remainder--more than 30,000 dedicated individuals--will be furloughed with no guarantee of backpay. Congress must act immediately to enact legislation that would fully fund the Department and allow these men and women who live and work in every district in every State to continue to carry out the critical message of keeping our Nation healthy, safe, and strong. But in the absence of such action, with time running dangerously short, DHS employees, at the very least, must be assured that there is an agreement in Congress that they will receive their full pay in a fair and timely manner.

The Chair recognizes the gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. Walker) for 5 minutes. Mr. WALKER. Madam Speaker, in traveling throughout the district this past week, people shared with me their frustration at the ambiguous language from this administration in describing the evils of radical Islamist terrorism. Though I greatly respect the office of the President, I too have grown weary at the timidity. While other world leaders have come to the forefront, our President continues to be defensive, at best. At first glance, the silence appears to be passive or poor leadership. But I am inclined to believe that the President's posture is not one of weakness but, rather, an intentional directive in both rhetoric and action. It appears that his promise to take our country in a fundamentally new direction is being played out in realtime. Instead of defending our liberty and our way of life, which is the most charitable in the world, our President seems to scoff at the belief that our country has been uniquely blessed by God. I would be remiss today if I did not pause and remember our Egyptian Christian brothers in the recent barbaric attacks in Libya. ISIS murdered innocent husbands and fathers who clearly died for their faith and their beliefs. Just this morning, we hear further reports out of Syria that Islamic State militants have abducted dozens of Christians, including women and children. Weeks prior, the President chastised the Christian community for getting on their judgmental high horses. Yet, in describing our martyred brothers from Egypt, the President refused to even utter the word, ``Christian.'' The undermining of our beliefs has become an issue with this President. This very week, we face a constitutional crisis that was created solely by this administration. House Republicans have passed legislation to fully fund the Department of Homeland Security, yet this President is now asking me and my colleagues to do something that, for 6 years and on more than 20 occasions, he said was outside the law. Throughout history, strong leaders have exhibited strength in times of crises. Recently, Tony Blair met with a few of us and gave a great speech on the concerns and the ills of extreme terrorism. He said this, and I haven't forgotten it. He said: America, it is not your job to be loved; it is your job to lead. Today, I beseech the President to lead by clearly defining this expanding extremism that is ISIS, al Qaeda, Boko Haram, al Shabaab, and other radical Islamic fundamentalists. {time} 1245 There are times when riding the high horse of justice is our only option.

Mr. Speaker, soon the House of Representatives is expected to vote on H.R. 5, the Student Success Act. H.R. 5 represents a long overdue rewrite of the current No Child Left Behind with new policies that aim to ensure that every student in this country has access to a quality public education. For years our Federal education policy has been failing our Nation's students--the statistics do not lie. Today only 38 percent of seniors in high school can read at grade level, and just 26 percent are proficient in math. While I do not believe that any Member can be in total agreement with every aspect of the proposed bill, it is important to recognize the underlying goal of reducing the Federal Government's role in education while empowering States and especially local school districts with discretion over academic standards and testing. While truly well intentioned, the current law places undue pressures upon young learners and has turned hardworking, compassionate teachers into test proctors. This is not fair to those who have worked tirelessly to ensure our children are receiving a quality education, nor is it fair to our children, who are not receiving a well-rounded education but memorizing answers to specific test questions. It has become overwhelmingly clear that the Washington bureaucrats don't know how to educate our children.

The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from New York (Ms. Stefanik) for 5 minutes. Ms. STEFANIK. ``Do you believe in miracles?'' Madam Speaker, these were the iconic words uttered by legendary sportscaster Al Michaels with just 3 seconds left in the historic match between Team USA and the Soviet national hockey team in the 1980 Winter Olympics in Lake Placid. With the eyes of the world on the Lake Placid games, through sheer grit and determination, an amateur Team USA proudly did what many thought would be impossible by defeating the favored Soviet team. [[Page H1092]] Decades of cold war politics made this event more than just an ordinary hockey game. For many, it was one more proud reminder of what a determined and united America can accomplish. I grew up hearing this story firsthand from my dad, who was in Lake Placid with his best friend, Doug Brownell, when the underdog Team USA won and the crowds erupted in cheers. It was an awe-inspiring moment for our entire country and the world. Our community in Lake Placid and the North Country still celebrate this incredible occasion.

The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Ohio. general leave Mr. LATTA. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and insert extraneous materials in the Record on the bill. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Ohio? There was no objection. Mr. LATTA. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 212, the Drinking Water Protection Act, which I reintroduced from last Congress in January. This important, bipartisan legislation requires the EPA to develop and submit a strategic plan to Congress for assessing and managing risks associated with algal toxins in drinking water provided by public water systems. Unfortunately, from the Great Lakes to other surface freshwaters across the country, algal toxins, produced by harmful algal blooms, are presenting a serious concern to human health and safety. Last August, half a million people in the Toledo, Ohio, area, including many of my constituents, weren't able to utilize their public drinking water for over 2 days without risking potentially negative health effects due to a high level of algal toxins detected in the city's public water supply. During that time, concerns and questions were and have since been raised about health effects data, testing protocols, treatment processes, and appropriate short- and long-term responses. Furthermore, during hearings in the House Energy and Commerce Committee, witnesses testified about the further complexity of this issue due to the numerous other algal toxins and variants that may have potential negative health effects when present in public drinking water. I commend the work that the U.S. EPA, the State of Ohio, and others have done since the Toledo water emergency to ensure public safety; however, the situation demonstrated the need for a more strategic, comprehensive, and strong scientific approach to protect our citizens' public drinking water. I believe H.R. 212 does just this. Specifically, the legislation calls for the EPA's strategic plan to include steps and timelines to: evaluate the risk to human health from drinking water provided by public water systems contaminated with algal toxins; establish, publish, and update a comprehensive list of algal toxins which the administrator determines may have an adverse effect on human health when present in public drinking water and provide a summary of those known adverse effects; publish health advisories and testing methods if the EPA determines it is warranted based on the published list; recommend feasible treatment options; enter into cooperative agreements and provide technical assistance to affected States and public water systems to manage risks associated with algal toxins; and identify gaps in the EPA's understanding of algal toxins. I want to thank all the cosponsors of this bill as well as Chairman Upton, [[Page H1095]] Subcommittee Chairman Shimkus, and all the other staff and stakeholders who have worked diligently on this important legislation. I urge the full support of my colleagues for H.R. 212. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, harmful algal blooms are a serious and growing threat to public health. The toxins they produce threaten communities that draw their water from coastal areas and the Great Lakes. They also pose risks to those who swim in contaminated waters or eat contaminated fish. Health impacts include skin and eye irritation, gastrointestinal illness, cancer, paralysis, and even death. Economic impacts are also serious, adversely affecting fishing, recreation, and tourism. Estimates of annual costs of these algal blooms in the United States are in the billions of dollars. This summer, Toledo, Ohio, experienced a profound disruption when citizens woke to a ``do not drink'' order. The impacts were significant and widespread. But the problem is not limited to Ohio or Lake Erie. Harmful algal blooms have been a recurring problem in my home State of New Jersey for decades. So I appreciate that the majority is taking up this bipartisan legislation to begin to address this most important environmental problem. This bill is a good step. More needs to be done. I am happy to say that language reported from the Energy and Commerce Committee reflects several changes sought by Democratic members of the committee. The bill was broadened to ensure that EPA will look at all algal toxins that may have an adverse effect on human health and consider source water protection measures, which are the preferred and most effective approach to managing harmful algal blooms. I thank the chairmen and majority staff for working with Ranking Member Tonko, myself, and the Democratic staff to improve the bill. For too long, Republicans in Congress have been more interested in attacking the EPA than supporting the important work the Agency does to protect human health, and safe drinking water should be a bipartisan issue. Unfortunately, this bill does lack resources. Addressing cyanotoxins in drinking water is very expensive for States and water utilities. If Congress doesn't make funding available at the Federal level, the money will have to come out of already strained State budgets or out of consumers' pockets. The cooperative agreements envisioned in the bill can address some of these costs, Mr. Speaker, but only if they are funded, and the strategic plan will have no impact if there are no resources to carry it out. So I hope this bill can be the start of broader drinking water work to address important threats like climate change, fracking, security, and aging infrastructure. As we continue our drinking water work this Congress, I hope the majority will recognize the importance of funding in addressing these needs. Resources are central to the conversation about safe drinking water. Much of our Nation's drinking water infrastructure is well beyond its useful life and in desperate need of replacement. Algae and other emerging threats, spurred by climate change and other factors, add to the challenge. Investing in drinking water infrastructure protects public health, creates jobs, and boosts the economy, and this is something that we should all support. Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleagues on the Energy and Commerce Committee, the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Latta), and my good friend from Ohio (Ms. Kaptur) for their hard work to address an important environmental threat. I support this bill. I urge its adoption. I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. LATTA. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I, too, would ask that the House pass H.R. 212. I appreciate, again, all of the work from all the members and the staff in putting this bill together and getting it on the floor, and also Chairman Upton for his work on the legislation as well as Chairman Shimkus. I yield back the balance of my time. Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the Drinking Water Protection Act, to arm communities against the threats posed by toxic algae. The water emergency across the Toledo region for three days last August highlighted the need for a more robust federal response to harmful algal blooms in our Great Lakes and around the country. Nearly half a million people, businesses, and hospitals were without fresh water from the city's system. First and foremost, Northern Ohio--which draws its sustenance from Lake Erie--has to guarantee our water is safe to drink. Our communities must be informed and prepared to respond, in the event of another emergency. This bill is an important step in the right direction. It is my hope that it expedites work at the U.S. EPA to publish long- overdue guidelines on safe consumption limits and testing protocols, in addition to treatment methods--information the EPA has been working on for more than a decade and a half. This is information that our mayors, our governor, and our citizens are clamoring for. Congress needs to pass this bill, and I hope our counterparts in the Senate will take up the measure quickly. Still, this bill only addresses one facet of the challenge. We must meet the larger challenge of stopping the growth of these blooms at their source--the nutrients flooding through our rivers, into Lake Erie. That imperative is not included in this particular bill, but we are working through programs like the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative to install conservation projects across our watershed. Congress should overturn the ill-advised proposed cuts to the GLRI program and fully fund it. The EPA and Corps of Engineers are also working to better protect our waterways through the Clean Water Act. If we are interested in protecting our Lakes and rivers and the communities that rely on them, Congress should stop opposing this important progress. Until the flow of algae-feeding nutrients into the lake is stopped, the risk of further water emergencies will persist. I urge my colleagues to join me in this broader effort, and that starts by supporting the bill before us today. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Latta) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 212, as amended. The question was taken. The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the opinion of the Chair, two-thirds being in the affirmative, the ayes have it. Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays. The yeas and nays were ordered. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further proceedings on this motion will be postponed. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 31 (Tuesday, February 24, 2015)] [House] [Pages H1094-H1095] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] DRINKING WATER PROTECTION ACT Mr. LATTA.

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Latta) and the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Pallone) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Ohio. general leave Mr. LATTA. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and insert extraneous materials in the Record on the bill. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Ohio? There was no objection. Mr. LATTA. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 212, the Drinking Water Protection Act, which I reintroduced from last Congress in January. This important, bipartisan legislation requires the EPA to develop and submit a strategic plan to Congress for assessing and managing risks associated with algal toxins in drinking water provided by public water systems. Unfortunately, from the Great Lakes to other surface freshwaters across the country, algal toxins, produced by harmful algal blooms, are presenting a serious concern to human health and safety. Last August, half a million people in the Toledo, Ohio, area, including many of my constituents, weren't able to utilize their public drinking water for over 2 days without risking potentially negative health effects due to a high level of algal toxins detected in the city's public water supply. During that time, concerns and questions were and have since been raised about health effects data, testing protocols, treatment processes, and appropriate short- and long-term responses. Furthermore, during hearings in the House Energy and Commerce Committee, witnesses testified about the further complexity of this issue due to the numerous other algal toxins and variants that may have potential negative health effects when present in public drinking water. I commend the work that the U.S. EPA, the State of Ohio, and others have done since the Toledo water emergency to ensure public safety; however, the situation demonstrated the need for a more strategic, comprehensive, and strong scientific approach to protect our citizens' public drinking water. I believe H.R. 212 does just this. Specifically, the legislation calls for the EPA's strategic plan to include steps and timelines to: evaluate the risk to human health from drinking water provided by public water systems contaminated with algal toxins; establish, publish, and update a comprehensive list of algal toxins which the administrator determines may have an adverse effect on human health when present in public drinking water and provide a summary of those known adverse effects; publish health advisories and testing methods if the EPA determines it is warranted based on the published list; recommend feasible treatment options; enter into cooperative agreements and provide technical assistance to affected States and public water systems to manage risks associated with algal toxins; and identify gaps in the EPA's understanding of algal toxins. I want to thank all the cosponsors of this bill as well as Chairman Upton, [[Page H1095]] Subcommittee Chairman Shimkus, and all the other staff and stakeholders who have worked diligently on this important legislation. I urge the full support of my colleagues for H.R. 212. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, harmful algal blooms are a serious and growing threat to public health. The toxins they produce threaten communities that draw their water from coastal areas and the Great Lakes. They also pose risks to those who swim in contaminated waters or eat contaminated fish. Health impacts include skin and eye irritation, gastrointestinal illness, cancer, paralysis, and even death. Economic impacts are also serious, adversely affecting fishing, recreation, and tourism. Estimates of annual costs of these algal blooms in the United States are in the billions of dollars. This summer, Toledo, Ohio, experienced a profound disruption when citizens woke to a ``do not drink'' order. The impacts were significant and widespread. But the problem is not limited to Ohio or Lake Erie. Harmful algal blooms have been a recurring problem in my home State of New Jersey for decades. So I appreciate that the majority is taking up this bipartisan legislation to begin to address this most important environmental problem. This bill is a good step. More needs to be done. I am happy to say that language reported from the Energy and Commerce Committee reflects several changes sought by Democratic members of the committee. The bill was broadened to ensure that EPA will look at all algal toxins that may have an adverse effect on human health and consider source water protection measures, which are the preferred and most effective approach to managing harmful algal blooms. I thank the chairmen and majority staff for working with Ranking Member Tonko, myself, and the Democratic staff to improve the bill. For too long, Republicans in Congress have been more interested in attacking the EPA than supporting the important work the Agency does to protect human health, and safe drinking water should be a bipartisan issue. Unfortunately, this bill does lack resources. Addressing cyanotoxins in drinking water is very expensive for States and water utilities. If Congress doesn't make funding available at the Federal level, the money will have to come out of already strained State budgets or out of consumers' pockets. The cooperative agreements envisioned in the bill can address some of these costs, Mr. Speaker, but only if they are funded, and the strategic plan will have no impact if there are no resources to carry it out. So I hope this bill can be the start of broader drinking water work to address important threats like climate change, fracking, security, and aging infrastructure. As we continue our drinking water work this Congress, I hope the majority will recognize the importance of funding in addressing these needs. Resources are central to the conversation about safe drinking water. Much of our Nation's drinking water infrastructure is well beyond its useful life and in desperate need of replacement. Algae and other emerging threats, spurred by climate change and other factors, add to the challenge. Investing in drinking water infrastructure protects public health, creates jobs, and boosts the economy, and this is something that we should all support. Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleagues on the Energy and Commerce Committee, the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Latta), and my good friend from Ohio (Ms. Kaptur) for their hard work to address an important environmental threat. I support this bill. I urge its adoption. I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. LATTA. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I, too, would ask that the House pass H.R. 212. I appreciate, again, all of the work from all the members and the staff in putting this bill together and getting it on the floor, and also Chairman Upton for his work on the legislation as well as Chairman Shimkus. I yield back the balance of my time. Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the Drinking Water Protection Act, to arm communities against the threats posed by toxic algae. The water emergency across the Toledo region for three days last August highlighted the need for a more robust federal response to harmful algal blooms in our Great Lakes and around the country. Nearly half a million people, businesses, and hospitals were without fresh water from the city's system. First and foremost, Northern Ohio--which draws its sustenance from Lake Erie--has to guarantee our water is safe to drink. Our communities must be informed and prepared to respond, in the event of another emergency. This bill is an important step in the right direction. It is my hope that it expedites work at the U.S. EPA to publish long- overdue guidelines on safe consumption limits and testing protocols, in addition to treatment methods--information the EPA has been working on for more than a decade and a half. This is information that our mayors, our governor, and our citizens are clamoring for. Congress needs to pass this bill, and I hope our counterparts in the Senate will take up the measure quickly. Still, this bill only addresses one facet of the challenge. We must meet the larger challenge of stopping the growth of these blooms at their source--the nutrients flooding through our rivers, into Lake Erie. That imperative is not included in this particular bill, but we are working through programs like the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative to install conservation projects across our watershed. Congress should overturn the ill-advised proposed cuts to the GLRI program and fully fund it. The EPA and Corps of Engineers are also working to better protect our waterways through the Clean Water Act. If we are interested in protecting our Lakes and rivers and the communities that rely on them, Congress should stop opposing this important progress. Until the flow of algae-feeding nutrients into the lake is stopped, the risk of further water emergencies will persist. I urge my colleagues to join me in this broader effort, and that starts by supporting the bill before us today. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Latta) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 212, as amended. The question was taken. The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the opinion of the Chair, two-thirds being in the affirmative, the ayes have it. Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays. The yeas and nays were ordered. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further proceedings on this motion will be postponed. ____________________",package_114_116.csv,15219,15219,15290,"[congressional record volume 161, number 31 (tuesday, february 24, 2015)] [house] [pages h1094-h1095] from the congressional record online through the government publishing office [ www.gpo.gov ] drinking water protection act mr. latta. mr. speaker, i move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (h.r. 212) to amend the safe drinking water act to provide for the assessment and management of the risk of cyanotoxins in drinking water, and for other purposes, as amended. the clerk read the title of the bill. the text of the bill is as follows: h.r. 212 be it enacted by the senate and house of representatives of the united states of america in congress assembled, section 1. short title. this act may be cited as the ``drinking water protection act''. sec. 2. amendment to the safe drinking water act.

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from Oregon (Mr. Walden) and the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Pallone) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Oregon. General Leave Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members [[Page H1097]] may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and insert extraneous materials in the Record on the bill. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Oregon? There was no objection. Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, in our multiyear effort to update the Communications Act, one of the most common themes we have heard is the convergence of the telecommunications marketplace. No longer are companies just one service over just one medium. Both technology and consumer expectations have completely changed the game. However, the agency tasked with regulating the communications sector still exists in the outdated and siloed structure that reflects decades-old assumptions, even how they evaluate and report on the industry. While that fractured approach will be a continued focus of our CommActUpdate process, this bill will take an important first step toward modernizing the way we look at this sector and its regulator. This legislation consolidates eight separate reports that require the FCC to evaluate the state of competition in various sectors and combines those eight reports into just a single biennial report to Congress on the communications marketplace as a whole. This bill also takes the important step of eliminating outdated reports that only serve to junk up the Communications Act and cause confusion. Reports like the ORBIT Act--which I have a copy of here--are aimed at ensuring that satellites that were long ago privatized are procompetitive, an examination that the FCC and the industry recognizes as both outdated, unnecessary, and burdensome. There are still laws on the books that address such outdated technologies as telegraphs. This is a small but significant step toward cleaning up the act and modernizing the laws and the agency that control this very dynamic marketplace. Ensuring that all of the reports on the books are both necessary and effective helps to reduce the burden on the agency. It also helps the regulatory agency make more informed decisions. I would like to take a moment to thank my colleagues, Representative Scalise, Ranking Member Eshoo, and the ranking member of the full committee, Mr. Pallone, for their work to make this bill a bipartisan success both today and, frankly, in the last two sessions of Congress. I am hopeful that the first bill to pass out of our subcommittee this Congress is an indication of the work that we can get done when we collaborate. Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to vote in favor of this legislation, and I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 734, the FCC Consolidated Reporting Act of 2015. Congress has charged the Federal Communications Commission with overseeing industries that make up one- sixth of our national economy. The communications and technology sectors are driving economic growth across the Nation, connecting businesses to markets large and small and delivering innovative new products and services to consumers. As part of this critical mission, Congress has tasked the FCC with compiling reports to provide the public with information about these dynamic markets. Democrats and Republicans agree that the FCC needs to collect good data. Consumers and businesses rely on this information, and we here in Congress need this information, too, in order to make sound policy decisions and conduct effective oversight of the FCC. Mr. Speaker, by consolidating certain reports and eliminating references to other outdated reports, this bill allows the FCC to use the agency's limited resources more wisely and present a more holistic analysis of the communications marketplace. At the same time, we have worked together to ensure this effort to promote efficiency does not undermine important existing FCC obligations and authorities. We were able to come to agreement in the Energy and Commerce Committee on language that preserves the FCC's duty to provide transparency to consumers about their cable bills and does not alter the FCC's authority over broadband under section 706. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Communications and Technology Subcommittee Ranking Member Eshoo for her leadership on these issues and Chairman Upton, Chairman Walden, and Representative Scalise for working with Democrats to address their concerns during the committee's consideration of the bill. In short, this bill is an example of the progress we can make when we engage in a truly bipartisan process. The consideration of H.R. 734 should be a model for legislative efforts in our committee and the entire House. Working together through regular order, we crafted legislation that addressed concerns from both sides of the aisle, and I look forward to continuing to work with our Republican and Democratic colleagues in the Senate to help this bill become law. I reserve the balance of my time, Mr. Speaker. Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Speaker, I now yield such time as he may consume to the distinguished gentleman from Louisiana (Mr. Scalise), our majority whip, and a terrific member of our subcommittee. Mr. SCALISE. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the chairman of the subcommittee, Mr. Walden, for his leadership in bringing this forward and the ranking member, Mr. Pallone, as well as Ms. Eshoo, the ranking member of the subcommittee, who has been working very closely I know with myself and others to bring a good, bipartisan bill that actually gets rid of outdated regulations and reports. This FCC Consolidated Reporting Act actually reduces the workload that the FCC has placed for years and years that has been outdated. If you look at some of the reports that have been required for years that they are supposed to go and consolidate and accumulate, they have reports on competitiveness within the telegraph. Clearly, Mr. Speaker, it is long past time that we update these laws and get the FCC reform in place that will finally bring some consolidation so that industry can look at a full picture instead of a bunch of different silos and reports that are so outdated, like the telegraph, that they are not even being done, yet these laws are still on the books. This is an important reform, and it is a good bipartisan reform that shows that Congress can work to get these kinds of things done to actually make things simpler in the real world and make an agency like the FCC more efficient in their operations. Mr. Speaker, I urge passage of this bill. Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I would urge support of this bill, and I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Speaker, I join my friend and colleague from New Jersey and ask our colleagues to support passage of this legislation, and I yield back the balance of my time. Ms. ESHOO. Mr. Speaker, this legislation, the FCC Consolidated Reporting Act of 2015 (H.R. 734) is a reflection of what our Subcommittee can accomplish when we work together in a bipartisan manner. Earlier this month, Chairman Walden, Rep. Scalise and I introduced H.R. 734 as a way to streamline Congressionally-mandated reporting requirements under a single, industry-wide report. I've consistently supported this goal because it frees the FCC to focus on its ultimate mission: to protect the public interest and promote competition. These reports and the data collected serve a critical role in supporting the FCC's decision-making and our work as policymakers on issues like broadband deployment and adoption, cable pricing and assessing the state of competition. As part of the Committee's markup of H.R. 734, two important clarifications were made. First, in our effort to consolidate reporting requirements, the legislation clarifies that the FCC's `706' Report does not in any way impact or alter the explicit grant of broadband authority that the court affirmed in the Verizon case last year. Second, the legislation preserves the FCC's obligation to examine how retransmission consent fees impact a consumer's monthly bill. For all these reasons, I support and urge my colleagues to pass H.R. 734. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is will the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 734. The question was taken. The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the opinion of the Chair, two-thirds being in the affirmative, the ayes have it. [[Page H1098]] Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays. The yeas and nays were ordered. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further proceedings on this question will be postponed. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 31 (Tuesday, February 24, 2015)] [House] [Pages H1095-H1098] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] {time} 1615 FEDERAL COMMUNICATIONS COMMISSION CONSOLIDATED REPORTING ACT OF 2015 Mr. WALDEN.

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from Oregon (Mr. Walden) and the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Pallone) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Oregon. General Leave Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members [[Page H1097]] may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and insert extraneous materials in the Record on the bill. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Oregon? There was no objection. Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, in our multiyear effort to update the Communications Act, one of the most common themes we have heard is the convergence of the telecommunications marketplace. No longer are companies just one service over just one medium. Both technology and consumer expectations have completely changed the game. However, the agency tasked with regulating the communications sector still exists in the outdated and siloed structure that reflects decades-old assumptions, even how they evaluate and report on the industry. While that fractured approach will be a continued focus of our CommActUpdate process, this bill will take an important first step toward modernizing the way we look at this sector and its regulator. This legislation consolidates eight separate reports that require the FCC to evaluate the state of competition in various sectors and combines those eight reports into just a single biennial report to Congress on the communications marketplace as a whole. This bill also takes the important step of eliminating outdated reports that only serve to junk up the Communications Act and cause confusion. Reports like the ORBIT Act--which I have a copy of here--are aimed at ensuring that satellites that were long ago privatized are procompetitive, an examination that the FCC and the industry recognizes as both outdated, unnecessary, and burdensome. There are still laws on the books that address such outdated technologies as telegraphs. This is a small but significant step toward cleaning up the act and modernizing the laws and the agency that control this very dynamic marketplace. Ensuring that all of the reports on the books are both necessary and effective helps to reduce the burden on the agency. It also helps the regulatory agency make more informed decisions. I would like to take a moment to thank my colleagues, Representative Scalise, Ranking Member Eshoo, and the ranking member of the full committee, Mr. Pallone, for their work to make this bill a bipartisan success both today and, frankly, in the last two sessions of Congress. I am hopeful that the first bill to pass out of our subcommittee this Congress is an indication of the work that we can get done when we collaborate. Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to vote in favor of this legislation, and I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 734, the FCC Consolidated Reporting Act of 2015. Congress has charged the Federal Communications Commission with overseeing industries that make up one- sixth of our national economy. The communications and technology sectors are driving economic growth across the Nation, connecting businesses to markets large and small and delivering innovative new products and services to consumers. As part of this critical mission, Congress has tasked the FCC with compiling reports to provide the public with information about these dynamic markets. Democrats and Republicans agree that the FCC needs to collect good data. Consumers and businesses rely on this information, and we here in Congress need this information, too, in order to make sound policy decisions and conduct effective oversight of the FCC. Mr. Speaker, by consolidating certain reports and eliminating references to other outdated reports, this bill allows the FCC to use the agency's limited resources more wisely and present a more holistic analysis of the communications marketplace. At the same time, we have worked together to ensure this effort to promote efficiency does not undermine important existing FCC obligations and authorities. We were able to come to agreement in the Energy and Commerce Committee on language that preserves the FCC's duty to provide transparency to consumers about their cable bills and does not alter the FCC's authority over broadband under section 706. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Communications and Technology Subcommittee Ranking Member Eshoo for her leadership on these issues and Chairman Upton, Chairman Walden, and Representative Scalise for working with Democrats to address their concerns during the committee's consideration of the bill. In short, this bill is an example of the progress we can make when we engage in a truly bipartisan process. The consideration of H.R. 734 should be a model for legislative efforts in our committee and the entire House. Working together through regular order, we crafted legislation that addressed concerns from both sides of the aisle, and I look forward to continuing to work with our Republican and Democratic colleagues in the Senate to help this bill become law. I reserve the balance of my time, Mr. Speaker. Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Speaker, I now yield such time as he may consume to the distinguished gentleman from Louisiana (Mr. Scalise), our majority whip, and a terrific member of our subcommittee. Mr. SCALISE. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the chairman of the subcommittee, Mr. Walden, for his leadership in bringing this forward and the ranking member, Mr. Pallone, as well as Ms. Eshoo, the ranking member of the subcommittee, who has been working very closely I know with myself and others to bring a good, bipartisan bill that actually gets rid of outdated regulations and reports. This FCC Consolidated Reporting Act actually reduces the workload that the FCC has placed for years and years that has been outdated. If you look at some of the reports that have been required for years that they are supposed to go and consolidate and accumulate, they have reports on competitiveness within the telegraph. Clearly, Mr. Speaker, it is long past time that we update these laws and get the FCC reform in place that will finally bring some consolidation so that industry can look at a full picture instead of a bunch of different silos and reports that are so outdated, like the telegraph, that they are not even being done, yet these laws are still on the books. This is an important reform, and it is a good bipartisan reform that shows that Congress can work to get these kinds of things done to actually make things simpler in the real world and make an agency like the FCC more efficient in their operations. Mr. Speaker, I urge passage of this bill. Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I would urge support of this bill, and I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Speaker, I join my friend and colleague from New Jersey and ask our colleagues to support passage of this legislation, and I yield back the balance of my time. Ms. ESHOO. Mr. Speaker, this legislation, the FCC Consolidated Reporting Act of 2015 (H.R. 734) is a reflection of what our Subcommittee can accomplish when we work together in a bipartisan manner. Earlier this month, Chairman Walden, Rep. Scalise and I introduced H.R. 734 as a way to streamline Congressionally-mandated reporting requirements under a single, industry-wide report. I've consistently supported this goal because it frees the FCC to focus on its ultimate mission: to protect the public interest and promote competition. These reports and the data collected serve a critical role in supporting the FCC's decision-making and our work as policymakers on issues like broadband deployment and adoption, cable pricing and assessing the state of competition. As part of the Committee's markup of H.R. 734, two important clarifications were made. First, in our effort to consolidate reporting requirements, the legislation clarifies that the FCC's `706' Report does not in any way impact or alter the explicit grant of broadband authority that the court affirmed in the Verizon case last year. Second, the legislation preserves the FCC's obligation to examine how retransmission consent fees impact a consumer's monthly bill. For all these reasons, I support and urge my colleagues to pass H.R. 734. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is will the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 734. The question was taken. The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the opinion of the Chair, two-thirds being in the affirmative, the ayes have it. [[Page H1098]] Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays. The yeas and nays were ordered. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further proceedings on this question will be postponed. ____________________",package_114_116.csv,19683,19683,19754,"[congressional record volume 161, number 31 (tuesday, february 24, 2015)] [house] [pages h1095-h1098] from the congressional record online through the government publishing office [ www.gpo.gov ] {time} 1615 federal communications commission consolidated reporting act of 2015 mr. walden. mr. speaker, i move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (h.r. 734) to amend the communications act of 1934 to consolidate the reporting obligations of the federal communications commission in order to improve congressional oversight and reduce reporting burdens. the clerk read the title of the bill. the text of the bill is as follows: h.r. 734 be it enacted by the senate and house of representatives of the united states of america in congress assembled, section 1. short title. this act may be cited as the ``federal communications commission consolidated reporting act of 2015''. sec. 2. communications marketplace report. title i of the communications act of 1934 (47 u.s.c. 151 et seq.) is amended by adding at the end the following: ``sec. 13. communications marketplace report. ``(a) in general.--in the last quarter of every even- numbered year, the commission shall publish on its website and submit to the committee on energy and commerce of the house of representatives and the committee on commerce, science, and transportation of the senate a report on the state of the communications marketplace. ``(b) contents.--each report required by subsection (a) shall-- ``(1) assess the state of competition in the communications marketplace, including competition to deliver voice, video, audio, [[page h1096]] and data services among providers of telecommunications, providers of commercial mobile service (as defined in section 332), multichannel video programming distributors (as defined in section 602), broadcast stations, providers of satellite communications, internet service providers, and other providers of communications services;

want to thank the chairman of the subcommittee, mr. walden, for his leadership in bringing this forward and the ranking member, mr. pallone, as well as ms. eshoo, the ranking member of the subcommittee, who has been working very closely i know with myself and others to bring a good, bipartisan bill that actually gets rid of outdated regulations and reports. this fcc consolidated reporting act actually reduces the workload that the fcc has placed for years and years that has been outdated. if you look at some of the reports that have been required for years that they are supposed to go and consolidate and accumulate, they have reports on competitiveness within the telegraph. clearly, mr. speaker, it is long past time that we update these laws and get the fcc reform in place that will finally bring some consolidation so that industry can look at a full picture instead of a bunch of different silos and reports that are so outdated, like the telegraph, that they are not even being done, yet these laws are still on the books. this is an important reform, and it is a good bipartisan reform that shows that congress can work to get these kinds of things done to actually make things simpler in the real world and make an agency like the fcc more efficient in their operations. mr. speaker, i urge passage of this bill. mr. pallone. mr. speaker, i would urge support of this bill, and i yield back the balance of my time. mr. walden. mr. speaker, i join my friend and colleague from new jersey and ask our colleagues to support passage of this legislation, and i yield back the balance of my time. ms. eshoo. mr. speaker, this legislation, the fcc consolidated reporting act of 2015 (h.r. 734) is a reflection of what our subcommittee can accomplish when we work together in a bipartisan manner. earlier this month, chairman walden, rep. scalise and i introduced h.r. 734 as a way to streamline congressionally-mandated reporting requirements under a single, industry-wide report. i've consistently supported this goal because it frees the fcc to focus on its ultimate mission: to protect the public interest and promote competition. these reports and the data collected serve a critical role in supporting the fcc's decision-making and our work as policymakers on issues like broadband deployment and adoption, cable pricing and assessing the state of competition. as part of the committee's markup of h.r. 734, two important clarifications were made. first, in our effort to consolidate reporting requirements, the legislation clarifies that the fcc's `706' report does not in any way impact or alter the explicit grant of broadband authority that the court affirmed in the verizon case last year. second, the legislation preserves the fcc's obligation to examine how retransmission consent fees impact a consumer's monthly bill. for all these reasons, i support and urge my colleagues to pass h.r. 734. the speaker pro tempore. the question is will the house suspend the rules and pass the bill, h.r. 734. the question was taken. the speaker pro tempore. in the opinion of the chair, two-thirds being in the affirmative, the ayes have it. [[page h1098]] mr. walden. mr. speaker, on that i demand the yeas and nays. the yeas and nays were ordered. the speaker pro tempore. pursuant to clause 8 of rule xx, further proceedings on this question will be postponed. ____________________",19683

SEC. 4. NOYCE SCHOLARSHIP PROGRAM AMENDMENTS. (a) Amendments.--Section 10A of the National Science Foundation Authorization Act of 2002 (42 U.S.C. 1862n-1a) is amended-- (1) in subsection (a)(2)(B), by inserting ``or bachelor's'' after ``master's''; (2) in subsection (c)-- (A) by striking ``and'' at the end of paragraph (2)(B); (B) in paragraph (3)-- (i) by inserting ``for teachers with master's degrees in their field'' after ``Teaching Fellowships''; and (ii) by striking the period at the end of subparagraph (B) and inserting ``; and''; and (C) by adding at the end the following new paragraph: ``(4) in the case of National Science Foundation Master Teaching Fellowships for teachers with bachelor's degrees in their field and working toward a master's degree-- ``(A) offering academic courses leading to a master's degree and leadership training to prepare individuals to become master teachers in elementary and secondary schools; and ``(B) offering programs both during and after matriculation in the program for which the fellowship is received to enable fellows to become highly effective mathematics and science teachers, including mentoring, training, induction, and professional development activities, to fulfill the service requirements of this section, including the requirements of subsection (e), and to exchange ideas with others in their fields.''; (3) in subsection (e), by striking ``subsection (g)'' and inserting ``subsection (h)''; (4) by redesignating subsections (g) through (i) as subsections (h) through (j), respectively; and (5) by inserting after subsection (f) the following new subsection: ``(g) Support for Master Teaching Fellows While Enrolled in a Master's Degree Program.--A National Science Foundation Master Teacher Fellow may receive a maximum of 1 year of fellowship support while enrolled in a master's degree program as described in subsection (c)(4)(A), except that if such fellow is enrolled in a part-time program, such amount shall be prorated according to the length of the program.''. (b) Definition.--Section 10(i)(5) of the National Science Foundation Authorization Act of 2002 (42 U.S.C. 1862n- 1(i)(5)) is amended by inserting ``computer science,'' after ``means a science,''. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Smith) and the gentlewoman from Connecticut (Ms. Esty) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Texas. Mr. SMITH of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. General Leave Mr. SMITH of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous material on the bill under consideration. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Texas? There was no objection. Mr. SMITH of Texas. Mr. Speaker, the STEM Education Act of 2015 is bipartisan legislation that includes computer science in the definition of STEM education for programs and activities at our Federal science agencies. The bill also supports and strengthens ongoing STEM education efforts at the National Science Foundation. Similar legislation passed the House last year by voice vote. I thank Representative Elizabeth Esty for cosponsoring the bill again this year. I also thank our new Research and Technology Subcommittee Chairwoman Barbara Comstock, Subcommittee Ranking Member Dan Lipinski, Subcommittee Vice Chair John Moolenaar, and Representatives Randy Hultgren, Larry Bucshon, Chris Collins, David McKinley, and Jaime Herrera Beutler for their support. Last Congress the Science, Space, and Technology Committee held several hearings on STEM education. Each hearing highlighted the importance of STEM education to keep America on the cutting edge of new products and ideas. Our hearings discussed the merits of ensuring computer science is included as a component of the science, technology, engineering, and mathematics that make up STEM education. Today a variety of jobs in industries from banking to engineering to medicine require familiarity with computer science. {time} 1630 According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, computing and mathematics will be one of the top 10 fastest growing major occupational groups from 2010 to 2020, with a growth rate of 4 percent annually compared to 1 percent for all other industries. Unfortunately, America lags behind many other nations when it comes to STEM education. American students rank 21st in science and 26th in math. That must change for the better. We need to ensure that our Nation's youth have the scientific and mathematical skills to strive and thrive in a technology-based economy, but we have to capture and hold the desire of young adults to study STEM subjects so they will want to pursue these careers. H.R. 1020 includes language suggested by Mr. Lipinski to support informal STEM education programs and activities at the National Science Foundation. These activities reach students outside of the classroom and strengthen a student's engagement in STEM subject areas. The STEM Education Act also ensures that teachers working towards a master's degree program in STEM subjects can participate in the Robert Noyce Master Teacher Fellowship program. I thank Ms. Esty for this good addition to the bill. This program provides opportunities for teachers who want to bolster their teaching skills. Through the Master Teaching fellowships, individuals receive training in order to become highly effective mathematics and science teachers. With this bill, the program now will encourage more teachers to pursue advanced degrees. A healthy and viable STEM workforce literate in all STEM subjects, including computer science, is critical to American industries. A well- educated and trained STEM workforce ensures our future economic prosperity. More graduates with STEM degrees means more advanced technologies and a more robust economy. Support for this bill from organizations like the STEM Education Coalition, STEM4US!, and Code.org illustrate the importance of aligning our [[Page H1099]] Federal STEM programs with workforce needs. We must work to ensure that students continue to go into these fields so that their innovative ideas can lead to a more innovative and prosperous America. I encourage my colleagues to support this bill. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Ms. ESTY. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I want to begin by thanking my friend, Chairman Smith, for his leadership on the Science Committee, particularly on STEM education. For the second Congress in a row, we are considering the STEM Education Act on the House floor. I am grateful that we are advancing these important efforts in a bipartisan fashion, thanks in large part to the chairman's willingness to work across the aisle. I would also like to thank and recognize the work of Representative Lipinski for his diligent work on this and many other bills and my good friend Eddie Bernice Johnson for her thoughtful leadership on STEM education and on all issues facing the Science Committee. The STEM Education Act of 2015 supports teachers who are preparing students to be the engineers, manufacturers, and scientists of tomorrow. We all know that students, particularly elementary school students, learn best when they are engaged and interested. However, any parent knows that it can be difficult to spark a student's passion for STEM subjects without innovative and creative learning environments. With more and more jobs of the 21st century requiring STEM skills, we need to better prepare our children for these good-paying jobs. As a mother of three, I remember when my children had incredible teachers who made science and math accessible and fun. We should do all we can to support innovative, passionate teachers for every child in every school. This bill today includes sections of my STEM Jobs Act, a bill expanding the Robert Noyce Master Teaching Fellowship program at the National Science Foundation. Currently, Master Teaching fellowships provide mentoring, training, and financial support to STEM professionals who want to enter the teaching profession. In Connecticut, we have two Robert Noyce Teacher Scholarship programs. UConn's Teachers for Tomorrow program prepares teachers throughout the State to teach math, biology, physics, and chemistry to students of all ages. At the University of Bridgeport, the Master Teacher Fellowship program places master physics teachers in high-need high schools in southwestern Connecticut. Our bill today expands the Master Teaching Fellowship so that those who are working towards a master's degree, not just those who already have a master's degree, are also eligible to apply--supporting more passionate teachers and, in doing so, allowing more students to benefit from excellent STEM instructors. Our bill also promotes learning outside of the classroom. In Connecticut, we have the wonderful Connecticut Science Center, with incredibly creative exhibits like one called ``Grossology,'' where children can explore how to keep their bodies healthy by crawling through an enormous digestive system and experiencing a ``larger than life sneeze,'' perfect for inspiring our Nation's future doctors and biomedical researchers. In addition to educating and inspiring our children, science centers, planetariums, and aquariums across the country also provide invaluable teacher training. Last year alone, the Connecticut Science Center trained nearly 1,200 teachers who then went on to teach and inspire tens of thousands of their students. The bill today directs the National Science Foundation to continue to award competitive grants for out-of-school STEM learning experiences for both students and teachers. Finally, our bill takes the important step of expanding the definition of STEM for Federal programs and grants to include computer science. As a member of the Science Committee and Representative Lipinski's STEM Education Caucus, I have been a strong advocate for increasing literacy in computer science. This winter, I joined students from across the State and more than 100 million worldwide to participate in an hour of code. We learned basic computer programming skills and discovered it is a lot of fun. I also helped create the Congressional App Challenge and hosted this competition in my district where students created and built apps for their smartphones. The entries submitted by these high school students were incredibly innovative and useful, technologically advanced, as well as terrific examples of the problem solving we need all of our students to learn. The winning apps included an app to keep teachers informed during a school emergency, a program to help students know if they are going to be able to catch their bus on time, an app I know that my children would have benefited from greatly on those cold Connecticut winter mornings--like this morning--and an app to help high school freshmen learn their way around a big new school. The STEM app competition helps students experience for themselves how important and fun computer science can be; but, for example, in Connecticut, where only 65 schools across the State have dedicated computer science programs, it is critical that we continue to expand access to computer science education for all students. Mr. Speaker, I am proud that we are rising above partisan politics to advance the bipartisan STEM Education Act of 2015. This bill demonstrates that we can come together to help our children, to help them thrive, and to help ensure that they will be competitive in the 21st century global economy. I want, again, to thank Chairman Smith and Representative Lipinski for their leadership and the committee staff for their hard work on the STEM Education Act. I would also like to thank my friend, Ranking Member Johnson, a dedicated STEM champion, who is leading all of us on the Science Committee to truly recognize the importance of a robust and multidisciplinary STEM education and inspire us to do more across the board to support STEM. I look forward to working with Ranking Member Johnson and the rest of the committee to further advance our priorities in Congress. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. SMITH of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Ms. ESTY. Mr. Speaker, I yield as much time as she may consume to the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Eddie Bernice Johnson), my friend, the ranking member of the Science Committee. Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 1020--although, reluctantly, I must qualify my support. I will begin with the parts of the bill that I strongly support. I want to thank Ms. Esty for her language to amend NSF's Noyce Master Teacher Fellowship program. This is an important update to the program to ensure that we are tapping into our entire pool of talented math and science teachers who might serve as master teachers in their schools and districts. I also want to thank Mr. Lipinski for his language to authorize the National Science Foundation's informal STEM education portfolio. While we know that informal STEM education learning holds great promise to increase engagement in STEM by diverse populations and to enhance learning of STEM content, there is still more R&D to be done to make sure we are developing and implementing the most effective programs. My support for those sections of this bill is unqualified. However, I must express my concern about the definition for STEM included in this legislation which differs in a significant way from the definition of STEM that Chairman Smith proposed in last year's version of this same bill. Specifically, the current version would define STEM as ``science, technology, engineering, and mathematics, including computer science.'' Last year's version, developed in collaboration with the STEM Education Coalition, read as ``science, technology, engineering, and mathematics, including other academic subjects that build on these disciplines such as computer science.'' This second definition, the one this entire House agreed to last year, was agreed to because it left the door open [[Page H1100]] for other critical fields such as statistics and geology that don't cleanly fit into S, T, E, or M of STEM in K-12 teacher certifications and curricula. I think we can all agree to the importance of computer science education. The current disconnect between the high demand for information technology jobs and limited opportunities for students to be exposed to computer science at the K-12 level puts American students and American companies at a significant disadvantage. However, it baffles me as to why we would implicitly devalue such fields as statistics and geology in order to highlight computer science. Statistics is an essential tool across all fields of science. Without good statistics, the biomedical research results that we count on to develop new diagnostics and therapeutics for diseases would be meaningless. Without geology, oil and gas companies would not be able to locate and drill for new sources of energy. Without geology, we will never achieve early warning for earthquakes to save lives. Whether we are from Texas or California, we ought to place high value on geology. I am also baffled why this bill is so urgent that we had to skip regular order to bring it to the floor. I requested that the committee hold a hearing or a markup on this legislation so that we might settle the definition dispute in committee after an open and public debate, but my request was denied. Mr. Speaker, I will support this bill today, but I hope that the Senate will be wiser than we are being today in defining STEM. This is not simply semantics. How and what science is taught in our Nation's classrooms is essential to our future economic competitiveness, national security, and overall well-being. Ms. ESTY. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. SMITH of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. {time} 1645 Parliamentary Inquiry Mr. SMITH of Texas. Mr. Speaker, parliamentary inquiry. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman will state his parliamentary inquiry. Mr. SMITH of Texas. Is it too late for me to yield time to the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Moolenaar), who I had mentioned a while ago was on the way to the House floor to speak on this particular bill? The SPEAKER pro tempore. Does the gentleman from Texas ask unanimous consent to reclaim his time? Mr. SMITH of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to reclaim my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Texas? There was no objection. Mr. SMITH of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Moolenaar), who is a member of the Committee on Science, Space, and Technology and is also vice chair of the Subcommittee on Research and Technology. Mr. MOOLENAAR. Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman for yielding. Science, technology, engineering, and mathematics education is necessary to prepare today's students for future job opportunities. H.R. 1020 will add computer science under the definition of STEM programs while providing STEM grants for the research of new, informal, out-of-school methods for teaching STEM subjects. Whether it is a hands-on museum, a science competition, or an internship as a lab assistant, finding the best ways to teach these critical subjects outside of the classroom will help students who might not learn these subjects in a traditional setting. As our Nation's employers look to fill good-paying jobs, STEM education has applications across the board, including skilled trades in construction, manufacturing, and welding. Every student who learns these skills will have the solid academic background to secure employment in a career field. This important legislation will benefit bright young minds outside of the classroom and help our country remain the world leader in research and innovation. I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes.'' Mr. SMITH of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Smith) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 1020. The question was taken. The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the opinion of the Chair, two-thirds being in the affirmative, the ayes have it. Mr. SMITH of Texas. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays. The yeas and nays were ordered. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further proceedings on this motion will be postponed. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 31 (Tuesday, February 24, 2015)] [House] [Pages H1098-H1100] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] STEM EDUCATION ACT OF 2015 Mr. SMITH of Texas.

This bill today includes sections of my STEM Jobs Act, a bill expanding the Robert Noyce Master Teaching Fellowship program at the National Science Foundation. Currently, Master Teaching fellowships provide mentoring, training, and financial support to STEM professionals who want to enter the teaching profession. In Connecticut, we have two Robert Noyce Teacher Scholarship programs. UConn's Teachers for Tomorrow program prepares teachers throughout the State to teach math, biology, physics, and chemistry to students of all ages. At the University of Bridgeport, the Master Teacher Fellowship program places master physics teachers in high-need high schools in southwestern Connecticut. Our bill today expands the Master Teaching Fellowship so that those who are working towards a master's degree, not just those who already have a master's degree, are also eligible to apply--supporting more passionate teachers and, in doing so, allowing more students to benefit from excellent STEM instructors. Our bill also promotes learning outside of the classroom. In Connecticut, we have the wonderful Connecticut Science Center, with incredibly creative exhibits like one called ``Grossology,'' where children can explore how to keep their bodies healthy by crawling through an enormous digestive system and experiencing a ``larger than life sneeze,'' perfect for inspiring our Nation's future doctors and biomedical researchers. In addition to educating and inspiring our children, science centers, planetariums, and aquariums across the country also provide invaluable teacher training. Last year alone, the Connecticut Science Center trained nearly 1,200 teachers who then went on to teach and inspire tens of thousands of their students. The bill today directs the National Science Foundation to continue to award competitive grants for out-of-school STEM learning experiences for both students and teachers. Finally, our bill takes the important step of expanding the definition of STEM for Federal programs and grants to include computer science. As a member of the Science Committee and Representative Lipinski's STEM Education Caucus, I have been a strong advocate for increasing literacy in computer science. This winter, I joined students from across the State and more than 100 million worldwide to participate in an hour of code. We learned basic computer programming skills and discovered it is a lot of fun. I also helped create the Congressional App Challenge and hosted this competition in my district where students created and built apps for their smartphones. The entries submitted by these high school students were incredibly innovative and useful, technologically advanced, as well as terrific examples of the problem solving we need all of our students to learn. The winning apps included an app to keep teachers informed during a school emergency, a program to help students know if they are going to be able to catch their bus on time, an app I know that my children would have benefited from greatly on those cold Connecticut winter mornings--like this morning--and an app to help high school freshmen learn their way around a big new school. The STEM app competition helps students experience for themselves how important and fun computer science can be; but, for example, in Connecticut, where only 65 schools across the State have dedicated computer science programs, it is critical that we continue to expand access to computer science education for all students. Mr. Speaker, I am proud that we are rising above partisan politics to advance the bipartisan STEM Education Act of 2015. This bill demonstrates that we can come together to help our children, to help them thrive, and to help ensure that they will be competitive in the 21st century global economy. I want, again, to thank Chairman Smith and Representative Lipinski for their leadership and the committee staff for their hard work on the STEM Education Act. I would also like to thank my friend, Ranking Member Johnson, a dedicated STEM champion, who is leading all of us on the Science Committee to truly recognize the importance of a robust and multidisciplinary STEM education and inspire us to do more across the board to support STEM. I look forward to working with Ranking Member Johnson and the rest of the committee to further advance our priorities in Congress. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. SMITH of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Ms. ESTY. Mr. Speaker, I yield as much time as she may consume to the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Eddie Bernice Johnson), my friend, the ranking member of the Science Committee. Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 1020--although, reluctantly, I must qualify my support. I will begin with the parts of the bill that I strongly support. I want to thank Ms. Esty for her language to amend NSF's Noyce Master Teacher Fellowship program. This is an important update to the program to ensure that we are tapping into our entire pool of talented math and science teachers who might serve as master teachers in their schools and districts. I also want to thank Mr. Lipinski for his language to authorize the National Science Foundation's informal STEM education portfolio. While we know that informal STEM education learning holds great promise to increase engagement in STEM by diverse populations and to enhance learning of STEM content, there is still more R&D to be done to make sure we are developing and implementing the most effective programs. My support for those sections of this bill is unqualified. However, I must express my concern about the definition for STEM included in this legislation which differs in a significant way from the definition of STEM that Chairman Smith proposed in last year's version of this same bill. Specifically, the current version would define STEM as ``science, technology, engineering, and mathematics, including computer science.'' Last year's version, developed in collaboration with the STEM Education Coalition, read as ``science, technology, engineering, and mathematics, including other academic subjects that build on these disciplines such as computer science.'' This second definition, the one this entire House agreed to last year, was agreed to because it left the door open [[Page H1100]] for other critical fields such as statistics and geology that don't cleanly fit into S, T, E, or M of STEM in K-12 teacher certifications and curricula. I think we can all agree to the importance of computer science education. The current disconnect between the high demand for information technology jobs and limited opportunities for students to be exposed to computer science at the K-12 level puts American students and American companies at a significant disadvantage. However, it baffles me as to why we would implicitly devalue such fields as statistics and geology in order to highlight computer science. Statistics is an essential tool across all fields of science. Without good statistics, the biomedical research results that we count on to develop new diagnostics and therapeutics for diseases would be meaningless. Without geology, oil and gas companies would not be able to locate and drill for new sources of energy. Without geology, we will never achieve early warning for earthquakes to save lives. Whether we are from Texas or California, we ought to place high value on geology. I am also baffled why this bill is so urgent that we had to skip regular order to bring it to the floor. I requested that the committee hold a hearing or a markup on this legislation so that we might settle the definition dispute in committee after an open and public debate, but my request was denied. Mr. Speaker, I will support this bill today, but I hope that the Senate will be wiser than we are being today in defining STEM. This is not simply semantics. How and what science is taught in our Nation's classrooms is essential to our future economic competitiveness, national security, and overall well-being. Ms. ESTY. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. SMITH of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. {time} 1645 Parliamentary Inquiry Mr. SMITH of Texas. Mr. Speaker, parliamentary inquiry. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman will state his parliamentary inquiry. Mr. SMITH of Texas. Is it too late for me to yield time to the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Moolenaar), who I had mentioned a while ago was on the way to the House floor to speak on this particular bill? The SPEAKER pro tempore. Does the gentleman from Texas ask unanimous consent to reclaim his time? Mr. SMITH of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to reclaim my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Texas? There was no objection. Mr. SMITH of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Moolenaar), who is a member of the Committee on Science, Space, and Technology and is also vice chair of the Subcommittee on Research and Technology. Mr. MOOLENAAR. Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman for yielding. Science, technology, engineering, and mathematics education is necessary to prepare today's students for future job opportunities. H.R. 1020 will add computer science under the definition of STEM programs while providing STEM grants for the research of new, informal, out-of-school methods for teaching STEM subjects. Whether it is a hands-on museum, a science competition, or an internship as a lab assistant, finding the best ways to teach these critical subjects outside of the classroom will help students who might not learn these subjects in a traditional setting. As our Nation's employers look to fill good-paying jobs, STEM education has applications across the board, including skilled trades in construction, manufacturing, and welding. Every student who learns these skills will have the solid academic background to secure employment in a career field. This important legislation will benefit bright young minds outside of the classroom and help our country remain the world leader in research and innovation. I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes.'' Mr. SMITH of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Smith) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 1020. The question was taken. The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the opinion of the Chair, two-thirds being in the affirmative, the ayes have it. Mr. SMITH of Texas. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays. The yeas and nays were ordered. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further proceedings on this motion will be postponed. ____________________","Congressional Record, Volume 161 Issue 31 (Tuesday, February 24, 2015) [Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 31 (Tuesday, February 24, 2015)] [House] [Pages H1098-H1100] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] STEM EDUCATION ACT OF 2015 Mr. SMITH of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 1020) to define STEM education to include computer science, and to support existing STEM education programs at the National Science Foundation.

(b) Definition.--Section 10(i)(5) of the National Science Foundation Authorization Act of 2002 (42 U.S.C. 1862n- 1(i)(5)) is amended by inserting ``computer science,'' after ``means a science,''. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Smith) and the gentlewoman from Connecticut (Ms. Esty) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Texas. Mr. SMITH of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. General Leave Mr. SMITH of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous material on the bill under consideration. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Texas? There was no objection. Mr. SMITH of Texas. Mr. Speaker, the STEM Education Act of 2015 is bipartisan legislation that includes computer science in the definition of STEM education for programs and activities at our Federal science agencies. The bill also supports and strengthens ongoing STEM education efforts at the National Science Foundation. Similar legislation passed the House last year by voice vote. I thank Representative Elizabeth Esty for cosponsoring the bill again this year. I also thank our new Research and Technology Subcommittee Chairwoman Barbara Comstock, Subcommittee Ranking Member Dan Lipinski, Subcommittee Vice Chair John Moolenaar, and Representatives Randy Hultgren, Larry Bucshon, Chris Collins, David McKinley, and Jaime Herrera Beutler for their support. Last Congress the Science, Space, and Technology Committee held several hearings on STEM education. Each hearing highlighted the importance of STEM education to keep America on the cutting edge of new products and ideas. Our hearings discussed the merits of ensuring computer science is included as a component of the science, technology, engineering, and mathematics that make up STEM education. Today a variety of jobs in industries from banking to engineering to medicine require familiarity with computer science. {time} 1630 According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, computing and mathematics will be one of the top 10 fastest growing major occupational groups from 2010 to 2020, with a growth rate of 4 percent annually compared to 1 percent for all other industries. Unfortunately, America lags behind many other nations when it comes to STEM education. American students rank 21st in science and 26th in math. That must change for the better. We need to ensure that our Nation's youth have the scientific and mathematical skills to strive and thrive in a technology-based economy, but we have to capture and hold the desire of young adults to study STEM subjects so they will want to pursue these careers. H.R. 1020 includes language suggested by Mr. Lipinski to support informal STEM education programs and activities at the National Science Foundation. These activities reach students outside of the classroom and strengthen a student's engagement in STEM subject areas. The STEM Education Act also ensures that teachers working towards a master's degree program in STEM subjects can participate in the Robert Noyce Master Teacher Fellowship program. I thank Ms. Esty for this good addition to the bill. This program provides opportunities for teachers who want to bolster their teaching skills. Through the Master Teaching fellowships, individuals receive training in order to become highly effective mathematics and science teachers. With this bill, the program now will encourage more teachers to pursue advanced degrees. A healthy and viable STEM workforce literate in all STEM subjects, including computer science, is critical to American industries. A well- educated and trained STEM workforce ensures our future economic prosperity. More graduates with STEM degrees means more advanced technologies and a more robust economy. Support for this bill from organizations like the STEM Education Coalition, STEM4US!, and Code.org illustrate the importance of aligning our [[Page H1099]] Federal STEM programs with workforce needs. We must work to ensure that students continue to go into these fields so that their innovative ideas can lead to a more innovative and prosperous America. I encourage my colleagues to support this bill. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Ms. ESTY. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I want to begin by thanking my friend, Chairman Smith, for his leadership on the Science Committee, particularly on STEM education. For the second Congress in a row, we are considering the STEM Education Act on the House floor. I am grateful that we are advancing these important efforts in a bipartisan fashion, thanks in large part to the chairman's willingness to work across the aisle. I would also like to thank and recognize the work of Representative Lipinski for his diligent work on this and many other bills and my good friend Eddie Bernice Johnson for her thoughtful leadership on STEM education and on all issues facing the Science Committee. The STEM Education Act of 2015 supports teachers who are preparing students to be the engineers, manufacturers, and scientists of tomorrow. We all know that students, particularly elementary school students, learn best when they are engaged and interested. However, any parent knows that it can be difficult to spark a student's passion for STEM subjects without innovative and creative learning environments. With more and more jobs of the 21st century requiring STEM skills, we need to better prepare our children for these good-paying jobs. As a mother of three, I remember when my children had incredible teachers who made science and math accessible and fun. We should do all we can to support innovative, passionate teachers for every child in every school. This bill today includes sections of my STEM Jobs Act, a bill expanding the Robert Noyce Master Teaching Fellowship program at the National Science Foundation. Currently, Master Teaching fellowships provide mentoring, training, and financial support to STEM professionals who want to enter the teaching profession. In Connecticut, we have two Robert Noyce Teacher Scholarship programs. UConn's Teachers for Tomorrow program prepares teachers throughout the State to teach math, biology, physics, and chemistry to students of all ages. At the University of Bridgeport, the Master Teacher Fellowship program places master physics teachers in high-need high schools in southwestern Connecticut. Our bill today expands the Master Teaching Fellowship so that those who are working towards a master's degree, not just those who already have a master's degree, are also eligible to apply--supporting more passionate teachers and, in doing so, allowing more students to benefit from excellent STEM instructors. Our bill also promotes learning outside of the classroom.

congress the science, space, and technology committee held several hearings on stem education. each hearing highlighted the importance of stem education to keep america on the cutting edge of new products and ideas. our hearings discussed the merits of ensuring computer science is included as a component of the science, technology, engineering, and mathematics that make up stem education. today a variety of jobs in industries from banking to engineering to medicine require familiarity with computer science. {time} 1630 according to the bureau of labor statistics, computing and mathematics will be one of the top 10 fastest growing major occupational groups from 2010 to 2020, with a growth rate of 4 percent annually compared to 1 percent for all other industries. unfortunately, america lags behind many other nations when it comes to stem education. american students rank 21st in science and 26th in math. that must change for the better. we need to ensure that our nation's youth have the scientific and mathematical skills to strive and thrive in a technology-based economy, but we have to capture and hold the desire of young adults to study stem subjects so they will want to pursue these careers. h.r. 1020 includes language suggested by mr. lipinski to support informal stem education programs and activities at the national science foundation. these activities reach students outside of the classroom and strengthen a student's engagement in stem subject areas. the stem education act also ensures that teachers working towards a master's degree program in stem subjects can participate in the robert noyce master teacher fellowship program. i thank ms. esty for this good addition to the bill. this program provides opportunities for teachers who want to bolster their teaching skills. through the master teaching fellowships, individuals receive training in order to become highly effective mathematics and science teachers. with this bill, the program now will encourage more teachers to pursue advanced degrees. a healthy and viable stem workforce literate in all stem subjects, including computer science, is critical to american industries. a well- educated and trained stem workforce ensures our future economic prosperity. more graduates with stem degrees means more advanced technologies and a more robust economy. support for this bill from organizations like the stem education coalition, stem4us!, and code.org illustrate the importance of aligning our [[page h1099]] federal stem programs with workforce needs. we must work to ensure that students continue to go into these fields so that their innovative ideas can lead to a more innovative and prosperous america. i encourage my colleagues to support this bill. mr. speaker, i reserve the balance of my time. ms. esty. mr. speaker, i yield myself such time as i may consume. i want to begin by thanking my friend, chairman smith, for his leadership on the science committee, particularly on stem education. for the second congress in a row, we are considering the stem education act on the house floor. i am grateful that we are advancing these important efforts in a bipartisan fashion, thanks in large part to the chairman's willingness to work across the aisle. i would also like to thank and recognize the work of representative lipinski for his diligent work on this and many other bills and my good friend eddie bernice johnson for her thoughtful leadership on stem education and on all issues facing the science committee. the stem education act of 2015 supports teachers who are preparing students to be the engineers, manufacturers, and scientists of tomorrow. we all know that students, particularly elementary school students, learn best when they are engaged and interested. however, any parent knows that it can be difficult to spark a student's passion for stem subjects without innovative and creative learning environments. with more and more jobs of the 21st century requiring stem skills, we need to better prepare our children for these good-paying jobs. as a mother of three, i remember when my children had incredible teachers who made science and math accessible and fun. we should do all we can to support innovative, passionate teachers for every child in every school. this bill today includes sections of my stem jobs act, a bill expanding the robert noyce master teaching fellowship program at the national science foundation. currently, master teaching fellowships provide mentoring, training, and financial support to stem professionals who want to enter the teaching profession. in connecticut, we have two robert noyce teacher scholarship programs. uconn's teachers for tomorrow program prepares teachers throughout the state to teach math, biology, physics, and chemistry to students of all ages. at the university of bridgeport, the master teacher fellowship program places master physics teachers in high-need high schools in southwestern connecticut. our bill today expands the master teaching fellowship so that those who are working towards a master's degree, not just those who already have a master's degree, are also eligible to apply--supporting more passionate teachers and, in doing so, allowing more students to benefit from excellent stem instructors. our bill also promotes learning outside of the classroom. in connecticut, we have the wonderful connecticut science center, with incredibly creative exhibits like one called ``grossology,'' where children can explore how to keep their bodies healthy by crawling through an enormous digestive system and experiencing a ``larger than life sneeze,'' perfect for inspiring our nation's future doctors and biomedical researchers. in addition to educating and inspiring our children, science centers, planetariums, and aquariums across the country also provide invaluable teacher training. last year alone, the connecticut science center trained nearly 1,200 teachers who then went on to teach and inspire tens of thousands of their students. the bill today directs the national science foundation to continue to award competitive grants for out-of-school stem learning experiences for both students and teachers. finally, our bill takes the important step of expanding the definition of stem for federal programs and grants to include computer science. as a member of the science committee and representative lipinski's stem education caucus, i have been a strong advocate for increasing literacy in computer science. this winter, i joined students from across the state and more than 100 million worldwide to participate in an hour of code. we learned basic computer programming skills and discovered it is a lot of fun. i also helped create the congressional app challenge and hosted this competition in my district where students created and built apps for their smartphones. the entries submitted by these high school students were incredibly innovative and useful, technologically advanced, as well as terrific examples of the problem solving we need all of our students to learn. the winning apps included an app to keep teachers informed during a school emergency, a program to help students know if they are going to be able to catch their bus on time, an app i know that my children would have benefited from greatly on those cold connecticut winter mornings--like this morning--and an app to help high school freshmen learn their way around a big new school. the stem app competition helps students experience for themselves how important and fun computer science can be; but, for example, in connecticut, where only 65 schools across the state have dedicated computer science programs, it is critical that we continue to expand access to computer science education for all students. mr. speaker, i am proud that we are rising above partisan politics to advance the bipartisan stem education act of 2015. this bill demonstrates that we can come together to help our children, to help them thrive, and to help ensure that they will be competitive in the 21st century global economy. i want, again, to thank chairman smith and representative lipinski for their leadership and the committee staff for their hard work on the stem education act. i would also like to thank my friend, ranking member johnson, a dedicated stem champion, who is leading all of us on the science committee to truly recognize the importance of a robust and multidisciplinary stem education and inspire us to do more across the board to support stem. i look forward to working with ranking member johnson and the rest of the committee to further advance our priorities in congress. mr. speaker, i reserve the balance of my time. mr. smith of texas. mr. speaker, i reserve the balance of my time. ms. esty. mr. speaker, i yield as much time as she may consume to the gentlewoman from texas (ms. eddie bernice johnson), my friend, the ranking member of the science committee. ms. eddie bernice johnson of texas. mr. speaker, i rise in support of h.r. 1020--although, reluctantly, i must qualify my support. i will begin with the parts of the bill that i strongly support. i want to thank ms. esty for her language to amend nsf's noyce master teacher fellowship program. this is an important update to the program to ensure that we are tapping into our entire pool of talented math and science teachers who might serve as master teachers in their schools and districts. i also want to thank mr. lipinski for his language to authorize the national science foundation's informal stem education portfolio. while we know that informal stem education learning holds great promise to increase engagement in stem by diverse populations and to enhance learning of stem content, there is still more r&d to be done to make sure we are developing and implementing the most effective programs. my support for those sections of this bill is unqualified. however, i must express my concern about the definition for stem included in this legislation which differs in a significant way from the definition of stem that chairman smith proposed in last year's version of this same bill. specifically, the current version would define stem as ``science, technology, engineering, and mathematics, including computer science.'' last year's version, developed in collaboration with the stem education coalition, read as ``science, technology, engineering, and mathematics, including other academic subjects that build on these disciplines such as computer science.'' this second definition, the one this entire house agreed to last year, was agreed to because it left the door open [[page h1100]] for other critical fields such as statistics and geology that don't cleanly fit into s, t, e, or m of stem in k-12 teacher certifications and curricula. i think we can all agree to the importance of computer science education. the current disconnect between the high demand for information technology jobs and limited opportunities for students to be exposed to computer science at the k-12 level puts american students and american companies at a significant disadvantage. however, it baffles me as to why we would implicitly devalue such fields as statistics and geology in order to highlight computer science. statistics is an essential tool across all fields of science. without good statistics, the biomedical research results that we count on to develop new diagnostics and therapeutics for diseases would be meaningless. without geology, oil and gas companies would not be able to locate and drill for new sources of energy. without geology, we will never achieve early warning for earthquakes to save lives. whether we are from texas or california, we ought to place high value on geology. i am also baffled why this bill is so urgent that we had to skip regular order to bring it to the floor. i requested that the committee hold a hearing or a markup on this legislation so that we might settle the definition dispute in committee after an open and public debate, but my request was denied. mr. speaker, i will support this bill today, but i hope that the senate will be wiser than we are being today in defining stem. this is not simply semantics. how and what science is taught in our nation's classrooms is essential to our future economic competitiveness, national security, and overall well-being. ms. esty. mr. speaker, i yield back the balance of my time. mr. smith of texas. mr. speaker, i yield back the balance of my time. {time} 1645 parliamentary inquiry mr. smith of texas. mr. speaker, parliamentary inquiry. the speaker pro tempore. the gentleman will state his parliamentary inquiry. mr. smith of texas. is it too late for me to yield time to the gentleman from michigan (mr. moolenaar), who i had mentioned a while ago was on the way to the house floor to speak on this particular bill? the speaker pro tempore. does the gentleman from texas ask unanimous consent to reclaim his time? mr. smith of texas. mr. speaker, i ask unanimous consent to reclaim my time. the speaker pro tempore. is there objection to the request of the gentleman from texas? there was no objection. mr. smith of texas. mr. speaker, i yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from michigan (mr. moolenaar), who is a member of the committee on science, space, and technology and is also vice chair of the subcommittee on research and technology. mr. moolenaar. mr. speaker, i thank the chairman for yielding. science, technology, engineering, and mathematics education is necessary to prepare today's students for future job opportunities. h.r. 1020 will add computer science under the definition of stem programs while providing stem grants for the research of new, informal, out-of-school methods for teaching stem subjects. whether it is a hands-on museum, a science competition, or an internship as a lab assistant, finding the best ways to teach these critical subjects outside of the classroom will help students who might not learn these subjects in a traditional setting. as our nation's employers look to fill good-paying jobs, stem education has applications across the board, including skilled trades in construction, manufacturing, and welding. every student who learns these skills will have the solid academic background to secure employment in a career field. this important legislation will benefit bright young minds outside of the classroom and help our country remain the world leader in research and innovation. i urge my colleagues to vote ``yes.'' mr. smith of texas. mr. speaker, i yield back the balance of my time. the speaker pro tempore. the question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from texas (mr. smith) that the house suspend the rules and pass the bill, h.r. 1020. the question was taken. the speaker pro tempore. in the opinion of the chair, two-thirds being in the affirmative, the ayes have it. mr. smith of texas. mr. speaker, on that i demand the yeas and nays. the yeas and nays were ordered. the speaker pro tempore. pursuant to clause

Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, over the weekend, Penn State University held its annual IFC/Panhellenic Dance Marathon, more commonly known as THON, at the Bryce Jordan Center on campus. THON, which is the largest student-run philanthropy in the world, is a yearlong effort to raise funds and awareness for the fight against pediatric cancer. Since 1977, THON has raised more than $127 million for the Four Diamonds Fund based out of Penn State Hershey Medical Center. With the support of students all across the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and supporters around the world, this year's event raised over $13 million.

It has been projected that our Nation will need almost 2 million engineers by 2018, and that some fields in engineering will experience a 30 to 70 percent growth during that timeframe. Despite these critical workforce needs, a vast majority of schools do not offer K through 12 education that creates clear pathways into careers in engineering and STEM-related feeds. This week, I visited Tech Valley High School in Albany, New York, in the 20th District, to highlight this need and celebrate the good work being done in my congressional district to close the skills gap we see in this very vital discipline. The nations that lead the global economy of the future will be those that invest in the education of their next generation--particularly in engineering. I urge my colleagues to recognize this need and to work in their own communities to bolster engineering education nationwide and allow our Nation to become the kingpin of the future international economy.

Mr. Speaker, I rise to salute a gentle giant by the name of Captain Brazile, a hero, a man who died in the line of fire, and a man who many of us got to know and love. He started in the Houston Fire Department at the age of 19, and he was called Baby Boy. That ultimately became B.B. Everyone who came in the distance of his heart and mind said that Captain Brazile was a mentor who taught men and women who were incoming firefighters. This past weekend, I flew into Houston and was able to go to his bedside on Saturday, to be able to see his family and his wonderful son, who he loves with deep and abiding love, and a wife who loved him without question. All of his fire brothers and sisters were all around. They had the opportunity to pray. Then, unfortunately, he lost his life. He died in the line of duty, and on Saturday night into early morning on Sunday, I joined a throng of firefighters to proceed in the procession to take his body from the Memorial Hermann Medical Center to the medical examiners. Mr. Speaker, let me simply say, as we rode through those streets, through the neighborhoods that he fought for and fought fires, saved lives, and passed Fire Station 46 and all of his brothers and sisters, I felt a sense that his spirit had lifted up and that we had honored him by his travel and journey, that we will continue to honor him--Baby Boy, B.B., father, husband, great leader, hero, captain, firefighter-- who died in the line of duty. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 31 (Tuesday, February 24, 2015)] [House] [Page H1103] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] HONORING THE LIFE OF CAPTAIN B.B.

CREC-2015-02-24-pt1-PgH1103-5,CREC-2015-02-24,114,MIDDLE CLASS ECONOMICS,"[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 31 (Tuesday, February 24, 2015)] [House] [Pages H1103-H1108] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] MIDDLE CLASS ECONOMICS The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Zeldin). Under the Speaker's announced policy of January 6, 2015, the gentleman from California (Mr. Garamendi) is recognized for 60 minutes as the designee of the minority leader. Mr. GARAMENDI. Mr. Speaker, about a month and a half ago, we heard the President speak to us about the economy, about his goals for America. He labeled his speech ``middle class economics,'' and tonight, I want to pick this issue up once again. We are here most every week discussing this issue, although last time we were up here, we took up another important issue, Alzheimer's. But I want to come back to middle class economics, why it is important. Well, basically, it is important because it drives our economy. The great majority of Americans want to be in the middle class, and most of them are. Unfortunately, we have seen the decline of the middle class, their ability to own a home, a car, to provide for their family--but if the middle class is healthy, it will drive our economy, and it will create jobs, so the focus on the middle class becomes very, very important. We can do this by strengthening their wages. If they are able to earn more money, then they will buy the home, the car, and the economy will grow, and other people will be able to enjoy the fruits of our economy. I am going to focus on infrastructure in a moment, but I just want to skip that over and go down to the other things. Health care--who among us doesn't want to have a good health care program, so that if we get sick or injured, we will be able to get to a doctor, get to a hospital, get the care we need to get back on our feet, and to once again be productive or, in our old age, be able to enjoy our retirement? So the affordable health care becomes really important, and here, we [[Page H1104]] have the Affordable Health Care Act as part of that. Finally, we need to develop policies to grow the middle class, and one such policy is infrastructure, which is the focus of tonight's discussion. I want to just stay with this infrastructure issue for a few moments, and then I am going to invite my colleague from Minnesota, Rick Nolan, to join us here. Let me talk about this also. The other theme, in addition to the middle class economics, is the Make It In America theme that we have been talking about for 4 years now. Trade, taxes, energy, labor, education, research, and infrastructure, these are the elements that we fold into our Make It In America agenda. We talk about trade. There is going to be a lot of discussion about that here in Congress over the next several months as the Trans-Pacific Partnership comes up. Taxes, which we will pick up with the infrastructure issue in a few moments--energy is also part of the infrastructure issue. Anyway, Make It In America means bringing the jobs back home, employing Americans, doing the things that we need to do in this country, whether it is the health care sector; the infrastructure; building the roads, the bridges, and the like; or education. That is the Make It In America agenda, and it is part of the middle class economics. In fact, it is the key to it. Why is infrastructure important? Well, there are certain things like this, a collapsed bridge. This is on Interstate 5 in the State of Washington. This is a bridge near the Canadian border. About 3 years ago, it went into the river, collapsed--one of about 163,000 deficient bridges here in the United States. So, yep, we have got a problem. Are we going to be able to address this problem? Well, we had better. Actually, it is 156,000. I was a little bit overanxious there. The American Society of Civil Engineers, who build these things, have graded the American infrastructure, and I just want to go through it: aviation, our airports, which I believe the Vice President, in referring to LaGuardia, said even the developing countries have a better airport than LaGuardia in New York City, aviation, a D; bridges, C-plus--as I said, 156,000 deficient; dams, D; running water, D; energy, D-plus; hazardous waste, D; inland waterways, D; levees, to protect us from floods, D; our ports, a C; public parks and recreation, C; our railroads, C-plus--whoa, a C-plus; our highways, a D; our schools, that is where our kids are, a D; solid waste, we are doing pretty well, that is a B; our transit systems, D; wastewater, a D. Incidentally, in California, we are in the midst of a major drought, and it is perfectly clear that the wastewater systems are inadequate. If we were to also fund the recycling programs which could be connected to the wastewater, we could, in southern California, over the next half decade, create a million acre feet of new water as we recycle the water from the fifth biggest river on the west coast of the Western Hemisphere, the sanitation plants in southern California. {time} 1930 So we have got some work out ahead of us. Let me bring this home before I invite my colleague from the great State of Minnesota to join us on this issue. Earlier today, I was reading an article in The Sacramento Bee about the transportation systems in Sacramento. Let me just share some of these thoughts with you. In Sacramento, the average commuter spends 32 hours each year stuck in traffic. This amounts to $669 of lost productivity. That is literally wages that could have been earned if they weren't stuck in traffic. For all of the commuters in the Sacramento area, which I represent, that is $834 million of commuting time. For the truckers in the area that are trying to pass through Sacramento on Interstate 5, on Interstate 80 or Highway 50, it is $199 million of lost productivity. There is another alternative. Down in Riverside, a southern California city that I once represented when I was lieutenant governor, they want to build a 13-mile streetcar system in the city of Riverside. It would cost about $300 million. The economic analysis that was done on that indicates that if they were to do it, there would be a 4-to-1 return on investment. Now, you tell me which investment banker on Wall Street wouldn't want to have a 4-to-1 return on their investment. Well, the city of Riverside could have a 4-to-1 return on their investment of $300 million to build that 13-mile streetcar section. That is property values and economic development. This morning, The Wall Street Journal published an article in which the American Society of Civil Engineers was quoted that between 2012 and 2022, in America, because of the insufficient infrastructure--and remember, I just read you their GPA, mostly Ds--lost sales, $1 trillion of lost sales. For the United States, the delays will cost $3.1 trillion. And to bring it home to a single company--a big company but, nonetheless, just one company--United Parcel Service, UPS, all of those big brown trucks that are out there, $105 million in lost revenue. There is a solution. The President has put forward to us, the Members of Congress, a 6-year, $478 billion transportation plan that will be paid for--fully paid for with the current gasoline and diesel tax not increased, keep it the same--and going out to those American corporations that are stiffing the American taxpayer by hiding their profits overseas. The President says: Bring those profits home; pay your fair share of the taxes. So there is a fully paid-for proposal before us here in the House of Representatives for a $478 billion, 6- year transportation program. Now, I think our Speaker represents an area in Ohio near Kentucky, and I believe there is a bridge in that area called the Brent Spence Bridge. It crosses the Ohio River between Kentucky and Ohio. It was built for 80,000 cars a day, and now there are over 200,000 cars a day that pass over that bridge--or try to pass over that bridge--creating a monumental traffic jam and slowing down the entire economy in that region. By the way, don't ever walk or drive underneath the bridge because the concrete in the bridge is falling off. They have a nice little safety net over the road beneath it, so perhaps, therefore, you won't be hit by a falling piece of concrete. So the issue for us, the Representatives of the American public, is: Are we willing to put together a full transportation program so that these kinds of bridge collapses are pictures of yesterday, not the pictures of tomorrow's future? I would like to have the gentleman from Minnesota, Mr. Rick Nolan, join us now. If you would come on down and join us, perhaps here on the floor, and take one of the microphones. Mr. Nolan, you have a fascinating history here in the House of Representatives. You were here in the early seventies as a Representative and then decided to go back to Minnesota and build a business, a lumber manufacturing, a timber manufacturing business. It was very successful. Then you came back to straighten us out, bringing all of that history to us. Welcome, Mr. Nolan. Thank you so very much for joining us this evening as we talk about transportation and infrastructure in America. Mr. NOLAN. Well, thank you. The House historian tells me that my 32-year hiatus is the longest in the history of the House of Representatives. Mr. GARAMENDI. Well, you had an opportunity to learn about the private sector and learn about the necessity of transportation; and I think your business was dependent on that, both to get the materials to your lumber mill and then to export. Mr. NOLAN. Very much so. I also built an export trading company and did a little business all over the globe. People asked me what I sold. I like to tell them I sold, well, just about everything except guns and drugs, which is where all the real money was. It was really quite an eye-opening experience to see how the rest of the world does business, to get a better feel and understanding for the importance of agriculture and a better feel and understanding of agriculture as it relates to feeding a hungry world, but infrastructure and its importance to building the middle class here in the country, to laying the foundation for job growth and economic growth. And to come back here again after those years in business and in community service, I have got to be frank with you; I feel [[Page H1105]] much better prepared today than I ever was to serve my district and to serve my Nation, and I am grateful to have the opportunity to be here. I want to particularly thank you for calling this to the attention of the American public, the importance of infrastructure, the importance of infrastructure to the middle class in this country, and the importance that it brings to the fulfillment of the American Dream. The American Dream is not everybody becoming a billionaire or a Pulitzer Prize winner. It is about contributing. It is about having a good job. It is about having a living wage. It is about having some money left over at the end of the week to take your family or your best friend and go out and have dinner or maybe wet a line and go fishing. And, quite frankly, that is what is getting away from us. I want to thank you for bringing to the attention of people how transportation and infrastructure and its degradation that is taking place is related to, quite frankly, the demise and the decline of the middle class in this country. The simple truth is the rich are getting richer, the poor are getting poorer, the middle class is getting crushed, and, simultaneously, our infrastructure is falling apart. The gentleman from California (Mr. Garamendi), you, too, have a background in business and public service and community service that gives you a good grasp and an understanding for the importance of all this. Mr. GARAMENDI. Well, there is no doubt about the importance of it. If you want to build good middle class jobs, a lot of those jobs are in the infrastructure. It may be a hardhat job out there putting up the steel and the concrete, the ironworkers or the cement masons or the operators of the heavy equipment. All of those are really good middle class jobs, no doubt about it, wherever they happen to be across the Nation. But also, in the back office, somebody has to do the accounting; somebody has to do the design work--the architects, the draftsmen and -women that are involved. So these jobs permeate the entire economy. And it is absolutely true that if we can fund--that is, pass--a 6-year, robust transportation bill that is fully paid for, Americans would go to work in middle class jobs. That is the first effect: people will have jobs. And in building the infrastructure, you then lay the foundation for future economic growth. You have seen this in your area. I was thinking about your call for the family to be able to enjoy the fruits of life. And I am thinking about you have got some heavy-duty hunting country up in your area. You are out in the backwoods of Minnesota, if I recall. Mr. NOLAN. I am. My nearest neighbor is a couple of miles away. Mr. GARAMENDI. And in between are bear, deer, and fish. Mr. NOLAN. We have bear. We have duck. We have grouse. We have good hunting and darn good fishing, too. You mentioned the fact that I had served many years ago, quite frankly, back in the seventies. I like to tell people I was only 10 years old at the time. When I first got back here, I said to a number of people: Perhaps you knew my father when he had served here back in the seventies. And there were always a couple of old-timers in the back that would laugh. And everyone would say: Well, what is so funny about that? And they would say: Well, it wasn't his father; it was him. But I have got to tell you, it was quite different. It was quite different than it is today. I had my staff do a little survey. We found that in the terms I served before, there was an average of about 8,000 subcommittee, full committee, and conference committee meetings here in the Congress. What that meant was that we got together 5 days a week in our committees. And all the diverse elements that make up America were all represented in those meetings, and that is how we found common ground; that is how we came together; that is how we fixed things; that is how we got things done. And people have to be reminded, I think, that process is important to good government. Because now we are faced with this gridlock; we are faced with this terrible partisanship, the seeming inability to be productive and to get things done. I think experts that study governance here in America are saying now that this immediate last Congress was the most unproductive in the history of the country. Well, guess what. When we had 8,000 committee meetings in the past, yes, maybe around 1,000 of them were just formal hearings or, you know, you have got to give Jack Nicklaus a gold medal and do a reauthorization of Peanut Butter and Jelly Week. Well, guess what. This last session of Congress, we had about 1,000 of those meetings, and most of them were quite informal. As you recall, Mr. Garamendi, when we started the hearings about a year ago in the Transportation Committee because we knew that the transportation legislation needed to be reauthorized, we had everybody come in before that committee; and, boy, we were laying the foundation for a good reauthorization of a transportation and infrastructure bill. You were there every day. By the way, I want to commend you for the leadership that you have shown on that committee in so many areas, in so many ways. But we had everybody, as you recall, from the head of the national Chamber of Commerce to the heads of all the labor unions, the truckers, retail. Everybody came before that committee. I don't know if you recall. But I asked every one of them, I said: I have three questions. And I remember the committee groaning, saying: Gee, Nolan, you have only got 5 minutes. How are you going to do that? I said: Question number one, is there anyone here on this committee who disagrees with the notion that our infrastructure is badly in need of repair and is falling down and dilapidated? Nobody disagreed. Second question, is there anybody here--of all that group that was testifying--that disagrees with the notion that our ability to grow an economy and create good jobs is dependent upon a good, strong infrastructure? Nobody disagreed, as you would recall. And then lastly, I said: Is there anybody on this committee who doubts that we need to find some new revenue to rebuild our infrastructure? And nobody disagreed. And I said: Make a note of it, Mr. Chairman, because we have got to write a bill here. And that is what we were there for. You know as well as everybody else that the authorization for the Transportation Committee to write a bill was pulled away from the committee. Presumably, in the Speaker's office or someplace else, it was decided that we should do a temporary reauthorization for 8 months; and, as you recall, we borrowed money from people's private pension funds. {time} 1945 We are getting near that 8-month deadline again. Mr. GARAMENDI. I think it is May 15. Mr. NOLAN. May 15. So now working people's pension funds are short a little money potentially, and we still haven't fixed the transportation problem. So one of the things I want to do here tonight, and I know you do as well, is to call upon the Speaker to let the committee do its work. We have got a good committee. You know it as well as I do and everybody else. There is a lot of goodwill in this Chamber among Democrats, Republicans, conservatives, and liberals, and if we are allowed to sit down in that committee and advance our ideas and argue the merits of them, we will find that common ground. We will find a way to get this country back on track with rebuilding our infrastructure. That is what democracy is all about. Someone said to me the other day here, and it almost broke my heart, when I was explaining this and they said: Well, isn't it more efficient here by not using the committees? I said: Yeah, of course, it is. The Nazis and the Communists would love it. Democracy is a lot of hard work. There is so much goodwill in this Chamber, and there are so many good men and women. We get along fine. Mr. Speaker, let the process work. Let the committee do its job, and we will get a good transportation bill, and we will rebuild this middle class and rebuild our economy in a way that is fair to everyone. Mr. GARAMENDI. Well, there is no doubt that if we were to pass--well, we [[Page H1106]] don't have a choice. If we don't pass a bill in the next 2 months, 2\1/ 2\ months, all public works, transportation programs, will come to a screeching halt. There will be no more Federal money, and it will simply stop. So we have got work to do. As you say, if the committee could have its way, we could put together a good bill. There has been a long history here of the transportation bill being a bipartisan bill. We can do that. If we don't--let me just go back through this. I get stacks and stacks of paper, and this one caught my eye. It is entitled, ``Infrastructure Investment Creates American Jobs.'' I said: Well, that is kind of a pretty good cover there. It has roads, bridges, ports, and so forth. It is the Duke Center on Globalization, Governance & Competitiveness. So it is the Duke University. Here they say: Old and broken transportation infrastructure makes the United States less competitive than 15 of our major trading partners and makes manufacturers less efficient in getting goods to market. Underinvestment costs the United States over 900,000 jobs, including more than 97,000 American manufacturing jobs. Maximizing American-made materials when rebuilding infrastructure has the potential to create even more jobs. Relying on American-made inputs can also mitigate safety concerns related to large-scale outsourcing. I am with you, Duke--Duke University. I am from the west coast, and I have problems with some of these east coast athletic teams, but, hey, I am with them on this one. Infrastructure creates American jobs. This is something that I have used over and over again. This is from Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's Analytics. He is the former economics adviser for Senator John McCain when the Senator ran for the United States Presidency. He put it this way: For every dollar invested in infrastructure investment, $1.57 is pumped back into the American economy with well paying, middle class American jobs. This is just really critically important. The question for us, and the reason we are here on the floor and the reason we are talking about this issue of middle class economics and now transportation, is that we are up against another timeline here. We have got the transportation cliff, we have got a bridge that is collapsed, and the question is: Will this Congress provide a transportation bill that can bridge this collapsed bridge and rebuild it? I think we can. I know we must. My fear--my fear--Mr. Nolan, is that we have become really, really good at something we used to play when I was a kid, and it is called kick the can. We have become really good at kicking the can down the road rather than just coming to grips with the reality that we have to have a long-term transportation bill. There are many reasons for it. These are long-term projects, and over the last I guess almost 7 years now we have not had a long-term bill. The longest one has been a 2-year bill that passed 2 years ago, and that doesn't give the planners enough time to plan these long-term projects or the assurance that the money, the Federal money, will be there; $478 billion, 6 years, fully paid for, doesn't increase the gasoline or diesel tax but requires American corporations that have run away from their obligation to this Nation by hiding their profits overseas to bring those profits back and tax them accordingly. That is the President's plan. It is all there for us. Can we do it? I don't think we have any choice. I think we have to do it, Mr. Nolan. I don't know how you feel about it from Minnesota, but I know in California that we are in the midst of a major drought, and this is going to be the fourth year of a major drought in California, and it has been at least 30 years since there have been any major water infrastructure investments in California. Our economy in California is paying dearly for it. About one-third of the rice fields in my district are fallow. If you go further south into the San Joaquin Valley it is probably about the same percentage. Cantaloupes, cotton, and other kinds of row crops, tomatoes, are not being planted. We have to have in California investments in our water infrastructure. One of the things that my Republican colleague--and Mr. Nolan, you spoke about bipartisanship--my Republican colleague from my area, Mr. LaMalfa, he and I are going to introduce tomorrow a piece of legislation to build a very large, offstream reservoir called Sites Reservoir. It is about 1.8, 1.9 million acre-feet of water. If that had been built a decade ago, the drought would still be very difficult. There would be a lot of trouble and a lot of lost opportunity. But at least we would have a very significant amount of water available stored in that reservoir to help us along. So we are going to do that. That is a major infrastructure program, and we will see if we can participate here at the Federal level with the participation that the State of California voters have already approved, a $7.6 billion bond act in which there is money for storage, both aquifer, underground, as well as surface storage, probably including the Sites Reservoir. So there are things we can do. And this is a piece of legislation, we will present it to the Congress and the Senate and hopefully it will move along. Mr. Nolan, I am sure that you have projects up in your area that are important, and perhaps you would like to pick up here. Mr. NOLAN. I sure do, Mr. Garamendi. I think the fact that our bridges are falling down could not be more evidenced than in Minnesota, where we had the catastrophic collapse of the I-35 bridge, which killed a number of people and did obviously irreparable damage to their lives and many others. Mr. GARAMENDI. This was the bridge across the Mississippi in Minneapolis? Mr. NOLAN. Yes. Very tragic. I have got several thousand bridges in my district alone, and several hundred of them have been certified as obsolete and in disrepair, in need of repair, and, of course, there are thousands and thousands of those bridges across the country. I held three transportation hearings back in Minnesota here recently, and the unanimity of agreement on what needs to be done is really quite unique. I mean, generally, if you get 50 people in a room in Minnesota you will have at least 40, 45 opinions. Mr. GARAMENDI. Well, in California, you would have 150 opinions if you had 50 people. Mr. NOLAN. Well, everybody agreed, as you pointed out, we need a long-term plan so that you can plan accordingly, and then do it responsibly in the most efficient and economical way. Everyone came up and said that we need it for our economic growth and our business, and they understand that, as you were pointing out earlier, good infrastructure is the foundation, it is the foundation for every single successful economy in this world. I have said to people on occasion: If you don't want to pay any taxes, you can move to Zaire. I think they have about 2 miles of roads and no taxes, but you had better bring a little army with you to protect you. So the other thing, of course--it has become real apparent--is the congestion. You must see that. We are seeing it in Minnesota. People are spending endless hours sitting in their cars trying to get to and from work, time that they could have used to sleep in an extra hour, get home in time for dinner with their family. Mr. GARAMENDI. Work with the kids on their homework. Mr. NOLAN. Of course, you mentioned the collapse of the bridge. The other thing they want to see is some bipartisanship. I would like to remind our colleagues, as well as the folks back home, because you and I were there, and we were part of a couple of the few instances where, in the last session of Congress, the process was allowed to work. It was cumbersome, and it was contentious, but at the end of the day, we came together, and we passed a good, bipartisan farm bill. You and I were part of that. Mr. GARAMENDI. You were on the committee. Mr. NOLAN. As well as our colleagues here on both sides of the aisle, and then we were allowed on the water resources bill, and we were able to put together a good bill. Not everybody got everything they wanted, but everybody was a part of it. They had a chance to advance their ideas. We had open rules. If you want to have an amendment or a good idea, you got a chance to advance it and get a vote on it. People want to see more of that as well. Then there is one thing that doesn't get mentioned very often, and I don't [[Page H1107]] mind bringing it up, and a number of my folks back home brought it up. And that is--you mentioned the cost of not doing anything. Well, that would be devastating for America. It would be just devastating for our economy. I pray to God that would never happen. But our hope is, of course, it will be done in a responsible way that solves the problems and fixes these things. But there is a little factor. I have about a 5- mile dirt road to my farm, and I went through two front ends on my new pickup truck until it became part of a local effort to pave the roads. My road got paved. That was 10 years ago. I am still driving the same pickup truck, and I haven't lost any front ends. You know the old saying, you pay me now or you pay me later. Boy, I tell you, these potholes and these washboard roads and bridges falling down, there is a heavy price to be paid for not fixing, maintaining, and upkeeping our roads and our bridges. Mr. GARAMENDI. There is no doubt about it--you can ruin your car real fast. That 5-mile road was a county road, I assume, it was not your personal road? Mr. NOLAN. No, no. It was not my personal road. No, no, no. It was a combination county and township. But it helped to have been on the township planning committee. Mr. GARAMENDI. Whatever it took, you got it done. A couple of things that I think are also important as we go about this infrastructure, and that is: Who is going to provide the material? I want to give you an example of why it is important that we honor the Buy America laws that exist today. We have had Buy America requirements in laws for almost 50 years now, and those requirements simply say that if it is our taxpayer money or your taxpayer money, then it should be used to buy American-made products and materials. Now, out in California, we have the San Francisco Bay Bridge. This is about a--what do we have here--$3.9 billion project. Excuse me--it is not $3.9 billion; it is about $6 billion. It is $3.9 billion over budget. This project replaces the old San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge connecting the two cities across the bay that collapsed during the 1989 earthquake. The bridge went out to bid, and the contractor said: I can use Chinese steel, and it will be 10 percent cheaper if we use Chinese rather than American-made steel. So the State waived the Buy America requirements. They didn't use them. They went out and bought Chinese steel. Well, they got 3,000 jobs in China and overbudget and poor material. In fact, today it is reported in the California newspapers that one of the major bolts, which is a 25-foot bolt, and I don't know, it must be several inches across, that holds down the main pier to the bridge is cracking. So we have a problem here. {time} 2000 Now, New York is undertaking a bridge across the Hudson River. It is called the Tappan Zee Bridge, and it is made with American steel. American steel is being used. The total cost is $3.9 billion--notice, that is the cost of the overrun in California. There are 7,728 American jobs, and it is 100 percent made in America. When we go about this infrastructure, I want to make very, very sure that we maintain the Buy America requirements. We can do it. I am going to put up one more placard here. This is one of my favorites. This is a brand-new 100 percent American-made electric locomotive for the Washington, D.C., to Boston Northeast corridor. About 70 to 80 of these will be made. In the American Recovery Act--you remember the stimulus bill-- somebody wrote in $700 million for Amtrak to buy new locomotives, and they said: 100 percent American-made. General Electric looked at it, other companies looked at it, and a German company looked at this $700 million or so and 70 to 80 locomotives, 100 percent American-made, and they go: We can do that. So Siemens, a major international German company, had a manufacturing plant in Sacramento, and they set about to make 100 percent American- made locomotives. They built double the size of their factory, hired several hundred new workers, and they went out across the United States to find all the parts. They are now building 100 percent American-made locomotives, a major infrastructure project, great for American jobs, great for the future. This is one of the first ones that came off the lot. Now, my final point and then I want to turn this back to my colleague from Minnesota. Today, on the east coast, Amtrak is going out to bid for 28 new high-speed train sets to travel between Washington, D.C., and Boston at maybe half again as fast as the current trains, so you can zip between the two cities--Washington, D.C., and New York--in, I don't know, 2 hours or less. They want--Amtrak--wants a waiver from the Buy America provisions, and I am saying: No way, period. This is American taxpayer money that is going to be used. You are going to buy America, we are going to make those train sets in America, and we can do it. Yes, we can--si se puede. We can do it. We can build these things in America and create good middle class jobs in America, just like Siemens is doing in Sacramento when they are making 100 percent American-made locomotives in Sacramento. This is an opportunity for us as we build our infrastructure, as we put together the surface transportation plan, as we take the Water Resources Reform and Development Act. Keep in mind and always keep in place the Buy America provisions, so that your tax money is used on American-made equipment and employing Americans making those things. I am sure this is important up in your area, as well as it is in Sacramento, California, on the edge of my district, Mr. Nolan. I know it is important to me, and I think it is important to Americans, that we use our tax money to buy American-made products that are employing Americans. Mr. NOLAN. Well, indeed, it is. I represent Minnesota's Iron Range, the largest iron mines anywhere in the United States. We are dependent upon a good, strong market for U.S. steel and for Minnesota-made taconite and processed iron ore. I was so delighted to join you and others recently in petitioning the U.S. Department of Commerce and the International Trade Commission to curtail the importation of cheap Korean steel. The market for steel in America is very, very good. The problem is that American steel is only providing about 70 to 75 percent of it. Close to over 30 percent of it is being foreign steel that is brought in. Foreign steel that, by the way, is subsidized by the foreign governments. Our steelworkers, iron mineworkers, can compete with anybody in the world, anybody in America, quite frankly, we can compete with anybody, but it has got to be fair trade. If they have government-subsidized, below market cheap steel coming in here, that is unfair trade. Guess what, there is about a dozen steel mills left here in America, and there is about 50,000 workers here. If we don't find a way to curtail the importation of this cheap, subsidized steel, we are going to put all 12 of those steel companies out of business, we are going to put 50,000 steelworkers out of business and countless thousands of mining processors and workers in this country. If we are talking about the middle class, we better start insisting on fair trade in this country, insisting--as you have so eloquently pointed out here--the significance and the importance of making it in America with U.S. steel when we are talking roads, bridges, railroads, pipelines, and all the rest. Mr. GARAMENDI. Well, here it is, the San Francisco Bay Bridge built with Chinese steel. They built a brand-new, one of the most advanced steel mills, making one of the most advanced types of steel in China-- 3,000 Chinese jobs, zero American. Then the Tappan Zee Bridge in New York, American steel--probably some of that iron ore from your district goes into making that steel. Mr. NOLAN. Oh, it did, no doubt. Mr. GARAMENDI. No doubt about it. Mr. NOLAN. And do you know what, John, I found in international trade, when it comes to quality, American steel is considered to be the best quality. [[Page H1108]] Now, what is the importance of that? Well, it might be the difference between a bridge falling down or standing; it might mean the difference between a pipeline breaking and polluting a wetland versus not doing that. There is an economic reason here, there is a reason for the middle class, there is a reason for our economy, there is a reason for safety, there is a reason for health, there is a reason for environment, there are so many good reasons to make it in America, John. Mr. GARAMENDI. You were just singing my song there. This Bay Bridge, why was it $3.9 billion over? Because the steel was unsatisfactory. It was low quality, it had cracks in it, it didn't meet the requirements, they had to go back and redo the welds--many, many issues. You are absolutely correct about quality, as well as about the jobs in America. We are going to make it in America. We have an opportunity here. Can I take up one more issue? Mr. NOLAN. Well, I am going to depart, but I really want to thank you for this session here and bringing it to the attention of our colleagues and people all across this country that care about America, care about good-paying middle class jobs, and want to see us do what we have got to do here to come together, fix this thing, and continue the great progress that America has enjoyed. A big part of being an American is paying it forward, and now, it is time for us to step up and do what we have to do for the next generation. Mr. GARAMENDI. Mr. Nolan, I thank you so very much. The folks in the northern Minnesota area are blessed to have you return after a 32-year hiatus. You came back with a fire in your belly, and you are ready to go. Mr. NOLAN. Well, I am honored and thrilled and glad to be here. Mr. GARAMENDI. Thank you so very much for joining us this evening. I want to bring up just one more issue, and then we will call it a night. America is blessed with a lot of energy. We have seen a resurgence of American energy here in the United States. We have seen us go from an importing Nation--we can be an exporting Nation. One of the things that the American gas industry wants to do is to export a strategic national asset, that is our natural gas. It has allowed us to have one of the lower energy prices in the world. That has allowed for a resurgence of manufacturing in the United States. There are other factors. Clearly, the ability to have low- priced natural gas is one of the ingredients in the resurgence of American manufacturing. Now, the gas industry wants to import a lot of gas so they can get two or three times more for the gas overseas. I want to be really careful here, I don't want to drive up the price of natural gas, but if we are going to export this strategic national asset, then we ought to consider two other strategic issues for the United States. One of them is the merchant marines. These are the American sailors and American ships. Our military is absolutely dependent on the merchant marines. We ship a lot of things through the air on the big C- 5As and the C-17s, but it is a small percentage of what we need if we go to Iraq or any other part of the world with our military. The merchant marines have historically, from the very earliest days of this Nation, been one of the key strategic assets in the United States. A third strategic asset is the U.S. Navy and the shipyards that build the naval ships. Those shipyards are absolutely critical. If we didn't have them, would we go to China to have them build our aircraft carriers and our submarines? I don't think so. The shipyards are a strategic asset, absolutely essential for American defense. You have got these three things: the natural gas, a strategic asset; the merchant marines; and the shipbuilding. Here is a key to American jobs, and that is, if we are ever to export natural gas, it will be done in liquefied natural gas. You take the natural gas, you compress it into a liquid, and you put it on an LNG-- liquefied natural gas--ship. This is an example of one liquefied natural gas ship. Sometime this year, a company--Cheniere--located in Texas will begin exporting LNG from a facility in Texas. They will need about 100 ships to export the full capacity of that LNG export facility. My sense of this is let us use that export of a strategic national asset to build and to grow the other two strategics. We should require that any LNG shipped from the United States be shipped on American-made tankers with American crews, thereby lifting up the ability of our Nation to grow its economy and to maintain its strategic defense industries--shipbuilding and the merchant marines--at the same time we ship and export a strategic asset. What does it mean? It means that the shipyards in America in the next two decades would be busy. American workers would be in those shipyards, they would be making the ships, so it would be the shipbuilders. You can imagine what could happen in the ports around the United States--in Baltimore, in the south coast, along the gulf coast, and in California, San Diego, up in Washington, and even San Francisco--an opportunity to build our economy with, once again, infrastructure, a different kind of infrastructure, this is moving infrastructure, the great ships that will be all across the oceans of this Nation and in the harbors around the United States, American ships, American-built ships, American sailors, exporting American liquefied natural gas. Si se puede--yes, we can. We can make it in America. We can rebuild the American economy. We can focus on middle class economics with the infrastructure systems that we must build, the foundation for future economic growth, and the foundation for American jobs today. Make it in America, build America, build our ports, our water systems, our highways, our bridges, our airports, our sanitation systems. Let us have the American Society of Civil Engineers come back with an A-plus rating when they look at our airports, an A-plus rating when they look at our rail lines, our transit lines, when they look at our transit systems, when they look at our waste disposal systems. We don't want to be a backwater. This is America. We are the people that can build for the future. All it takes is the Senate and the House to pass a 6-year surface transportation bill and infrastructure bills that are fully funded, that provide the foundation for middle class jobs, middle class economics, putting Americans back to work, and building this Nation's future. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 31 (Tuesday, February 24, 2015)] [House] [Pages H1103-H1108] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] MIDDLE CLASS ECONOMICS The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Zeldin). Under the Speaker's announced policy of January 6, 2015, the gentleman from California (Mr. Garamendi) is recognized for 60 minutes as the designee of the minority leader. Mr. GARAMENDI. Mr. Speaker, about a month and a half ago, we heard the President speak to us about the economy, about his goals for America. He labeled his speech ``middle class economics,'' and tonight, I want to pick this issue up once again. We are here most every week discussing this issue, although last time we were up here, we took up another important issue, Alzheimer's. But I want to come back to middle class economics, why it is important. Well, basically, it is important because it drives our economy. The great majority of Americans want to be in the middle class, and most of them are. Unfortunately, we have seen the decline of the middle class, their ability to own a home, a car, to provide for their family--but if the middle class is healthy, it will drive our economy, and it will create jobs, so the focus on the middle class becomes very, very important. We can do this by strengthening their wages. If they are able to earn more money, then they will buy the home, the car, and the economy will grow, and other people will be able to enjoy the fruits of our economy. I am going to focus on infrastructure in a moment, but I just want to skip that over and go down to the other things. Health care--who among us doesn't want to have a good health care program, so that if we get sick or injured, we will be able to get to a doctor, get to a hospital, get the care we need to get back on our feet, and to once again be productive or, in our old age, be able to enjoy our retirement? So the affordable health care becomes really important, and here, we [[Page H1104]] have the Affordable Health Care Act as part of that. Finally, we need to develop policies to grow the middle class, and one such policy is infrastructure, which is the focus of tonight's discussion. I want to just stay with this infrastructure issue for a few moments, and then I am going to invite my colleague from Minnesota, Rick Nolan, to join us here. Let me talk about this also. The other theme, in addition to the middle class economics, is the Make It In America theme that we have been talking about for 4 years now. Trade, taxes, energy, labor, education, research, and infrastructure, these are the elements that we fold into our Make It In America agenda. We talk about trade. There is going to be a lot of discussion about that here in Congress over the next several months as the Trans-Pacific Partnership comes up. Taxes, which we will pick up with the infrastructure issue in a few moments--energy is also part of the infrastructure issue. Anyway, Make It In America means bringing the jobs back home, employing Americans, doing the things that we need to do in this country, whether it is the health care sector; the infrastructure; building the roads, the bridges, and the like; or education. That is the Make It In America agenda, and it is part of the middle class economics. In fact, it is the key to it. Why is infrastructure important? Well, there are certain things like this, a collapsed bridge. This is on Interstate 5 in the State of Washington. This is a bridge near the Canadian border. About 3 years ago, it went into the river, collapsed--one of about 163,000 deficient bridges here in the United States. So, yep, we have got a problem. Are we going to be able to address this problem? Well, we had better. Actually, it is 156,000. I was a little bit overanxious there. The American Society of Civil Engineers, who build these things, have graded the American infrastructure, and I just want to go through it: aviation, our airports, which I believe the Vice President, in referring to LaGuardia, said even the developing countries have a better airport than LaGuardia in New York City, aviation, a D; bridges, C-plus--as I said, 156,000 deficient; dams, D; running water, D; energy, D-plus; hazardous waste, D; inland waterways, D; levees, to protect us from floods, D; our ports, a C; public parks and recreation, C; our railroads, C-plus--whoa, a C-plus; our highways, a D; our schools, that is where our kids are, a D; solid waste, we are doing pretty well, that is a B; our transit systems, D; wastewater, a D. Incidentally, in California, we are in the midst of a major drought, and it is perfectly clear that the wastewater systems are inadequate. If we were to also fund the recycling programs which could be connected to the wastewater, we could, in southern California, over the next half decade, create a million acre feet of new water as we recycle the water from the fifth biggest river on the west coast of the Western Hemisphere, the sanitation plants in southern California. {time} 1930 So we have got some work out ahead of us. Let me bring this home before I invite my colleague from the great State of Minnesota to join us on this issue. Earlier today, I was reading an article in The Sacramento Bee about the transportation systems in Sacramento. Let me just share some of these thoughts with you. In Sacramento, the average commuter spends 32 hours each year stuck in traffic. This amounts to $669 of lost productivity. That is literally wages that could have been earned if they weren't stuck in traffic. For all of the commuters in the Sacramento area, which I represent, that is $834 million of commuting time. For the truckers in the area that are trying to pass through Sacramento on Interstate 5, on Interstate 80 or Highway 50, it is $199 million of lost productivity. There is another alternative. Down in Riverside, a southern California city that I once represented when I was lieutenant governor, they want to build a 13-mile streetcar system in the city of Riverside. It would cost about $300 million. The economic analysis that was done on that indicates that if they were to do it, there would be a 4-to-1 return on investment. Now, you tell me which investment banker on Wall Street wouldn't want to have a 4-to-1 return on their investment. Well, the city of Riverside could have a 4-to-1 return on their investment of $300 million to build that 13-mile streetcar section. That is property values and economic development. This morning, The Wall Street Journal published an article in which the American Society of Civil Engineers was quoted that between 2012 and 2022, in America, because of the insufficient infrastructure--and remember, I just read you their GPA, mostly Ds--lost sales, $1 trillion of lost sales. For the United States, the delays will cost $3.1 trillion. And to bring it home to a single company--a big company but, nonetheless, just one company--United Parcel Service, UPS, all of those big brown trucks that are out there, $105 million in lost revenue. There is a solution. The President has put forward to us, the Members of Congress, a 6-year, $478 billion transportation plan that will be paid for--fully paid for with the current gasoline and diesel tax not increased, keep it the same--and going out to those American corporations that are stiffing the American taxpayer by hiding their profits overseas. The President says: Bring those profits home; pay your fair share of the taxes. So there is a fully paid-for proposal before us here in the House of Representatives for a $478 billion, 6- year transportation program. Now, I think our Speaker represents an area in Ohio near Kentucky, and I believe there is a bridge in that area called the Brent Spence Bridge. It crosses the Ohio River between Kentucky and Ohio. It was built for 80,000 cars a day, and now there are over 200,000 cars a day that pass over that bridge--or try to pass over that bridge--creating a monumental traffic jam and slowing down the entire economy in that region. By the way, don't ever walk or drive underneath the bridge because the concrete in the bridge is falling off. They have a nice little safety net over the road beneath it, so perhaps, therefore, you won't be hit by a falling piece of concrete. So the issue for us, the Representatives of the American public, is: Are we willing to put together a full transportation program so that these kinds of bridge collapses are pictures of yesterday, not the pictures of tomorrow's future? I would like to have the gentleman from Minnesota, Mr. Rick Nolan, join us now. If you would come on down and join us, perhaps here on the floor, and take one of the microphones. Mr. Nolan, you have a fascinating history here in the House of Representatives. You were here in the early seventies as a Representative and then decided to go back to Minnesota and build a business, a lumber manufacturing, a timber manufacturing business. It was very successful. Then you came back to straighten us out, bringing all of that history to us. Welcome, Mr. Nolan. Thank you so very much for joining us this evening as we talk about transportation and infrastructure in America. Mr. NOLAN. Well, thank you. The House historian tells me that my 32-year hiatus is the longest in the history of the House of Representatives. Mr. GARAMENDI. Well, you had an opportunity to learn about the private sector and learn about the necessity of transportation; and I think your business was dependent on that, both to get the materials to your lumber mill and then to export. Mr. NOLAN. Very much so. I also built an export trading company and did a little business all over the globe. People asked me what I sold. I like to tell them I sold, well, just about everything except guns and drugs, which is where all the real money was. It was really quite an eye-opening experience to see how the rest of the world does business, to get a better feel and understanding for the importance of agriculture and a better feel and understanding of agriculture as it relates to feeding a hungry world, but infrastructure and its importance to building the middle class here in the country, to laying the foundation for job growth and economic growth. And to come back here again after those years in business and in community service, I have got to be frank with you; I feel [[Page H1105]] much better prepared today than I ever was to serve my district and to serve my Nation, and I am grateful to have the opportunity to be here. I want to particularly thank you for calling this to the attention of the American public, the importance of infrastructure, the importance of infrastructure to the middle class in this country, and the importance that it brings to the fulfillment of the American Dream. The American Dream is not everybody becoming a billionaire or a Pulitzer Prize winner. It is about contributing. It is about having a good job. It is about having a living wage. It is about having some money left over at the end of the week to take your family or your best friend and go out and have dinner or maybe wet a line and go fishing. And, quite frankly, that is what is getting away from us. I want to thank you for bringing to the attention of people how transportation and infrastructure and its degradation that is taking place is related to, quite frankly, the demise and the decline of the middle class in this country. The simple truth is the rich are getting richer, the poor are getting poorer, the middle class is getting crushed, and, simultaneously, our infrastructure is falling apart. The gentleman from California (Mr. Garamendi), you, too, have a background in business and public service and community service that gives you a good grasp and an understanding for the importance of all this. Mr. GARAMENDI. Well, there is no doubt about the importance of it. If you want to build good middle class jobs, a lot of those jobs are in the infrastructure. It may be a hardhat job out there putting up the steel and the concrete, the ironworkers or the cement masons or the operators of the heavy equipment. All of those are really good middle class jobs, no doubt about it, wherever they happen to be across the Nation. But also, in the back office, somebody has to do the accounting; somebody has to do the design work--the architects, the draftsmen and -women that are involved. So these jobs permeate the entire economy. And it is absolutely true that if we can fund--that is, pass--a 6-year, robust transportation bill that is fully paid for, Americans would go to work in middle class jobs. That is the first effect: people will have jobs. And in building the infrastructure, you then lay the foundation for future economic growth. You have seen this in your area. I was thinking about your call for the family to be able to enjoy the fruits of life. And I am thinking about you have got some heavy-duty hunting country up in your area. You are out in the backwoods of Minnesota, if I recall. Mr. NOLAN. I am. My nearest neighbor is a couple of miles away. Mr. GARAMENDI. And in between are bear, deer, and fish. Mr. NOLAN. We have bear. We have duck. We have grouse. We have good hunting and darn good fishing, too. You mentioned the fact that I had served many years ago, quite frankly, back in the seventies. I like to tell people I was only 10 years old at the time. When I first got back here, I said to a number of people: Perhaps you knew my father when he had served here back in the seventies. And there were always a couple of old-timers in the back that would laugh. And everyone would say: Well, what is so funny about that? And they would say: Well, it wasn't his father; it was him. But I have got to tell you, it was quite different. It was quite different than it is today. I had my staff do a little survey. We found that in the terms I served before, there was an average of about 8,000 subcommittee, full committee, and conference committee meetings here in the Congress. What that meant was that we got together 5 days a week in our committees. And all the diverse elements that make up America were all represented in those meetings, and that is how we found common ground; that is how we came together; that is how we fixed things; that is how we got things done. And people have to be reminded, I think, that process is important to good government. Because now we are faced with this gridlock; we are faced with this terrible partisanship, the seeming inability to be productive and to get things done. I think experts that study governance here in America are saying now that this immediate last Congress was the most unproductive in the history of the country. Well, guess what. When we had 8,000 committee meetings in the past, yes, maybe around 1,000 of them were just formal hearings or, you know, you have got to give Jack Nicklaus a gold medal and do a reauthorization of Peanut Butter and Jelly Week. Well, guess what. This last session of Congress, we had about 1,000 of those meetings, and most of them were quite informal. As you recall, Mr. Garamendi, when we started the hearings about a year ago in the Transportation Committee because we knew that the transportation legislation needed to be reauthorized, we had everybody come in before that committee; and, boy, we were laying the foundation for a good reauthorization of a transportation and infrastructure bill. You were there every day. By the way, I want to commend you for the leadership that you have shown on that committee in so many areas, in so many ways. But we had everybody, as you recall, from the head of the national Chamber of Commerce to the heads of all the labor unions, the truckers, retail. Everybody came before that committee. I don't know if you recall. But I asked every one of them, I said: I have three questions. And I remember the committee groaning, saying: Gee, Nolan, you have only got 5 minutes. How are you going to do that? I said: Question number one, is there anyone here on this committee who disagrees with the notion that our infrastructure is badly in need of repair and is falling down and dilapidated? Nobody disagreed. Second question, is there anybody here--of all that group that was testifying--that disagrees with the notion that our ability to grow an economy and create good jobs is dependent upon a good, strong infrastructure? Nobody disagreed, as you would recall. And then lastly, I said: Is there anybody on this committee who doubts that we need to find some new revenue to rebuild our infrastructure? And nobody disagreed. And I said: Make a note of it, Mr. Chairman, because we have got to write a bill here. And that is what we were there for. You know as well as everybody else that the authorization for the Transportation Committee to write a bill was pulled away from the committee. Presumably, in the Speaker's office or someplace else, it was decided that we should do a temporary reauthorization for 8 months; and, as you recall, we borrowed money from people's private pension funds. {time} 1945 We are getting near that 8-month deadline again. Mr. GARAMENDI. I think it is May 15. Mr. NOLAN. May 15. So now working people's pension funds are short a little money potentially, and we still haven't fixed the transportation problem. So one of the things I want to do here tonight, and I know you do as well, is to call upon the Speaker to let the committee do its work. We have got a good committee. You know it as well as I do and everybody else. There is a lot of goodwill in this Chamber among Democrats, Republicans, conservatives, and liberals, and if we are allowed to sit down in that committee and advance our ideas and argue the merits of them, we will find that common ground. We will find a way to get this country back on track with rebuilding our infrastructure. That is what democracy is all about. Someone said to me the other day here, and it almost broke my heart, when I was explaining this and they said: Well, isn't it more efficient here by not using the committees? I said: Yeah, of course, it is. The Nazis and the Communists would love it. Democracy is a lot of hard work. There is so much goodwill in this Chamber, and there are so many good men and women. We get along fine. Mr. Speaker, let the process work. Let the committee do its job, and we will get a good transportation bill, and we will rebuild this middle class and rebuild our economy in a way that is fair to everyone. Mr. GARAMENDI. Well, there is no doubt that if we were to pass--well, we [[Page H1106]] don't have a choice. If we don't pass a bill in the next 2 months, 2\1/ 2\ months, all public works, transportation programs, will come to a screeching halt. There will be no more Federal money, and it will simply stop. So we have got work to do. As you say, if the committee could have its way, we could put together a good bill. There has been a long history here of the transportation bill being a bipartisan bill. We can do that. If we don't--let me just go back through this. I get stacks and stacks of paper, and this one caught my eye. It is entitled, ``Infrastructure Investment Creates American Jobs.'' I said: Well, that is kind of a pretty good cover there. It has roads, bridges, ports, and so forth. It is the Duke Center on Globalization, Governance & Competitiveness. So it is the Duke University. Here they say: Old and broken transportation infrastructure makes the United States less competitive than 15 of our major trading partners and makes manufacturers less efficient in getting goods to market. Underinvestment costs the United States over 900,000 jobs, including more than 97,000 American manufacturing jobs. Maximizing American-made materials when rebuilding infrastructure has the potential to create even more jobs. Relying on American-made inputs can also mitigate safety concerns related to large-scale outsourcing. I am with you, Duke--Duke University. I am from the west coast, and I have problems with some of these east coast athletic teams, but, hey, I am with them on this one. Infrastructure creates American jobs. This is something that I have used over and over again. This is from Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's Analytics. He is the former economics adviser for Senator John McCain when the Senator ran for the United States Presidency. He put it this way: For every dollar invested in infrastructure investment, $1.57 is pumped back into the American economy with well paying, middle class American jobs. This is just really critically important. The question for us, and the reason we are here on the floor and the reason we are talking about this issue of middle class economics and now transportation, is that we are up against another timeline here. We have got the transportation cliff, we have got a bridge that is collapsed, and the question is: Will this Congress provide a transportation bill that can bridge this collapsed bridge and rebuild it? I think we can. I know we must. My fear--my fear--Mr. Nolan, is that we have become really, really good at something we used to play when I was a kid, and it is called kick the can. We have become really good at kicking the can down the road rather than just coming to grips with the reality that we have to have a long-term transportation bill. There are many reasons for it. These are long-term projects, and over the last I guess almost 7 years now we have not had a long-term bill. The longest one has been a 2-year bill that passed 2 years ago, and that doesn't give the planners enough time to plan these long-term projects or the assurance that the money, the Federal money, will be there; $478 billion, 6 years, fully paid for, doesn't increase the gasoline or diesel tax but requires American corporations that have run away from their obligation to this Nation by hiding their profits overseas to bring those profits back and tax them accordingly. That is the President's plan. It is all there for us. Can we do it? I don't think we have any choice. I think we have to do it, Mr. Nolan. I don't know how you feel about it from Minnesota, but I know in California that we are in the midst of a major drought, and this is going to be the fourth year of a major drought in California, and it has been at least 30 years since there have been any major water infrastructure investments in California. Our economy in California is paying dearly for it. About one-third of the rice fields in my district are fallow. If you go further south into the San Joaquin Valley it is probably about the same percentage. Cantaloupes, cotton, and other kinds of row crops, tomatoes, are not being planted. We have to have in California investments in our water infrastructure. One of the things that my Republican colleague--and Mr. Nolan, you spoke about bipartisanship--my Republican colleague from my area, Mr. LaMalfa, he and I are going to introduce tomorrow a piece of legislation to build a very large, offstream reservoir called Sites Reservoir. It is about 1.8, 1.9 million acre-feet of water. If that had been built a decade ago, the drought would still be very difficult. There would be a lot of trouble and a lot of lost opportunity. But at least we would have a very significant amount of water available stored in that reservoir to help us along. So we are going to do that. That is a major infrastructure program, and we will see if we can participate here at the Federal level with the participation that the State of California voters have already approved, a $7.6 billion bond act in which there is money for storage, both aquifer, underground, as well as surface storage, probably including the Sites Reservoir. So there are things we can do. And this is a piece of legislation, we will present it to the Congress and the Senate and hopefully it will move along. Mr. Nolan, I am sure that you have projects up in your area that are important, and perhaps you would like to pick up here. Mr. NOLAN. I sure do, Mr. Garamendi. I think the fact that our bridges are falling down could not be more evidenced than in Minnesota, where we had the catastrophic collapse of the I-35 bridge, which killed a number of people and did obviously irreparable damage to their lives and many others. Mr. GARAMENDI. This was the bridge across the Mississippi in Minneapolis? Mr. NOLAN. Yes. Very tragic. I have got several thousand bridges in my district alone, and several hundred of them have been certified as obsolete and in disrepair, in need of repair, and, of course, there are thousands and thousands of those bridges across the country. I held three transportation hearings back in Minnesota here recently, and the unanimity of agreement on what needs to be done is really quite unique. I mean, generally, if you get 50 people in a room in Minnesota you will have at least 40, 45 opinions. Mr. GARAMENDI. Well, in California, you would have 150 opinions if you had 50 people. Mr. NOLAN. Well, everybody agreed, as you pointed out, we need a long-term plan so that you can plan accordingly, and then do it responsibly in the most efficient and economical way. Everyone came up and said that we need it for our economic growth and our business, and they understand that, as you were pointing out earlier, good infrastructure is the foundation, it is the foundation for every single successful economy in this world. I have said to people on occasion: If you don't want to pay any taxes, you can move to Zaire. I think they have about 2 miles of roads and no taxes, but you had better bring a little army with you to protect you. So the other thing, of course--it has become real apparent--is the congestion. You must see that. We are seeing it in Minnesota. People are spending endless hours sitting in their cars trying to get to and from work, time that they could have used to sleep in an extra hour, get home in time for dinner with their family. Mr. GARAMENDI. Work with the kids on their homework. Mr. NOLAN. Of course, you mentioned the collapse of the bridge. The other thing they want to see is some bipartisanship. I would like to remind our colleagues, as well as the folks back home, because you and I were there, and we were part of a couple of the few instances where, in the last session of Congress, the process was allowed to work. It was cumbersome, and it was contentious, but at the end of the day, we came together, and we passed a good, bipartisan farm bill. You and I were part of that. Mr. GARAMENDI. You were on the committee. Mr. NOLAN. As well as our colleagues here on both sides of the aisle, and then we were allowed on the water resources bill, and we were able to put together a good bill. Not everybody got everything they wanted, but everybody was a part of it. They had a chance to advance their ideas. We had open rules. If you want to have an amendment or a good idea, you got a chance to advance it and get a vote on it. People want to see more of that as well. Then there is one thing that doesn't get mentioned very often, and I don't [[Page H1107]] mind bringing it up, and a number of my folks back home brought it up. And that is--you mentioned the cost of not doing anything. Well, that would be devastating for America. It would be just devastating for our economy. I pray to God that would never happen. But our hope is, of course, it will be done in a responsible way that solves the problems and fixes these things. But there is a little factor. I have about a 5- mile dirt road to my farm, and I went through two front ends on my new pickup truck until it became part of a local effort to pave the roads. My road got paved. That was 10 years ago. I am still driving the same pickup truck, and I haven't lost any front ends. You know the old saying, you pay me now or you pay me later. Boy, I tell you, these potholes and these washboard roads and bridges falling down, there is a heavy price to be paid for not fixing, maintaining, and upkeeping our roads and our bridges. Mr. GARAMENDI. There is no doubt about it--you can ruin your car real fast. That 5-mile road was a county road, I assume, it was not your personal road? Mr. NOLAN. No, no. It was not my personal road. No, no, no. It was a combination county and township. But it helped to have been on the township planning committee. Mr. GARAMENDI. Whatever it took, you got it done. A couple of things that I think are also important as we go about this infrastructure, and that is: Who is going to provide the material? I want to give you an example of why it is important that we honor the Buy America laws that exist today. We have had Buy America requirements in laws for almost 50 years now, and those requirements simply say that if it is our taxpayer money or your taxpayer money, then it should be used to buy American-made products and materials. Now, out in California, we have the San Francisco Bay Bridge. This is about a--what do we have here--$3.9 billion project. Excuse me--it is not $3.9 billion; it is about $6 billion. It is $3.9 billion over budget. This project replaces the old San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge connecting the two cities across the bay that collapsed during the 1989 earthquake. The bridge went out to bid, and the contractor said: I can use Chinese steel, and it will be 10 percent cheaper if we use Chinese rather than American-made steel. So the State waived the Buy America requirements. They didn't use them. They went out and bought Chinese steel. Well, they got 3,000 jobs in China and overbudget and poor material. In fact, today it is reported in the California newspapers that one of the major bolts, which is a 25-foot bolt, and I don't know, it must be several inches across, that holds down the main pier to the bridge is cracking. So we have a problem here. {time} 2000 Now, New York is undertaking a bridge across the Hudson River. It is called the Tappan Zee Bridge, and it is made with American steel. American steel is being used. The total cost is $3.9 billion--notice, that is the cost of the overrun in California. There are 7,728 American jobs, and it is 100 percent made in America. When we go about this infrastructure, I want to make very, very sure that we maintain the Buy America requirements. We can do it. I am going to put up one more placard here. This is one of my favorites. This is a brand-new 100 percent American-made electric locomotive for the Washington, D.C., to Boston Northeast corridor. About 70 to 80 of these will be made. In the American Recovery Act--you remember the stimulus bill-- somebody wrote in $700 million for Amtrak to buy new locomotives, and they said: 100 percent American-made. General Electric looked at it, other companies looked at it, and a German company looked at this $700 million or so and 70 to 80 locomotives, 100 percent American-made, and they go: We can do that. So Siemens, a major international German company, had a manufacturing plant in Sacramento, and they set about to make 100 percent American- made locomotives. They built double the size of their factory, hired several hundred new workers, and they went out across the United States to find all the parts. They are now building 100 percent American-made locomotives, a major infrastructure project, great for American jobs, great for the future. This is one of the first ones that came off the lot. Now, my final point and then I want to turn this back to my colleague from Minnesota. Today, on the east coast, Amtrak is going out to bid for 28 new high-speed train sets to travel between Washington, D.C., and Boston at maybe half again as fast as the current trains, so you can zip between the two cities--Washington, D.C., and New York--in, I don't know, 2 hours or less. They want--Amtrak--wants a waiver from the Buy America provisions, and I am saying: No way, period. This is American taxpayer money that is going to be used. You are going to buy America, we are going to make those train sets in America, and we can do it. Yes, we can--si se puede. We can do it. We can build these things in America and create good middle class jobs in America, just like Siemens is doing in Sacramento when they are making 100 percent American-made locomotives in Sacramento. This is an opportunity for us as we build our infrastructure, as we put together the surface transportation plan, as we take the Water Resources Reform and Development Act. Keep in mind and always keep in place the Buy America provisions, so that your tax money is used on American-made equipment and employing Americans making those things. I am sure this is important up in your area, as well as it is in Sacramento, California, on the edge of my district, Mr. Nolan. I know it is important to me, and I think it is important to Americans, that we use our tax money to buy American-made products that are employing Americans. Mr. NOLAN. Well, indeed, it is. I represent Minnesota's Iron Range, the largest iron mines anywhere in the United States. We are dependent upon a good, strong market for U.S. steel and for Minnesota-made taconite and processed iron ore. I was so delighted to join you and others recently in petitioning the U.S. Department of Commerce and the International Trade Commission to curtail the importation of cheap Korean steel. The market for steel in America is very, very good. The problem is that American steel is only providing about 70 to 75 percent of it. Close to over 30 percent of it is being foreign steel that is brought in. Foreign steel that, by the way, is subsidized by the foreign governments. Our steelworkers, iron mineworkers, can compete with anybody in the world, anybody in America, quite frankly, we can compete with anybody, but it has got to be fair trade. If they have government-subsidized, below market cheap steel coming in here, that is unfair trade. Guess what, there is about a dozen steel mills left here in America, and there is about 50,000 workers here. If we don't find a way to curtail the importation of this cheap, subsidized steel, we are going to put all 12 of those steel companies out of business, we are going to put 50,000 steelworkers out of business and countless thousands of mining processors and workers in this country. If we are talking about the middle class, we better start insisting on fair trade in this country, insisting--as you have so eloquently pointed out here--the significance and the importance of making it in America with U.S. steel when we are talking roads, bridges, railroads, pipelines, and all the rest. Mr. GARAMENDI. Well, here it is, the San Francisco Bay Bridge built with Chinese steel. They built a brand-new, one of the most advanced steel mills, making one of the most advanced types of steel in China-- 3,000 Chinese jobs, zero American. Then the Tappan Zee Bridge in New York, American steel--probably some of that iron ore from your district goes into making that steel. Mr. NOLAN. Oh, it did, no doubt. Mr. GARAMENDI. No doubt about it. Mr. NOLAN. And do you know what, John, I found in international trade, when it comes to quality, American steel is considered to be the best quality. [[Page H1108]] Now, what is the importance of that? Well, it might be the difference between a bridge falling down or standing; it might mean the difference between a pipeline breaking and polluting a wetland versus not doing that. There is an economic reason here, there is a reason for the middle class, there is a reason for our economy, there is a reason for safety, there is a reason for health, there is a reason for environment, there are so many good reasons to make it in America, John. Mr. GARAMENDI. You were just singing my song there. This Bay Bridge, why was it $3.9 billion over? Because the steel was unsatisfactory. It was low quality, it had cracks in it, it didn't meet the requirements, they had to go back and redo the welds--many, many issues. You are absolutely correct about quality, as well as about the jobs in America. We are going to make it in America. We have an opportunity here. Can I take up one more issue? Mr. NOLAN. Well, I am going to depart, but I really want to thank you for this session here and bringing it to the attention of our colleagues and people all across this country that care about America, care about good-paying middle class jobs, and want to see us do what we have got to do here to come together, fix this thing, and continue the great progress that America has enjoyed. A big part of being an American is paying it forward, and now, it is time for us to step up and do what we have to do for the next generation. Mr. GARAMENDI. Mr. Nolan, I thank you so very much. The folks in the northern Minnesota area are blessed to have you return after a 32-year hiatus. You came back with a fire in your belly, and you are ready to go. Mr. NOLAN. Well, I am honored and thrilled and glad to be here. Mr. GARAMENDI. Thank you so very much for joining us this evening. I want to bring up just one more issue, and then we will call it a night. America is blessed with a lot of energy. We have seen a resurgence of American energy here in the United States. We have seen us go from an importing Nation--we can be an exporting Nation. One of the things that the American gas industry wants to do is to export a strategic national asset, that is our natural gas. It has allowed us to have one of the lower energy prices in the world. That has allowed for a resurgence of manufacturing in the United States. There are other factors. Clearly, the ability to have low- priced natural gas is one of the ingredients in the resurgence of American manufacturing. Now, the gas industry wants to import a lot of gas so they can get two or three times more for the gas overseas. I want to be really careful here, I don't want to drive up the price of natural gas, but if we are going to export this strategic national asset, then we ought to consider two other strategic issues for the United States. One of them is the merchant marines. These are the American sailors and American ships. Our military is absolutely dependent on the merchant marines. We ship a lot of things through the air on the big C- 5As and the C-17s, but it is a small percentage of what we need if we go to Iraq or any other part of the world with our military. The merchant marines have historically, from the very earliest days of this Nation, been one of the key strategic assets in the United States. A third strategic asset is the U.S. Navy and the shipyards that build the naval ships. Those shipyards are absolutely critical. If we didn't have them, would we go to China to have them build our aircraft carriers and our submarines? I don't think so. The shipyards are a strategic asset, absolutely essential for American defense. You have got these three things: the natural gas, a strategic asset; the merchant marines; and the shipbuilding. Here is a key to American jobs, and that is, if we are ever to export natural gas, it will be done in liquefied natural gas. You take the natural gas, you compress it into a liquid, and you put it on an LNG-- liquefied natural gas--ship. This is an example of one liquefied natural gas ship. Sometime this year, a company--Cheniere--located in Texas will begin exporting LNG from a facility in Texas. They will need about 100 ships to export the full capacity of that LNG export facility. My sense of this is let us use that export of a strategic national asset to build and to grow the other two strategics. We should require that any LNG shipped from the United States be shipped on American-made tankers with American crews, thereby lifting up the ability of our Nation to grow its economy and to maintain its strategic defense industries--shipbuilding and the merchant marines--at the same time we ship and export a strategic asset. What does it mean? It means that the shipyards in America in the next two decades would be busy. American workers would be in those shipyards, they would be making the ships, so it would be the shipbuilders. You can imagine what could happen in the ports around the United States--in Baltimore, in the south coast, along the gulf coast, and in California, San Diego, up in Washington, and even San Francisco--an opportunity to build our economy with, once again, infrastructure, a different kind of infrastructure, this is moving infrastructure, the great ships that will be all across the oceans of this Nation and in the harbors around the United States, American ships, American-built ships, American sailors, exporting American liquefied natural gas. Si se puede--yes, we can. We can make it in America. We can rebuild the American economy. We can focus on middle class economics with the infrastructure systems that we must build, the foundation for future economic growth, and the foundation for American jobs today. Make it in America, build America, build our ports, our water systems, our highways, our bridges, our airports, our sanitation systems. Let us have the American Society of Civil Engineers come back with an A-plus rating when they look at our airports, an A-plus rating when they look at our rail lines, our transit lines, when they look at our transit systems, when they look at our waste disposal systems. We don't want to be a backwater. This is America. We are the people that can build for the future. All it takes is the Senate and the House to pass a 6-year surface transportation bill and infrastructure bills that are fully funded, that provide the foundation for middle class jobs, middle class economics, putting Americans back to work, and building this Nation's future. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. ____________________","Congressional Record, Volume 161 Issue 31 (Tuesday, February 24, 2015) [Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 31 (Tuesday, February 24, 2015)] [House] [Pages H1103-H1108] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] MIDDLE CLASS ECONOMICS The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Zeldin). Under the Speaker's announced policy of January 6, 2015, the gentleman from California (Mr. Garamendi) is recognized for 60 minutes as the designee of the minority leader. Mr. GARAMENDI. Mr. Speaker, about a month and a half ago, we heard the President speak to us about the economy, about his goals for America. He labeled his speech ``middle class economics,'' and tonight, I want to pick this issue up once again. We are here most every week discussing this issue, although last time we were up here, we took up another important issue, Alzheimer's. But I want to come back to middle class economics, why it is important. Well, basically, it is important because it drives our economy. The great majority of Americans want to be in the middle class, and most of them are. Unfortunately, we have seen the decline of the middle class, their ability to own a home, a car, to provide for their family--but if the middle class is healthy, it will drive our economy, and it will create jobs, so the focus on the middle class becomes very, very important. We can do this by strengthening their wages. If they are able to earn more money, then they will buy the home, the car, and the economy will grow, and other people will be able to enjoy the fruits of our economy. I am going to focus on infrastructure in a moment, but I just want to skip that over and go down to the other things. Health care--who among us doesn't want to have a good health care program, so that if we get sick or injured, we will be able to get to a doctor, get to a hospital, get the care we need to get back on our feet, and to once again be productive or, in our old age, be able to enjoy our retirement? So the affordable health care becomes really important, and here, we [[Page H1104]] have the Affordable Health Care Act as part of that. Finally, we need to develop policies to grow the middle class, and one such policy is infrastructure, which is the focus of tonight's discussion. I want to just stay with this infrastructure issue for a few moments, and then I am going to invite my colleague from Minnesota, Rick Nolan, to join us here. Let me talk about this also. The other theme, in addition to the middle class economics, is the Make It In America theme that we have been talking about for 4 years now. Trade, taxes, energy, labor, education, research, and infrastructure, these are the elements that we fold into our Make It In America agenda. We talk about trade. There is going to be a lot of discussion about that here in Congress over the next several months as the Trans-Pacific Partnership comes up. Taxes, which we will pick up with the infrastructure issue in a few moments--energy is also part of the infrastructure issue. Anyway, Make It In America means bringing the jobs back home, employing Americans, doing the things that we need to do in this country, whether it is the health care sector; the infrastructure; building the roads, the bridges, and the like; or education. That is the Make It In America agenda, and it is part of the middle class economics. In fact, it is the key to it. Why is infrastructure important? Well, there are certain things like this, a collapsed bridge. This is on Interstate 5 in the State of Washington. This is a bridge near the Canadian border. About 3 years ago, it went into the river, collapsed--one of about 163,000 deficient bridges here in the United States. So, yep, we have got a problem. Are we going to be able to address this problem? Well, we had better. Actually, it is 156,000. I was a little bit overanxious there. The American Society of Civil Engineers, who build these things, have graded the American infrastructure, and I just want to go through it: aviation, our airports, which I believe the Vice President, in referring to LaGuardia, said even the developing countries have a better airport than LaGuardia in New York City, aviation, a D; bridges, C-plus--as I said, 156,000 deficient; dams, D; running water, D; energy, D-plus; hazardous waste, D; inland waterways, D; levees, to protect us from floods, D; our ports, a C; public parks and recreation, C; our railroads, C-plus--whoa, a C-plus; our highways, a D; our schools, that is where our kids are, a D; solid waste, we are doing pretty well, that is a B; our transit systems, D; wastewater, a D. Incidentally, in California, we are in the midst of a major drought, and it is perfectly clear that the wastewater systems are inadequate. If we were to also fund the recycling programs which could be connected to the wastewater, we could, in southern California, over the next half decade, create a million acre feet of new water as we recycle the water from the fifth biggest river on the west coast of the Western Hemisphere, the sanitation plants in southern California. {time} 1930 So we have got some work out ahead of us. Let me bring this home before I invite my colleague from the great State of Minnesota to join us on this issue. Earlier today, I was reading an article in The Sacramento Bee about the transportation systems in Sacramento. Let me just share some of these thoughts with you. In Sacramento, the average commuter spends 32 hours each year stuck in traffic. This amounts to $669 of lost productivity. That is literally wages that could have been earned if they weren't stuck in traffic. For all of the commuters in the Sacramento area, which I represent, that is $834 million of commuting time. For the truckers in the area that are trying to pass through Sacramento on Interstate 5, on Interstate 80 or Highway 50, it is $199 million of lost productivity. There is another alternative. Down in Riverside, a southern California city that I once represented when I was lieutenant governor, they want to build a 13-mile streetcar system in the city of Riverside. It would cost about $300 million. The economic analysis that was done on that indicates that if they were to do it, there would be a 4-to-1 return on investment. Now, you tell me which investment banker on Wall Street wouldn't want to have a 4-to-1 return on their investment. Well, the city of Riverside could have a 4-to-1 return on their investment of $300 million to build that 13-mile streetcar section. That is property values and economic development. This morning, The Wall Street Journal published an article in which the American Society of Civil Engineers was quoted that between 2012 and 2022, in America, because of the insufficient infrastructure--and remember, I just read you their GPA, mostly Ds--lost sales, $1 trillion of lost sales. For the United States, the delays will cost $3.1 trillion. And to bring it home to a single company--a big company but, nonetheless, just one company--United Parcel Service, UPS, all of those big brown trucks that are out there, $105 million in lost revenue. There is a solution. The President has put forward to us, the Members of Congress, a 6-year, $478 billion transportation plan that will be paid for--fully paid for with the current gasoline and diesel tax not increased, keep it the same--and going out to those American corporations that are stiffing the American taxpayer by hiding their profits overseas. The President says: Bring those profits home; pay your fair share of the taxes. So there is a fully paid-for proposal before us here in the House of Representatives for a $478 billion, 6- year transportation program. Now, I think our Speaker represents an area in Ohio near Kentucky, and I believe there is a bridge in that area called the Brent Spence Bridge. It crosses the Ohio River between Kentucky and Ohio. It was built for 80,000 cars a day, and now there are over 200,000 cars a day that pass over that bridge--or try to pass over that bridge--creating a monumental traffic jam and slowing down the entire economy in that region. By the way, don't ever walk or drive underneath the bridge because the concrete in the bridge is falling off. They have a nice little safety net over the road beneath it, so perhaps, therefore, you won't be hit by a falling piece of concrete. So the issue for us, the Representatives of the American public, is: Are we willing to put together a full transportation program so that these kinds of bridge collapses are pictures of yesterday, not the pictures of tomorrow's future? I would like to have the gentleman from Minnesota, Mr. Rick Nolan, join us now. If you would come on down and join us, perhaps here on the floor, and take one of the microphones. Mr. Nolan, you have a fascinating history here in the House of Representatives. You were here in the early seventies as a Representative and then decided to go back to Minnesota and build a business, a lumber manufacturing, a timber manufacturing business. It was very successful. Then you came back to straighten us out, bringing all of that history to us. Welcome, Mr. Nolan. Thank you so very much for joining us this evening as we talk about transportation and infrastructure in America. Mr. NOLAN. Well, thank you. The House historian tells me that my 32-year hiatus is the longest in the history of the House of Representatives. Mr. GARAMENDI. Well, you had an opportunity to learn about the private sector and learn about the necessity of transportation; and I think your business was dependent on that, both to get the materials to your lumber mill and then to export. Mr. NOLAN. Very much so. I also built an export trading company and did a little business all over the globe. People asked me what I sold. I like to tell them I sold, well, just about everything except guns and drugs, which is where all the real money was. It was really quite an eye-opening experience to see how the rest of the world does business, to get a better feel and understanding for the importance of agriculture and a better feel and understanding of agriculture as it relates to feeding a hungry world, but infrastructure and its importance to building the middle class here in the country, to laying the foundation for job growth and economic growth. And to come back here again after those years in business and in community service, I have got to be frank with you; I feel [[Page H1105]] much better prepared today than I ever was to serve my district and to serve my Nation, and I am grateful to have the opportunity to be here. I want to particularly thank you for calling this to the attention of the American public, the importance of infrastructure, the importance of infrastructure to the middle class in this country, and the importance that it brings to the fulfillment of the American Dream. The American Dream is not everybody becoming a billionaire or a Pulitzer Prize winner. It is about contributing. It is about having a good job. It is about having a living wage. It is about having some money left over at the end of the week to take your family or your best friend and go out and have dinner or maybe wet a line and go fishing. And, quite frankly, that is what is getting away from us. I want to thank you for bringing to the attention of people how transportation and infrastructure and its degradation that is taking place is related to, quite frankly, the demise and the decline of the middle class in this country. The simple truth is the rich are getting richer, the poor are getting poorer, the middle class is getting crushed, and, simultaneously, our infrastructure is falling apart. The gentleman from California (Mr. Garamendi), you, too, have a background in business and public service and community service that gives you a good grasp and an understanding for the importance of all this. Mr. GARAMENDI. Well, there is no doubt about the importance of it. If you want to build good middle class jobs, a lot of those jobs are in the infrastructure. It may be a hardhat job out there putting up the steel and the concrete, the ironworkers or the cement masons or the operators of the heavy equipment. All of those are really good middle class jobs, no doubt about it, wherever they happen to be across the Nation. But also, in the back office, somebody has to do the accounting; somebody has to do the design work--the architects, the draftsmen and -women that are involved. So these jobs permeate the entire economy. And it is absolutely true that if we can fund--that is, pass--a 6-year, robust transportation bill that is fully paid for, Americans would go to work in middle class jobs. That is the first effect: people will have jobs. And in building the infrastructure, you then lay the foundation for future economic growth. You have seen this in your area. I was thinking about your call for the family to be able to enjoy the fruits of life. And I am thinking about you have got some heavy-duty hunting country up in your area. You are out in the backwoods of Minnesota, if I recall. Mr. NOLAN. I am. My nearest neighbor is a couple of miles away. Mr. GARAMENDI. And in between are bear, deer, and fish. Mr. NOLAN. We have bear. We have duck. We have grouse. We have good hunting and darn good fishing, too. You mentioned the fact that I had served many years ago, quite frankly, back in the seventies. I like to tell people I was only 10 years old at the time. When I first got back here, I said to a number of people: Perhaps you knew my father when he had served here back in the seventies. And there were always a couple of old-timers in the back that would laugh. And everyone would say: Well, what is so funny about that? And they would say: Well, it wasn't his father; it was him. But I have got to tell you, it was quite different. It was quite different than it is today. I had my staff do a little survey. We found that in the terms I served before, there was an average of about 8,000 subcommittee, full committee, and conference committee meetings here in the Congress. What that meant was that we got together 5 days a week in our committees. And all the diverse elements that make up America were all represented in those meetings, and that is how we found common ground; that is how we came together; that is how we fixed things; that is how we got things done. And people have to be reminded, I think, that process is important to good government. Because now we are faced with this gridlock; we are faced with this terrible partisanship, the seeming inability to be productive and to get things done. I think experts that study governance here in America are saying now that this immediate last Congress was the most unproductive in the history of the country. Well, guess what. When we had 8,000 committee meetings in the past, yes, maybe around 1,000 of them were just formal hearings or, you know, you have got to give Jack Nicklaus a gold medal and do a reauthorization of Peanut Butter and Jelly Week. Well, guess what. This last session of Congress, we had about 1,000 of those meetings, and most of them were quite informal. As you recall, Mr. Garamendi, when we started the hearings about a year ago in the Transportation Committee because we knew that the transportation legislation needed to be reauthorized, we had everybody come in before that committee; and, boy, we were laying the foundation for a good reauthorization of a transportation and infrastructure bill. You were there every day. By the way, I want to commend you for the leadership that you have shown on that committee in so many areas, in so many ways. But we had everybody, as you recall, from the head of the national Chamber of Commerce to the heads of all the labor unions, the truckers, retail. Everybody came before that committee. I don't know if you recall. But I asked every one of them, I said: I have three questions. And I remember the committee groaning, saying: Gee, Nolan, you have only got 5 minutes. How are you going to do that? I said: Question number one, is there anyone here on this committee who disagrees with the notion that our infrastructure is badly in need of repair and is falling down and dilapidated? Nobody disagreed. Second question, is there anybody here--of all that group that was testifying--that disagrees with the notion that our ability to grow an economy and create good jobs is dependent upon a good, strong infrastructure? Nobody disagreed, as you would recall. And then lastly, I said: Is there anybody on this committee who doubts that we need to find some new revenue to rebuild our infrastructure? And nobody disagreed. And I said: Make a note of it, Mr. Chairman, because we have got to write a bill here. And that is what we were there for. You know as well as everybody else that the authorization for the Transportation Committee to write a bill was pulled away from the committee. Presumably, in the Speaker's office or someplace else, it was decided that we should do a temporary reauthorization for 8 months; and, as you recall, we borrowed money from people's private pension funds. {time} 1945 We are getting near that 8-month deadline again. Mr. GARAMENDI. I think it is May 15. Mr. NOLAN. May 15. So now working people's pension funds are short a little money potentially, and we still haven't fixed the transportation problem. So one of the things I want to do here tonight, and I know you do as well, is to call upon the Speaker to let the committee do its work. We have got a good committee. You know it as well as I do and everybody else. There is a lot of goodwill in this Chamber among Democrats, Republicans, conservatives, and liberals, and if we are allowed to sit down in that committee and advance our ideas and argue the merits of them, we will find that common ground. We will find a way to get this country back on track with rebuilding our infrastructure. That is what democracy is all about. Someone said to me the other day here, and it almost broke my heart, when I was explaining this and they said: Well, isn't it more efficient here by not using the committees? I said: Yeah, of course, it is. The Nazis and the Communists would love it. Democracy is a lot of hard work. There is so much goodwill in this Chamber, and there are so many good men and women. We get along fine. Mr. Speaker, let the process work. Let the committee do its job, and we will get a good transportation bill, and we will rebuild this middle class and rebuild our economy in a way that is fair to everyone. Mr. GARAMENDI. Well, there is no doubt that if we were to pass--well, we [[Page H1106]] don't have a choice. If we don't pass a bill in the next 2 months, 2\1/ 2\ months, all public works, transportation programs, will come to a screeching halt. There will be no more Federal money, and it will simply stop. So we have got work to do. As you say, if the committee could have its way, we could put together a good bill. There has been a long history here of the transportation bill being a bipartisan bill. We can do that. If we don't--let me just go back through this. I get stacks and stacks of paper, and this one caught my eye. It is entitled, ``Infrastructure Investment Creates American Jobs.'' I said: Well, that is kind of a pretty good cover there. It has roads, bridges, ports, and so forth. It is the Duke Center on Globalization, Governance & Competitiveness. So it is the Duke University. Here they say: Old and broken transportation infrastructure makes the United States less competitive than 15 of our major trading partners and makes manufacturers less efficient in getting goods to market. Underinvestment costs the United States over 900,000 jobs, including more than 97,000 American manufacturing jobs. Maximizing American-made materials when rebuilding infrastructure has the potential to create even more jobs. Relying on American-made inputs can also mitigate safety concerns related to large-scale outsourcing. I am with you, Duke--Duke University. I am from the west coast, and I have problems with some of these east coast athletic teams, but, hey, I am with them on this one. Infrastructure creates American jobs. This is something that I have used over and over again. This is from Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's Analytics. He is the former economics adviser for Senator John McCain when the Senator ran for the United States Presidency. He put it this way: For every dollar invested in infrastructure investment, $1.57 is pumped back into the American economy with well paying, middle class American jobs. This is just really critically important. The question for us, and the reason we are here on the floor and the reason we are talking about this issue of middle class economics and now transportation, is that we are up against another timeline here. We have got the transportation cliff, we have got a bridge that is collapsed, and the question is: Will this Congress provide a transportation bill that can bridge this collapsed bridge and rebuild it? I think we can. I know we must. My fear--my fear--Mr. Nolan, is that we have become really, really good at something we used to play when I was a kid, and it is called kick the can. We have become really good at kicking the can down the road rather than just coming to grips with the reality that we have to have a long-term transportation bill. There are many reasons for it. These are long-term projects, and over the last I guess almost 7 years now we have not had a long-term bill. The longest one has been a 2-year bill that passed 2 years ago, and that doesn't give the planners enough time to plan these long-term projects or the assurance that the money, the Federal money, will be there; $478 billion, 6 years, fully paid for, doesn't increase the gasoline or diesel tax but requires American corporations that have run away from their obligation to this Nation by hiding their profits overseas to bring those profits back and tax them accordingly. That is the President's plan. It is all there for us. Can we do it? I don't think we have any choice. I think we have to do it, Mr. Nolan. I don't know how you feel about it from Minnesota, but I know in California that we are in the midst of a major drought, and this is going to be the fourth year of a major drought in California, and it has been at least 30 years since there have been any major water infrastructure investments in California. Our economy in California is paying dearly for it. About one-third of the rice fields in my district are fallow. If you go further south into the San Joaquin Valley it is probably about the same percentage. Cantaloupes, cotton, and other kinds of row crops, tomatoes, are not being planted. We have to have in California investments in our water infrastructure. One of the things that my Republican colleague--and Mr. Nolan, you spoke about bipartisanship--my Republican colleague from my area, Mr. LaMalfa, he and I are going to introduce tomorrow a piece of legislation to build a very large, offstream reservoir called Sites Reservoir. It is about 1.8, 1.9 million acre-feet of water. If that had been built a decade ago, the drought would still be very difficult. There would be a lot of trouble and a lot of lost opportunity. But at least we would have a very significant amount of water available stored in that reservoir to help us along. So we are going to do that. That is a major infrastructure program, and we will see if we can participate here at the Federal level with the participation that the State of California voters have already approved, a $7.6 billion bond act in which there is money for storage, both aquifer, underground, as well as surface storage, probably including the Sites Reservoir. So there are things we can do. And this is a piece of legislation, we will present it to the Congress and the Senate and hopefully it will move along. Mr. Nolan, I am sure that you have projects up in your area that are important, and perhaps you would like to pick up here. Mr. NOLAN. I sure do, Mr. Garamendi. I think the fact that our bridges are falling down could not be more evidenced than in Minnesota, where we had the catastrophic collapse of the I-35 bridge, which killed a number of people and did obviously irreparable damage to their lives and many others. Mr. GARAMENDI. This was the bridge across the Mississippi in Minneapolis? Mr. NOLAN. Yes. Very tragic. I have got several thousand bridges in my district alone, and several hundred of them have been certified as obsolete and in disrepair, in need of repair, and, of course, there are thousands and thousands of those bridges across the country. I held three transportation hearings back in Minnesota here recently, and the unanimity of agreement on what needs to be done is really quite unique. I mean, generally, if you get 50 people in a room in Minnesota you will have at least 40, 45 opinions. Mr. GARAMENDI. Well, in California, you would have 150 opinions if you had 50 people. Mr. NOLAN. Well, everybody agreed, as you pointed out, we need a long-term plan so that you can plan accordingly, and then do it responsibly in the most efficient and economical way. Everyone came up and said that we need it for our economic growth and our business, and they understand that, as you were pointing out earlier, good infrastructure is the foundation, it is the foundation for every single successful economy in this world. I have said to people on occasion: If you don't want to pay any taxes, you can move to Zaire. I think they have about 2 miles of roads and no taxes, but you had better bring a little army with you to protect you. So the other thing, of course--it has become real apparent--is the congestion. You must see that. We are seeing it in Minnesota. People are spending endless hours sitting in their cars trying to get to and from work, time that they could have used to sleep in an extra hour, get home in time for dinner with their family. Mr. GARAMENDI. Work with the kids on their homework. Mr. NOLAN. Of course, you mentioned the collapse of the bridge. The other thing they want to see is some bipartisanship. I would like to remind our colleagues, as well as the folks back home, because you and I were there, and we were part of a couple of the few instances where, in the last session of Congress, the process was allowed to work. It was cumbersome, and it was contentious, but at the end of the day, we came together, and we passed a good, bipartisan farm bill. You and I were part of that. Mr. GARAMENDI. You were on the committee. Mr. NOLAN. As well as our colleagues here on both sides of the aisle, and then we were allowed on the water resources bill, and we were able to put together a good bill. Not everybody got everything they wanted, but everybody was a part of it. They had a chance to advance their ideas. We had open rules. If you want to have an amendment or a good idea, you got a chance to advance it and get a vote on it. People want to see more of that as well. Then there is one thing that doesn't get mentioned very often, and I don't [[Page H1107]] mind bringing it up, and a number of my folks back home brought it up. And that is--you mentioned the cost of not doing anything. Well, that would be devastating for America. It would be just devastating for our economy. I pray to God that would never happen. But our hope is, of course, it will be done in a responsible way that solves the problems and fixes these things. But there is a little factor. I have about a 5- mile dirt road to my farm, and I went through two front ends on my new pickup truck until it became part of a local effort to pave the roads. My road got paved. That was 10 years ago. I am still driving the same pickup truck, and I haven't lost any front ends. You know the old saying, you pay me now or you pay me later. Boy, I tell you, these potholes and these washboard roads and bridges falling down, there is a heavy price to be paid for not fixing, maintaining, and upkeeping our roads and our bridges. Mr. GARAMENDI. There is no doubt about it--you can ruin your car real fast. That 5-mile road was a county road, I assume, it was not your personal road? Mr. NOLAN. No, no. It was not my personal road. No, no, no. It was a combination county and township. But it helped to have been on the township planning committee. Mr. GARAMENDI. Whatever it took, you got it done. A couple of things that I think are also important as we go about this infrastructure, and that is: Who is going to provide the material? I want to give you an example of why it is important that we honor the Buy America laws that exist today. We have had Buy America requirements in laws for almost 50 years now, and those requirements simply say that if it is our taxpayer money or your taxpayer money, then it should be used to buy American-made products and materials. Now, out in California, we have the San Francisco Bay Bridge. This is about a--what do we have here--$3.9 billion project. Excuse me--it is not $3.9 billion; it is about $6 billion. It is $3.9 billion over budget. This project replaces the old San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge connecting the two cities across the bay that collapsed during the 1989 earthquake. The bridge went out to bid, and the contractor said: I can use Chinese steel, and it will be 10 percent cheaper if we use Chinese rather than American-made steel. So the State waived the Buy America requirements. They didn't use them. They went out and bought Chinese steel. Well, they got 3,000 jobs in China and overbudget and poor material. In fact, today it is reported in the California newspapers that one of the major bolts, which is a 25-foot bolt, and I don't know, it must be several inches across, that holds down the main pier to the bridge is cracking. So we have a problem here. {time} 2000 Now, New York is undertaking a bridge across the Hudson River. It is called the Tappan Zee Bridge, and it is made with American steel. American steel is being used. The total cost is $3.9 billion--notice, that is the cost of the overrun in California. There are 7,728 American jobs, and it is 100 percent made in America. When we go about this infrastructure, I want to make very, very sure that we maintain the Buy America requirements. We can do it. I am going to put up one more placard here. This is one of my favorites. This is a brand-new 100 percent American-made electric locomotive for the Washington, D.C., to Boston Northeast corridor. About 70 to 80 of these will be made. In the American Recovery Act--you remember the stimulus bill-- somebody wrote in $700 million for Amtrak to buy new locomotives, and they said: 100 percent American-made. General Electric looked at it, other companies looked at it, and a German company looked at this $700 million or so and 70 to 80 locomotives, 100 percent American-made, and they go: We can do that. So Siemens, a major international German company, had a manufacturing plant in Sacramento, and they set about to make 100 percent American- made locomotives. They built double the size of their factory, hired several hundred new workers, and they went out across the United States to find all the parts. They are now building 100 percent American-made locomotives, a major infrastructure project, great for American jobs, great for the future. This is one of the first ones that came off the lot. Now, my final point and then I want to turn this back to my colleague from Minnesota. Today, on the east coast, Amtrak is going out to bid for 28 new high-speed train sets to travel between Washington, D.C., and Boston at maybe half again as fast as the current trains, so you can zip between the two cities--Washington, D.C., and New York--in, I don't know, 2 hours or less. They want--Amtrak--wants a waiver from the Buy America provisions, and I am saying: No way, period. This is American taxpayer money that is going to be used. You are going to buy America, we are going to make those train sets in America, and we can do it. Yes, we can--si se puede. We can do it. We can build these things in America and create good middle class jobs in America, just like Siemens is doing in Sacramento when they are making 100 percent American-made locomotives in Sacramento. This is an opportunity for us as we build our infrastructure, as we put together the surface transportation plan, as we take the Water Resources Reform and Development Act. Keep in mind and always keep in place the Buy America provisions, so that your tax money is used on American-made equipment and employing Americans making those things. I am sure this is important up in your area, as well as it is in Sacramento, California, on the edge of my district, Mr. Nolan. I know it is important to me, and I think it is important to Americans, that we use our tax money to buy American-made products that are employing Americans. Mr. NOLAN. Well, indeed, it is. I represent Minnesota's Iron Range, the largest iron mines anywhere in the United States. We are dependent upon a good, strong market for U.S. steel and for Minnesota-made taconite and processed iron ore. I was so delighted to join you and others recently in petitioning the U.S. Department of Commerce and the International Trade Commission to curtail the importation of cheap Korean steel. The market for steel in America is very, very good. The problem is that American steel is only providing about 70 to 75 percent of it. Close to over 30 percent of it is being foreign steel that is brought in. Foreign steel that, by the way, is subsidized by the foreign governments. Our steelworkers, iron mineworkers, can compete with anybody in the world, anybody in America, quite frankly, we can compete with anybody, but it has got to be fair trade. If they have government-subsidized, below market cheap steel coming in here, that is unfair trade. Guess what, there is about a dozen steel mills left here in America, and there is about 50,000 workers here. If we don't find a way to curtail the importation of this cheap, subsidized steel, we are going to put all 12 of those steel companies out of business, we are going to put 50,000 steelworkers out of business and countless thousands of mining processors and workers in this country. If we are talking about the middle class, we better start insisting on fair trade in this country, insisting--as you have so eloquently pointed out here--the significance and the importance of making it in America with U.S. steel when we are talking roads, bridges, railroads, pipelines, and all the rest. Mr. GARAMENDI. Well, here it is, the San Francisco Bay Bridge built with Chinese steel. They built a brand-new, one of the most advanced steel mills, making one of the most advanced types of steel in China-- 3,000 Chinese jobs, zero American. Then the Tappan Zee Bridge in New York, American steel--probably some of that iron ore from your district goes into making that steel. Mr. NOLAN. Oh, it did, no doubt. Mr. GARAMENDI. No doubt about it. Mr. NOLAN. And do you know what, John, I found in international trade, when it comes to quality, American steel is considered to be the best quality. [[Page H1108]] Now, what is the importance of that? Well, it might be the difference between a bridge falling down or standing; it might mean the difference between a pipeline breaking and polluting a wetland versus not doing that. There is an economic reason here, there is a reason for the middle class, there is a reason for our economy, there is a reason for safety, there is a reason for health, there is a reason for environment, there are so many good reasons to make it in America, John. Mr. GARAMENDI. You were just singing my song there. This Bay Bridge, why was it $3.9 billion over? Because the steel was unsatisfactory. It was low quality, it had cracks in it, it didn't meet the requirements, they had to go back and redo the welds--many, many issues. You are absolutely correct about quality, as well as about the jobs in America. We are going to make it in America. We have an opportunity here. Can I take up one more issue? Mr. NOLAN. Well, I am going to depart, but I really want to thank you for this session here and bringing it to the attention of our colleagues and people all across this country that care about America, care about good-paying middle class jobs, and want to see us do what we have got to do here to come together, fix this thing, and continue the great progress that America has enjoyed. A big part of being an American is paying it forward, and now, it is time for us to step up and do what we have to do for the next generation. Mr. GARAMENDI. Mr. Nolan, I thank you so very much. The folks in the northern Minnesota area are blessed to have you return after a 32-year hiatus. You came back with a fire in your belly, and you are ready to go. Mr. NOLAN. Well, I am honored and thrilled and glad to be here. Mr. GARAMENDI. Thank you so very much for joining us this evening. I want to bring up just one more issue, and then we will call it a night. America is blessed with a lot of energy. We have seen a resurgence of American energy here in the United States. We have seen us go from an importing Nation--we can be an exporting Nation. One of the things that the American gas industry wants to do is to export a strategic national asset, that is our natural gas. It has allowed us to have one of the lower energy prices in the world. That has allowed for a resurgence of manufacturing in the United States. There are other factors. Clearly, the ability to have low- priced natural gas is one of the ingredients in the resurgence of American manufacturing. Now, the gas industry wants to import a lot of gas so they can get two or three times more for the gas overseas. I want to be really careful here, I don't want to drive up the price of natural gas, but if we are going to export this strategic national asset, then we ought to consider two other strategic issues for the United States. One of them is the merchant marines. These are the American sailors and American ships. Our military is absolutely dependent on the merchant marines. We ship a lot of things through the air on the big C- 5As and the C-17s, but it is a small percentage of what we need if we go to Iraq or any other part of the world with our military. The merchant marines have historically, from the very earliest days of this Nation, been one of the key strategic assets in the United States. A third strategic asset is the U.S. Navy and the shipyards that build the naval ships. Those shipyards are absolutely critical. If we didn't have them, would we go to China to have them build our aircraft carriers and our submarines? I don't think so. The shipyards are a strategic asset, absolutely essential for American defense. You have got these three things: the natural gas, a strategic asset; the merchant marines; and the shipbuilding. Here is a key to American jobs, and that is, if we are ever to export natural gas, it will be done in liquefied natural gas. You take the natural gas, you compress it into a liquid, and you put it on an LNG-- liquefied natural gas--ship. This is an example of one liquefied natural gas ship. Sometime this year, a company--Cheniere--located in Texas will begin exporting LNG from a facility in Texas. They will need about 100 ships to export the full capacity of that LNG export facility. My sense of this is let us use that export of a strategic national asset to build and to grow the other two strategics. We should require that any LNG shipped from the United States be shipped on American-made tankers with American crews, thereby lifting up the ability of our Nation to grow its economy and to maintain its strategic defense industries--shipbuilding and the merchant marines--at the same time we ship and export a strategic asset. What does it mean? It means that the shipyards in America in the next two decades would be busy. American workers would be in those shipyards, they would be making the ships, so it would be the shipbuilders. You can imagine what could happen in the ports around the United States--in Baltimore, in the south coast, along the gulf coast, and in California, San Diego, up in Washington, and even San Francisco--an opportunity to build our economy with, once again, infrastructure, a different kind of infrastructure, this is moving infrastructure, the great ships that will be all across the oceans of this Nation and in the harbors around the United States, American ships, American-built ships, American sailors, exporting American liquefied natural gas. Si se puede--yes, we can. We can make it in America. We can rebuild the American economy. We can focus on middle class economics with the infrastructure systems that we must build, the foundation for future economic growth, and the foundation for American jobs today. Make it in America, build America, build our ports, our water systems, our highways, our bridges, our airports, our sanitation systems. Let us have the American Society of Civil Engineers come back with an A-plus rating when they look at our airports, an A-plus rating when they look at our rail lines, our transit lines, when they look at our transit systems, when they look at our waste disposal systems. We don't want to be a backwater. This is America. We are the people that can build for the future. All it takes is the Senate and the House to pass a 6-year surface transportation bill and infrastructure bills that are fully funded, that provide the foundation for middle class jobs, middle class economics, putting Americans back to work, and building this Nation's future. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. ____________________",package_114_116.csv,41711,41711,41782,"[congressional record volume 161, number 31 (tuesday, february 24, 2015)] [house] [pages h1103-h1108] from the congressional record online through the government publishing office [ www.gpo.gov ] middle class economics the speaker pro tempore (mr. zeldin). under the speaker's announced policy of january 6, 2015, the gentleman from california (mr. garamendi) is recognized for 60 minutes as the designee of the minority leader. mr. garamendi. mr. speaker, about a month and a half ago, we heard the president speak to us about the economy, about his goals for america. he labeled his speech ``middle class economics,'' and tonight, i want to pick this issue up once again. we are here most every week discussing this issue, although last time we were up here, we took up another important issue, alzheimer's. but i want to come back to middle class economics, why it is important. well, basically, it is important because it drives our economy. the great majority of americans want to be in the middle class, and most of them are. unfortunately, we have seen the decline of the middle class, their ability to own a home, a car, to provide for their family--but if the middle class is healthy, it will drive our economy, and it will create jobs, so the focus on the middle class becomes very, very important. we can do this by strengthening their wages. if they are able to earn more money, then they will buy the home, the car, and the economy will grow, and other people will be able to enjoy the fruits of our economy. i am going to focus on infrastructure in a moment, but i just want to skip that over and go down to the other things. health care--who among us doesn't want to have a good health care program, so that if we get sick or injured, we will be able to get to a doctor, get to a hospital, get the care we need to get back on our feet, and to once again be productive or, in our old age, be able to enjoy our retirement? so the affordable health care becomes really important, and here, we [[page h1104]] have the affordable health care act as part of that. finally, we need to develop policies to grow the middle class, and one such policy is infrastructure, which is the focus of tonight's discussion. i want to just stay with this infrastructure issue for a few moments, and then i am going to invite my colleague from minnesota, rick nolan, to join us here. let me talk about this also. the other theme, in addition to the middle class economics, is the make it in america theme that we have been talking about for 4 years now. trade, taxes, energy, labor, education, research, and infrastructure, these are the elements that we fold into our make it in america agenda. we talk about trade. there is going to be a lot of discussion about that here in congress over the next several months as the trans-pacific partnership comes up. taxes, which we will pick up with the infrastructure issue in a few moments--energy is also part of the infrastructure issue. anyway, make it in america means bringing the jobs back home, employing americans, doing the things that we need to do in this country, whether it is the health care sector; the infrastructure; building the roads, the bridges, and the like; or education. that is the make it in america agenda, and it is part of the middle class economics. in fact, it is the key to it. why is infrastructure important? well, there are certain things like this, a collapsed bridge. this is on interstate 5 in the state of washington. this is a bridge near the canadian border. about 3 years ago, it went into the river, collapsed--one of about 163,000 deficient bridges here in the united states. so, yep, we have got a problem. are we going to be able to address this problem? well, we had better. actually, it is 156,000. i was a little bit overanxious there. the american society of civil engineers, who build these things, have graded the american infrastructure, and i just want to go through it: aviation, our airports, which i believe the vice president, in referring to laguardia, said even the developing countries have a better airport than laguardia in new york city, aviation, a d; bridges, c-plus--as i said, 156,000 deficient; dams, d; running water, d; energy, d-plus; hazardous waste, d; inland waterways, d; levees, to protect us from floods, d; our ports, a c; public parks and recreation, c; our railroads, c-plus--whoa, a c-plus; our highways, a d; our schools, that is where our kids are, a d; solid waste, we are doing pretty well, that is a b; our transit systems, d; wastewater, a d. incidentally, in california, we are in the midst of a major drought, and it is perfectly clear that the wastewater systems are inadequate. if we were to also fund the recycling programs which could be connected to the wastewater, we could, in southern california, over the next half decade, create a million acre feet of new water as we recycle the water from the fifth biggest river on the west coast of the western hemisphere, the sanitation plants in southern california. {time} 1930 so we have got some work out ahead of us. let me bring this home before i invite my colleague from the great state of minnesota to join us on this issue. earlier today, i was reading an article in the sacramento bee about the transportation systems in sacramento. let me just share some of these thoughts with you. in sacramento, the average commuter spends 32 hours each year stuck in traffic. this amounts to $669 of lost productivity. that is literally wages that could have been earned if they weren't stuck in traffic. for all of the commuters in the sacramento area, which i represent, that is $834 million of commuting time. for the truckers in the area that are trying to pass through sacramento on interstate 5, on interstate 80 or highway 50, it is $199 million of lost productivity. there is another alternative. down in riverside, a southern california city that i once represented when i was lieutenant governor, they want to build a 13-mile streetcar system in the city of riverside. it would cost about $300 million. the economic analysis that was done on that indicates that if they were to do it, there would be a 4-to-1 return on investment. now, you tell me which investment banker on wall street wouldn't want to have a 4-to-1 return on their investment. well, the city of riverside could have a 4-to-1 return on their investment of $300 million to build that 13-mile streetcar section. that is property values and economic development. this morning, the wall street journal published an article in which the american society of civil engineers was quoted that between 2012 and 2022, in america, because of the insufficient infrastructure--and remember, i just read you their gpa, mostly ds--lost sales, $1 trillion of lost sales. for the united states, the delays will cost $3.1 trillion. and to bring it home to a single company--a big company but, nonetheless, just one company--united parcel service, ups, all of those big brown trucks that are out there, $105 million in lost revenue. there is a solution. the president has put forward to us, the members of congress, a 6-year, $478 billion transportation plan that will be paid for--fully paid for with the current gasoline and diesel tax not increased, keep it the same--and going out to those american corporations that are stiffing the american taxpayer by hiding their profits overseas. the president says: bring those profits home; pay your fair share of the taxes. so there is a fully paid-for proposal before us here in the house of representatives for a $478 billion, 6- year transportation program. now, i think our speaker represents an area in ohio near kentucky, and i believe there is a bridge in that area called the brent spence bridge. it crosses the ohio river between kentucky and ohio. it was built for 80,000 cars a day, and now there are over 200,000 cars a day that pass over that bridge--or try to pass over that bridge--creating a monumental traffic jam and slowing down the entire economy in that region. by the way, don't ever walk or drive underneath the bridge because the concrete in the bridge is falling off. they have a nice little safety net over the road beneath it, so perhaps, therefore, you won't be hit by a falling piece of concrete. so the issue for us, the representatives of the american public, is: are we willing to put together a full transportation program so that these kinds of bridge collapses are pictures of yesterday, not the pictures of tomorrow's future? i would like to have the gentleman from minnesota, mr. rick nolan, join us now. if you would come on down and join us, perhaps here on the floor, and take one of the microphones. mr. nolan, you have a fascinating history here in the house of representatives. you were here in the early seventies as a representative and then decided to go back to minnesota and build a business, a lumber manufacturing, a timber manufacturing business. it was very successful. then you came back to straighten us out, bringing all of that history to us. welcome, mr. nolan. thank you so very much for joining us this evening as we talk about transportation and infrastructure in america. mr. nolan. well, thank you. the house historian tells me that my 32-year hiatus is the longest in the history of the house of representatives. mr. garamendi. well, you had an opportunity to learn about the private sector and learn about the necessity of transportation; and i think your business was dependent on that, both to get the materials to your lumber mill and then to export. mr. nolan. very much so. i also built an export trading company and did a little business all over the globe. people asked me what i sold. i like to tell them i sold, well, just about everything except guns and drugs, which is where all the real money was. it was really quite an eye-opening experience to see how the rest of the world does business, to get a better feel and understanding for the importance of agriculture and a better feel and understanding of agriculture as it relates to feeding a hungry world, but infrastructure and its importance to building the middle class here in the country, to laying the foundation for job growth and economic growth. and to come back here again after those years in business and in community service, i have got to be frank with you; i feel [[page h1105]] much better prepared today than i ever was to serve my district and to serve my nation, and i am grateful to have the opportunity to be here. i want to particularly thank you for calling this to the attention of the american public, the importance of infrastructure, the importance of infrastructure to the middle class in this country, and the importance that it brings to the fulfillment of the american dream. the american dream is not everybody becoming a billionaire or a pulitzer prize winner. it is about contributing. it is about having a good job. it is about having a living wage. it is about having some money left over at the end of the week to take your family or your best friend and go out and have dinner or maybe wet a line and go fishing. and, quite frankly, that is what is getting away from us. i want to thank you for bringing to the attention of people how transportation and infrastructure and its degradation that is taking place is related to, quite frankly, the demise and the decline of the middle class in this country. the simple truth is the rich are getting richer, the poor are getting poorer, the middle class is getting crushed, and, simultaneously, our infrastructure is falling apart. the gentleman from california (mr. garamendi), you, too, have a background in business and public service and community service that gives you a good grasp and an understanding for the importance of all this. mr. garamendi. well, there is no doubt about the importance of it. if you want to build good middle class jobs, a lot of those jobs are in the infrastructure. it may be a hardhat job out there putting up the steel and the concrete, the ironworkers or the cement masons or the operators of the heavy equipment. all of those are really good middle class jobs, no doubt about it, wherever they happen to be across the nation. but also, in the back office, somebody has to do the accounting; somebody has to do the design work--the architects, the draftsmen and -women that are involved. so these jobs permeate the entire economy. and it is absolutely true that if we can fund--that is, pass--a 6-year, robust transportation bill that is fully paid for, americans would go to work in middle class jobs. that is the first effect: people will have jobs. and in building the infrastructure, you then lay the foundation for future economic growth. you have seen this in your area. i was thinking about your call for the family to be able to enjoy the fruits of life. and i am thinking about you have got some heavy-duty hunting country up in your area. you are out in the backwoods of minnesota, if i recall. mr. nolan. i am. my nearest neighbor is a couple of miles away. mr. garamendi. and in between are bear, deer, and fish. mr. nolan. we have bear. we have duck. we have grouse. we have good hunting and darn good fishing, too. you mentioned the fact that i had served many years ago, quite frankly, back in the seventies. i like to tell people i was only 10 years old at the time. when i first got back here, i said to a number of people: perhaps you knew my father when he had served here back in the seventies. and there were always a couple of old-timers in the back that would laugh. and everyone would say: well, what is so funny about that? and they would say: well, it wasn't his father; it was him. but i have got to tell you, it was quite different. it was quite different than it is today. i had my staff do a little survey. we found that in the terms i served before, there was an average of about 8,000 subcommittee, full committee, and conference committee meetings here in the congress. what that meant was that we got together 5 days a week in our committees. and all the diverse elements that make up america were all represented in those meetings, and that is how we found common ground; that is how we came together; that is how we fixed things; that is how we got things done. and people have to be reminded, i think, that process is important to good government. because now we are faced with this gridlock; we are faced with this terrible partisanship, the seeming inability to be productive and to get things done. i think experts that study governance here in america are saying now that this immediate last congress was the most unproductive in the history of the country. well, guess what. when we had 8,000 committee meetings in the past, yes, maybe around 1,000 of them were just formal hearings or, you know, you have got to give jack nicklaus a gold medal and do a reauthorization of peanut butter and jelly week. well, guess what. this last session of congress, we had about 1,000 of those meetings, and most of them were quite informal. as you recall, mr. garamendi, when we started the hearings about a year ago in the transportation committee because we knew that the transportation legislation needed to be reauthorized, we had everybody come in before that committee; and, boy, we were laying the foundation for a good reauthorization of a transportation and infrastructure bill. you were there every day. by the way, i want to commend you for the leadership that you have shown on that committee in so many areas, in so many ways. but we had everybody, as you recall, from the head of the national chamber of commerce to the heads of all the labor unions, the truckers, retail. everybody came before that committee. i don't know if you recall. but i asked every one of them, i said: i have three questions. and i remember the committee groaning, saying: gee, nolan, you have only got 5 minutes. how are you going to do that? i said: question number one, is there anyone here on this committee who disagrees with the notion that our infrastructure is badly in need of repair and is falling down and dilapidated? nobody disagreed. second question, is there anybody here--of all that group that was testifying--that disagrees with the notion that our ability to grow an economy and create good jobs is dependent upon a good, strong infrastructure? nobody disagreed, as you would recall. and then lastly, i said: is there anybody on this committee who doubts that we need to find some new revenue to rebuild our infrastructure? and nobody disagreed. and i said: make a note of it, mr. chairman, because we have got to write a bill here. and that is what we were there for. you know as well as everybody else that the authorization for the transportation committee to write a bill was pulled away from the committee. presumably, in the speaker's office or someplace else, it was decided that we should do a temporary reauthorization for 8 months; and, as you recall, we borrowed money from people's private pension funds. {time} 1945 we are getting near that 8-month deadline again. mr. garamendi. i think it is may 15. mr. nolan. may 15. so now working people's pension funds are short a little money potentially, and we still haven't fixed the transportation problem. so one of the things i want to do here tonight, and i know you do as well, is to call upon the speaker to let the committee do its work. we have got a good committee. you know it as well as i do and everybody else. there is a lot of goodwill in this chamber among democrats, republicans, conservatives, and liberals, and if we are allowed to sit down in that committee and advance our ideas and argue the merits of them, we will find that common ground. we will find a way to get this country back on track with rebuilding our infrastructure. that is what democracy is all about. someone said to me the other day here, and it almost broke my heart, when i was explaining this and they said: well, isn't it more efficient here by not using the committees? i said: yeah, of course, it is. the nazis and the communists would love it. democracy is a lot of hard work. there is so much goodwill in this chamber, and there are so many good men and women. we get along fine. mr. speaker, let the process work. let the committee do its job, and we will get a good transportation bill, and we will rebuild this middle class and rebuild our economy in a way that is fair to everyone. mr. garamendi. well, there is no doubt that if we were to pass--well, we [[page h1106]] don't have a choice. if we don't pass a bill in the next 2 months, 2\1/ 2\ months, all public works, transportation programs, will come to a screeching halt. there will be no more federal money, and it will simply stop. so we have got work to do. as you say, if the committee could have its way, we could put together a good bill. there has been a long history here of the transportation bill being a bipartisan bill. we can do that. if we don't--let me just go back through this. i get stacks and stacks of paper, and this one caught my eye. it is entitled, ``infrastructure investment creates american jobs.'' i said: well, that is kind of a pretty good cover there. it has roads, bridges, ports, and so forth. it is the duke center on globalization, governance & competitiveness. so it is the duke university. here they say: old and broken transportation infrastructure makes the united states less competitive than 15 of our major trading partners and makes manufacturers less efficient in getting goods to market. underinvestment costs the united states over 900,000 jobs, including more than 97,000 american manufacturing jobs. maximizing american-made materials when rebuilding infrastructure has the potential to create even more jobs. relying on american-made inputs can also mitigate safety concerns related to large-scale outsourcing. i am with you, duke--duke university. i am from the west coast, and i have problems with some of these east coast athletic teams, but, hey, i am with them on this one. infrastructure creates american jobs. this is something that i have used over and over again. this is from mark zandi, chief economist at moody's analytics. he is the former economics adviser for senator john mccain when the senator ran for the united states presidency. he put it this way: for every dollar invested in infrastructure investment, $1.57 is pumped back into the american economy with well paying, middle class american jobs. this is just really critically important. the question for us, and the reason we are here on the floor and the reason we are talking about this issue of middle class economics and now transportation, is that we are up against another timeline here. we have got the transportation cliff, we have got a bridge that is collapsed, and the question is: will this congress provide a transportation bill that can bridge this collapsed bridge and rebuild it? i think we can. i know we must. my fear--my fear--mr. nolan, is that we have become really, really good at something we used to play when i was a kid, and it is called kick the can. we have become really good at kicking the can down the road rather than just coming to grips with the reality that we have to have a long-term transportation bill. there are many reasons for it. these are long-term projects, and over the last i guess almost 7 years now we have not had a long-term bill. the longest one has been a 2-year bill that passed 2 years ago, and that doesn't give the planners enough time to plan these long-term projects or the assurance that the money, the federal money, will be there; $478 billion, 6 years, fully paid for, doesn't increase the gasoline or diesel tax but requires american corporations that have run away from their obligation to this nation by hiding their profits overseas to bring those profits back and tax them accordingly. that is the president's plan. it is all there for us. can we do it? i don't think we have any choice. i think we have to do it, mr. nolan. i don't know how you feel about it from minnesota, but i know in california that we are in the midst of a major drought, and this is going to be the fourth year of a major drought in california, and it has been at least 30 years since there have been any major water infrastructure investments in california. our economy in california is paying dearly for it. about one-third of the rice fields in my district are fallow. if you go further south into the san joaquin valley it is probably about the same percentage. cantaloupes, cotton, and other kinds of row crops, tomatoes, are not being planted. we have to have in california investments in our water infrastructure. one of the things that my republican colleague--and mr. nolan, you spoke about bipartisanship--my republican colleague from my area, mr. lamalfa, he and i are going to introduce tomorrow a piece of legislation to build a very large, offstream reservoir called sites reservoir. it is about 1.8, 1.9 million acre-feet of water. if that had been built a decade ago, the drought would still be very difficult. there would be a lot of trouble and a lot of lost opportunity. but at least we would have a very significant amount of water available stored in that reservoir to help us along. so we are going to do that. that is a major infrastructure program, and we will see if we can participate here at the federal level with the participation that the state of california voters have already approved, a $7.6 billion bond act in which there is money for storage, both aquifer, underground, as well as surface storage, probably including the sites reservoir. so there are things we can do. and this is a piece of legislation, we will present it to the congress and the senate and hopefully it will move along. mr. nolan, i am sure that you have projects up in your area that are important, and perhaps you would like to pick up here. mr. nolan. i sure do, mr. garamendi. i think the fact that our bridges are falling down could not be more evidenced than in minnesota, where we had the catastrophic collapse of the i-35 bridge, which killed a number of people and did obviously irreparable damage to their lives and many others. mr. garamendi. this was the bridge across the mississippi in minneapolis? mr. nolan. yes. very tragic. i have got several thousand bridges in my district alone, and several hundred of them have been certified as obsolete and in disrepair, in need of repair, and, of course, there are thousands and thousands of those bridges across the country. i held three transportation hearings back in minnesota here recently, and the unanimity of agreement on what needs to be done is really quite unique. i mean, generally, if you get 50 people in a room in minnesota you will have at least 40, 45 opinions. mr. garamendi. well, in california, you would have 150 opinions if you had 50 people. mr. nolan. well, everybody agreed, as you pointed out, we need a long-term plan so that you can plan accordingly, and then do it responsibly in the most efficient and economical way. everyone came up and said that we need it for our economic growth and our business, and they understand that, as you were pointing out earlier, good infrastructure is the foundation, it is the foundation for every single successful economy in this world. i have said to people on occasion: if you don't want to pay any taxes, you can move to zaire. i think they have about 2 miles of roads and no taxes, but you had better bring a little army with you to protect you. so the other thing, of course--it has become real apparent--is the congestion. you must see that. we are seeing it in minnesota. people are spending endless hours sitting in their cars trying to get to and from work, time that they could have used to sleep in an extra hour, get home in time for dinner with their family. mr. garamendi. work with the kids on their homework. mr. nolan. of course, you mentioned the collapse of the bridge. the other thing they want to see is some bipartisanship. i would like to remind our colleagues, as well as the folks back home, because you and i were there, and we were part of a couple of the few instances where, in the last session of congress, the process was allowed to work. it was cumbersome, and it was contentious, but at the end of the day, we came together, and we passed a good, bipartisan farm bill. you and i were part of that. mr. garamendi. you were on the committee. mr. nolan. as well as our colleagues here on both sides of the aisle, and then we were allowed on the water resources bill, and we were able to put together a good bill. not everybody got everything they wanted, but everybody was a part of it. they had a chance to advance their ideas. we had open rules. if you want to have an amendment or a good idea, you got a chance to advance it and get a vote on it. people want to see more of that as well. then there is one thing that doesn't get mentioned very often, and i don't [[page h1107]] mind bringing it up, and a number of my folks back home brought it up. and that is--you mentioned the cost of not doing anything. well, that would be devastating for america. it would be just devastating for our economy. i pray to god that would never happen. but our hope is, of course, it will be done in a responsible way that solves the problems and fixes these things. but there is a little factor. i have about a 5- mile dirt road to my farm, and i went through two front ends on my new pickup truck until it became part of a local effort to pave the roads. my road got paved. that was 10 years ago. i am still driving the same pickup truck, and i haven't lost any front ends. you know the old saying, you pay me now or you pay me later. boy, i tell you, these potholes and these washboard roads and bridges falling down, there is a heavy price to be paid for not fixing, maintaining, and upkeeping our roads and our bridges. mr. garamendi. there is no doubt about it--you can ruin your car real fast. that 5-mile road was a county road, i assume, it was not your personal road? mr. nolan. no, no. it was not my personal road. no, no, no. it was a combination county and township. but it helped to have been on the township planning committee. mr. garamendi. whatever it took, you got it done. a couple of things that i think are also important as we go about this infrastructure, and that is: who is going to provide the material? i want to give you an example of why it is important that we honor the buy america laws that exist today. we have had buy america requirements in laws for almost 50 years now, and those requirements simply say that if it is our taxpayer money or your taxpayer money, then it should be used to buy american-made products and materials. now, out in california, we have the san francisco bay bridge. this is about a--what do we have here--$3.9 billion project. excuse me--it is not $3.9 billion; it is about $6 billion. it is $3.9 billion over budget. this project replaces the old san francisco-oakland bay bridge connecting the two cities across the bay that collapsed during the 1989 earthquake. the bridge went out to bid, and the contractor said: i can use chinese steel, and it will be 10 percent cheaper if we use chinese rather than american-made steel. so the state waived the buy america requirements. they didn't use them. they went out and bought chinese steel. well, they got 3,000 jobs in china and overbudget and poor material. in fact, today it is reported in the california newspapers that one of the major bolts, which is a 25-foot bolt, and i don't know, it must be several inches across, that holds down the main pier to the bridge is cracking. so we have a problem here. {time} 2000 now, new york is undertaking a bridge across the hudson river. it is called the tappan zee bridge, and it is made with american steel. american steel is being used. the total cost is $3.9 billion--notice, that is the cost of the overrun in california. there are 7,728 american jobs, and it is 100 percent made in america. when we go about this infrastructure, i want to make very, very sure that we maintain the buy america requirements. we can do it. i am going to put up one more placard here. this is one of my favorites. this is a brand-new 100 percent american-made electric locomotive for the washington, d.c., to boston northeast corridor. about 70 to 80 of these will be made. in the american recovery act--you remember the stimulus bill-- somebody wrote in $700 million for amtrak to buy new locomotives, and they said: 100 percent american-made. general electric looked at it, other companies looked at it, and a german company looked at this $700 million or so and 70 to 80 locomotives, 100 percent american-made, and they go: we can do that. so siemens, a major international german company, had a manufacturing plant in sacramento, and they set about to make 100 percent american- made locomotives. they built double the size of their factory, hired several hundred new workers, and they went out across the united states to find all the parts. they are now building 100 percent american-made locomotives, a major infrastructure project, great for american jobs, great for the future. this is one of the first ones that came off the lot. now, my final point and then i want to turn this back to my colleague from minnesota. today, on the east coast, amtrak is going out to bid for 28 new high-speed train sets to travel between washington, d.c., and boston at maybe half again as fast as the current trains, so you can zip between the two cities--washington, d.c., and new york--in, i don't know, 2 hours or less. they want--amtrak--wants a waiver from the buy america provisions, and i am saying: no way, period. this is american taxpayer money that is going to be used. you are going to buy america, we are going to make those train sets in america, and we can do it. yes, we can--si se puede. we can do it. we can build these things in america and create good middle class jobs in america, just like siemens is doing in sacramento when they are making 100 percent american-made locomotives in sacramento. this is an opportunity for us as we build our infrastructure, as we put together the surface transportation plan, as we take the water resources reform and development act. keep in mind and always keep in place the buy america provisions, so that your tax money is used on american-made equipment and employing americans making those things. i am sure this is important up in your area, as well as it is in sacramento, california, on the edge of my district, mr. nolan. i know it is important to me, and i think it is important to americans, that we use our tax money to buy american-made products that are employing americans. mr. nolan. well, indeed, it is. i represent minnesota's iron range, the largest iron mines anywhere in the united states. we are dependent upon a good, strong market for u.s. steel and for minnesota-made taconite and processed iron ore. i was so delighted to join you and others recently in petitioning the u.s. department of commerce and the international trade commission to curtail the importation of cheap korean steel. the market for steel in america is very, very good. the problem is that american steel is only providing about 70 to 75 percent of it. close to over 30 percent of it is being foreign steel that is brought in. foreign steel that, by the way, is subsidized by the foreign governments. our steelworkers, iron mineworkers, can compete with anybody in the world, anybody in america, quite frankly, we can compete with anybody, but it has got to be fair trade. if they have government-subsidized, below market cheap steel coming in here, that is unfair trade. guess what, there is about a dozen steel mills left here in america, and there is about 50,000 workers here. if we don't find a way to curtail the importation of this cheap, subsidized steel, we are going to put all 12 of those steel companies out of business, we are going to put 50,000 steelworkers out of business and countless thousands of mining processors and workers in this country. if we are talking about the middle class, we better start insisting on fair trade in this country, insisting--as you have so eloquently pointed out here--the significance and the importance of making it in america with u.s. steel when we are talking roads, bridges, railroads, pipelines, and all the rest. mr. garamendi. well, here it is, the san francisco bay bridge built with chinese steel. they built a brand-new, one of the most advanced steel mills, making one of the most advanced types of steel in china-- 3,000 chinese jobs, zero american. then the tappan zee bridge in new york, american steel--probably some of that iron ore from your district goes into making that steel. mr. nolan. oh, it did, no doubt. mr. garamendi. no doubt about it. mr. nolan. and do you know what, john, i found in international trade, when it comes to quality, american steel is considered to be the best quality. [[page h1108]] now, what is the importance of that? well, it might be the difference between a bridge falling down or standing; it might mean the difference between a pipeline breaking and polluting a wetland versus not doing that. there is an economic reason here, there is a reason for the middle class, there is a reason for our economy, there is a reason for safety, there is a reason for health, there is a reason for environment, there are so many good reasons to make it in america, john. mr. garamendi. you were just singing my song there. this bay bridge, why was it $3.9 billion over? because the steel was unsatisfactory. it was low quality, it had cracks in it, it didn't meet the requirements, they had to go back and redo the welds--many, many issues. you are absolutely correct about quality, as well as about the jobs in america. we are going to make it in america. we have an opportunity here. can i take up one more issue? mr. nolan. well, i am going to depart, but i really want to thank you for this session here and bringing it to the attention of our colleagues and people all across this country that care about america, care about good-paying middle class jobs, and want to see us do what we have got to do here to come together, fix this thing, and continue the great progress that america has enjoyed. a big part of being an american is paying it forward, and now, it is time for us to step up and do what we have to do for the next generation. mr. garamendi. mr. nolan, i thank you so very much. the folks in the northern minnesota area are blessed to have you return after a 32-year hiatus. you came back with a fire in your belly, and you are ready to go. mr. nolan. well, i am honored and thrilled and glad to be here. mr. garamendi. thank you so very much for joining us this evening. i want to bring up just one more issue, and then we will call it a night. america is blessed with a lot of energy. we have seen a resurgence of american energy here in the united states. we have seen us go from an importing nation--we can be an exporting nation. one of the things that the american gas industry wants to do is to export a strategic national asset, that is our natural gas. it has allowed us to have one of the lower energy prices in the world. that has allowed for a resurgence of manufacturing in the united states. there are other factors. clearly, the ability to have low- priced natural gas is one of the ingredients in the resurgence of american manufacturing. now, the gas industry wants to import a lot of gas so they can get two or three times more for the gas overseas. i want to be really careful here, i don't want to drive up the price of natural gas, but if we are going to export this strategic national asset, then we ought to consider two other strategic issues for the united states. one of them is the merchant marines. these are the american sailors and american ships. our military is absolutely dependent on the merchant marines. we ship a lot of things through the air on the big c- 5as and the c-17s, but it is a small percentage of what we need if we go to iraq or any other part of the world with our military. the merchant marines have historically, from the very earliest days of this nation, been one of the key strategic assets in the united states. a third strategic asset is the u.s. navy and the shipyards that build the naval ships. those shipyards are absolutely critical. if we didn't have them, would we go to china to have them build our aircraft carriers and our submarines? i don't think so. the shipyards are a strategic asset, absolutely essential for american defense. you have got these three things: the natural gas, a strategic asset; the merchant marines; and the shipbuilding. here is a key to american jobs, and that is, if we are ever to export natural gas, it will be done in liquefied natural gas. you take the natural gas, you compress it into a liquid, and you put it on an lng-- liquefied natural gas--ship. this is an example of one liquefied natural gas ship. sometime this year, a company--cheniere--located in texas will begin exporting lng from a facility in texas. they will need about 100 ships to export the full capacity of that lng export facility. my sense of this is let us use that export of a strategic national asset to build and to grow the other two strategics. we should require that any lng shipped from the united states be shipped on american-made tankers with american crews, thereby lifting up the ability of our nation to grow its economy and to maintain its strategic defense industries--shipbuilding and the merchant marines--at the same time we ship and export a strategic asset. what does it mean? it means that the shipyards in america in the next two decades would be busy. american workers would be in those shipyards, they would be making the ships, so it would be the shipbuilders. you can imagine what could happen in the ports around the united states--in baltimore, in the south coast, along the gulf coast, and in california, san diego, up in washington, and even san francisco--an opportunity to build our economy with, once again, infrastructure, a different kind of infrastructure, this is moving infrastructure, the great ships that will be all across the oceans of this nation and in the harbors around the united states, american ships, american-built ships, american sailors, exporting american liquefied natural gas. si se puede--yes, we can. we can make it in america. we can rebuild the american economy. we can focus on middle class economics with the infrastructure systems that we must build, the foundation for future economic growth, and the foundation for american jobs today. make it in america, build america, build our ports, our water systems, our highways, our bridges, our airports, our sanitation systems. let us have the american society of civil engineers come back with an a-plus rating when they look at our airports, an a-plus rating when they look at our rail lines, our transit lines, when they look at our transit systems, when they look at our waste disposal systems. we don't want to be a backwater. this is america. we are the people that can build for the future. all it takes is the senate and the house to pass a 6-year surface transportation bill and infrastructure bills that are fully funded, that provide the foundation for middle class jobs, middle class economics, putting americans back to work, and building this nation's future. mr. speaker, i yield back the balance of my time. ____________________",41711

Mr. YOUNG of Iowa. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to speak about a very special seventh-grader from Hamburg, Iowa, in Fremont County, located in the Third Congressional District, which I represent. Autumn Gadoua is the statewide winner in the Iowa League of Cities' Fifth Annual ``If I Were Mayor'' contest. This annual essay contest allows students to form and express ideas regarding citizenship and leadership. Autumn and the other district winners are being recognized at a ceremony at the Iowa State Capitol building in Des Moines. In her essay, Autumn wrote that, if she were mayor of her hometown, she would pursue policies that would preserve the town's history and the historical brick buildings for current and new businesses. She notes that this policy would connect the past to the present and would promote growth for the future. Mayor Gadoua would also work for opportunities to help businesses thrive, bring new businesses and families to the town, promote green solutions, recycling, and support police officers and firefighters to keep them and the citizens of the community safe. Autumn concluded her essay by saying: I would visit the school in my community to teach children the responsibilities of a mayor and give examples of good citizenship. To help children grow and learn, I would establish an afterschool youth club. Being mayor is a big responsibility but one that is rewarding and important to me. I applaud and congratulate Autumn for her award-winning essay and for proving that the next generation of leaders in Iowa and this Nation is already preparing for its time of service. I am proud to represent Autumn and her family and her teachers and fellow students in the United States Congress. I know that my colleagues join me in congratulating Autumn Gadoua and in wishing her continued success in the future. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 31 (Tuesday, February 24, 2015)] [House] [Page H1111] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] AUTUMN GADOUA (Mr. YOUNG of Iowa asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.)

Under the Speaker's announced policy of January 6, 2015, the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Poe) is recognized for 60 minutes as the designee of the majority leader. Mr. POE of Texas. Mr. Speaker, it was in the cold, dark, damp, moldy walls of a beat-up old Spanish mission that was already 100 years old at the time. He was a 27-year-old lawyer from South Carolina and also from Alabama. He was the commander of 187 volunteers from 13 countries and most of the States in then the United States. His men were surrounded by several thousand of the enemy. It was the Alamo. It had been turned into a makeshift fort, and the commander was William Barret Travis. Mr. Speaker, he wrote the following letter 179 years ago this very night, February 24, 1836. It is entitled Commander of the Alamo, February 24, 1836: To all the people of Texas and all Americans in the world, fellow citizens and compatriots: I am besieged by a thousand or more of the Mexicans under Santa Anna. I have sustained a continual bombardment and cannon fire for over 24 hours, but I have not lost a man. The enemy has demanded surrender at its discretion; otherwise, the fort will be put to the sword. I have answered that demand with a cannon shot, and the flag still waves proudly over the north wall. I shall never surrender or retreat. I call upon you in the name of liberty and patriotism and everything dear to our character to come to my aid with all dispatch. The enemy is receiving reinforcements daily and will no doubt increase to 3 or 4,000 in 4 or 5 days. If this call is neglected, I am determined to sustain myself for as long as possible and die like a soldier that never forgets his honor and that of his country. Victory or death. Signed, William Barret Travis, Commander of the Alamo. [[Page H1109]] Besides Travis, there were other famous people: Davy Crockett, Jim Bowie, Jim Bonham, and many others.

Mr. POE of Texas. Mr. Speaker, this hardy band of frontiersmen and patriots, shopkeepers, lawyers were a frightful sight to see. They did not wear uniforms. They wore what they worked in. They entered the Alamo, and they stood there for 13 days, fought here at this place, and all died for Texas freedom. They fought against a dictatorship, a dictator by the name of Santa Anna. He had abolished the Constitution of Mexico. Texas was a part of Mexico at the time. He had abolished the Constitution and set up a dictatorship. [[Page H1110]] That is what started the Texas war of independence against Mexico. You notice that the flag that is flying over the Alamo is the Mexican flag. The Mexican eagle has been removed, and it has the date 1824 on it. That is the date that the Republic of Mexico established a Constitution. The defenders of the Alamo were hoping to reestablish a democracy in Mexico, which Texas was a part of. After the Alamo fell, after 13 days and all 187 of the Texans were killed, other Texans went ahead and rallied for Texas independence from Mexico. As I said, the defenders of the Alamo were from all races. Nine, maybe 11 were Tejanos. Tejano is a uniquely Texas name. Those are individuals of Mexican or Spanish descent that were born in Texas, thus the name Tejano. The Alamo was important for a lot of reasons, but, one, it stopped Santa Anna's invasion of Texas. Texas was one of several states in Mexico that had rebelled against Santa Anna's dictatorship. On this other chart here, there are numerous states in Mexico that were established, but several of those, including Texas, Coahuila y Tejas, Tamaulipas, Nuevo Leon, Yucatan, all of them rebelled about the same time against Mexico, in 1835, 1836, because Santa Anna established a dictatorship and abolished the democracy. None of these other states that rebelled were successful in creating independence except Texas. Santa Anna used his army and went through his own country, destroying and defeating any resistance to his dictatorship, and he had taken all of these states back, so to speak, when he invaded what is now the State of Texas. So he had well-seasoned troops when he came into the State of Texas in 1836. It all started, really, in the year of 1835. In October of 1835, the Mexican Army had come upon a small town in Gonzales, Texas, and had demanded that the townspeople turn over to the Mexican Army a small cannon that they had to defend themselves from Indians in the area. The locals, the Texans, refused to turn over the cannon. They, in fact, made a flag. They called it the Come and Take It flag, that had a white background and then painted in a cannon that said, ``Come and Take It.'' That is the famous Come and Take It flag that was used, the first flag that was used in the Texas war of independence. After a skirmish where several shots were fired by both sides--I don't think anybody was hurt very bad--the Mexican Army left, but most importantly they left without taking the arms, the cannon from the Texas people who lived in Gonzales. That was the spark that started the Texas war of independence and revolution. There were several other skirmishes, and by February of 1836, Travis and his band of volunteers had found themselves in the Alamo to thwart the invasion of the larger army of Santa Anna that was coming from the south. Their defense of the Alamo for 13 days gave the rest of Texas time to build another army to eventually fight Santa Anna. That army was, of course, led by General Sam Houston at the time. So they were in the Alamo for many reasons, but the primary reason was to fight for liberty for Texas and Texas independence. When Travis realized that he wasn't getting any aid except for a small band of individuals from Gonzales, Texas, that came and volunteered when Travis sent out that first letter, he penned this letter on March 3, 1836. Travis addressed his last letter to the Council at Washington-on-the- Brazos that was not far from the Alamo or San Antonio, Bexar--what it was called at that time--in hopes that they would understand his plight. His battered walls, according to T. R. Fehrenbach, the noted Texas historian, were still show defenses, still flew the flag. His men were on duty and in combat that day and every day and night. They were exhausted. Travis expected no rescue, and he wrote, according to Fehrenbach, apparently to stir his countrymen into action that the country might be saved. He was speaking of Texas. Here is what he said in that last letter: I shall have to fight the enemy on its own terms. I will do the best I can. The victory will cost the enemy so dear that it will be worse for him than defeat. I hope your honorable body will hasten reinforcements. Our supply of ammunition is limited. God and Texas. Victory or death. William Barret Travis. Then on March 6, 1836, a few days later, they were all killed in the Alamo, even though they inflicted tremendous losses against the invasion by Santa Anna. But Travis was right, victory would cost the enemy more than defeat. It did give Sam Houston and other Texas volunteers enough time to assemble another army. Not a large army, it was only 600 individuals. Santa Anna, still with a larger force, met Sam Houston and his 600 volunteers, which once again included men from several countries, included men from several States, and had numerous Tejanos involved fighting from the side of the Republic of Texas, including Juan Seguin, Captain Seguin and his volunteers, his cavalry that was there. It is interesting to note that before the battle took place on April 21, 1836, on the plains of San Jacinto--you have never heard of that, Mr. Speaker, but it is near what is now Houston, Texas, down on the gulf coast, in the marsh area--Juan Seguin made sure that he had all of his Tejanos, the cavalry, put playing cards in the hatbands of their hats so that they wouldn't be mistaken for the enemy. In those days, apparently, the playing cards that were used to gamble were much larger than the small ones we have. So they placed these playing cards in their hatbands so they could be recognized as fighting on the side of the Texas volunteers because, once again, they didn't wear uniforms. The battle that took place that Travis was able to delay the army of Santa Anna in reaching this battle was an interesting military feat. Most battles take place, have taken place throughout history, in the early hours of the day. At sunrise, two armies get together and fight it out. They have done that for thousands of years. Even still today in World War II, Vietnam, battles were fought at dawn. {time} 2030 This battle--the Battle of San Jacinto--did not take place at dawn; it took place in the middle of the afternoon on April 21 because Santa Anna and his army were taking a siesta in the middle of the day. They didn't expect the battle until the next morning. Sam Houston and his other commanders didn't want to wait until the next day--the troops were getting restless, as they say--so they decided to have that battle in the afternoon. They lined up in a single column across the high ground and marched in broad daylight. Santa Anna had not put out pickets, so he had no one to warn him that the Texans were charging. They came down the hill, and the battle began. In 18 minutes, Mr. Speaker, it was all over. Santa Anna had been completely defeated. More of the enemy were killed than were in the Texas Army. The rest were captured. Only a handful--13 Texans--were killed, and the battle lasted 18 minutes. Santa Anna was captured. He was pretending to change clothes, and he put on the uniform of a Mexican private. He was captured and held. Travis enters the Alamo on February 23, 1836, and writes this famous letter. He and the defenders were killed on March 6. In between that, on March 2, 1836, Texas had declared independence. Then, just a few weeks later, on April 21, about 200 miles or so from the Alamo, the Battle of San Jacinto took place. Sam Houston won that battle, and Texas became a free and independent country. We have this map here, Mr. Speaker. You may not have seen something like this. This is what Texas claimed when Texas became an independent country--what is now modern-day Texas--and you see that here on this map; but it also had claimed parts of Oklahoma, Kansas, New Mexico, Colorado, and parts of Wyoming. Texas claimed all of this area when Texas became the Republic of Texas. Sam Houston was the first President of the Republic of Texas. Texas was an independent country for 9 years, and then it decided to request to join the United States. Even how Texas joined the United States was an interesting phenomena. Not all of the States wanted Texas to become a part of the United States. Finally, after several tries and failures to become a State in the United States, [[Page H1111]] on a joint resolution--not a treaty--Texas became a State in the United States by one vote when, apparently, a Louisiana Senator changed his mind and voted to annex Texas and make it the next State in the United States. That took place in 1845. Ever since then, Texas gave up its sovereignty as a republic and became a State. Some say that we still act like we are a foreign country, a sovereign country. Under Texas law that allowed it to become a part of the U.S., the Texas flag always is supposed to fly level with the American flag, since we were a republic. Texas can divide into five states. I don't ever see that happening, but Texans can make that decision and split the State up to make it five different states. We have a unique history, as all of America has a unique history, and it goes back to the fact that Texans did not want to live under a dictatorship no matter who it was. That is why people of all races were at the Alamo. All races fought for Texas independence, for freedom, and for liberty--very similar to the actions that took place with the Thirteen Colonies in how they were being oppressed by Great Britain. Nobody ever thought they could whip Great Britain--the most powerful empire that had ever existed at the time--and very few people thought that Texas could defeat Mexico. After all, Santa Anna had defeated all of these other parts of Mexico that were in rebellion. He had not lost any battles when he came and invaded Texas. People were surprised that Texas could defeat them, but it did because some things are worth fighting for and giving their lives for. That is why those 187 individuals from all walks of life, from different parts of the world--Brown, Black, and White--stood together as volunteers to defend the Alamo and help freedom ring in a part of the world that we call Texas. Mr. Speaker, I think you are probably old enough to have heard of Marty Robbins. Maybe you haven't. Marty Robbins, years ago, the singer, wrote a ballad in honor of the people who stayed and defied tyranny and gave their lives fighting for freedom, for Texas. It goes like this: In the southern part of Texas in the town of San Antone, There's a fortress all in ruin, and the weeds have overgrown. You may look in vain for crosses, and you'll never see a one, but sometime between the setting and the rising of the Sun, You can hear a ghostly bugle as men go marching by; You can hear them as they answer to that roll call in the sky: Colonel Travis, Davy Crockett, and 180 more; Captain Dickinson, Jim Bowie stand present and accounted for. Back in 1836, Sam Houston said to Travis, ``Get some volunteers, and go and fortify the Alamo.'' Well, the men came from Texas and from old Tennessee and a lot of other places. They joined up with Travis just to fight for the right to be free. Indian scouts with squirrel guns and men with muzzle loaders, Stood together, heel and toe, to defend the Alamo. ``You may never see your loved ones,'' Travis told them that day. ``Those who want to can leave now. Those who fight to the death, let 'em stay.'' So, in the sand, he drew a line with his army sabre; Out of 185, not a soldier crossed the line. With his banners a-dancin' in the dawn's golden light, Santa Anna came prancin' on a horse that was black as the night. He sent an officer to tell Travis to surrender. Travis answered with a shell and a rousin' yell. Santa Anna said, ``I will show them no quarter. Everyone will be put to our sword.'' 185 holding back 5,000. 5 days, 6 days, 8 days, 10 days, Travis kept holding again and again. Then Travis sent for replacements for his wounded and lame, But the troops that were comin' never came, never came. So twice Santa Anna charged and then blew recall, But on that fatal third time, Santa Anna breached the wall, and he killed them one and all. Now the bugles are silent, and there is rust on each sword, And the small band of soldiers lies asleep in the arms of the Lord. In the southern part of Texas, near the town of San Antone, Like a statue on his pinto rides a cowboy all alone. He sees the cattle grazin' where a century before, Santa Anna's guns were blazin' and the cannons used to roar. His eyes turn a little misty, and his heart begins to glow, And he takes his hat off slowly to those men of the Alamo, To the 13 days of glory at the siege of the Alamo. And that is just the way it is. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 31 (Tuesday, February 24, 2015)] [House] [Pages H1108-H1111] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] {time} 2015 REMEMBERING THE ALAMO The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Grothman).

Mr. POE of Texas. Mr. Speaker, this hardy band of frontiersmen and patriots, shopkeepers, lawyers were a frightful sight to see. They did not wear uniforms. They wore what they worked in. They entered the Alamo, and they stood there for 13 days, fought here at this place, and all died for Texas freedom. They fought against a dictatorship, a dictator by the name of Santa Anna. He had abolished the Constitution of Mexico. Texas was a part of Mexico at the time. He had abolished the Constitution and set up a dictatorship. [[Page H1110]] That is what started the Texas war of independence against Mexico. You notice that the flag that is flying over the Alamo is the Mexican flag. The Mexican eagle has been removed, and it has the date 1824 on it. That is the date that the Republic of Mexico established a Constitution. The defenders of the Alamo were hoping to reestablish a democracy in Mexico, which Texas was a part of. After the Alamo fell, after 13 days and all 187 of the Texans were killed, other Texans went ahead and rallied for Texas independence from Mexico. As I said, the defenders of the Alamo were from all races. Nine, maybe 11 were Tejanos. Tejano is a uniquely Texas name. Those are individuals of Mexican or Spanish descent that were born in Texas, thus the name Tejano. The Alamo was important for a lot of reasons, but, one, it stopped Santa Anna's invasion of Texas. Texas was one of several states in Mexico that had rebelled against Santa Anna's dictatorship. On this other chart here, there are numerous states in Mexico that were established, but several of those, including Texas, Coahuila y Tejas, Tamaulipas, Nuevo Leon, Yucatan, all of them rebelled about the same time against Mexico, in 1835, 1836, because Santa Anna established a dictatorship and abolished the democracy. None of these other states that rebelled were successful in creating independence except Texas. Santa Anna used his army and went through his own country, destroying and defeating any resistance to his dictatorship, and he had taken all of these states back, so to speak, when he invaded what is now the State of Texas. So he had well-seasoned troops when he came into the State of Texas in 1836. It all started, really, in the year of 1835. In October of 1835, the Mexican Army had come upon a small town in Gonzales, Texas, and had demanded that the townspeople turn over to the Mexican Army a small cannon that they had to defend themselves from Indians in the area. The locals, the Texans, refused to turn over the cannon. They, in fact, made a flag. They called it the Come and Take It flag, that had a white background and then painted in a cannon that said, ``Come and Take It.'' That is the famous Come and Take It flag that was used, the first flag that was used in the Texas war of independence. After a skirmish where several shots were fired by both sides--I don't think anybody was hurt very bad--the Mexican Army left, but most importantly they left without taking the arms, the cannon from the Texas people who lived in Gonzales. That was the spark that started the Texas war of independence and revolution. There were several other skirmishes, and by February of 1836, Travis and his band of volunteers had found themselves in the Alamo to thwart the invasion of the larger army of Santa Anna that was coming from the south. Their defense of the Alamo for 13 days gave the rest of Texas time to build another army to eventually fight Santa Anna. That army was, of course, led by General Sam Houston at the time. So they were in the Alamo for many reasons, but the primary reason was to fight for liberty for Texas and Texas independence. When Travis realized that he wasn't getting any aid except for a small band of individuals from Gonzales, Texas, that came and volunteered when Travis sent out that first letter, he penned this letter on March 3, 1836. Travis addressed his last letter to the Council at Washington-on-the- Brazos that was not far from the Alamo or San Antonio, Bexar--what it was called at that time--in hopes that they would understand his plight. His battered walls, according to T. R. Fehrenbach, the noted Texas historian, were still show defenses, still flew the flag. His men were on duty and in combat that day and every day and night. They were exhausted. Travis expected no rescue, and he wrote, according to Fehrenbach, apparently to stir his countrymen into action that the country might be saved. He was speaking of Texas. Here is what he said in that last letter: I shall have to fight the enemy on its own terms. I will do the best I can. The victory will cost the enemy so dear that it will be worse for him than defeat. I hope your honorable body will hasten reinforcements. Our supply of ammunition is limited. God and Texas. Victory or death. William Barret Travis. Then on March 6, 1836, a few days later, they were all killed in the Alamo, even though they inflicted tremendous losses against the invasion by Santa Anna. But Travis was right, victory would cost the enemy more than defeat. It did give Sam Houston and other Texas volunteers enough time to assemble another army. Not a large army, it was only 600 individuals. Santa Anna, still with a larger force, met Sam Houston and his 600 volunteers, which once again included men from several countries, included men from several States, and had numerous Tejanos involved fighting from the side of the Republic of Texas, including Juan Seguin, Captain Seguin and his volunteers, his cavalry that was there. It is interesting to note that before the battle took place on April 21, 1836, on the plains of San Jacinto--you have never heard of that, Mr. Speaker, but it is near what is now Houston, Texas, down on the gulf coast, in the marsh area--Juan Seguin made sure that he had all of his Tejanos, the cavalry, put playing cards in the hatbands of their hats so that they wouldn't be mistaken for the enemy. In those days, apparently, the playing cards that were used to gamble were much larger than the small ones we have. So they placed these playing cards in their hatbands so they could be recognized as fighting on the side of the Texas volunteers because, once again, they didn't wear uniforms. The battle that took place that Travis was able to delay the army of Santa Anna in reaching this battle was an interesting military feat. Most battles take place, have taken place throughout history, in the early hours of the day. At sunrise, two armies get together and fight it out. They have done that for thousands of years. Even still today in World War II, Vietnam, battles were fought at dawn. {time} 2030 This battle--the Battle of San Jacinto--did not take place at dawn; it took place in the middle of the afternoon on April 21 because Santa Anna and his army were taking a siesta in the middle of the day. They didn't expect the battle until the next morning. Sam Houston and his other commanders didn't want to wait until the next day--the troops were getting restless, as they say--so they decided to have that battle in the afternoon. They lined up in a single column across the high ground and marched in broad daylight. Santa Anna had not put out pickets, so he had no one to warn him that the Texans were charging. They came down the hill, and the battle began. In 18 minutes, Mr. Speaker, it was all over. Santa Anna had been completely defeated. More of the enemy were killed than were in the Texas Army. The rest were captured. Only a handful--13 Texans--were killed, and the battle lasted 18 minutes. Santa Anna was captured. He was pretending to change clothes, and he put on the uniform of a Mexican private. He was captured and held. Travis enters the Alamo on February 23, 1836, and writes this famous letter. He and the defenders were killed on March 6. In between that, on March 2, 1836, Texas had declared independence. Then, just a few weeks later, on April 21, about 200 miles or so from the Alamo, the Battle of San Jacinto took place. Sam Houston won that battle, and Texas became a free and independent country. We have this map here, Mr. Speaker. You may not have seen something like this. This is what Texas claimed when Texas became an independent country--what is now modern-day Texas--and you see that here on this map; but it also had claimed parts of Oklahoma, Kansas, New Mexico, Colorado, and parts of Wyoming. Texas claimed all of this area when Texas became the Republic of Texas. Sam Houston was the first President of the Republic of Texas. Texas was an independent country for 9 years, and then it decided to request to join the United States. Even how Texas joined the United States was an interesting phenomena. Not all of the States wanted Texas to become a part of the United States. Finally, after several tries and failures to become a State in the United States, [[Page H1111]] on a joint resolution--not a treaty--Texas became a State in the United States by one vote when, apparently, a Louisiana Senator changed his mind and voted to annex Texas and make it the next State in the United States. That took place in 1845. Ever since then, Texas gave up its sovereignty as a republic and became a State. Some say that we still act like we are a foreign country, a sovereign country. Under Texas law that allowed it to become a part of the U.S., the Texas flag always is supposed to fly level with the American flag, since we were a republic. Texas can divide into five states. I don't ever see that happening, but Texans can make that decision and split the State up to make it five different states. We have a unique history, as all of America has a unique history, and it goes back to the fact that Texans did not want to live under a dictatorship no matter who it was. That is why people of all races were at the Alamo. All races fought for Texas independence, for freedom, and for liberty--very similar to the actions that took place with the Thirteen Colonies in how they were being oppressed by Great Britain. Nobody ever thought they could whip Great Britain--the most powerful empire that had ever existed at the time--and very few people thought that Texas could defeat Mexico. After all, Santa Anna had defeated all of these other parts of Mexico that were in rebellion. He had not lost any battles when he came and invaded Texas. People were surprised that Texas could defeat them, but it did because some things are worth fighting for and giving their lives for. That is why those 187 individuals from all walks of life, from different parts of the world--Brown, Black, and White--stood together as volunteers to defend the Alamo and help freedom ring in a part of the world that we call Texas. Mr. Speaker, I think you are probably old enough to have heard of Marty Robbins. Maybe you haven't. Marty Robbins, years ago, the singer, wrote a ballad in honor of the people who stayed and defied tyranny and gave their lives fighting for freedom, for Texas. It goes like this: In the southern part of Texas in the town of San Antone, There's a fortress all in ruin, and the weeds have overgrown. You may look in vain for crosses, and you'll never see a one, but sometime between the setting and the rising of the Sun, You can hear a ghostly bugle as men go marching by; You can hear them as they answer to that roll call in the sky: Colonel Travis, Davy Crockett, and 180 more; Captain Dickinson, Jim Bowie stand present and accounted for. Back in 1836, Sam Houston said to Travis, ``Get some volunteers, and go and fortify the Alamo.'' Well, the men came from Texas and from old Tennessee and a lot of other places. They joined up with Travis just to fight for the right to be free. Indian scouts with squirrel guns and men with muzzle loaders, Stood together, heel and toe, to defend the Alamo. ``You may never see your loved ones,'' Travis told them that day. ``Those who want to can leave now. Those who fight to the death, let 'em stay.'' So, in the sand, he drew a line with his army sabre; Out of 185, not a soldier crossed the line. With his banners a-dancin' in the dawn's golden light, Santa Anna came prancin' on a horse that was black as the night. He sent an officer to tell Travis to surrender. Travis answered with a shell and a rousin' yell. Santa Anna said, ``I will show them no quarter. Everyone will be put to our sword.'' 185 holding back 5,000. 5 days, 6 days, 8 days, 10 days, Travis kept holding again and again. Then Travis sent for replacements for his wounded and lame, But the troops that were comin' never came, never came. So twice Santa Anna charged and then blew recall, But on that fatal third time, Santa Anna breached the wall, and he killed them one and all. Now the bugles are silent, and there is rust on each sword, And the small band of soldiers lies asleep in the arms of the Lord. In the southern part of Texas, near the town of San Antone, Like a statue on his pinto rides a cowboy all alone. He sees the cattle grazin' where a century before, Santa Anna's guns were blazin' and the cannons used to roar. His eyes turn a little misty, and his heart begins to glow, And he takes his hat off slowly to those men of the Alamo, To the 13 days of glory at the siege of the Alamo. And that is just the way it is. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. ____________________","Congressional Record, Volume 161 Issue 31 (Tuesday, February 24, 2015) [Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 31 (Tuesday, February 24, 2015)] [House] [Pages H1108-H1111] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] {time} 2015 REMEMBERING THE ALAMO The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Grothman). Under the Speaker's announced policy of January 6, 2015, the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Poe) is recognized for 60 minutes as the designee of the majority leader. Mr. POE of Texas. Mr. Speaker, it was in the cold, dark, damp, moldy walls of a beat-up old Spanish mission that was already 100 years old at the time. He was a 27-year-old lawyer from South Carolina and also from Alabama. He was the commander of 187 volunteers from 13 countries and most of the States in then the United States. His men were surrounded by several thousand of the enemy. It was the Alamo. It had been turned into a makeshift fort, and the commander was William Barret Travis. Mr. Speaker, he wrote the following letter 179 years ago this very night, February 24, 1836. It is entitled Commander of the Alamo, February 24, 1836: To all the people of Texas and all Americans in the world, fellow citizens and compatriots: I am besieged by a thousand or more of the Mexicans under Santa Anna. I have sustained a continual bombardment and cannon fire for over 24 hours, but I have not lost a man. The enemy has demanded surrender at its discretion; otherwise, the fort will be put to the sword. I have answered that demand with a cannon shot, and the flag still waves proudly over the north wall. I shall never surrender or retreat. I call upon you in the name of liberty and patriotism and everything dear to our character to come to my aid with all dispatch. The enemy is receiving reinforcements daily and will no doubt increase to 3 or 4,000 in 4 or 5 days. If this call is neglected, I am determined to sustain myself for as long as possible and die like a soldier that never forgets his honor and that of his country. Victory or death. Signed, William Barret Travis, Commander of the Alamo. [[Page H1109]] Besides Travis, there were other famous people: Davy Crockett, Jim Bowie, Jim Bonham, and many others. Mr. Speaker, it is interesting that all of these people were volunteers. They came from most States, 13 foreign countries. They were black, they were brown, and they were white.

Mr. POE of Texas. Mr. Speaker, this hardy band of frontiersmen and patriots, shopkeepers, lawyers were a frightful sight to see. They did not wear uniforms. They wore what they worked in. They entered the Alamo, and they stood there for 13 days, fought here at this place, and all died for Texas freedom. They fought against a dictatorship, a dictator by the name of Santa Anna. He had abolished the Constitution of Mexico. Texas was a part of Mexico at the time. He had abolished the Constitution and set up a dictatorship. [[Page H1110]] That is what started the Texas war of independence against Mexico. You notice that the flag that is flying over the Alamo is the Mexican flag. The Mexican eagle has been removed, and it has the date 1824 on it. That is the date that the Republic of Mexico established a Constitution. The defenders of the Alamo were hoping to reestablish a democracy in Mexico, which Texas was a part of. After the Alamo fell, after 13 days and all 187 of the Texans were killed, other Texans went ahead and rallied for Texas independence from Mexico. As I said, the defenders of the Alamo were from all races. Nine, maybe 11 were Tejanos. Tejano is a uniquely Texas name. Those are individuals of Mexican or Spanish descent that were born in Texas, thus the name Tejano. The Alamo was important for a lot of reasons, but, one, it stopped Santa Anna's invasion of Texas. Texas was one of several states in Mexico that had rebelled against Santa Anna's dictatorship. On this other chart here, there are numerous states in Mexico that were established, but several of those, including Texas, Coahuila y Tejas, Tamaulipas, Nuevo Leon, Yucatan, all of them rebelled about the same time against Mexico, in 1835, 1836, because Santa Anna established a dictatorship and abolished the democracy. None of these other states that rebelled were successful in creating independence except Texas. Santa Anna used his army and went through his own country, destroying and defeating any resistance to his dictatorship, and he had taken all of these states back, so to speak, when he invaded what is now the State of Texas. So he had well-seasoned troops when he came into the State of Texas in 1836. It all started, really, in the year of 1835. In October of 1835, the Mexican Army had come upon a small town in Gonzales, Texas, and had demanded that the townspeople turn over to the Mexican Army a small cannon that they had to defend themselves from Indians in the area. The locals, the Texans, refused to turn over the cannon. They, in fact, made a flag. They called it the Come and Take It flag, that had a white background and then painted in a cannon that said, ``Come and Take It.'' That is the famous Come and Take It flag that was used, the first flag that was used in the Texas war of independence. After a skirmish where several shots were fired by both sides--I don't think anybody was hurt very bad--the Mexican Army left, but most importantly they left without taking the arms, the cannon from the Texas people who lived in Gonzales. That was the spark that started the Texas war of independence and revolution. There were several other skirmishes, and by February of 1836, Travis and his band of volunteers had found themselves in the Alamo to thwart the invasion of the larger army of Santa Anna that was coming from the south. Their defense of the Alamo for 13 days gave the rest of Texas time to build another army to eventually fight Santa Anna. That army was, of course, led by General Sam Houston at the time. So they were in the Alamo for many reasons, but the primary reason was to fight for liberty for Texas and Texas independence. When Travis realized that he wasn't getting any aid except for a small band of individuals from Gonzales, Texas, that came and volunteered when Travis sent out that first letter, he penned this letter on March 3, 1836. Travis addressed his last letter to the Council at Washington-on-the- Brazos that was not far from the Alamo or San Antonio, Bexar--what it was called at that time--in hopes that they would understand his plight. His battered walls, according to T. R. Fehrenbach, the noted Texas historian, were still show defenses, still flew the flag. His men were on duty and in combat that day and every day and night. They were exhausted. Travis expected no rescue, and he wrote, according to Fehrenbach, apparently to stir his countrymen into action that the country might be saved. He was speaking of Texas. Here is what he said in that last letter: I shall have to fight the enemy on its own terms. I will do the best I can. The victory will cost the enemy so dear that it will be worse for him than defeat. I hope your honorable body will hasten reinforcements. Our supply of ammunition is limited. God and Texas. Victory or death. William Barret Travis. Then on March 6, 1836, a few days later, they were all killed in the Alamo, even though they inflicted tremendous losses against the invasion by Santa Anna. But Travis was right, victory would cost the enemy more than defeat. It did give Sam Houston and other Texas volunteers enough time to assemble another army. Not a large army, it was only 600 individuals. Santa Anna, still with a larger force, met Sam Houston and his 600 volunteers, which once again included men from several countries, included men from several States, and had numerous Tejanos involved fighting from the side of the Republic of Texas, including Juan Seguin, Captain Seguin and his volunteers, his cavalry that was there. It is interesting to note that before the battle took place on April 21, 1836, on the plains of San Jacinto--you have never heard of that, Mr. Speaker, but it is near what is now Houston, Texas, down on the gulf coast, in the marsh area--Juan Seguin made sure that he had all of his Tejanos, the cavalry, put playing cards in the hatbands of their hats so that they wouldn't be mistaken for the enemy. In those days, apparently, the playing cards that were used to gamble were much larger than the small ones we have. So they placed these playing cards in their hatbands so they could be recognized as fighting on the side of the Texas volunteers because, once again, they didn't wear uniforms. The battle that took place that Travis was able to delay the army of Santa Anna in reaching this battle was an interesting military feat. Most battles take place, have taken place throughout history, in the early hours of the day. At sunrise, two armies get together and fight it out. They have done that for thousands of years. Even still today in World War II, Vietnam, battles were fought at dawn. {time} 2030 This battle--the Battle of San Jacinto--did not take place at dawn; it took place in the middle of the afternoon on April 21 because Santa Anna and his army were taking a siesta in the middle of the day. They didn't expect the battle until the next morning. Sam Houston and his other commanders didn't want to wait until the next day--the troops were getting restless, as they say--so they decided to have that battle in the afternoon. They lined up in a single column across the high ground and marched in broad daylight. Santa Anna had not put out pickets, so he had no one to warn him that the Texans were charging. They came down the hill, and the battle began. In 18 minutes, Mr. Speaker, it was all over. Santa Anna had been completely defeated. More of the enemy were killed than were in the Texas Army. The rest were captured. Only a handful--13 Texans--were killed, and the battle lasted 18 minutes. Santa Anna was captured. He was pretending to change clothes, and he put on the uniform of a Mexican private. He was captured and held. Travis enters the Alamo on February 23, 1836, and writes this famous letter. He and the defenders were killed on March 6. In between that, on March 2, 1836, Texas had declared independence. Then, just a few weeks later, on April 21, about 200 miles or so from the Alamo, the Battle of San Jacinto took place. Sam Houston won that battle, and Texas became a free and independent country. We have this map here, Mr. Speaker. You may not have seen something like this. This is what Texas claimed when Texas became an independent country--what is now modern-day Texas--and you see that here on this map; but it also had claimed parts of Oklahoma, Kansas, New Mexico, Colorado, and parts of Wyoming. Texas claimed all of this area when Texas became the Republic of Texas. Sam Houston was the first President of the Republic of Texas. Texas was an independent country for 9 years, and then it decided to request to join the United States. Even how Texas joined the United States was an interesting phenomena. Not all of the States wanted Texas to become a part of the United States. Finally, after several tries and failures to become a State in the United States, [[Page H1111]] on a joint resolution--not a treaty--Texas became a State in the United States by one vote when, apparently, a Louisiana Senator changed his mind and voted to annex Texas and make it the next State in the United States. That took place in 1845. Ever since then, Texas gave up its sovereignty as a republic and became a State. Some say that we still act like we are a foreign country, a sovereign country. Under Texas law that allowed it to become a part of the U.S., the Texas flag always is supposed to fly level with the American flag, since we were a republic. Texas can divide into five states. I don't ever see that happening, but Texans can make that decision and split the State up to make it five different states. We have a unique history, as all of America has a unique history, and it goes back to the fact that Texans did not want to live under a dictatorship no matter who it was. That is why people of all races were at the Alamo. All races fought for Texas independence, for freedom, and for liberty--very similar to the actions that took place with the Thirteen Colonies in how they were being oppressed by Great Britain. Nobody ever thought they could whip Great Britain--the most powerful empire that had ever existed at the time--and very few people thought that Texas could defeat Mexico. After all, Santa Anna had defeated all of these other parts of Mexico that were in rebellion. He had not lost any battles when he came and invaded Texas. People were surprised that Texas could defeat them, but it did because some things are worth fighting for and giving their lives for. That is why those 187 individuals from all walks of life, from different parts of the world--Brown, Black, and White--stood together as volunteers to defend the Alamo and help freedom ring in a part of the world that we call Texas. Mr. Speaker, I think you are probably old enough to have heard of Marty Robbins. Maybe you haven't. Marty Robbins, years ago, the singer, wrote a ballad in honor of the people who stayed and defied tyranny and gave their lives fighting for freedom, for Texas. It goes like this: In the southern part of Texas in the town of San Antone, There's a fortress all in ruin, and the weeds have overgrown. You may look in vain for crosses, and you'll never see a one, but sometime between the setting and the rising of the Sun, You can hear a ghostly bugle as men go marching by; You can hear them as they answer to that roll call in the sky: Colonel Travis, Davy Crockett, and 180 more; Captain Dickinson, Jim Bowie stand present and accounted for. Back in 1836, Sam Houston said to Travis, ``Get some volunteers, and go and fortify the Alamo.'' Well, the men came from Texas and from old Tennessee and a lot of other places. They joined up with Travis just to fight for the right to be free. Indian scouts with squirrel guns and men with muzzle loaders, Stood together, heel and toe, to defend the Alamo. ``You may never see your loved ones,'' Travis told them that day. ``Those who want to can leave now. Those who fight to the death, let 'em stay.'' So, in the sand, he drew a line with his army sabre; Out of 185, not a soldier crossed the line. With his banners a-dancin' in the dawn's golden light, Santa Anna came prancin' on a horse that was black as the night. He sent an officer to tell Travis to surrender. Travis answered with a shell and a rousin' yell. Santa Anna said, ``I will show them no quarter. Everyone will be put to our sword.'' 185 holding back 5,000. 5 days, 6 days, 8 days, 10 days, Travis kept holding again and again. Then Travis sent for replacements for his wounded and lame, But the troops that were comin' never came, never came. So twice Santa Anna charged and then blew recall, But on that fatal third time, Santa Anna breached the wall, and he killed them one and all. Now the bugles are silent, and there is rust on each sword, And the small band of soldiers lies asleep in the arms of the Lord. In the southern part of Texas, near the town of San Antone, Like a statue on his pinto rides a cowboy all alone. He sees the cattle grazin' where a century before, Santa Anna's guns were blazin' and the cannons used to roar. His eyes turn a little misty, and his heart begins to glow, And he takes his hat off slowly to those men of the Alamo, To the 13 days of glory at the siege of the Alamo. And that is just the way it is. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. ____________________",package_114_116.csv,25192,25192,25263,"[congressional record volume 161, number 31 (tuesday, february 24, 2015)] [house] [pages h1108-h1111] from the congressional record online through the government publishing office [ www.gpo.gov ] {time} 2015 remembering the alamo the speaker pro tempore (mr. grothman). under the speaker's announced policy of january 6, 2015, the gentleman from texas (mr. poe) is recognized for 60 minutes as the designee of the majority leader. mr. poe of texas. mr. speaker, it was in the cold, dark, damp, moldy walls of a beat-up old spanish mission that was already 100 years old at the time. he was a 27-year-old lawyer from south carolina and also from alabama. he was the commander of 187 volunteers from 13 countries and most of the states in then the united states. his men were surrounded by several thousand of the enemy. it was the alamo. it had been turned into a makeshift fort, and the commander was william barret travis. mr. speaker, he wrote the following letter 179 years ago this very night, february 24, 1836. it is entitled commander of the alamo, february 24, 1836: to all the people of texas and all americans in the world, fellow citizens and compatriots: i am besieged by a thousand or more of the mexicans under santa anna. i have sustained a continual bombardment and cannon fire for over 24 hours, but i have not lost a man. the enemy has demanded surrender at its discretion; otherwise, the fort will be put to the sword. i have answered that demand with a cannon shot, and the flag still waves proudly over the north wall. i shall never surrender or retreat. i call upon you in the name of liberty and patriotism and everything dear to our character to come to my aid with all dispatch. the enemy is receiving reinforcements daily and will no doubt increase to 3 or 4,000 in 4 or 5 days. if this call is neglected, i am determined to sustain myself for as long as possible and die like a soldier that never forgets his honor and that of his country. victory or death. signed, william barret travis, commander of the alamo.

[[page h1110]] that is what started the texas war of independence against mexico. you notice that the flag that is flying over the alamo is the mexican flag. the mexican eagle has been removed, and it has the date 1824 on it. that is the date that the republic of mexico established a constitution. the defenders of the alamo were hoping to reestablish a democracy in mexico, which texas was a part of. after the alamo fell, after 13 days and all 187 of the texans were killed, other texans went ahead and rallied for texas independence from mexico. as i said, the defenders of the alamo were from all races. nine, maybe 11 were tejanos. tejano is a uniquely texas name. those are individuals of mexican or spanish descent that were born in texas, thus the name tejano. the alamo was important for a lot of reasons, but, one, it stopped santa anna's invasion of texas. texas was one of several states in mexico that had rebelled against santa anna's dictatorship. on this other chart here, there are numerous states in mexico that were established, but several of those, including texas, coahuila y tejas, tamaulipas, nuevo leon, yucatan, all of them rebelled about the same time against mexico, in 1835, 1836, because santa anna established a dictatorship and abolished the democracy. none of these other states that rebelled were successful in creating independence except texas. santa anna used his army and went through his own country, destroying and defeating any resistance to his dictatorship, and he had taken all of these states back, so to speak, when he invaded what is now the state of texas. so he had well-seasoned troops when he came into the state of texas in 1836. it all started, really, in the year of 1835. in october of 1835, the mexican army had come upon a small town in gonzales, texas, and had demanded that the townspeople turn over to the mexican army a small cannon that they had to defend themselves from indians in the area. the locals, the texans, refused to turn over the cannon. they, in fact, made a flag. they called it the come and take it flag, that had a white background and then painted in a cannon that said, ``come and take it.'' that is the famous come and take it flag that was used, the first flag that was used in the texas war of independence. after a skirmish where several shots were fired by both sides--i don't think anybody was hurt very bad--the mexican army left, but most importantly they left without taking the arms, the cannon from the texas people who lived in gonzales. that was the spark that started the texas war of independence and revolution. there were several other skirmishes, and by february of 1836, travis and his band of volunteers had found themselves in the alamo to thwart the invasion of the larger army of santa anna that was coming from the south. their defense of the alamo for 13 days gave the rest of texas time to build another army to eventually fight santa anna. that army was, of course, led by general sam houston at the time. so they were in the alamo for many reasons, but the primary reason was to fight for liberty for texas and texas independence. when travis realized that he wasn't getting any aid except for a small band of individuals from gonzales, texas, that came and volunteered when travis sent out that first letter, he penned this letter on march 3, 1836. travis addressed his last letter to the council at washington-on-the- brazos that was not far from the alamo or san antonio, bexar--what it was called at that time--in hopes that they would understand his plight. his battered walls, according to t. r. fehrenbach, the noted texas historian, were still show defenses, still flew the flag. his men were on duty and in combat that day and every day and night. they were exhausted. travis expected no rescue, and he wrote, according to fehrenbach, apparently to stir his countrymen into action that the country might be saved. he was speaking of texas. here is what he said in that last letter: i shall have to fight the enemy on its own terms. i will do the best i can. the victory will cost the enemy so dear that it will be worse for him than defeat. i hope your honorable body will hasten reinforcements. our supply of ammunition is limited. god and texas. victory or death. william barret travis. then on march 6, 1836, a few days later, they were all killed in the alamo, even though they inflicted tremendous losses against the invasion by santa anna. but travis was right, victory would cost the enemy more than defeat. it did give sam houston and other texas volunteers enough time to assemble another army. not a large army, it was only 600 individuals. santa anna, still with a larger force, met sam houston and his 600 volunteers, which once again included men from several countries, included men from several states, and had numerous tejanos involved fighting from the side of the republic of texas, including juan seguin, captain seguin and his volunteers, his cavalry that was there. it is interesting to note that before the battle took place on april 21, 1836, on the plains of san jacinto--you have never heard of that, mr. speaker, but it is near what is now houston, texas, down on the gulf coast, in the marsh area--juan seguin made sure that he had all of his tejanos, the cavalry, put playing cards in the hatbands of their hats so that they wouldn't be mistaken for the enemy. in those days, apparently, the playing cards that were used to gamble were much larger than the small ones we have. so they placed these playing cards in their hatbands so they could be recognized as fighting on the side of the texas volunteers because, once again, they didn't wear uniforms. the battle that took place that travis was able to delay the army of santa anna in reaching this battle was an interesting military feat. most battles take place, have taken place throughout history, in the early hours of the day. at sunrise, two armies get together and fight it out. they have done that for thousands of years. even still today in world war ii, vietnam, battles were fought at dawn. {time} 2030 this battle--the battle of san jacinto--did not take place at dawn; it took place in the middle of the afternoon on april 21 because santa anna and his army were taking a siesta in the middle of the day. they didn't expect the battle until the next morning. sam houston and his other commanders didn't want to wait until the next day--the troops were getting restless, as they say--so they decided to have that battle in the afternoon. they lined up in a single column across the high ground and marched in broad daylight. santa anna had not put out pickets, so he had no one to warn him that the texans were charging. they came down the hill, and the battle began. in 18 minutes, mr. speaker, it was all over. santa anna had been completely defeated. more of the enemy were killed than were in the texas army. the rest were captured. only a handful--13 texans--were killed, and the battle lasted 18 minutes. santa anna was captured. he was pretending to change clothes, and he put on the uniform of a mexican private. he was captured and held. travis enters the alamo on february 23, 1836, and writes this famous letter. he and the defenders were killed on march 6. in between that, on march 2, 1836, texas had declared independence. then, just a few weeks later, on april 21, about 200 miles or so from the alamo, the battle of san jacinto took place. sam houston won that battle, and texas became a free and independent country. we have this map here, mr. speaker. you may not have seen something like this. this is what texas claimed when texas became an independent country--what is now modern-day texas--and you see that here on this map; but it also had claimed parts of oklahoma, kansas, new mexico, colorado, and parts of wyoming. texas claimed all of this area when texas became the republic of texas. sam houston was the first president of the republic of texas. texas was an independent country for 9 years, and then it decided to request to join the united states. even how texas joined the united states was an interesting phenomena. not all of the states wanted texas to become a part of the united states. finally, after several tries and failures to become a state in the united states, [[page h1111]] on a joint resolution--not a treaty--texas became a state in the united states by one vote when, apparently, a louisiana senator changed his mind and voted to annex texas and make it the next state in the united states. that took place in 1845. ever since then, texas gave up its sovereignty as a republic and became a state. some say that we still act like we are a foreign country, a sovereign country. under texas law that allowed it to become a part of the u.s., the texas flag always is supposed to fly level with the american flag, since we were a republic. texas can divide into five states. i don't ever see that happening, but texans can make that decision and split the state up to make it five different states. we have a unique history, as all of america has a unique history, and it goes back to the fact that texans did not want to live under a dictatorship no matter who it was. that is why people of all races were at the alamo. all races fought for texas independence, for freedom, and for liberty--very similar to the actions that took place with the thirteen colonies in how they were being oppressed by great britain. nobody ever thought they could whip great britain--the most powerful empire that had ever existed at the time--and very few people thought that texas could defeat mexico. after all, santa anna had defeated all of these other parts of mexico that were in rebellion. he had not lost any battles when he came and invaded texas. people were surprised that texas could defeat them, but it did because some things are worth fighting for and giving their lives for. that is why those 187 individuals from all walks of life, from different parts of the world--brown, black, and white--stood together as volunteers to defend the alamo and help freedom ring in a part of the world that we call texas. mr. speaker, i think you are probably old enough to have heard of marty robbins. maybe you haven't. marty robbins, years ago, the singer, wrote a ballad in honor of the people who stayed and defied tyranny and gave their lives fighting for freedom, for texas. it goes like this: in the southern part of texas in the town of san antone, there's a fortress all in ruin, and the weeds have overgrown. you may look in vain for crosses, and you'll never see a one, but sometime between the setting and the rising of the sun, you can hear a ghostly bugle as men go marching by; you can hear them as they answer to that roll call in the sky: colonel travis, davy crockett, and 180 more; captain dickinson, jim bowie stand present and accounted for. back in 1836, sam houston said to travis, ``get some volunteers, and go and fortify the alamo.'' well, the men came from texas and from old tennessee and a lot of other places. they joined up with travis just to fight for the right to be free. indian scouts with squirrel guns and men with muzzle loaders, stood together, heel and toe, to defend the alamo. ``you may never see your loved ones,'' travis told them that day. ``those who want to can leave now. those who fight to the death, let 'em stay.'' so, in the sand, he drew a line with his army sabre; out of 185, not a soldier crossed the line. with his banners a-dancin' in the dawn's golden light, santa anna came prancin' on a horse that was black as the night. he sent an officer to tell travis to surrender. travis answered with a shell and a rousin' yell. santa anna said, ``i will show them no quarter. everyone will be put to our sword.'' 185 holding back 5,000. 5 days, 6 days, 8 days, 10 days, travis kept holding again and again. then travis sent for replacements for his wounded and lame, but the troops that were comin' never came, never came. so twice santa anna charged and then blew recall, but on that fatal third time, santa anna breached the wall, and he killed them one and all. now the bugles are silent, and there is rust on each sword, and the small band of soldiers lies asleep in the arms of the lord. in the southern part of texas, near the town of san antone, like a statue on his pinto rides a cowboy all alone. he sees the cattle grazin' where a century before, santa anna's guns were blazin' and the cannons used to roar. his eyes turn a little misty, and his heart begins to glow, and he takes his hat off slowly to those men of the alamo, to the 13 days of glory at the siege of the alamo. and that is just the way it is. mr. speaker, i yield back the balance of my time. ____________________",25192

CREC-2015-02-24-pt1-PgS1037-4,CREC-2015-02-24,114,WELCOMING THE GUEST CHAPLAIN,"[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 31 (Tuesday, February 24, 2015)] [Senate] [Page S1037] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] WELCOMING THE GUEST CHAPLAIN Mr. BURR. Mr. President, I want to take 60 seconds before the two leaders speak to welcome a North Carolinian, Randy Cash, who was appointed the national chaplain of the American Legion on August 28, 2014, at their annual convention in Charlotte, which I attended, as well as the President. Randy is a native of North Carolina. He spent part of his life in Myrtle Beach, SC, but he attended a number of schools throughout the region. He was commissioned as a Navy chaplain in 1980 and he entered Active Service in 1983. He was assigned to Destroyer Squadron Six out of Charleston, SC. His next tour was staff chaplain, Naval Education and Training Center in Newport, RI, and his life continued from spot to spot.

Mr. President, I move to proceed to H.R. 240. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the motion. The senior assistant legislative clerk read as follows: Motion to proceed to Calendar No. 5, H.R. 240, a bill making appropriations for the Department of Homeland Security for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2015, and for other purposes. Keystone Bill Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, the Congress is sending the President of the United States another piece of bipartisan legislation today. Americans of both parties are calling on him to sign it. There is no good reason not to. The Keystone jobs bill is just common sense. Construction of this important infrastructure project would support thousands of American jobs. It would pump billions into our economy and the President's own State Department [[Page S1038]] told us this could be achieved with minimal--minimal--environmental impact. That is why this jobs and infrastructure bill passed both Houses of Congress with bipartisan support. I know powerful special interests and political extremists are pressuring the President to veto American jobs. I hope President Obama will join with us in standing for the middle class instead. It is hard to even imagine what a serious justification for a veto might be. Excuses related to the review process obviously won't work, since this bipartisan bill is a solution for fixing a review the Obama administration broke as it ignored deadlines and interfered for political reasons. Plus, the President has called on Congress to send him infrastructure projects, and Keystone is an important infrastructure project that is shovel ready. Americans are urging President Obama to finally heed scientific conclusions his own State Department already reached. There is no reason for the President to ignore that science any longer. Republicans and Democrats, labor unions and businesses--we are all calling on him to finally allow American workers to build an infrastructure project that just makes good sense. Mr. President, last night I took action to allow the Senate to consider commonsense legislation that every Democrat should want to support. This targeted measure would address the President's most recent overreach from November. The bill isn't tied to DHS funding. There is no excuse for our friends on the other side to oppose it. That is especially true of the Democrats who led their constituents to believe they would stand up for democratic principles in this debate. These colleagues have hidden behind all manner of excuses to avoid upsetting the far left. Well, this bill removes the excuses and it sets up a simple political equation: Either stand in defense of extreme overreach or stand with constituents in support of shared democratic values. As I have said already, my preference remains with the legislation that has already passed the House. It is still the simplest way forward. But as long as Democrats continue to prevent us from even debating that bill, I am ready to try another way. I hope our friends across the aisle will demonstrate similar flexibility. I am calling on Senators of good faith to work with us and move the bill forward as quickly as possible. So let's get to work. Recognition Of The Minority Leader The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democratic leader is recognized. Mr. REID. Mr. President, I do appreciate--and that is an understatement--what the majority leader has to go through to try to please the extreme voices on his side. The fact remains we are 4 very short days away from a Homeland Security shutdown--a shutdown, Mr. President. We have a couple of bills on the floor that, unless there is unanimous consent, we can't get to in 4 days. Funding expires on Friday, yet last night the majority leader moved to bring a bill to the floor that does absolutely nothing to fund Homeland Security--nothing. If the majority leader wanted a vote on this bill, he shouldn't have wasted a month repeating the same failed procedural vote four times with the same result. Albert Einstein said that is the definition of insanity, when you keep doing the same thing over and over again, getting the same result. We have said all along that we are more than happy to have an immigration debate once Homeland Security is funded. Nevada so badly needs full funding of Homeland Security. State and local governments demand full funding of Homeland Security. It is not only for Nevada, it is all across the country, because the homeland cannot be protected the way the law is now set up unless the Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security has the ability to grant. If there is full funding, it would be almost $2 billion worth of programs to allow the homeland to be protected by State and local governments. So we are happy to have a debate on immigration, but we have to fully fund Homeland Security. We have said that all along. We have said it not once, not twice, but we have said it many different times. In fact, there was a proposal brought to the Senate floor 3 weeks ago, sponsored by Senators Mikulski and Shaheen, only to have the Republicans object to that. We want a debate on immigration. We are happy to have a debate on immigration. We are eager to debate immigration now or any other time, but we can't do that until we fully fund the Department of Homeland Security. We have been saying that for 4 weeks and nothing has changed in the last 24 hours. The majority leader should allow a vote on the Mikulski-Shaheen funding, which is sitting on the floor right now. It is on the calendar. That is the only way to resolve this mess which the Republicans created. The only thing that can pass the Senate is a clean bill to fund Homeland Security. And then, once that is done, there is a consent pending here on the Senate floor that says once that is done and the President signs that, we will be happy to debate immigration for whatever time the Republicans deem necessary. Would the Chair announce the business of the day. Reservation Of Leader Time The PRESIDING OFFICER.

keystone jobs bill is just common sense. construction of this important infrastructure project would support thousands of american jobs. it would pump billions into our economy and the president's own state department [[page s1038]] told us this could be achieved with minimal--minimal--environmental impact. that is why this jobs and infrastructure bill passed both houses of congress with bipartisan support. i know powerful special interests and political extremists are pressuring the president to veto american jobs. i hope president obama will join with us in standing for the middle class instead. it is hard to even imagine what a serious justification for a veto might be. excuses related to the review process obviously won't work, since this bipartisan bill is a solution for fixing a review the obama administration broke as it ignored deadlines and interfered for political reasons. plus, the president has called on congress to send him infrastructure projects, and keystone is an important infrastructure project that is shovel ready. americans are urging president obama to finally heed scientific conclusions his own state department already reached. there is no reason for the president to ignore that science any longer. republicans and democrats, labor unions and businesses--we are all calling on him to finally allow american workers to build an infrastructure project that just makes good sense. mr. president, last night i took action to allow the senate to consider commonsense legislation that every democrat should want to support. this targeted measure would address the president's most recent overreach from november. the bill isn't tied to dhs funding. there is no excuse for our friends on the other side to oppose it. that is especially true of the democrats who led their constituents to believe they would stand up for democratic principles in this debate. these colleagues have hidden behind all manner of excuses to avoid upsetting the far left. well, this bill removes the excuses and it sets up a simple political equation: either stand in defense of extreme overreach or stand with constituents in support of shared democratic values. as i have said already, my preference remains with the legislation that has already passed the house. it is still the simplest way forward. but as long as democrats continue to prevent us from even debating that bill, i am ready to try another way. i hope our friends across the aisle will demonstrate similar flexibility. i am calling on senators of good faith to work with us and move the bill forward as quickly as possible. so let's get to work. recognition of the minority leader the presiding officer. the democratic leader is recognized. mr. reid. mr. president, i do appreciate--and that is an understatement--what the majority leader has to go through to try to please the extreme voices on his side. the fact remains we are 4 very short days away from a homeland security shutdown--a shutdown, mr. president. we have a couple of bills on the floor that, unless there is unanimous consent, we can't get to in 4 days. funding expires on friday, yet last night the majority leader moved to bring a bill to the floor that does absolutely nothing to fund homeland security--nothing. if the majority leader wanted a vote on this bill, he shouldn't have wasted a month repeating the same failed procedural vote four times with the same result. albert einstein said that is the definition of insanity, when you keep doing the same thing over and over again, getting the same result. we have said all along that we are more than happy to have an immigration debate once homeland security is funded. nevada so badly needs full funding of homeland security. state and local governments demand full funding of homeland security. it is not only for nevada, it is all across the country, because the homeland cannot be protected the way the law is now set up unless the secretary of the department of homeland security has the ability to grant. if there is full funding, it would be almost $2 billion worth of programs to allow the homeland to be protected by state and local governments. so we are happy to have a debate on immigration, but we have to fully fund homeland security. we have said that all along. we have said it not once, not twice, but we have said it many different times. in fact, there was a proposal brought to the senate floor 3 weeks ago, sponsored by senators mikulski and shaheen, only to have the republicans object to that. we want a debate on immigration. we are happy to have a debate on immigration. we are eager to debate immigration now or any other time, but we can't do that until we fully fund the department of homeland security. we have been saying that for 4 weeks and nothing has changed in the last 24 hours. the majority leader should allow a vote on the mikulski-shaheen funding, which is sitting on the floor right now. it is on the calendar. that is the only way to resolve this mess which the republicans created. the only thing that can pass the senate is a clean bill to fund homeland security. and then, once that is done, there is a consent pending here on the senate floor that says once that is done and the president signs that, we will be happy to debate immigration for whatever time the republicans deem necessary. would the chair announce the business of the day. reservation of leader time the presiding officer. under the previous order, the leadership time is reserved. ____________________",6397

CREC-2015-02-24-pt1-PgS1038-2,CREC-2015-02-24,114,DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY FUNDING,"[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 31 (Tuesday, February 24, 2015)] [Senate] [Pages S1038-S1041] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY FUNDING Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, by calculation, we have today and 3 more days before the Department of Homeland Security is shut down. Think about what happened this last weekend all across America. It was disclosed publicly that an extremist group, a terrorist group--Al- Shabab--had some communication among their membership targeting malls in America for extremism and terrorism. God forbid that ever happens. I know those who are managing these malls look at the terrible situation that occurred in Africa and want to make certain it is never repeated anywhere, let alone in the United States. They are making extraordinary efforts to protect people across America, not only as they are shopping in malls but in other places, as they should. What is the lead agency to protect America against terrorism? What is the lead agency to make sure we never ever again in our history experience 9/11? The Department of Homeland Security. That Department was created after 9/11, because we felt the way we were protecting America wasn't good enough. We took 22 different Federal agencies and put them under the roof of the Department of Homeland Security and said to that Department: Now focus; focus all your time and efforts to keep us safe. They have done a good job. I am sure they have made some mistakes along the way, but they have really dedicated themselves--all the men and women who work there--to keeping America safe. Now what has Congress done for the Department of Homeland Security? Last December, when we considered the appropriations--the budget--for the Department of Homeland Security, the Republicans insisted we take that Department out of the regular budget process and give it only temporary funding, a continuing resolution--temporary funding--which limits the authority of the Secretary of Homeland Security to do his best job to keep America safe. Why would the Republicans pick this appropriation, the single appropriation to keep America safe from terrorism and decide they don't want to properly fund it? They are only giving it temporary funding and a continuing resolution because they disagree with President Obama's position on immigration. That is it. They want this issue of immigration, separate and apart from the budget of the Homeland Security, to be debated, and they insist they will not fund the Department of Homeland Security until it is debated. So come February [[Page S1039]] 27, in just a few days, this Department of Homeland Security is going to shut down. It is going to shut down. Many of the employees are essential. They will be asked to come to work even though there is only a promise of a paycheck, and they will show up because they are loyal to this country and they want to do their job to keep it safe. Why won't the Senate and the House do its job? Why can't we pass a clean appropriations bill for the Department of Homeland Security? Before we took a break last week for President's week I made a unanimous consent request on the floor to do just that-- pass a clean appropriations bill for the Department of Homeland Security. The majority leader, Senator McConnell of Kentucky, objected. He objected to funding the Department of Homeland Security. I don't understand it. It doesn't make sense for us to put in jeopardy the security of America over a political debate on immigration. What is ironic is that now that the Republicans have the majority control of the House and the Senate they can call any bill they wish. After funding the Department of Homeland Security, they can turn immediately to a debate on immigration. It is their right. They pick the topics, they dictate the calendar, and those of us in the minority have to accede to their wishes. They are in the majority. They are controlling, but still Speaker Boehner and Senator McConnell, the Republican majority leader, refuse to pass a clean appropriations bill to the Department of Homeland Security. Luckily some Republicans are stepping up and saying this is wrong. I commend the following Senators on the Republican side who have publicly stated that Congress should pass a clean Homeland Security bill and stop this tactic that came from the House of Representatives. Those Senators include: Senator Dean Heller of Nevada, Senator Mark Kirk of Illinois, Senators Jeff Flake and John McCain of Arizona, Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, and Senator Ron Johnson of Wisconsin. We need eight more Republican Senators to come forward and say we need a clean appropriations bill and we need to pass it now. If eight Republican Senators today will say that, then we can move forward and pass this bill. We can fund this Department and stop this gamesmanship. Then, if the leaders want to move to a debate on immigration, so be it. But let's have eight more Republicans step forward and join us to make this a reality. I don't understand, frankly, the thinking of many of the Republicans who oppose the President's approach to immigration. Here is what it comes down to. If the President used every penny given to him by Congress to deport those who are undocumented in the United States, he could reach about 4 percent of those who are eligible for deportation-- 4 percent. What the President has said is: Let me focus then on deporting those who are most dangerous to the United States. President Obama has said there are people who have been here for years. They are part of our communities. They have good jobs. They have raised families. They go to our churches. We see them every day. They are no threat to us. Let's focus on deporting those who are dangerous-- the felons, the criminals. The President has basically said we shouldn't set out to deport families, we ought to deport felons. We shouldn't set out to deport children, we ought to deport criminals. So his priority is deportation of those most dangerous to the United States, and the Republicans have opposed that. Why? Primarily because the President supports it. It has reached that point in the debate. It is so divisive. The President doesn't want to waste any resources in deporting those who are not dangerous. He wants to get those who are dangerous out of the United States first, and Republicans object to that. There is something else they want to do too. The House of Representatives wants to challenge the President's right to Executive orders when it comes to prioritizing those who can stay in the United States. Several years ago at the request of 20 or more Senators, the President initiated an Executive action known as DACA. This Executive action said that if someone qualified as a DREAMer, they would be allowed to stay without threat of deportation. We estimate that 2 million young people in America would qualify as DREAMers, and 600,000 have this protection now. What the Republicans want to do in the House of Representatives is to eliminate this. Who are these young people? They are young folks in America brought to this country as toddlers and infants, young boys and girls who grew up in this country, went to school in this country, have no problems in their criminal record and want to be part of America. That is it. What the Republicans have said in the House is we want to deport these people--deport them because they are here undocumented, despite the fact that we have educated them and many of them are successes in life and want to be part of our future. The Republicans have said deport them. The senior Senator from Maine has authored a bill to address this subject, but as much as I respect her and count her as a friend, it falls short of protecting the DREAMers who are in this country under DACA. I have to say that as one learns the stories of those who are protected by the President's Executive order, we wonder what are the Republicans thinking. I have tried to tell these stories in light of individuals, not statistics, and here is one I wish to tell everyone today. It is about a young man who came to America when he was 9 years old from Thailand. His name is Jirayut New. He was brought here at the age of 9 from Thailand by his parents. He grew up in San Francisco and he said: I forced myself to read mystery novels, dictionary in hand, in order to expand my vocabulary, one word at a time. I mispronounced words, even in the face of ridicule, until I mastered the English language. It is amazing. These stories have happened many times in the past, but it is incredible to think of a 9-year-old facing that ridicule but learning the English language in San Francisco. This young man became an excellent student and his dream was to be a doctor. Throughout high school New worked 30 hours a week in his family's Thai restaurant. Here is what he said about that experience: I spent most of my time in the restaurant working as a waiter, cashier and chef, scrubbing toilets, washing dishes, and mopping floors. It taught me to have faith, work hard, and persevere. His work paid off. He graduated salutatorian of his high school class with a 4.3 grade point average. He was admitted to the University of California at Berkeley, one of the top schools in California and the Nation. He won a scholarship that would have covered most of his tuition, but he couldn't accept it because he was undocumented. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired. Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for 2 additional minutes. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. DURBIN. Despite this setback, New persevered. In May of 2012 he graduated with honors from Berkeley with a 3.7 grade point average and a major in molecular and cellular biology. One month after he graduated, President Obama issued his Executive order, DACA, and now New was protected from deportation. As a result he was able to pursue his dream to become a doctor. Last fall New went to medical school at the University of California in San Francisco. Now what does he do in his spare time as a medical student? He volunteers at a homeless clinic run by students at the University of California in San Francisco. He has cofounded Pre-Health Dreamers, a national network of more than 400 DREAMers who are pursuing careers in health care. New and other similar DREAMers have so much to contribute to America. But if the Republicans have their way, this man is going to be deported. Instead of being able to stay in the United States as a doctor, to realize his life's dream and make this a better and stronger nation, he will be deported. Will America be better or worse if this young man leaves? I think the answer is obvious. So why do the Republicans persist? Why are they determined to take this amazing young man and deport him? They have forgotten our legacy in [[Page S1040]] America. We are a nation of immigrants, and our immigrants have come to this country from all over the world because they appreciate the values and opportunity of America. I am lucky. My mother was an immigrant to this country, and I stand on the Senate floor representing the great State of Illinois. It is my story, my family's story, and it is America's story. The time is clearly upon us to fund the appropriations of the Department of Homeland Security but not at the expense of this amazing young man. Let us fund this Department to keep America safe but also let us dedicate ourselves to passing legislation which fixes our broken immigration system and helps this young man and others like him to be a part of America's future. I yield the floor. Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I may speak for 15 minutes. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, before the Senator from Illinois leaves the floor, I just want to thank him for his amazing leadership on this whole issue of immigration. The Senator and I share a similar background because my mother also was an immigrant, and the thought of our moms being ripped out of our lives is just untenable. We are not going to let it happen. I wish to thank him so much because he has been, I would say, the grandfather of the whole DREAMer movement. So thank you, Senator. We all know Republicans won in huge numbers in the 2014 election and they took over the Senate and they run it. They run it--or at least they are trying to run it. Let's be clear. Less than 8 weeks after they took over the Senate we are facing a shutdown, a shutdown of the very agency that protects the health, the safety, the lives of the American people--the Department of Homeland Security. We are 4 days away, and even if they come up with a continuing resolution, a small little patch, they are shutting down the programs that fund our firefighters and our first responders back home. So any way we look at it, this is a national disgrace. Think about what our friends abroad and those who are not our friends are thinking about this. Republicans say we are in danger. We have to go to war, put combat troops on the ground. But they are willing to shut down the Department that protects Americans in the homeland from a terrorist attack. This is a self-inflicted crisis made up by the Republicans. It is dangerous. It is the height of irresponsibility and it is unnecessary. Let me tell you, how does it make sense in the very same week that terrorists are threatening our shopping malls that we would shut down the very agency charged with protecting those malls? How does it make sense at a time when we are facing serious threats to our national security to furlough 30,000 Department of Homeland Security workers and to force more than 100,000 frontline Homeland Security personnel to work without pay? Why don't these Senators go without their pay? Give up your pay. Do you want to come to work every day and stand there and look for threats to our homeland and worry about how you are going to pay the bills for your kids? Go without pay before you do this. You tell me how that makes sense not to pay people who are in charge of our security. It is a disgrace. Give up your pay--give up your pay, give up your health care, give up your benefits, if this is so important to you. Oh, no. They will collect their pay. Tell me, how does it make sense to shut off the grants that protect our cities, our ports from terrorist attacks, and how does it make sense to stop local communities from being able to hire police officers and firefighters? The Department of Homeland Security is very large. When it was created I was troubled by that because it includes so many important things in one department, including FEMA. So when we have a natural disaster such as an earthquake, fire or flood, that is the Department that deals with it. How does it make sense to disrupt disaster recovery operations such as the efforts in California to recover from our devastating Napa Earthquake and the Rim Fire in Yosemite? So not only are they disrupting Homeland Security and the protections of our perhaps most-targeted places in America, but they are disrupting recovery from natural disasters, and God forbid if we have another one. And the reason they are throwing a hissy fit is because the President stepped in and has a policy to take care of immigration. Why did the President step in? Because Republicans refused to take up a bipartisan bill, pass it, and take care of the immigration problem the way they are supposed to. They are paralyzed on that point. They cannot do it. We had a bill that garnered 68 votes in the last Congress. All they have to do is bring it up, pass it here, and then pass it in the House. It will pass with overwhelming majorities. The President will sign it, and that would make his Executive order unnecessary. The only reason he issued an Executive order is that we are facing a crisis in this country. There are 11 million undocumented folks. Some of those undocumented folks are DREAMers. To me, that is the most important category. They are young people who were brought here when they were children. They know no other home. All they want to do is stay here and give back to America. Republicans want to deport them and their parents. They want to deport the parents of American citizens. I thank God these people were not in charge of Congress when I was growing up or else they might have deported my mother. It took her awhile to get through her naturalization. What if they passed something such as what the Republicans are proposing? I thought they were the party of family values. Show me where that is true--ripping families apart. I thought they were the party of economic prosperity. Show me how that is true when we know from study after study that one of the greatest things we can do for our economy and job creation is to get people out of the shadows so they can go and buy a home and hold a good job. They can't or won't pass an immigration bill. They will not do their job. So when the President steps in and does his job, they say: Oh, this is terrible. Let's shut down a totally unrelated department, the Department of Homeland Security. Again I say, let's look at fiscal responsibility. According to the Center for American Progress, it would cost more than $50 billion to deport the entire population that the President is protecting. And here is the deal: I never heard a Republican--and I will stand corrected if any Republican corrects me--complain when President Eisenhower used his Executive power to help immigrants or when President Nixon did the same thing to protect immigrants or when President Ronald Reagan, their hero, protected immigrants or when George Bush, Sr., protected immigrants or when George W. Bush protected immigrants. They all used their authority. Show me one Republican who stood up and said: This is outrageous. Let's impeach the President. But they are annoyed because it is President Obama, and he won twice. Sorry. Wake up and smell the roses. He is the President, and he is doing the right thing for America because he loves America and he understands that these people, who the Republicans want to deport, are going to help America move on to an era of greatness and keep us going. Let's look at some of the young people Republicans want to deport. Alexis Bux is a 21-year-old student from central California. He is the oldest of three siblings. His younger two siblings were born in the United States, but he was not. So these great family-value Republicans want to rip away the oldest child from this family. His parents were farm workers in the fields of San Joaquin Valley. Alexis received immigration relief under DACA in 2012, and he will transfer to UC San Diego this fall where he will pursue his dream of a career in biomedical engineering. Tell me, Republicans, how our country is better off when you deport a young man such as him. He hopes to use his education to develop a sophisticated medical application and tools that will help cure deadly diseases. All he wants to do is contribute to the Nation he loves. If the Republicans had their way, they would deport people such as Ana Albarran, who left Mexico at age 8. She came to this country with her younger [[Page S1041]] brother and sister to join her parents. Her parents worked 11 hours a day as trimmers for a landscaping company in downtown Los Angeles. After Ana received immigration relief, she felt confident enough to begin applying for jobs, and now she is finishing her final year at UC Merced so she can begin her career as a bilingual first grade teacher. Tell me, Republicans, how does it make sense to deport people such as Ana and split her up from her parents when all they want to do is contribute to the country they love? How does it make sense just because you are too incompetent to hold a vote on your immigration plan? If you want to kick people out of the country, put it to a vote. Let's go. If you want to deport 11 million people, then put it to a vote. Don't hide behind the Homeland Security bill and hold the President's work hostage. You never did it to the other Presidents. Don't do it to this President. How does it make sense to deport these moms, these dads, and these young kids? I mentioned before that I am the daughter of an immigrant mother. I tried to think of what my life would have been like without my mother. She gave me my conscience. She gave me my values. She gave me all the love and support I needed to pursue my dreams. I am the daughter of an immigrant mother who never graduated from high school. I am a Senator in the U.S. Senate. But they would have deported my mother. I would not be here today if it were not for my mom. So tell me how it makes sense to deport moms and dads and rip apart the lives of children. Our national security is at stake, our family values are at stake, and our economy is at stake here. So get over the fact that you don't like the President. We get it. You couldn't beat him. It is too bad for you. You are in charge here in the Senate. Do your job. Bring an immigration bill to the floor. Let's let this Homeland Security bill go. It is a bipartisan bill. It is funding for the most important issue we are dealing with today. Let's get to it. Don't hold it hostage because of your hatred of this President--and I use that word because that is what I think. That is what I think. In California alone, the President's Executive actions could boost California's economy by as much as $27.5 billion. The President's action will aid our economy. It will raise the Nation's gross domestic product by up to $90 billion over the next 10 years by expanding the labor force and allowing immigrant workers the flexibility to seek new jobs. Why is that the case? Why does every independent study show us this is the case? The reason is simple. When workers come out of the shadows, their wages rise, they open bank accounts, buy homes, start businesses, and spend money in their communities. So I say this to my Republican friends. There is a Presidential race coming up. Forget the last one. Get over it. Let's work together. Listen, I served with five Presidents. I am a strong Democrat. Everyone will tell you that. But I have respect for the office of the Presidency. If I didn't agree with Ronald Reagan, I came down here and said it. We had respect back and forth. If we lost, we lost, and we moved on. That went both ways. I know how it feels not to like the policies of a President. I get it. But don't overdo it and make it so personal. Get on with it. Grow up. Do your job. Have respect for the Office of the President. Don't suddenly say Executive orders are bad when the President you don't like does it, but you don't say one word when a Republican President does the same thing. It doesn't pass the smell test. Three things could not be more important in this battle. We need to fund our Department of Homeland Security--especially when we are facing serious threats to our security. We need to uphold our family values and not split up loving families, and we need to protect and grow our economy. We can do this in the simplest way. First, I say to House Speaker Boehner--because under the Constitution all funding bills start in the House: Send us a clean bill. Send us the bill that everybody supported before you took it hostage on this immigration issue. Send it over clean. Let's fund everything in that bill to protect our shopping malls, to give grants to our first responders, and to give grants to our local fire departments. Send it over. We will pass it, and immediately following that, we will bring up an immigration bill. We have it all ready for you. It passed with 68 votes. There is not much work to do. If you do that, the President's Executive order will not be necessary because we will have taken the steps ourselves to fix our broken immigration system. Let's stop the lawsuits. We have one judge who said there was overreach, but the next judge may say there is no overreach. Let's keep this out of the courts. Let's do our job. Let's stop the self-inflicted crisis. Let's stop the shadow that is hanging over the Nation. Let's do the right thing here. We can protect the American people from threats to our national security. We can protect and grow our economy, and we can treat hard- working immigrants and their families with the dignity and respect they deserve. It all lies in the hands of Speaker Boehner and Leader McConnell. When you took over the Senate, you said: no more threats of shutdowns. Eight weeks later--not even 8 weeks--we are facing a shutdown of one of the most important departments. This is a disgrace, and it is self-inflicted. All you have to do is talk to Speaker Boehner. Send over a clean bill so we can vote on it. Then we will take up immigration, and you can show us all your great ideas on immigration. Let's hear it. Do you want to deport the DREAMers? Come on with it, and we will have a vote. You want to deport the parents? Come on with it, and we will have a vote. You want to kick 11 million people out of this country? Come on with it, and we will have a vote and debate on it. But don't hold the Department of Homeland Security hostage because of this issue. If there is one thing the American people hate more than anything else, it is attaching unrelated matters to spending bills. I don't care if they are conservative Republicans or liberal Democrats or Independent voters. They think it is the dumbest idea. They really do. They don't understand it. Pass your funding bills. Then battle your ideological issues separately and apart from that. Don't hold these departments hostage to your decision that President Obama did the wrong thing. If you don't like what he did, put forward your own bill. You have not even done that. I have been here a long time. I will tell you something. I have never seen anything like this. It is a self-inflicted wound. Who gets hurt? Not the Republicans--they will keep getting their pay. They are fine. The people who will be hurt are those whom we trust and count on and the families that thought they could stay together. They are on the verge of that. That is what this party--the Grand Old Party, the GOP-- have brought to us, but they can get out of it in 5 minutes. Speaker Boehner can pass a funding bill that will pass in a heartbeat. Send it over here, and we will pass it, turn to immigration, and then we can have it out on that subject. I think it is worthy of a debate. But don't hold an important funding bill hostage to that debate. It is ridiculous, unnecessary, destructive, and cruel. With that, I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Flake). Without objection, it is so ordered. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 31 (Tuesday, February 24, 2015)] [Senate] [Pages S1038-S1041] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY FUNDING Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, by calculation, we have today and 3 more days before the Department of Homeland Security is shut down. Think about what happened this last weekend all across America. It was disclosed publicly that an extremist group, a terrorist group--Al- Shabab--had some communication among their membership targeting malls in America for extremism and terrorism. God forbid that ever happens. I know those who are managing these malls look at the terrible situation that occurred in Africa and want to make certain it is never repeated anywhere, let alone in the United States. They are making extraordinary efforts to protect people across America, not only as they are shopping in malls but in other places, as they should. What is the lead agency to protect America against terrorism? What is the lead agency to make sure we never ever again in our history experience 9/11? The Department of Homeland Security. That Department was created after 9/11, because we felt the way we were protecting America wasn't good enough. We took 22 different Federal agencies and put them under the roof of the Department of Homeland Security and said to that Department: Now focus; focus all your time and efforts to keep us safe. They have done a good job. I am sure they have made some mistakes along the way, but they have really dedicated themselves--all the men and women who work there--to keeping America safe. Now what has Congress done for the Department of Homeland Security? Last December, when we considered the appropriations--the budget--for the Department of Homeland Security, the Republicans insisted we take that Department out of the regular budget process and give it only temporary funding, a continuing resolution--temporary funding--which limits the authority of the Secretary of Homeland Security to do his best job to keep America safe. Why would the Republicans pick this appropriation, the single appropriation to keep America safe from terrorism and decide they don't want to properly fund it? They are only giving it temporary funding and a continuing resolution because they disagree with President Obama's position on immigration. That is it. They want this issue of immigration, separate and apart from the budget of the Homeland Security, to be debated, and they insist they will not fund the Department of Homeland Security until it is debated. So come February [[Page S1039]] 27, in just a few days, this Department of Homeland Security is going to shut down. It is going to shut down. Many of the employees are essential. They will be asked to come to work even though there is only a promise of a paycheck, and they will show up because they are loyal to this country and they want to do their job to keep it safe. Why won't the Senate and the House do its job? Why can't we pass a clean appropriations bill for the Department of Homeland Security? Before we took a break last week for President's week I made a unanimous consent request on the floor to do just that-- pass a clean appropriations bill for the Department of Homeland Security. The majority leader, Senator McConnell of Kentucky, objected. He objected to funding the Department of Homeland Security. I don't understand it. It doesn't make sense for us to put in jeopardy the security of America over a political debate on immigration. What is ironic is that now that the Republicans have the majority control of the House and the Senate they can call any bill they wish. After funding the Department of Homeland Security, they can turn immediately to a debate on immigration. It is their right. They pick the topics, they dictate the calendar, and those of us in the minority have to accede to their wishes. They are in the majority. They are controlling, but still Speaker Boehner and Senator McConnell, the Republican majority leader, refuse to pass a clean appropriations bill to the Department of Homeland Security. Luckily some Republicans are stepping up and saying this is wrong. I commend the following Senators on the Republican side who have publicly stated that Congress should pass a clean Homeland Security bill and stop this tactic that came from the House of Representatives. Those Senators include: Senator Dean Heller of Nevada, Senator Mark Kirk of Illinois, Senators Jeff Flake and John McCain of Arizona, Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, and Senator Ron Johnson of Wisconsin. We need eight more Republican Senators to come forward and say we need a clean appropriations bill and we need to pass it now. If eight Republican Senators today will say that, then we can move forward and pass this bill. We can fund this Department and stop this gamesmanship. Then, if the leaders want to move to a debate on immigration, so be it. But let's have eight more Republicans step forward and join us to make this a reality. I don't understand, frankly, the thinking of many of the Republicans who oppose the President's approach to immigration. Here is what it comes down to. If the President used every penny given to him by Congress to deport those who are undocumented in the United States, he could reach about 4 percent of those who are eligible for deportation-- 4 percent. What the President has said is: Let me focus then on deporting those who are most dangerous to the United States. President Obama has said there are people who have been here for years. They are part of our communities. They have good jobs. They have raised families. They go to our churches. We see them every day. They are no threat to us. Let's focus on deporting those who are dangerous-- the felons, the criminals. The President has basically said we shouldn't set out to deport families, we ought to deport felons. We shouldn't set out to deport children, we ought to deport criminals. So his priority is deportation of those most dangerous to the United States, and the Republicans have opposed that. Why? Primarily because the President supports it. It has reached that point in the debate. It is so divisive. The President doesn't want to waste any resources in deporting those who are not dangerous. He wants to get those who are dangerous out of the United States first, and Republicans object to that. There is something else they want to do too. The House of Representatives wants to challenge the President's right to Executive orders when it comes to prioritizing those who can stay in the United States. Several years ago at the request of 20 or more Senators, the President initiated an Executive action known as DACA. This Executive action said that if someone qualified as a DREAMer, they would be allowed to stay without threat of deportation. We estimate that 2 million young people in America would qualify as DREAMers, and 600,000 have this protection now. What the Republicans want to do in the House of Representatives is to eliminate this. Who are these young people? They are young folks in America brought to this country as toddlers and infants, young boys and girls who grew up in this country, went to school in this country, have no problems in their criminal record and want to be part of America. That is it. What the Republicans have said in the House is we want to deport these people--deport them because they are here undocumented, despite the fact that we have educated them and many of them are successes in life and want to be part of our future. The Republicans have said deport them. The senior Senator from Maine has authored a bill to address this subject, but as much as I respect her and count her as a friend, it falls short of protecting the DREAMers who are in this country under DACA. I have to say that as one learns the stories of those who are protected by the President's Executive order, we wonder what are the Republicans thinking. I have tried to tell these stories in light of individuals, not statistics, and here is one I wish to tell everyone today. It is about a young man who came to America when he was 9 years old from Thailand. His name is Jirayut New. He was brought here at the age of 9 from Thailand by his parents. He grew up in San Francisco and he said: I forced myself to read mystery novels, dictionary in hand, in order to expand my vocabulary, one word at a time. I mispronounced words, even in the face of ridicule, until I mastered the English language. It is amazing. These stories have happened many times in the past, but it is incredible to think of a 9-year-old facing that ridicule but learning the English language in San Francisco. This young man became an excellent student and his dream was to be a doctor. Throughout high school New worked 30 hours a week in his family's Thai restaurant. Here is what he said about that experience: I spent most of my time in the restaurant working as a waiter, cashier and chef, scrubbing toilets, washing dishes, and mopping floors. It taught me to have faith, work hard, and persevere. His work paid off. He graduated salutatorian of his high school class with a 4.3 grade point average. He was admitted to the University of California at Berkeley, one of the top schools in California and the Nation. He won a scholarship that would have covered most of his tuition, but he couldn't accept it because he was undocumented. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired. Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for 2 additional minutes. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. DURBIN. Despite this setback, New persevered. In May of 2012 he graduated with honors from Berkeley with a 3.7 grade point average and a major in molecular and cellular biology. One month after he graduated, President Obama issued his Executive order, DACA, and now New was protected from deportation. As a result he was able to pursue his dream to become a doctor. Last fall New went to medical school at the University of California in San Francisco. Now what does he do in his spare time as a medical student? He volunteers at a homeless clinic run by students at the University of California in San Francisco. He has cofounded Pre-Health Dreamers, a national network of more than 400 DREAMers who are pursuing careers in health care. New and other similar DREAMers have so much to contribute to America. But if the Republicans have their way, this man is going to be deported. Instead of being able to stay in the United States as a doctor, to realize his life's dream and make this a better and stronger nation, he will be deported. Will America be better or worse if this young man leaves? I think the answer is obvious. So why do the Republicans persist? Why are they determined to take this amazing young man and deport him? They have forgotten our legacy in [[Page S1040]] America. We are a nation of immigrants, and our immigrants have come to this country from all over the world because they appreciate the values and opportunity of America. I am lucky. My mother was an immigrant to this country, and I stand on the Senate floor representing the great State of Illinois. It is my story, my family's story, and it is America's story. The time is clearly upon us to fund the appropriations of the Department of Homeland Security but not at the expense of this amazing young man. Let us fund this Department to keep America safe but also let us dedicate ourselves to passing legislation which fixes our broken immigration system and helps this young man and others like him to be a part of America's future. I yield the floor. Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I may speak for 15 minutes. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, before the Senator from Illinois leaves the floor, I just want to thank him for his amazing leadership on this whole issue of immigration. The Senator and I share a similar background because my mother also was an immigrant, and the thought of our moms being ripped out of our lives is just untenable. We are not going to let it happen. I wish to thank him so much because he has been, I would say, the grandfather of the whole DREAMer movement. So thank you, Senator. We all know Republicans won in huge numbers in the 2014 election and they took over the Senate and they run it. They run it--or at least they are trying to run it. Let's be clear. Less than 8 weeks after they took over the Senate we are facing a shutdown, a shutdown of the very agency that protects the health, the safety, the lives of the American people--the Department of Homeland Security. We are 4 days away, and even if they come up with a continuing resolution, a small little patch, they are shutting down the programs that fund our firefighters and our first responders back home. So any way we look at it, this is a national disgrace. Think about what our friends abroad and those who are not our friends are thinking about this. Republicans say we are in danger. We have to go to war, put combat troops on the ground. But they are willing to shut down the Department that protects Americans in the homeland from a terrorist attack. This is a self-inflicted crisis made up by the Republicans. It is dangerous. It is the height of irresponsibility and it is unnecessary. Let me tell you, how does it make sense in the very same week that terrorists are threatening our shopping malls that we would shut down the very agency charged with protecting those malls? How does it make sense at a time when we are facing serious threats to our national security to furlough 30,000 Department of Homeland Security workers and to force more than 100,000 frontline Homeland Security personnel to work without pay? Why don't these Senators go without their pay? Give up your pay. Do you want to come to work every day and stand there and look for threats to our homeland and worry about how you are going to pay the bills for your kids? Go without pay before you do this. You tell me how that makes sense not to pay people who are in charge of our security. It is a disgrace. Give up your pay--give up your pay, give up your health care, give up your benefits, if this is so important to you. Oh, no. They will collect their pay. Tell me, how does it make sense to shut off the grants that protect our cities, our ports from terrorist attacks, and how does it make sense to stop local communities from being able to hire police officers and firefighters? The Department of Homeland Security is very large. When it was created I was troubled by that because it includes so many important things in one department, including FEMA. So when we have a natural disaster such as an earthquake, fire or flood, that is the Department that deals with it. How does it make sense to disrupt disaster recovery operations such as the efforts in California to recover from our devastating Napa Earthquake and the Rim Fire in Yosemite? So not only are they disrupting Homeland Security and the protections of our perhaps most-targeted places in America, but they are disrupting recovery from natural disasters, and God forbid if we have another one. And the reason they are throwing a hissy fit is because the President stepped in and has a policy to take care of immigration. Why did the President step in? Because Republicans refused to take up a bipartisan bill, pass it, and take care of the immigration problem the way they are supposed to. They are paralyzed on that point. They cannot do it. We had a bill that garnered 68 votes in the last Congress. All they have to do is bring it up, pass it here, and then pass it in the House. It will pass with overwhelming majorities. The President will sign it, and that would make his Executive order unnecessary. The only reason he issued an Executive order is that we are facing a crisis in this country. There are 11 million undocumented folks. Some of those undocumented folks are DREAMers. To me, that is the most important category. They are young people who were brought here when they were children. They know no other home. All they want to do is stay here and give back to America. Republicans want to deport them and their parents. They want to deport the parents of American citizens. I thank God these people were not in charge of Congress when I was growing up or else they might have deported my mother. It took her awhile to get through her naturalization. What if they passed something such as what the Republicans are proposing? I thought they were the party of family values. Show me where that is true--ripping families apart. I thought they were the party of economic prosperity. Show me how that is true when we know from study after study that one of the greatest things we can do for our economy and job creation is to get people out of the shadows so they can go and buy a home and hold a good job. They can't or won't pass an immigration bill. They will not do their job. So when the President steps in and does his job, they say: Oh, this is terrible. Let's shut down a totally unrelated department, the Department of Homeland Security. Again I say, let's look at fiscal responsibility. According to the Center for American Progress, it would cost more than $50 billion to deport the entire population that the President is protecting. And here is the deal: I never heard a Republican--and I will stand corrected if any Republican corrects me--complain when President Eisenhower used his Executive power to help immigrants or when President Nixon did the same thing to protect immigrants or when President Ronald Reagan, their hero, protected immigrants or when George Bush, Sr., protected immigrants or when George W. Bush protected immigrants. They all used their authority. Show me one Republican who stood up and said: This is outrageous. Let's impeach the President. But they are annoyed because it is President Obama, and he won twice. Sorry. Wake up and smell the roses. He is the President, and he is doing the right thing for America because he loves America and he understands that these people, who the Republicans want to deport, are going to help America move on to an era of greatness and keep us going. Let's look at some of the young people Republicans want to deport. Alexis Bux is a 21-year-old student from central California. He is the oldest of three siblings. His younger two siblings were born in the United States, but he was not. So these great family-value Republicans want to rip away the oldest child from this family. His parents were farm workers in the fields of San Joaquin Valley. Alexis received immigration relief under DACA in 2012, and he will transfer to UC San Diego this fall where he will pursue his dream of a career in biomedical engineering. Tell me, Republicans, how our country is better off when you deport a young man such as him. He hopes to use his education to develop a sophisticated medical application and tools that will help cure deadly diseases. All he wants to do is contribute to the Nation he loves. If the Republicans had their way, they would deport people such as Ana Albarran, who left Mexico at age 8. She came to this country with her younger [[Page S1041]] brother and sister to join her parents. Her parents worked 11 hours a day as trimmers for a landscaping company in downtown Los Angeles. After Ana received immigration relief, she felt confident enough to begin applying for jobs, and now she is finishing her final year at UC Merced so she can begin her career as a bilingual first grade teacher. Tell me, Republicans, how does it make sense to deport people such as Ana and split her up from her parents when all they want to do is contribute to the country they love? How does it make sense just because you are too incompetent to hold a vote on your immigration plan? If you want to kick people out of the country, put it to a vote. Let's go. If you want to deport 11 million people, then put it to a vote. Don't hide behind the Homeland Security bill and hold the President's work hostage. You never did it to the other Presidents. Don't do it to this President. How does it make sense to deport these moms, these dads, and these young kids? I mentioned before that I am the daughter of an immigrant mother. I tried to think of what my life would have been like without my mother. She gave me my conscience. She gave me my values. She gave me all the love and support I needed to pursue my dreams. I am the daughter of an immigrant mother who never graduated from high school. I am a Senator in the U.S. Senate. But they would have deported my mother. I would not be here today if it were not for my mom. So tell me how it makes sense to deport moms and dads and rip apart the lives of children. Our national security is at stake, our family values are at stake, and our economy is at stake here. So get over the fact that you don't like the President. We get it. You couldn't beat him. It is too bad for you. You are in charge here in the Senate. Do your job. Bring an immigration bill to the floor. Let's let this Homeland Security bill go. It is a bipartisan bill. It is funding for the most important issue we are dealing with today. Let's get to it. Don't hold it hostage because of your hatred of this President--and I use that word because that is what I think. That is what I think. In California alone, the President's Executive actions could boost California's economy by as much as $27.5 billion. The President's action will aid our economy. It will raise the Nation's gross domestic product by up to $90 billion over the next 10 years by expanding the labor force and allowing immigrant workers the flexibility to seek new jobs. Why is that the case? Why does every independent study show us this is the case? The reason is simple. When workers come out of the shadows, their wages rise, they open bank accounts, buy homes, start businesses, and spend money in their communities. So I say this to my Republican friends. There is a Presidential race coming up. Forget the last one. Get over it. Let's work together. Listen, I served with five Presidents. I am a strong Democrat. Everyone will tell you that. But I have respect for the office of the Presidency. If I didn't agree with Ronald Reagan, I came down here and said it. We had respect back and forth. If we lost, we lost, and we moved on. That went both ways. I know how it feels not to like the policies of a President. I get it. But don't overdo it and make it so personal. Get on with it. Grow up. Do your job. Have respect for the Office of the President. Don't suddenly say Executive orders are bad when the President you don't like does it, but you don't say one word when a Republican President does the same thing. It doesn't pass the smell test. Three things could not be more important in this battle. We need to fund our Department of Homeland Security--especially when we are facing serious threats to our security. We need to uphold our family values and not split up loving families, and we need to protect and grow our economy. We can do this in the simplest way. First, I say to House Speaker Boehner--because under the Constitution all funding bills start in the House: Send us a clean bill. Send us the bill that everybody supported before you took it hostage on this immigration issue. Send it over clean. Let's fund everything in that bill to protect our shopping malls, to give grants to our first responders, and to give grants to our local fire departments. Send it over. We will pass it, and immediately following that, we will bring up an immigration bill. We have it all ready for you. It passed with 68 votes. There is not much work to do. If you do that, the President's Executive order will not be necessary because we will have taken the steps ourselves to fix our broken immigration system. Let's stop the lawsuits. We have one judge who said there was overreach, but the next judge may say there is no overreach. Let's keep this out of the courts. Let's do our job. Let's stop the self-inflicted crisis. Let's stop the shadow that is hanging over the Nation. Let's do the right thing here. We can protect the American people from threats to our national security. We can protect and grow our economy, and we can treat hard- working immigrants and their families with the dignity and respect they deserve. It all lies in the hands of Speaker Boehner and Leader McConnell. When you took over the Senate, you said: no more threats of shutdowns. Eight weeks later--not even 8 weeks--we are facing a shutdown of one of the most important departments. This is a disgrace, and it is self-inflicted. All you have to do is talk to Speaker Boehner. Send over a clean bill so we can vote on it. Then we will take up immigration, and you can show us all your great ideas on immigration. Let's hear it. Do you want to deport the DREAMers? Come on with it, and we will have a vote. You want to deport the parents? Come on with it, and we will have a vote. You want to kick 11 million people out of this country? Come on with it, and we will have a vote and debate on it. But don't hold the Department of Homeland Security hostage because of this issue. If there is one thing the American people hate more than anything else, it is attaching unrelated matters to spending bills. I don't care if they are conservative Republicans or liberal Democrats or Independent voters. They think it is the dumbest idea. They really do. They don't understand it. Pass your funding bills. Then battle your ideological issues separately and apart from that. Don't hold these departments hostage to your decision that President Obama did the wrong thing. If you don't like what he did, put forward your own bill. You have not even done that. I have been here a long time. I will tell you something. I have never seen anything like this. It is a self-inflicted wound. Who gets hurt? Not the Republicans--they will keep getting their pay. They are fine. The people who will be hurt are those whom we trust and count on and the families that thought they could stay together. They are on the verge of that. That is what this party--the Grand Old Party, the GOP-- have brought to us, but they can get out of it in 5 minutes. Speaker Boehner can pass a funding bill that will pass in a heartbeat. Send it over here, and we will pass it, turn to immigration, and then we can have it out on that subject. I think it is worthy of a debate. But don't hold an important funding bill hostage to that debate. It is ridiculous, unnecessary, destructive, and cruel. With that, I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Flake). Without objection, it is so ordered. ____________________","Congressional Record, Volume 161 Issue 31 (Tuesday, February 24, 2015) [Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 31 (Tuesday, February 24, 2015)] [Senate] [Pages S1038-S1041] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY FUNDING Mr. DURBIN.

Here is what he said about that experience: I spent most of my time in the restaurant working as a waiter, cashier and chef, scrubbing toilets, washing dishes, and mopping floors. It taught me to have faith, work hard, and persevere. His work paid off. He graduated salutatorian of his high school class with a 4.3 grade point average. He was admitted to the University of California at Berkeley, one of the top schools in California and the Nation. He won a scholarship that would have covered most of his tuition, but he couldn't accept it because he was undocumented. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired. Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for 2 additional minutes. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. DURBIN. Despite this setback, New persevered. In May of 2012 he graduated with honors from Berkeley with a 3.7 grade point average and a major in molecular and cellular biology. One month after he graduated, President Obama issued his Executive order, DACA, and now New was protected from deportation. As a result he was able to pursue his dream to become a doctor. Last fall New went to medical school at the University of California in San Francisco. Now what does he do in his spare time as a medical student? He volunteers at a homeless clinic run by students at the University of California in San Francisco. He has cofounded Pre-Health Dreamers, a national network of more than 400 DREAMers who are pursuing careers in health care. New and other similar DREAMers have so much to contribute to America. But if the Republicans have their way, this man is going to be deported. Instead of being able to stay in the United States as a doctor, to realize his life's dream and make this a better and stronger nation, he will be deported. Will America be better or worse if this young man leaves? I think the answer is obvious. So why do the Republicans persist? Why are they determined to take this amazing young man and deport him? They have forgotten our legacy in [[Page S1040]] America. We are a nation of immigrants, and our immigrants have come to this country from all over the world because they appreciate the values and opportunity of America. I am lucky. My mother was an immigrant to this country, and I stand on the Senate floor representing the great State of Illinois. It is my story, my family's story, and it is America's story. The time is clearly upon us to fund the appropriations of the Department of Homeland Security but not at the expense of this amazing young man. Let us fund this Department to keep America safe but also let us dedicate ourselves to passing legislation which fixes our broken immigration system and helps this young man and others like him to be a part of America's future. I yield the floor. Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I may speak for 15 minutes. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, before the Senator from Illinois leaves the floor, I just want to thank him for his amazing leadership on this whole issue of immigration. The Senator and I share a similar background because my mother also was an immigrant, and the thought of our moms being ripped out of our lives is just untenable. We are not going to let it happen. I wish to thank him so much because he has been, I would say, the grandfather of the whole DREAMer movement. So thank you, Senator. We all know Republicans won in huge numbers in the 2014 election and they took over the Senate and they run it. They run it--or at least they are trying to run it. Let's be clear. Less than 8 weeks after they took over the Senate we are facing a shutdown, a shutdown of the very agency that protects the health, the safety, the lives of the American people--the Department of Homeland Security. We are 4 days away, and even if they come up with a continuing resolution, a small little patch, they are shutting down the programs that fund our firefighters and our first responders back home. So any way we look at it, this is a national disgrace. Think about what our friends abroad and those who are not our friends are thinking about this. Republicans say we are in danger. We have to go to war, put combat troops on the ground. But they are willing to shut down the Department that protects Americans in the homeland from a terrorist attack. This is a self-inflicted crisis made up by the Republicans. It is dangerous. It is the height of irresponsibility and it is unnecessary. Let me tell you, how does it make sense in the very same week that terrorists are threatening our shopping malls that we would shut down the very agency charged with protecting those malls? How does it make sense at a time when we are facing serious threats to our national security to furlough 30,000 Department of Homeland Security workers and to force more than 100,000 frontline Homeland Security personnel to work without pay? Why don't these Senators go without their pay? Give up your pay. Do you want to come to work every day and stand there and look for threats to our homeland and worry about how you are going to pay the bills for your kids? Go without pay before you do this. You tell me how that makes sense not to pay people who are in charge of our security. It is a disgrace. Give up your pay--give up your pay, give up your health care, give up your benefits, if this is so important to you. Oh, no. They will collect their pay. Tell me, how does it make sense to shut off the grants that protect our cities, our ports from terrorist attacks, and how does it make sense to stop local communities from being able to hire police officers and firefighters? The Department of Homeland Security is very large. When it was created I was troubled by that because it includes so many important things in one department, including FEMA. So when we have a natural disaster such as an earthquake, fire or flood, that is the Department that deals with it. How does it make sense to disrupt disaster recovery operations such as the efforts in California to recover from our devastating Napa Earthquake and the Rim Fire in Yosemite? So not only are they disrupting Homeland Security and the protections of our perhaps most-targeted places in America, but they are disrupting recovery from natural disasters, and God forbid if we have another one. And the reason they are throwing a hissy fit is because the President stepped in and has a policy to take care of immigration. Why did the President step in? Because Republicans refused to take up a bipartisan bill, pass it, and take care of the immigration problem the way they are supposed to. They are paralyzed on that point. They cannot do it. We had a bill that garnered 68 votes in the last Congress. All they have to do is bring it up, pass it here, and then pass it in the House. It will pass with overwhelming majorities. The President will sign it, and that would make his Executive order unnecessary. The only reason he issued an Executive order is that we are facing a crisis in this country. There are 11 million undocumented folks. Some of those undocumented folks are DREAMers. To me, that is the most important category. They are young people who were brought here when they were children. They know no other home. All they want to do is stay here and give back to America. Republicans want to deport them and their parents. They want to deport the parents of American citizens. I thank God these people were not in charge of Congress when I was growing up or else they might have deported my mother. It took her awhile to get through her naturalization. What if they passed something such as what the Republicans are proposing? I thought they were the party of family values. Show me where that is true--ripping families apart. I thought they were the party of economic prosperity. Show me how that is true when we know from study after study that one of the greatest things we can do for our economy and job creation is to get people out of the shadows so they can go and buy a home and hold a good job. They can't or won't pass an immigration bill. They will not do their job. So when the President steps in and does his job, they say: Oh, this is terrible. Let's shut down a totally unrelated department, the Department of Homeland Security. Again I say, let's look at fiscal responsibility. According to the Center for American Progress, it would cost more than $50 billion to deport the entire population that the President is protecting. And here is the deal: I never heard a Republican--and I will stand corrected if any Republican corrects me--complain when President Eisenhower used his Executive power to help immigrants or when President Nixon did the same thing to protect immigrants or when President Ronald Reagan, their hero, protected immigrants or when George Bush, Sr., protected immigrants or when George W. Bush protected immigrants. They all used their authority. Show me one Republican who stood up and said: This is outrageous. Let's impeach the President. But they are annoyed because it is President Obama, and he won twice. Sorry. Wake up and smell the roses. He is the President, and he is doing the right thing for America because he loves America and he understands that these people, who the Republicans want to deport, are going to help America move on to an era of greatness and keep us going. Let's look at some of the young people Republicans want to deport. Alexis Bux is a 21-year-old student from central California. He is the oldest of three siblings. His younger two siblings were born in the United States, but he was not. So these great family-value Republicans want to rip away the oldest child from this family. His parents were farm workers in the fields of San Joaquin Valley. Alexis received immigration relief under DACA in 2012, and he will transfer to UC San Diego this fall where he will pursue his dream of a career in biomedical engineering. Tell me, Republicans, how our country is better off when you deport a young man such as him. He hopes to use his education to develop a sophisticated medical application and tools that will help cure deadly diseases. All he wants to do is contribute to the Nation he loves. If the Republicans had their way, they would deport people such as Ana Albarran, who left Mexico at age 8. She came to this country with her younger [[Page S1041]] brother and sister to join her parents. Her parents worked 11 hours a day as trimmers for a landscaping company in downtown Los Angeles. After Ana received immigration relief, she felt confident enough to begin applying for jobs, and now she is finishing her final year at UC Merced so she can begin her career as a bilingual first grade teacher. Tell me, Republicans, how does it make sense to deport people such as Ana and split her up from her parents when all they want to do is contribute to the country they love? How does it make sense just because you are too incompetent to hold a vote on your immigration plan? If you want to kick people out of the country, put it to a vote. Let's go. If you want to deport 11 million people, then put it to a vote. Don't hide behind the Homeland Security bill and hold the President's work hostage. You never did it to the other Presidents. Don't do it to this President. How does it make sense to deport these moms, these dads, and these young kids? I mentioned before that I am the daughter of an immigrant mother. I tried to think of what my life would have been like without my mother. She gave me my conscience. She gave me my values. She gave me all the love and support I needed to pursue my dreams. I am the daughter of an immigrant mother who never graduated from high school. I am a Senator in the U.S. Senate. But they would have deported my mother. I would not be here today if it were not for my mom. So tell me how it makes sense to deport moms and dads and rip apart the lives of children. Our national security is at stake, our family values are at stake, and our economy is at stake here. So get over the fact that you don't like the President. We get it. You couldn't beat him. It is too bad for you. You are in charge here in the Senate. Do your job. Bring an immigration bill to the floor. Let's let this Homeland Security bill go. It is a bipartisan bill. It is funding for the most important issue we are dealing with today. Let's get to it. Don't hold it hostage because of your hatred of this President--and I use that word because that is what I think. That is what I think. In California alone, the President's Executive actions could boost California's economy by as much as $27.5 billion. The President's action will aid our economy. It will raise the Nation's gross domestic product by up to $90 billion over the next 10 years by expanding the labor force and allowing immigrant workers the flexibility to seek new jobs. Why is that the case? Why does every independent study show us this is the case? The reason is simple. When workers come out of the shadows, their wages rise, they open bank accounts, buy homes, start businesses, and spend money in their communities. So I say this to my Republican friends. There is a Presidential race coming up. Forget the last one. Get over it. Let's work together. Listen, I served with five Presidents. I am a strong Democrat. Everyone will tell you that. But I have respect for the office of the Presidency. If I didn't agree with Ronald Reagan, I came down here and said it. We had respect back and forth. If we lost, we lost, and we moved on. That went both ways. I know how it feels not to like the policies of a President. I get it. But don't overdo it and make it so personal. Get on with it. Grow up. Do your job. Have respect for the Office of the President. Don't suddenly say Executive orders are bad when the President you don't like does it, but you don't say one word when a Republican President does the same thing. It doesn't pass the smell test. Three things could not be more important in this battle. We need to fund our Department of Homeland Security--especially when we are facing serious threats to our security. We need to uphold our family values and not split up loving families, and we need to protect and grow our economy. We can do this in the simplest way. First, I say to House Speaker Boehner--because under the Constitution all funding bills start in the House: Send us a clean bill. Send us the bill that everybody supported before you took it hostage on this immigration issue. Send it over clean. Let's fund everything in that bill to protect our shopping malls, to give grants to our first responders, and to give grants to our local fire departments. Send it over. We will pass it, and immediately following that, we will bring up an immigration bill. We have it all ready for you. It passed with 68 votes. There is not much work to do. If you do that, the President's Executive order will not be necessary because we will have taken the steps ourselves to fix our broken immigration system. Let's stop the lawsuits. We have one judge who said there was overreach, but the next judge may say there is no overreach. Let's keep this out of the courts. Let's do our job. Let's stop the self-inflicted crisis. Let's stop the shadow that is hanging over the Nation. Let's do the right thing here. We can protect the American people from threats to our national security. We can protect and grow our economy, and we can treat hard- working immigrants and their families with the dignity and respect they deserve. It all lies in the hands of Speaker Boehner and Leader McConnell. When you took over the Senate, you said: no more threats of shutdowns. Eight weeks later--not even 8 weeks--we are facing a shutdown of one of the most important departments. This is a disgrace, and it is self-inflicted. All you have to do is talk to Speaker Boehner. Send over a clean bill so we can vote on it. Then we will take up immigration, and you can show us all your great ideas on immigration. Let's hear it. Do you want to deport the DREAMers? Come on with it, and we will have a vote. You want to deport the parents? Come on with it, and we will have a vote. You want to kick 11 million people out of this country? Come on with it, and we will have a vote and debate on it. But don't hold the Department of Homeland Security hostage because of this issue. If there is one thing the American people hate more than anything else, it is attaching unrelated matters to spending bills. I don't care if they are conservative Republicans or liberal Democrats or Independent voters. They think it is the dumbest idea. They really do. They don't understand it. Pass your funding bills. Then battle your ideological issues separately and apart from that. Don't hold these departments hostage to your decision that President Obama did the wrong thing. If you don't like what he did, put forward your own bill. You have not even done that. I have been here a long time. I will tell you something. I have never seen anything like this. It is a self-inflicted wound. Who gets hurt? Not the Republicans--they will keep getting their pay. They are fine. The people who will be hurt are those whom we trust and count on and the families that thought they could stay together. They are on the verge of that. That is what this party--the Grand Old Party, the GOP-- have brought to us, but they can get out of it in 5 minutes. Speaker Boehner can pass a funding bill that will pass in a heartbeat. Send it over here, and we will pass it, turn to immigration, and then we can have it out on that subject. I think it is worthy of a debate. But don't hold an important funding bill hostage to that debate. It is ridiculous, unnecessary, destructive, and cruel. With that, I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Flake). Without objection, it is so ordered. ____________________",package_114_116.csv,27099,27099,27170,"[congressional record volume 161, number 31 (tuesday, february 24, 2015)] [senate] [pages s1038-s1041] from the congressional record online through the government publishing office [ www.gpo.gov ] department of homeland security funding mr. durbin. mr. president, by calculation, we have today and 3 more days before the department of homeland security is shut down. think about what happened this last weekend all across america. it was disclosed publicly that an extremist group, a terrorist group--al- shabab--had some communication among their membership targeting malls in america for extremism and terrorism. god forbid that ever happens. i know those who are managing these malls look at the terrible situation that occurred in africa and want to make certain it is never repeated anywhere, let alone in the united states. they are making extraordinary efforts to protect people across america, not only as they are shopping in malls but in other places, as they should. what is the lead agency to protect america against terrorism? what is the lead agency to make sure we never ever again in our history experience 9/11? the department of homeland security. that department was created after 9/11, because we felt the way we were protecting america wasn't good enough. we took 22 different federal agencies and put them under the roof of the department of homeland security and said to that department: now focus; focus all your time and efforts to keep us safe. they have done a good job. i am sure they have made some mistakes along the way, but they have really dedicated themselves--all the men and women who work there--to keeping america safe. now what has congress done for the department of homeland security? last december, when we considered the appropriations--the budget--for the department of homeland security, the republicans insisted we take that department out of the regular budget process and give it only temporary funding, a continuing resolution--temporary funding--which limits the authority of the secretary of homeland security to do his best job to keep america safe. why would the republicans pick this appropriation, the single appropriation to keep america safe from terrorism and decide they don't want to properly fund it? they are only giving it temporary funding and a continuing resolution because they disagree with president obama's position on immigration. that is it. they want this issue of immigration, separate and apart from the budget of the homeland security, to be debated, and they insist they will not fund the department of homeland security until it is debated. so come february [[page s1039]] 27, in just a few days, this department of homeland security is going to shut down. it is going to shut down. many of the employees are essential. they will be asked to come to work even though there is only a promise of a paycheck, and they will show up because they are loyal to this country and they want to do their job to keep it safe. why won't the senate and the house do its job? why can't we pass a clean appropriations bill for the department of homeland security? before we took a break last week for president's week i made a unanimous consent request on the floor to do just that-- pass a clean appropriations bill for the department of homeland security. the majority leader, senator mcconnell of kentucky, objected. he objected to funding the department of homeland security. i don't understand it. it doesn't make sense for us to put in jeopardy the security of america over a political debate on immigration. what is ironic is that now that the republicans have the majority control of the house and the senate they can call any bill they wish. after funding the department of homeland security, they can turn immediately to a debate on immigration. it is their right. they pick the topics, they dictate the calendar, and those of us in the minority have to accede to their wishes. they are in the majority. they are controlling, but still speaker boehner and senator mcconnell, the republican majority leader, refuse to pass a clean appropriations bill to the department of homeland security. luckily some republicans are stepping up and saying this is wrong. i commend the following senators on the republican side who have publicly stated that congress should pass a clean homeland security bill and stop this tactic that came from the house of representatives. those senators include: senator dean heller of nevada, senator mark kirk of illinois, senators jeff flake and john mccain of arizona, senator lindsey graham of south carolina, and senator ron johnson of wisconsin. we need eight more republican senators to come forward and say we need a clean appropriations bill and we need to pass it now. if eight republican senators today will say that, then we can move forward and pass this bill. we can fund this department and stop this gamesmanship. then, if the leaders want to move to a debate on immigration, so be it. but let's have eight more republicans step forward and join us to make this a reality. i don't understand, frankly, the thinking of many of the republicans who oppose the president's approach to immigration. here is what it comes down to. if the president used every penny given to him by congress to deport those who are undocumented in the united states, he could reach about 4 percent of those who are eligible for deportation-- 4 percent. what the president has said is: let me focus then on deporting those who are most dangerous to the united states. president obama has said there are people who have been here for years. they are part of our communities. they have good jobs. they have raised families. they go to our churches. we see them every day. they are no threat to us. let's focus on deporting those who are dangerous-- the felons, the criminals. the president has basically said we shouldn't set out to deport families, we ought to deport felons. we shouldn't set out to deport children, we ought to deport criminals. so his priority is deportation of those most dangerous to the united states, and the republicans have opposed that. why? primarily because the president supports it. it has reached that point in the debate. it is so divisive. the president doesn't want to waste any resources in deporting those who are not dangerous. he wants to get those who are dangerous out of the united states first, and republicans object to that. there is something else they want to do too. the house of representatives wants to challenge the president's right to executive orders when it comes to prioritizing those who can stay in the united states. several years ago at the request of 20 or more senators, the president initiated an executive action known as daca. this executive action said that if someone qualified as a dreamer, they would be allowed to stay without threat of deportation. we estimate that 2 million young people in america would qualify as dreamers, and 600,000 have this protection now. what the republicans want to do in the house of representatives is to eliminate this. who are these young people? they are young folks in america brought to this country as toddlers and infants, young boys and girls who grew up in this country, went to school in this country, have no problems in their criminal record and want to be part of america. that is it. what the republicans have said in the house is we want to deport these people--deport them because they are here undocumented, despite the fact that we have educated them and many of them are successes in life and want to be part of our future. the republicans have said deport them. the senior senator from maine has authored a bill to address this subject, but as much as i respect her and count her as a friend, it falls short of protecting the dreamers who are in this country under daca. i have to say that as one learns the stories of those who are protected by the president's executive order, we wonder what are the republicans thinking. i have tried to tell these stories in light of individuals, not statistics, and here is one i wish to tell everyone today. it is about a young man who came to america when he was 9 years old from thailand. his name is jirayut new. he was brought here at the age of 9 from thailand by his parents. he grew up in san francisco and he said: i forced myself to read mystery novels, dictionary in hand, in order to expand my vocabulary, one word at a time. i mispronounced words, even in the face of ridicule, until i mastered the english language. it is amazing. these stories have happened many times in the past, but it is incredible to think of a 9-year-old facing that ridicule but learning the english language in san francisco. this young man became an excellent student and his dream was to be a doctor. throughout high school new worked 30 hours a week in his family's thai restaurant. here is what he said about that experience: i spent most of my time in the restaurant working as a waiter, cashier and chef, scrubbing toilets, washing dishes, and mopping floors. it taught me to have faith, work hard, and persevere. his work paid off. he graduated salutatorian of his high school class with a 4.3 grade point average. he was admitted to the university of california at berkeley, one of the top schools in california and the nation. he won a scholarship that would have covered most of his tuition, but he couldn't accept it because he was undocumented. the presiding officer. the senator's time has expired. mr. durbin. mr. president, i ask unanimous consent for 2 additional minutes. the presiding officer. without objection, it is so ordered. mr. durbin. despite this setback, new persevered. in may of 2012 he graduated with honors from berkeley with a 3.7 grade point average and a major in molecular and cellular biology. one month after he graduated, president obama issued his executive order, daca, and now new was protected from deportation. as a result he was able to pursue his dream to become a doctor. last fall new went to medical school at the university of california in san francisco. now what does he do in his spare time as a medical student? he volunteers at a homeless clinic run by students at the university of california in san francisco. he has cofounded pre-health dreamers, a national network of more than 400 dreamers who are pursuing careers in health care. new and other similar dreamers have so much to contribute to america. but if the republicans have their way, this man is going to be deported. instead of being able to stay in the united states as a doctor, to realize his life's dream and make this a better and stronger nation, he will be deported. will america be better or worse if this young man leaves? i think the answer is obvious. so why do the republicans persist? why are they determined to take this amazing young man and deport him? they have forgotten our legacy in [[page s1040]] america. we are a nation of immigrants, and our immigrants have come to this country from all over the world because they appreciate the values and opportunity of america. i am lucky. my mother was an immigrant to this country, and i stand on the senate floor representing the great state of illinois. it is my story, my family's story, and it is america's story. the time is clearly upon us to fund the appropriations of the department of homeland security but not at the expense of this amazing young man. let us fund this department to keep america safe but also let us dedicate ourselves to passing legislation which fixes our broken immigration system and helps this young man and others like him to be a part of america's future. i yield the floor. mrs. boxer. mr. president, i ask unanimous consent that i may speak for 15 minutes. the presiding officer. without objection, it is so ordered. mrs. boxer. mr. president, before the senator from illinois leaves the floor, i just want to thank him for his amazing leadership on this whole issue of immigration. the senator and i share a similar background because my mother also was an immigrant, and the thought of our moms being ripped out of our lives is just untenable. we are not going to let it happen. i wish to thank him so much because he has been, i would say, the grandfather of the whole dreamer movement. so thank you, senator. we all know republicans won in huge numbers in the 2014 election and they took over the senate and they run it. they run it--or at least they are trying to run it. let's be clear. less than 8 weeks after they took over the senate we are facing a shutdown, a shutdown of the very agency that protects the health, the safety, the lives of the american people--the department of homeland security. we are 4 days away, and even if they come up with a continuing resolution, a small little patch, they are shutting down the programs that fund our firefighters and our first responders back home. so any way we look at it, this is a national disgrace. think about what our friends abroad and those who are not our friends are thinking about this. republicans say we are in danger. we have to go to war, put combat troops on the ground. but they are willing to shut down the department that protects americans in the homeland from a terrorist attack. this is a self-inflicted crisis made up by the republicans. it is dangerous. it is the height of irresponsibility and it is unnecessary. let me tell you, how does it make sense in the very same week that terrorists are threatening our shopping malls that we would shut down the very agency charged with protecting those malls? how does it make sense at a time when we are facing serious threats to our national security to furlough 30,000 department of homeland security workers and to force more than 100,000 frontline homeland security personnel to work without pay? why don't these senators go without their pay? give up your pay. do you want to come to work every day and stand there and look for threats to our homeland and worry about how you are going to pay the bills for your kids? go without pay before you do this. you tell me how that makes sense not to pay people who are in charge of our security. it is a disgrace. give up your pay--give up your pay, give up your health care, give up your benefits, if this is so important to you. oh, no. they will collect their pay. tell me, how does it make sense to shut off the grants that protect our cities, our ports from terrorist attacks, and how does it make sense to stop local communities from being able to hire police officers and firefighters? the department of homeland security is very large. when it was created i was troubled by that because it includes so many important things in one department, including fema. so when we have a natural disaster such as an earthquake, fire or flood, that is the department that deals with it. how does it make sense to disrupt disaster recovery operations such as the efforts in california to recover from our devastating napa earthquake and the rim fire in yosemite?

i thought they were the party of family values. show me where that is true--ripping families apart. i thought they were the party of economic prosperity. show me how that is true when we know from study after study that one of the greatest things we can do for our economy and job creation is to get people out of the shadows so they can go and buy a home and hold a good job. they can't or won't pass an immigration bill. they will not do their job. so when the president steps in and does his job, they say: oh, this is terrible. let's shut down a totally unrelated department, the department of homeland security. again i say, let's look at fiscal responsibility. according to the center for american progress, it would cost more than $50 billion to deport the entire population that the president is protecting. and here is the deal: i never heard a republican--and i will stand corrected if any republican corrects me--complain when president eisenhower used his executive power to help immigrants or when president nixon did the same thing to protect immigrants or when president ronald reagan, their hero, protected immigrants or when george bush, sr., protected immigrants or when george w. bush protected immigrants. they all used their authority. show me one republican who stood up and said: this is outrageous. let's impeach the president. but they are annoyed because it is president obama, and he won twice. sorry. wake up and smell the roses. he is the president, and he is doing the right thing for america because he loves america and he understands that these people, who the republicans want to deport, are going to help america move on to an era of greatness and keep us going. let's look at some of the young people republicans want to deport. alexis bux is a 21-year-old student from central california. he is the oldest of three siblings. his younger two siblings were born in the united states, but he was not. so these great family-value republicans want to rip away the oldest child from this family. his parents were farm workers in the fields of san joaquin valley. alexis received immigration relief under daca in 2012, and he will transfer to uc san diego this fall where he will pursue his dream of a career in biomedical engineering. tell me, republicans, how our country is better off when you deport a young man such as him. he hopes to use his education to develop a sophisticated medical application and tools that will help cure deadly diseases. all he wants to do is contribute to the nation he loves. if the republicans had their way, they would deport people such as ana albarran, who left mexico at age 8. she came to this country with her younger [[page s1041]] brother and sister to join her parents. her parents worked 11 hours a day as trimmers for a landscaping company in downtown los angeles. after ana received immigration relief, she felt confident enough to begin applying for jobs, and now she is finishing her final year at uc merced so she can begin her career as a bilingual first grade teacher. tell me, republicans, how does it make sense to deport people such as ana and split her up from her parents when all they want to do is contribute to the country they love? how does it make sense just because you are too incompetent to hold a vote on your immigration plan? if you want to kick people out of the country, put it to a vote. let's go. if you want to deport 11 million people, then put it to a vote. don't hide behind the homeland security bill and hold the president's work hostage. you never did it to the other presidents. don't do it to this president. how does it make sense to deport these moms, these dads, and these young kids? i mentioned before that i am the daughter of an immigrant mother. i tried to think of what my life would have been like without my mother. she gave me my conscience. she gave me my values. she gave me all the love and support i needed to pursue my dreams. i am the daughter of an immigrant mother who never graduated from high school. i am a senator in the u.s. senate. but they would have deported my mother. i would not be here today if it were not for my mom. so tell me how it makes sense to deport moms and dads and rip apart the lives of children. our national security is at stake, our family values are at stake, and our economy is at stake here. so get over the fact that you don't like the president. we get it. you couldn't beat him. it is too bad for you. you are in charge here in the senate. do your job. bring an immigration bill to the floor. let's let this homeland security bill go. it is a bipartisan bill. it is funding for the most important issue we are dealing with today. let's get to it. don't hold it hostage because of your hatred of this president--and i use that word because that is what i think. that is what i think. in california alone, the president's executive actions could boost california's economy by as much as $27.5 billion. the president's action will aid our economy. it will raise the nation's gross domestic product by up to $90 billion over the next 10 years by expanding the labor force and allowing immigrant workers the flexibility to seek new jobs. why is that the case? why does every independent study show us this is the case? the reason is simple. when workers come out of the shadows, their wages rise, they open bank accounts, buy homes, start businesses, and spend money in their communities. so i say this to my republican friends. there is a presidential race coming up. forget the last one. get over it. let's work together. listen, i served with five presidents. i am a strong democrat. everyone will tell you that. but i have respect for the office of the presidency. if i didn't agree with ronald reagan, i came down here and said it. we had respect back and forth. if we lost, we lost, and we moved on. that went both ways. i know how it feels not to like the policies of a president. i get it. but don't overdo it and make it so personal. get on with it. grow up. do your job. have respect for the office of the president. don't suddenly say executive orders are bad when the president you don't like does it, but you don't say one word when a republican president does the same thing. it doesn't pass the smell test. three things could not be more important in this battle. we need to fund our department of homeland security--especially when we are facing serious threats to our security. we need to uphold our family values and not split up loving families, and we need to protect and grow our economy. we can do this in the simplest way. first, i say to house speaker boehner--because under the constitution all funding bills start in the house: send us a clean bill. send us the bill that everybody supported before you took it hostage on this immigration issue. send it over clean. let's fund everything in that bill to protect our shopping malls, to give grants to our first responders, and to give grants to our local fire departments. send it over. we will pass it, and immediately following that, we will bring up an immigration bill. we have it all ready for you. it passed with 68 votes. there is not much work to do. if you do that, the president's executive order will not be necessary because we will have taken the steps ourselves to fix our broken immigration system. let's stop the lawsuits. we have one judge who said there was overreach, but the next judge may say there is no overreach. let's keep this out of the courts. let's do our job. let's stop the self-inflicted crisis. let's stop the shadow that is hanging over the nation. let's do the right thing here. we can protect the american people from threats to our national security. we can protect and grow our economy, and we can treat hard- working immigrants and their families with the dignity and respect they deserve. it all lies in the hands of speaker boehner and leader mcconnell. when you took over the senate, you said: no more threats of shutdowns. eight weeks later--not even 8 weeks--we are facing a shutdown of one of the most important departments. this is a disgrace, and it is self-inflicted. all you have to do is talk to speaker boehner. send over a clean bill so we can vote on it. then we will take up immigration, and you can show us all your great ideas on immigration. let's hear it. do you want to deport the dreamers? come on with it, and we will have a vote. you want to deport the parents? come on with it, and we will have a vote. you want to kick 11 million people out of this country? come on with it, and we will have a vote and debate on it. but don't hold the department of homeland security hostage because of this issue. if there is one thing the american people hate more than anything else, it is attaching unrelated matters to spending bills. i don't care if they are conservative republicans or liberal democrats or independent voters. they think it is the dumbest idea. they really do. they don't understand it. pass your funding bills. then battle your ideological issues separately and apart from that. don't hold these departments hostage to your decision that president obama did the wrong thing. if you don't like what he did, put forward your own bill. you have not even done that. i have been here a long time. i will tell you something. i have never seen anything like this. it is a self-inflicted wound. who gets hurt? not the republicans--they will keep getting their pay. they are fine. the people who will be hurt are those whom we trust and count on and the families that thought they could stay together. they are on the verge of that. that is what this party--the grand old party, the gop-- have brought to us, but they can get out of it in 5 minutes. speaker boehner can pass a funding bill that will pass in a heartbeat. send it over here, and we will pass it, turn to immigration, and then we can have it out on that subject. i think it is worthy of a debate. but don't hold an important funding bill hostage to that debate. it is ridiculous, unnecessary, destructive, and cruel. with that, i yield the floor. i suggest the absence of a quorum. the presiding officer. the clerk will call the roll. the senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. mr. cardin. mr. president, i ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. the presiding officer (mr. flake). without objection, it is so ordered. ____________________",27099
CREC-2015-02-24-pt1-PgS1041,CREC-2015-02-24,114,HARRIET TUBMAN AND THE HARRIET TUBMAN UNDERGROUND RAILROAD NATIONAL HISTORICAL PARK,"[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 31 (Tuesday, February 24, 2015)] [Senate] [Pages S1041-S1043] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] HARRIET TUBMAN AND THE HARRIET TUBMAN UNDERGROUND RAILROAD NATIONAL HISTORICAL PARK Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I rise to celebrate the life of Harriet Tubman and the establishment of the Harriet Tubman Underground Railroad National Historical Park. Harriet Tubman was an American hero who championed freedom and was most famously known as a leader of the Underground Railroad whose roots were on the Eastern Shore of Maryland. Harriet Tubman was an iconic figure in our Nation's history for whom liberty and freedom were not just ideas [[Page S1042]] but were God-given rights she fought tirelessly and at great personal peril to spread to others in bondage. The woman who is known to us as Harriet Tubman was born in approximately 1822 in Dorchester County, MD, and given the name Araminta ``Minty'' Ross. Born into slavery, she spent nearly 30 years of her life toiling for various families on Maryland's Eastern Shore. Even as a young, enslaved girl, she demonstrated impressive mental and physical strength. One of her jobs was to set and check muskrat traps in the swamps of the Blackwater River during blazing hot summers and freezing cold winters. Even though Harriet was slight in physical stature, she frequently worked with the men in the forest cutting timber and carrying logs. It was in this work setting, where both free and enslaved people worked together harvesting timber, that she first heard stories about what life was like for free Blacks in Northern States. As a teenaged slave, one of her first acts of defiance was sticking up for an enslaved boy who was being harassed by a shopkeeper. In helping the boy out of this situation, she took a serious blow to the head when the shopkeeper threw a lead weight that struck her in the head. Tubman recalled later in life that the mark of the weight on her skull never fully healed and after this incident she would see visions that later inspired her to escape slavery. As an adult she took the first name Harriet, and when she was 24 years old she married John Tubman. In her late twenties, Harriet Tubman escaped from slavery in 1849. She fled in the dead of night, navigating the maze of tidal streams and wetlands that to this day comprise the Eastern Shore's landscape. She did so alone, demonstrating courage, strength, and fortitude that became her hallmark. Not satisfied with attaining her own freedom, she returned repeatedly for more than 10 years to places of her enslavement in Dorchester and Caroline Counties where, under the most adverse conditions, she led away many family members and other slaves to freedom in the Northeastern United States and Canada. She helped develop a complex network of safe houses and recruited abolitionist sympathizers residing along secret routes connecting the Southern slave States and Northern free States. No one knows exactly how many people she led to freedom or the number of trips between the North and the South she led, but the legend of her work was an inspiration to the multitude of slaves seeking freedom and to abolitionists fighting to end slavery. Tubman became known as the Moses of her people by African Americans and White abolitionists alike. Tubman once proudly told Frederick Douglass that in all her journeys she ``never lost a single passenger.'' She was so effective that in 1856 there was a $40,000 reward offered for her capture in the South. She is the most famous and the most important conductor of the network of resistance known as the Underground Railroad. But Tubman was more than a conductor on the Underground Railroad. She was a scout and a spy for the Union Army, she was active in the women's suffrage movement after the Civil War, and ultimately she served aging African Americans by running a home for the aged in Auburn, NY. In 1903 she bequeathed the Tubman home to the African Methodist Episcopal Zion Church in Auburn, where it stands to this day. Just this month I was able to attend the midwinter meeting of the Board of Bishops/International Ministers and Lay Association of the AME Zion Church, where we honored Sojourner Truth, Frederick Douglass, and Harriet Tubman. The AME Zion Church, or the ``Freedom Church,'' as many refer to it, was an important part of Harriet Tubman's life and was involved in the forefront of both the abolition and civil rights movements. She was a dedicated member of the church and actively supported the construction of the Thompson AME Church in Auburn, NY, where she lay in state after her death. Harriet Tubman died in Auburn in 1913, and she is buried in the Fort Hill Cemetery. Fortunately, many of the structures and landmarks in New York remain intact, in relatively good condition. For the past 7 years, I have championed legislation to establish the creation of the Harriet Tubman Historical Parks in Maryland and New York. The creation of these parks has been years in the making and long overdue, and I am very grateful for the support my colleagues gave this bill in the last Congress. Recently I was able to celebrate this park's formal designation during a ceremonial event at the Harriet Tubman Museum and Educational Center in Cambridge, MD, just a few miles from where she grew up. I was able to meet some of Harriet Tubman's descendants, which was incredibly meaningful to me. I am so pleased Harriet Tubman's legacy will live on in these parks. My cosponsors and I all share a deep appreciation for how establishing this park is preserving the legacy of this remarkable historic figure in American history and will also show how important this park will be to communities where they are located. Every February our Nation's children learn lessons about the many contributions African Americans have made to our democracy and to the growth and prosperity of our Nation. Preserving places significant to Harriet Tubman's life story for future generations creates a learning opportunity that our kids and grandkids can't get in the classroom or learn from a textbook. The park will educate the public about the historical significance of the Underground Railroad and Harriet Tubman's early life and also is expected to increase tourism, create jobs, and strengthen local economies. The final passage of this bill to create the park was the result of an unyielding bipartisan effort, including Representative Andy Harris, Senator Mikulski, and me, along with our partners from New York, Senators Schumer, Gillibrand, and former Secretary Clinton when she represented New York in this body, along with Congressmen Dan Maffei and Richard Hanna. This was a bipartisan effort and involved Members from both New York and Maryland. The effort on this legislative work was started by my predecessor, Senator Sarbanes, when he passed legislation commissioning the national service to conduct a special resource study on Harriet Tubman. The establishment of the national historical park commemorating the life of Harriet Tubman and protecting the serene and almost untouched landscape is an ideal way to celebrate and honor the outstanding life and incredible work of Harriet Tubman, while establishing an important destination for tourists to come visit, learn, and experience Maryland's Eastern Shore. The vision for the Tubman National Historical Parks is to preserve the places significant to the life of Harriet Tubman and tell her story through interpretive activities, while continuing to discover aspects of her life and the experiences of passage along the Underground Railroad through archaeological research and discovery. The buildings and structures in Maryland have mainly disappeared. Slaves were forced to live in primitive buildings even though many slaves were skilled tradesmen who constructed the substantial homes of their owners. Not surprising, few of the structures associated with the early years of Tubman's life remain standing today. The landscape of the Eastern Shore of Maryland, however, is still evocative of the time when Harriet Tubman lived there. Farm fields and loblolly pine forests dot the lowland landscape, which is also notable for its extensive network of tidal rivers and wetlands that Tubman and the people she guided to freedom used under cover of night. In particular, a number of places significant to Tubman's life--including the homestead of Ben Ross, her father; Stewart's Canal, where he worked; the Brodess Farm, where she worked as a slave; and others--are within the master plan boundaries of the Blackwater National Wildlife Refuge. Similarly, Poplar Neck, the plantation from which she escaped, is still largely intact in Caroline County. The properties in Talbot County, immediately across the Choptank River from the plantation, are currently protected by various conservation easements. Were she alive today, Tubman would recognize much of the landscape that she knew intimately as she secretly led freedom [[Page S1043]] seekers of all ages to the North. This park helps connect people today to America's history. Only recently has the Park Service begun establishing units dedicated to the lives of African Americans. Places such as Booker T. Washington National Monument on the campus of Tuskegee University in Alabama, the George Washington Carver National Monument in Missouri, the National Historic Trail commemorating the march for voting rights from Selma to Montgomery, and most recently the Martin Luther King, Jr. Memorial on the Mall are all important monuments and places of historical significance that help tell the story of the African-American experience. As the National Park Service continues its important work to commemorate and preserve African-American history by providing greater public access and information about the places and people who have shaped the African-American experience, there are very few units dedicated to the lives of African-American women. This historic park is the first national park in honor of a woman--obviously the first historical park for an African-American woman. As we celebrate Black history this month and women's history next month, I cannot think of a more fitting hero than Harriet Tubman to be the first African-American woman to be memorialized with national historical parks. These parks tell both her personal story and her lifelong fight for justice and freedom, from her fight against the cruel institution of slavery and the establishment of the Underground Railroad that she led, to her work in the women's suffrage movement. I encourage my colleagues to seek inspiration from the heroes of their own States and work to preserve the physical remnants of their legacy so that future generations of Americans might better know who helped form this great Nation. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cruz). Without objection, it is so ordered. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 31 (Tuesday, February 24, 2015)] [Senate] [Pages S1041-S1043] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] HARRIET TUBMAN AND THE HARRIET TUBMAN UNDERGROUND RAILROAD NATIONAL HISTORICAL PARK Mr. CARDIN.

Tubman once proudly told Frederick Douglass that in all her journeys she ``never lost a single passenger.'' She was so effective that in 1856 there was a $40,000 reward offered for her capture in the South. She is the most famous and the most important conductor of the network of resistance known as the Underground Railroad. But Tubman was more than a conductor on the Underground Railroad. She was a scout and a spy for the Union Army, she was active in the women's suffrage movement after the Civil War, and ultimately she served aging African Americans by running a home for the aged in Auburn, NY. In 1903 she bequeathed the Tubman home to the African Methodist Episcopal Zion Church in Auburn, where it stands to this day. Just this month I was able to attend the midwinter meeting of the Board of Bishops/International Ministers and Lay Association of the AME Zion Church, where we honored Sojourner Truth, Frederick Douglass, and Harriet Tubman. The AME Zion Church, or the ``Freedom Church,'' as many refer to it, was an important part of Harriet Tubman's life and was involved in the forefront of both the abolition and civil rights movements. She was a dedicated member of the church and actively supported the construction of the Thompson AME Church in Auburn, NY, where she lay in state after her death. Harriet Tubman died in Auburn in 1913, and she is buried in the Fort Hill Cemetery. Fortunately, many of the structures and landmarks in New York remain intact, in relatively good condition. For the past 7 years, I have championed legislation to establish the creation of the Harriet Tubman Historical Parks in Maryland and New York. The creation of these parks has been years in the making and long overdue, and I am very grateful for the support my colleagues gave this bill in the last Congress. Recently I was able to celebrate this park's formal designation during a ceremonial event at the Harriet Tubman Museum and Educational Center in Cambridge, MD, just a few miles from where she grew up. I was able to meet some of Harriet Tubman's descendants, which was incredibly meaningful to me. I am so pleased Harriet Tubman's legacy will live on in these parks. My cosponsors and I all share a deep appreciation for how establishing this park is preserving the legacy of this remarkable historic figure in American history and will also show how important this park will be to communities where they are located. Every February our Nation's children learn lessons about the many contributions African Americans have made to our democracy and to the growth and prosperity of our Nation. Preserving places significant to Harriet Tubman's life story for future generations creates a learning opportunity that our kids and grandkids can't get in the classroom or learn from a textbook. The park will educate the public about the historical significance of the Underground Railroad and Harriet Tubman's early life and also is expected to increase tourism, create jobs, and strengthen local economies. The final passage of this bill to create the park was the result of an unyielding bipartisan effort, including Representative Andy Harris, Senator Mikulski, and me, along with our partners from New York, Senators Schumer, Gillibrand, and former Secretary Clinton when she represented New York in this body, along with Congressmen Dan Maffei and Richard Hanna. This was a bipartisan effort and involved Members from both New York and Maryland. The effort on this legislative work was started by my predecessor, Senator Sarbanes, when he passed legislation commissioning the national service to conduct a special resource study on Harriet Tubman. The establishment of the national historical park commemorating the life of Harriet Tubman and protecting the serene and almost untouched landscape is an ideal way to celebrate and honor the outstanding life and incredible work of Harriet Tubman, while establishing an important destination for tourists to come visit, learn, and experience Maryland's Eastern Shore. The vision for the Tubman National Historical Parks is to preserve the places significant to the life of Harriet Tubman and tell her story through interpretive activities, while continuing to discover aspects of her life and the experiences of passage along the Underground Railroad through archaeological research and discovery. The buildings and structures in Maryland have mainly disappeared. Slaves were forced to live in primitive buildings even though many slaves were skilled tradesmen who constructed the substantial homes of their owners. Not surprising, few of the structures associated with the early years of Tubman's life remain standing today. The landscape of the Eastern Shore of Maryland, however, is still evocative of the time when Harriet Tubman lived there. Farm fields and loblolly pine forests dot the lowland landscape, which is also notable for its extensive network of tidal rivers and wetlands that Tubman and the people she guided to freedom used under cover of night. In particular, a number of places significant to Tubman's life--including the homestead of Ben Ross, her father; Stewart's Canal, where he worked; the Brodess Farm, where she worked as a slave; and others--are within the master plan boundaries of the Blackwater National Wildlife Refuge. Similarly, Poplar Neck, the plantation from which she escaped, is still largely intact in Caroline County. The properties in Talbot County, immediately across the Choptank River from the plantation, are currently protected by various conservation easements. Were she alive today, Tubman would recognize much of the landscape that she knew intimately as she secretly led freedom [[Page S1043]] seekers of all ages to the North. This park helps connect people today to America's history. Only recently has the Park Service begun establishing units dedicated to the lives of African Americans. Places such as Booker T. Washington National Monument on the campus of Tuskegee University in Alabama, the George Washington Carver National Monument in Missouri, the National Historic Trail commemorating the march for voting rights from Selma to Montgomery, and most recently the Martin Luther King, Jr. Memorial on the Mall are all important monuments and places of historical significance that help tell the story of the African-American experience. As the National Park Service continues its important work to commemorate and preserve African-American history by providing greater public access and information about the places and people who have shaped the African-American experience, there are very few units dedicated to the lives of African-American women. This historic park is the first national park in honor of a woman--obviously the first historical park for an African-American woman. As we celebrate Black history this month and women's history next month, I cannot think of a more fitting hero than Harriet Tubman to be the first African-American woman to be memorialized with national historical parks. These parks tell both her personal story and her lifelong fight for justice and freedom, from her fight against the cruel institution of slavery and the establishment of the Underground Railroad that she led, to her work in the women's suffrage movement. I encourage my colleagues to seek inspiration from the heroes of their own States and work to preserve the physical remnants of their legacy so that future generations of Americans might better know who helped form this great Nation. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cruz). Without objection, it is so ordered. ____________________",package_114_116.csv,11234,11234,11305,"[congressional record volume 161, number 31 (tuesday, february 24, 2015)] [senate] [pages s1041-s1043] from the congressional record online through the government publishing office [ www.gpo.gov ] harriet tubman and the harriet tubman underground railroad national historical park mr. cardin. mr. president, i rise to celebrate the life of harriet tubman and the establishment of the harriet tubman underground railroad national historical park. harriet tubman was an american hero who championed freedom and was most famously known as a leader of the underground railroad whose roots were on the eastern shore of maryland. harriet tubman was an iconic figure in our nation's history for whom liberty and freedom were not just ideas [[page s1042]] but were god-given rights she fought tirelessly and at great personal peril to spread to others in bondage. the woman who is known to us as harriet tubman was born in approximately 1822 in dorchester county, md, and given the name araminta ``minty'' ross. born into slavery, she spent nearly 30 years of her life toiling for various families on maryland's eastern shore. even as a young, enslaved girl, she demonstrated impressive mental and physical strength. one of her jobs was to set and check muskrat traps in the swamps of the blackwater river during blazing hot summers and freezing cold winters. even though harriet was slight in physical stature, she frequently worked with the men in the forest cutting timber and carrying logs. it was in this work setting, where both free and enslaved people worked together harvesting timber, that she first heard stories about what life was like for free blacks in northern states. as a teenaged slave, one of her first acts of defiance was sticking up for an enslaved boy who was being harassed by a shopkeeper. in helping the boy out of this situation, she took a serious blow to the head when the shopkeeper threw a lead weight that struck her in the head. tubman recalled later in life that the mark of the weight on her skull never fully healed and after this incident she would see visions that later inspired her to escape slavery. as an adult she took the first name harriet, and when she was 24 years old she married john tubman. in her late twenties, harriet tubman escaped from slavery in 1849. she fled in the dead of night, navigating the maze of tidal streams and wetlands that to this day comprise the eastern shore's landscape. she did so alone, demonstrating courage, strength, and fortitude that became her hallmark. not satisfied with attaining her own freedom, she returned repeatedly for more than 10 years to places of her enslavement in dorchester and caroline counties where, under the most adverse conditions, she led away many family members and other slaves to freedom in the northeastern united states and canada. she helped develop a complex network of safe houses and recruited abolitionist sympathizers residing along secret routes connecting the southern slave states and northern free states. no one knows exactly how many people she led to freedom or the number of trips between the north and the south she led, but the legend of her work was an inspiration to the multitude of slaves seeking freedom and to abolitionists fighting to end slavery. tubman became known as the moses of her people by african americans and white abolitionists alike. tubman once proudly told frederick douglass that in all her journeys she ``never lost a single

CREC-2015-02-24-pt1-PgS1043-2,CREC-2015-02-24,114,WORKING TOGETHER FOR AMERICA,"[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 31 (Tuesday, February 24, 2015)] [Senate] [Pages S1043-S1044] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] WORKING TOGETHER FOR AMERICA Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, at a press conference the day after the elections in November, President Obama said: ``I am eager to work with the new Congress to make the next 2 years as productive as possible.'' Well, Republicans couldn't have been happier to hear that. After years of dysfunction in the Democrat-led Senate, Republicans were eager to get Washington working again for Americans and working with the President to get things done for the American people. We are still eager to work with the President, but, unfortunately, despite his words, the President hasn't shown much of an inclination to work with Congress. Between January 7 and February 10 of this year, President Obama issued a total of 13 veto threats. That is more than two veto threats per week during that period. He has announced his intention to veto everything from a bipartisan jobs bill to national security legislation to bills to protect the unborn. And, of course, he has threatened to veto the Keystone XL Pipeline bill--a threat he is likely to make good on this week. One would think that if President Obama were at all serious about wanting to work with Congress, Keystone would be the first bill he would sign. The American people support Keystone by a wide margin. Unions support Keystone because they are eager for the jobs that it would create. Substantial numbers of Democrats support Keystone. Here is what one Democrat had to say about the pipeline: ``We have everything to gain by building this pipeline, especially since it would help create thousands of jobs right here at home and limit our dependence on foreign oil.'' That is from a Democrat here in the Senate. Approving Keystone is a no-brainer. It would support 42,000 jobs during construction, would contribute billions to our economy, and would bring in substantial revenue to State and local governments which would mean more money for local priorities such as schools and teachers, roads and bridges. It would do all of this without spending a dime--not a single dime of taxpayer money. The President's refusal to approve this legislation is a signal of just how unserious he is about wanting to work with Congress to get things done. Unfortunately, after a promising start Democrats in the Senate are starting to imitate President Obama's obstruction. Yesterday Democrats again voted to filibuster the Department of Homeland Security appropriations bill for the fourth time this month. What is their reason? They are desperate to protect the President's Executive action on immigration. Before President Obama decided to implement his Executive amnesty, he said 22 times he did not have the authority to take this action. In fact, in March of 2011 he told an audience: With respect to the notion that I can just suspend deportation through executive order, that is just not the case, because there are laws on the books that Congress has passed. . . . we've got three branches of government. Congress passes the law. The executive branch's job is to enforce and implement those laws. That is from the President of the United States in March of 2011. At least eight Democrats have expressed similar concerns. This is from a Democrat here in the Senate: ``I have to be honest, how this is coming about makes me uncomfortable.'' An independent Senator from Maine stated: ``I also frankly am concerned about the constitutional separation of powers.'' This is an example of the reservations that have been expressed by Democrats right here in the Senate about the President's Executive amnesty. Last week a Federal judge agreed with the legal concerns the President had raised and ordered the administration to halt amnesty proceedings. Despite this, Democrats continue to try to protect funding for the President's unconstitutional action by preventing consideration of the Homeland Security appropriations bill. If Democrats object to parts of the bill, they need to vote to get on the bill so they can offer proposals to amend it. That is the way this place works. Republicans have made it very clear that we are ready and willing to vote on Democratic amendments. The leader on our side has said that when we get on the bill we will alternate amendments. It will be a free-flowing process, just as we committed to when we took the majority in the Senate. The Democrats object to the bill's lack of funding for the President's amnesty. Then they should offer amendments to restore the funding. That is simply how it works in the Senate. All we have to do is get on the bill. That just takes six Democrats to get us onto that legislation to give us an opportunity to actually debate this. When the Republicans took over the Senate in January, we made it our goal to get Washington working again. That is exactly what we have done. Our Democrat-controlled Senate was run on a strictly partisan line basis. The minority party was shut out of the debate and the amendment process, and the Senate spent much of its time on narrow, partisan legislation. Under Republican control the Senate floor has become once again an open forum for debate and amendments by Members of both parties. Republicans have allowed almost three times as many amendments in January alone as Democrats allowed in the entire calendar year of 2014. The Keystone XL Pipeline bill was passed with bipartisan support with amendments from Members of both parties. Republicans are eager to continue this bipartisan process going forward. That is why the obstruction of [[Page S1044]] the President and the Democrats in this particular circumstance is so disappointing. Nobody around here expects Democrats and Republicans to always agree. They certainly don't expect the President to never issue a veto threat. But the President's apparent determination to obstruct everything is pretty discouraging. If the President continues to make veto threats at the same rate he has so far, we will be looking at almost 90 veto threats by the end of 2015. The American people deserve and expect better. Americans sent a clear message in the last election. They were tired of business as usual in Washington. They want Members of Congress and the President to work together to address the challenges facing our Nation. Clearly, the President still hasn't managed to process that message. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 31 (Tuesday, February 24, 2015)] [Senate] [Pages S1043-S1044] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] WORKING TOGETHER FOR AMERICA Mr. THUNE.

That is why the obstruction of [[Page S1044]] the President and the Democrats in this particular circumstance is so disappointing. Nobody around here expects Democrats and Republicans to always agree. They certainly don't expect the President to never issue a veto threat. But the President's apparent determination to obstruct everything is pretty discouraging. If the President continues to make veto threats at the same rate he has so far, we will be looking at almost 90 veto threats by the end of 2015. The American people deserve and expect better. Americans sent a clear message in the last election. They were tired of business as usual in Washington. They want Members of Congress and the President to work together to address the challenges facing our Nation. Clearly, the President still hasn't managed to process that message. ____________________",package_114_116.csv,6542,6542,6613,"[congressional record volume 161, number 31 (tuesday, february 24, 2015)] [senate] [pages s1043-s1044] from the congressional record online through the government publishing office [ www.gpo.gov ] working together for america mr. thune. mr. president, at a press conference the day after the elections in november, president obama said: ``i am eager to work with the new congress to make the next 2 years as productive as possible.'' well, republicans couldn't have been happier to hear that. after years of dysfunction in the democrat-led senate, republicans were eager to get washington working again for americans and working with the president to get things done for the american people. we are still eager to work with the president, but, unfortunately, despite his words, the president hasn't shown much of an inclination to work with congress. between january 7 and february 10 of this year, president obama issued a total of 13 veto threats. that is more than two veto threats per week during that period. he has announced his intention to veto everything from a bipartisan jobs bill to national security legislation to bills to protect the unborn. and, of course, he has threatened to veto the keystone xl pipeline bill--a threat he is likely to make good on this week. one would think that if president obama were at all serious about wanting to work with congress, keystone would be the first bill he would sign. the american people support keystone by a wide margin. unions support keystone because they are eager for the jobs that it would create. substantial numbers of democrats support keystone. here is what one democrat had to say about the pipeline: ``we have everything to gain by building this pipeline, especially since it would help create thousands of jobs right here at home and limit our dependence on foreign oil.'' that is from a democrat here in the senate. approving keystone is a no-brainer. it would support 42,000 jobs during construction, would contribute billions to our economy, and would bring in substantial revenue to state and local governments which would mean more money for local priorities such as schools and teachers, roads and bridges. it would do all of this without spending a dime--not a single dime of taxpayer money. the president's refusal to approve this legislation is a signal of just how unserious he is about wanting to work with congress to get things done. unfortunately, after a promising start democrats in the senate are starting to imitate president obama's obstruction. yesterday democrats again voted to filibuster the department of homeland security appropriations bill for the fourth time this month. what is their reason? they are desperate to protect the president's executive action on immigration. before president obama decided to implement his executive amnesty, he said 22 times he did not have the authority to take this action. in fact, in march of 2011 he told an audience: with respect to the notion that i can just suspend deportation through executive order, that is just not the case, because there are laws on the books that congress has passed. . . . we've got three branches of government. congress passes the law. the executive branch's job is to enforce and implement those laws. that is from the president of the united states in march of 2011. at least eight democrats have expressed similar concerns. this is from a democrat here in the senate: ``i have to be honest, how this is coming about makes me uncomfortable.'' an independent senator from maine stated: ``i also frankly am concerned about the constitutional separation of powers.'' this is an example of the reservations that have been expressed by democrats right here in the senate about the president's executive amnesty. last week a federal judge agreed with the legal concerns the president had raised and ordered the administration to halt amnesty proceedings. despite this, democrats continue to try to protect funding for the president's unconstitutional action by preventing consideration of the homeland security appropriations bill. if democrats object to parts of the bill, they need to vote to get on the bill so they can offer proposals to amend it. that is the way this place works. republicans have made it very clear that we are ready and willing to vote on democratic amendments. the leader on our side has said that when we get on the bill we will alternate amendments. it will be a free-flowing process, just as we committed to when we took the majority in the senate. the democrats object to the bill's lack of funding for the president's amnesty. then they should offer amendments to restore the funding. that is simply how it works in the senate. all we have to do is get on the bill. that just takes six democrats to get us onto that legislation to give us an opportunity to actually debate this. when the republicans took over the senate in january, we made it our goal to get washington working again. that is exactly what we have done. our democrat-controlled senate was run on a strictly partisan line basis. the minority party was shut out of the debate and the amendment process, and the senate spent much of its time on narrow, partisan legislation. under republican control the senate floor has become once again an open forum for debate and amendments by members of both parties. republicans have allowed almost three times as many amendments in january alone as democrats allowed in the entire calendar year of 2014. the keystone xl pipeline bill was passed with bipartisan support with amendments from members of both parties. republicans are eager to continue this bipartisan process going forward. that is why the obstruction of [[page s1044]] the president and the democrats in this particular circumstance is so disappointing. nobody around here expects democrats and republicans to always agree. they certainly don't expect the president to never issue a veto threat. but the president's apparent determination to obstruct everything is pretty discouraging. if the president continues to make veto threats at the same rate he has so far, we will be looking at almost 90 veto threats by the end of 2015. the american people deserve and expect better. americans sent a clear message in the last election. they were tired of business as usual in washington. they want members of congress and the president to work together to address the challenges facing our nation. clearly, the president still hasn't managed to process that message. ____________________",6542

The Congress has received the President's request for authorization for the use of military force in Iraq and Syria, and we will take a hard look at this request. But we still haven't seen a comprehensive strategy from the President for confronting and defeating ISIS. ISIS represents a barely comprehensible level of evil. Wherever its members go they leave a trail of blood. Their reign of terror in the Middle East has included the systematic persecution and murder of Christians and other minorities, rape, torture, burnings, beheadings, as well as reports of the crucifixion and burying alive of children. Just 2 weeks ago ISIS beheaded 21 Coptic Christians in Libya. The men's only crime was professing their faith. This morning's news included reports of another 90 Assyrian Christians being abducted by ISIS from a village in northern Syria. My heart sinks each time I hear any report of abductions of this nature because we know the fate that is likely in store for these people. Evil like this cannot be ignored. It must be confronted. The United States should be a leader in the effort to defeat this hellish organization and its reign of brutality. The President should have articulated a plan for responding to ISIS months ago, but, unfortunately, his lack of decision is par for the course when it comes to this administration's foreign policy. Time and again, the President has been confronted with a foreign policy crisis and has simply failed to respond. That needs to end now.

Mr. President, this week marks the final week of Black History Month, an annual tradition that celebrates Black history and culture but also is a call to action to continue our Nation's march, as halting as it sometimes is, toward equality. This week we take an important step toward awarding a Congressional Gold Medal to the foot soldiers who participated in Bloody Sunday, Turnaround Tuesday, or the Selma to Montgomery Voting Rights March. Senator Scott and I and Senators Shelby and Sessions and the banking committee moved forward on that earlier today. I am proud to be one of the 65 cosponsors. I am also introducing a resolution this week instructing the Postal Service to issue a commemorative stamp honoring the 50th anniversary of the Selma marches. It is far past time for us to honor the brave men and women who risked life and limb to demand full participation in our democracy. We can do this on the Senate floor. We can do it by traveling to Selma. Next week Senator Scott and I will lead a delegation to Selma for the anniversary of the march. I understand my colleague from Ohio may be joining us. I took my daughters Emily and Elizabeth there a number of years ago. I look forward to the journey to Selma with my wife in a couple of weeks, marking the 50th anniversary. Fifty years ago, Dr. King led thousands in that 54-mile march--the second Selma bridge crossing, if you will. They arrived in Montgomery 4 days later to a crowd of 25,000 Black and White supporters. In his speech that day, Dr. King told a story of one of the marchers: Sister Pollard, a 70-year-old African-American women who lived in Montgomery during the bus boycott a little less than a decade earlier. She was asked if she wanted a ride during the march instead of walking. She said: ``No.'' The person said: ``Aren't you tired?'' She said: ``My feet are tired, but my soul is rested.'' Progress is never easy, and as we celebrate Black History Month, we are reminded of the long journey we have traveled and how far we still have to go. This month we celebrate the contributions African Americans have made to the fabric of our Nation. When Carter G. Woodson started what became Black History Month in 1926, my State of Ohio--the Presiding Officer's State--had already produced 19th-century poet Paul Laurence Dunbar; Columbus native Granville T. Woods had already invented the telegraph device that sent messages between moving trains and train stations; Mary Jane Patterson had already become the first Black woman to graduate from Oberlin College, in my part of Ohio; Garrett Morgan, a Clevelander, had already invented the traffic signal; Ohio State Representative John P. Green had introduced a bill to establish Labor Day in Ohio, which later became Labor Day, which we all celebrate; and COL Charles Young, who found freedom in Ripley, OH, in the Presiding Officer's old congressional district, became the highest ranking African-American commanding officer in the U.S. Army in 1894--120 years ago--and the first African-American superintendent of a national park. This month we celebrate these and other pioneering Ohioans: two Pulitzer Prize winners--Nobel Prize-winning writer Toni Morrison from Lorain and former Poet Laureate of the United States Rita Dove from Akron. Olympic Gold Medalist Jesse Owens grew up in Cleveland. Jesse Owens spoke at my brother's high school graduation in Mansfield. Howard Arthur Tibbs from Salem served with the Tuskegee Airmen, and I was honored to meet his family in 2007 when this body posthumously awarded him the Congressional Gold Medal. [[Page S1045]] Congressman Louis Stokes, who so many in this body know, rose from one of the first Federal housing projects in the Nation, in Cleveland, to prominence as a lawyer and legislator. Yesterday Louis Stokes celebrated his 90th birthday. He argued before the Supreme Court in his legal practice, and during his two decades in Congress he was a forceful advocate for the city he loves. This month we honor them and many others. These achievements have come in the face of centuries of oppression, making these achievements all the more remarkable. They have not come to be recognized simply through chance. It took a century of concerted effort--longer than that, really--led by Black Americans such as Dr. King, to give voice to the struggles and the stories, the triumphs and the traditions of the African Americans who have shaped who we are as a country and as a people. These stories are the ones we celebrate this month and the ones we must do more to honor and tell. This month I am introducing legislation to begin the process of designating the Parker House in Ripley, OH, as a national monument. John Parker was a slave who purchased his freedom, became a successful businessman, and helped many others to freedom on the Underground Railroad through crossing the Ohio River and heading north, some to Oberlin and ultimately many to Canada. Stories such as these are too often untold and overlooked. They show us how African Americans have shaped their own destiny in this country. I hope today my colleagues will join me in honoring the African Americans who have made us who we are as a nation. I would add that I hope this 50th anniversary, this trip that a number of colleagues and I will take to Selma, will mark progress in voting rights. We took huge strides in voting rights in the last 50 years. In fact, in 1964 it was a conservative Republican Congressman from north of Dayton by the name of William McCullough, who was the senior Republican on the House Judiciary Committee--Jacqueline Kennedy and others credited Congressman McCullough, perhaps more than any other single Member--even more than Hubert Humphrey or Everett Dirksen--for the Civil Rights Act and Voting Rights Act passing the U.S. House of Representatives and the Senate and being signed by the President. Unfortunately, in the last few years we have seen State legislators and far too many Members of this body try to scale back and roll back some of those gains in voting rights--all in the name of stopping fraud, when in fact voting fraud is much exaggerated by them. It barely exists. But the efforts to roll back voting rights has resulted from that. It is wrong, and it is shameful, especially as we celebrate the 50th anniversary. I am hopeful we can move forward in spite of what this very conservative Supreme Court has done, move forward in voting rights as we honor Black History Month, as we honor 50 years of Selma, and as we honor the work African Americans and Whites have done to make this country a better place to live. Mr. President, I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority whip. Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, as my colleagues know, for weeks now Senate Democrats have repeatedly blocked the Senate from even considering a $40 billion funding bill for the Department of Homeland Security that would extend through the end of the fiscal year, the end of September. They have done it not once, not twice, not three times, but four times. Four times they have filibustered this Department of Homeland Security funding bill that would pay the salaries of the men and women who protect our ports, our airports, and our border. Meanwhile, our friends across the aisle are telling the American people: No, it is not us blocking this funding, it is the Republicans. Well, I beg to differ. The House of Representatives has actually passed a Homeland Security appropriations bill--the bill we tried to get on four different times and the Democrats don't seem satisfied with the ability to offer amendments to change it or modify it in any way that they can command 60 votes to do. Their attitude is: We are not even going to consider it unless we get everything we want right upfront. I guess I can kind of understand why they are of that frame of mind because over the last few years, the Senate has become completely dysfunctional. Under the previous majority leader, there wasn't any opportunity to offer amendments and get votes on those amendments on legislation. It was a ``my way or the highway'' proposition. In other words, what I am saying is the Senate was broken, and after years of running the Senate as an incumbent protection program and voting on only poll-tested messages and blocking amendments, last November the American people said, enough is enough; no more dysfunction. Let's have a Senate and a Congress that represents our interests, not the interests of protecting incumbents against taking tough votes. I believe our colleagues who have blocked consideration of this funding amendment should be, frankly, ashamed of themselves. It doesn't seem as though they have gotten the message. The senior Senator from New York, Senator Schumer, who is a member of the leadership and my friend, told the Huffington Post recently that ``it is really fun to be in the minority.'' By that, I guess he means it is fun to block Homeland Security appropriations bills not once, not twice, not three times, but four separate times. But filibustering this critical funding for the men and women who protect us every day is not my idea of fun, nor is it, I suspect, for the thousands of men and women who work in the Department of Homeland Security, from the Coast Guard to the Border Patrol to all of the people who work day in and day out to try and help keep us safe in the homeland. When given the opportunity four times over the last few weeks to fully fund the Department of Homeland Security while rolling back the President's unconstitutional Executive action, four times Senate Democrats have taken the low road and continued to obstruct. Over the last several weeks, we pointed out the tough talk that came from some Senate Democrats last fall when the President issued his Executive action on immigration back when the President made his intent clear to follow through with a series of unilateral actions that he had previously said, on 22 different occasions, he didn't have the authority to do. Twenty-two times the President said publicly he didn't have the authority to do it, and last November, after being encouraged to wait until after the election so it didn't have a negative blowback on people running for the Senate, he went ahead and did it anyway. As I noted before, some of our colleagues on the other side expressed their concerns at the time. Some said it made them feel uncomfortable, and some said: I wish he wouldn't do it. Well, no kidding. When the President usurps the authority given under the Constitution to the legislative branch of government and seeks to arrogate to himself the power to unilaterally change the law, they should feel uncomfortable. One by one these same folks who were so concerned and so uncomfortable with what the President did last November have come down to the floor and voted in lockstep. They voted, in effect, to reaffirm the President's actions. In justifying these votes, we heard the common refrain, we don't necessarily agree with the President's Executive actions, but an appropriations bill is not the proper vehicle to address them. That is what they said time and time again. So now we have a pretty simple and straightforward message to our Democratic friends who were so concerned and so uncomfortable and who wished the President had not gone around Congress on immigration. We are here to say: Here is your chance. This week the Senate will take up a bill that will address the President's Executive actions that were announced last November. Senator McConnell, the majority leader, made it clear last night that this targeted bill is not tied to the Department of Homeland Security funding. Under the regular rules of the Senate, the process he set in order last night will come to fruition on Friday, and that will be the time for all of our colleagues on this side of the aisle and [[Page S1046]] the ones on the other side of the aisle who expressed disapproval of the President's Executive action to vote for a bill that expresses that disapproval--the so-called Collins bill. My strong preference would be to pass the House bill--that has been filibustered four separate times by our Democratic friends--because it fully funds the Department while reining in the President's overreach. But since the Democrats have refused on four different occasions to even allow the bill to come to the floor with the excuse that it is tied to the Department of Homeland Security funding, we are going to give them an opportunity to put their money where their mouth is. In other words, we are going to see if they can take yes for an answer. If all of the occasions where my colleagues said they were uncomfortable with the President's actions are not enough--if the 22 times the President himself said he didn't have the authority to issue this Executive action--well, we now know that during the recess last week a Federal judge in Texas has given us one more reason. A week ago U.S. District Judge Andrew Hanen in Brownsville, TX, ruled in a lawsuit brought by 26 different States, including Texas, that what the President did was illegal. He issued a temporary injunction blocking implementation of the President's Executive action. If that were the end of it, any amount of money that was appropriated by the Congress to fund the Department of Homeland Security could not legally be used to fund the President's Executive action because there is an injunction in place issued by a Federal court that says you can't do it, and, indeed, the administration has acknowledged that. They stood down, but now they have come back to the judge and asked for a stay of the judge's temporary injunction. They said if they don't get that, they will go to the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals in New Orleans and ask the appellate court to stay the judge's temporary injunction. Judge Hanen's ruling enforces what I and many others have been saying for a long time, that the President acted outside of the law when he went around Congress to unilaterally change our Nation's immigration laws. But the judge's ruling gets to a broader issue, and there is one part of it that I found particularly important. In writing his opinion explaining his ruling, Judge Hanen looked at the Obama administration's case and imagined how you could take their argument and apply it across the board. It is easy to overlook and overreach what the President has said if you perhaps agree with what he actually accomplished, which is, in effect, to give legal status to roughly 5 million people. If you think that is a good idea, you are likely to turn a blind eye to the way the President did it. But if the courts establish the precedent that this President--or any future President, Republican or Democrat--can pick and choose which laws to enforce, what could end up happening? Well, it doesn't take a lot of imagination. Judge Hanen writes: ``then a lack of resources''--which is the argument that was made by the administration--``would be an acceptable reason to cease enforcing environmental laws, or the Voting Rights Act, or even the various laws that protect civil rights and equal opportunity.'' That is what Judge Hanen said in his opinion in repudiating the argument made by the administration that the President had this authority and talked about what kind of dangerous precedent it would set if it were accepted by the court as legal. I am sure I am not the only one who would hate to see our country head down that sort of lawless path where the laws don't make any difference, it is just the preference of whoever is President which determines the direction the country should take. That is a dangerous path. It is completely inconsistent with who we are as a country that believes in the rule of law. So now that the President's actions have been settled in the court of public opinion, where they are deeply unpopular, and ruled upon by a court of law, my friends from the other side of the aisle need to take note because they have a very clear choice. They can continue to give excuses for why they are filibustering this $40 billion Homeland Security appropriations bill or, as I said, they can put their money where their mouth is and vote to stop the President's 2014 Executive action separate and apart from any issue of funding of the Department of Homeland Security. At the end of the day, the Senate will make sure the people who protect our borders and our ports and our skies get paid because that is the responsible thing to do. Senate Democrats, who were so concerned and so uncomfortable with what the President did last fall, are out of excuses, and they are going to have a chance to vote on the Collins amendment on Friday or at some other time mutually agreed upon by the majority and the minority. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democratic leader is recognized. Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I listened carefully to the remarks of my friend and my colleague from Texas. If my friend has a moment as he walks out this door, he should take a sharp left and stop at the staircase and look up. At the top of the staircase the Senator from Texas will see this amazing portrait that has been copied and referred to over and over again. It is an incredible painting that shows President Abraham Lincoln signing the Emancipation Proclamation in the midst of the Civil War while surrounded by his Cabinet. This Emancipation Proclamation freed 3 million slaves in America from involuntary servitude. Was the President signing a bill that had been passed by Congress? No. He was signing an Executive order--the same type of Executive order used by President Obama to address the issue of immigration. All right, Senator Durbin, you found one moment in history. According to arguments you heard on the floor, there could not be very many more. Let's fast forward to the late 1940s with President Harry Truman. President Harry Truman, after World War II, decided to finally end racial discrimination in the ranks of our military. How did he do it? Did he do it by signing a law passed by Congress? No. He signed an Executive order ending the discrimination and segregation taking place in our military. I don't argue that Presidents can exceed their constitutional powers. It has happened. But to argue that Executive orders that have been used by President after President are inherently unconstitutional defies any accurate, honest reading of history. Here are some realities. The immigration system in the United States of America today is broken--broken terribly--to the point where we may have 12 to 13 million undocumented people in this country, where our borders are stronger now than they have ever been, but still have to be fortified to make sure we don't have the unnecessary migration of people into the United States in an illegal status. There are so many things we need to do to fix this broken immigration system, and we addressed them. Two years ago eight Senators came together--four Democrats and four Republicans. I was honored to be part of it. We sat down for months and wrote a comprehensive immigration reform bill. We brought it to the floor of the Senate after considering 100 amendments in the Senate Judiciary Committee, and it passed on the floor with 68 positive votes. Fourteen Republicans joined the Democrats for the bipartisan bill which was supported by the Chamber of Commerce, the AFL-CIO, and conservatives and liberals across America. Pretty good work for a Congress that is blamed many times for just being obstructionists. We passed it with 68 votes, sent it to the House of Representatives, where it languished for almost 2 years, never being called for a vote--never. At that point the President stepped forward and said: I have to do something to deal with the problems of illegal immigration in America. Here is what he proposed--two things, basically. He said: If you are here in America and are the parent of a child who is a U.S. citizen or the parent of a child who is a legal resident alien, you can come forward, pay about $500 as a fee, subject yourself to a criminal background check. If you clear it or you committed no serious crimes and are no threat to America, then we will give you a temporary work permit to be in [[Page S1047]] the United States and work. We want to know who you are, where you live, the members of your family, and where you work. That is what the President proposed, and that is what they want to stop. We would continue the current situation with millions of undocumented people working without background checks, working without any registration to this government, so we know their whereabouts and what they do. That is what they want to end. They think the President went way too far in setting up this process. I think they are wrong. The Republicans had a chance to pass a comprehensive immigration bill and they refused. In refusing, they left the President no alternative. He is trying to make sense out of a broken immigration system. It would be better if the Republicans joined us in the House and the Senate in a bipartisan effort to achieve that. The last point I want to make is this: I think one of the most heartless things I have seen in my time in the House and Senate is the effort by the Republicans to end DACA. DACA was the protection the President gave to DREAMers. DREAMers are children brought to America-- children, infants, toddlers, and young kids--by their parents, who grew up in America and went to school, have no serious criminal issues in their background, and who simply want the chance to be part of America's future. That is all they are asking for. The President's Executive order gives them that chance to prove themselves, and the Republicans want to eliminate that order. I don't understand it. If they take the time to meet some of these young people, they would realize what a waste it would be of such great skill and talent and love of America. I will close--and I see my friend and colleague Senator Murray--and say this: We are a nation of immigrants. Our diversity is our strength. The people who are willing to risk everything in their lives to come to this country, to be part of this great American experiment, to have an opportunity for their next generation to have a chance for a better life, that is what defines us. That is who we are. I stand here--and I have said it so many times and proudly so--the son of an immigrant mother who was brought here at the age of 2. She was the first DREAMer in my house, and she raised a son to serve in the U.S. Senate. That is my story. That is my family's story. That is America's story. It is time for us to fund the Department of Homeland Security and protect America and then have an honest debate about an immigration policy consistent with American values. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington. Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Illinois for his passionate remarks. That rings so true to all of us. I thank him for all his work on the DREAM Act and making sure young people who are raised in this country have the opportunities that all of us do. As we count down the final days before funding for the Department of Homeland Security potentially runs out, I want to take a few minutes to talk about how we got to this point. As this deadline gets closer and closer, I have been continually reminded we have been down this road many times before. This is a manufactured crisis, and it is no different than so many others we have faced in Congress over the last few years. What is happening in Congress right now is not a debate over government spending policies or priorities. That much is certain. This is not a debate over how the Department of Homeland Security should function. It is certainly not a debate about our national security. This is, pure and simple, a political fight Republicans are having with themselves across the two Chambers of the Capitol and across the different factions of the Republican Party. That is not the case for every Republican in the Senate. Several Members have said clearly we should fund the Department of Homeland Security without any strings attached. The fact remains some Republicans are making it clear they are willing to hold hostage the basic operation of our government over rightwing politics and nothing else. While this process might seem complicated, it is actually very simple. Democrats--along with national security experts, law enforcement experts, State and local officials, and three former Secretaries of Homeland Security, including two Republicans--want to do nothing more than fund the Department of Homeland Security cleanly, no strings or unrelated political amendments attached. But because they are so angry about the President's actions months ago to improve our country's immigration laws, some Republicans are demanding to pass a bill that will tear apart families who are working hard to make it in America, put our security at risk, and seriously threaten all of the work we have done recently--including the budget agreement I reached with Congressman Paul Ryan--to keep our government functioning. That is not only bad policy. It doesn't make any sense. The bill passed by Speaker Boehner and House Republicans would be devastating to families across the country, and it would make day-to- day operations for the Department of Homeland Security needlessly difficult. For example, TSA agents who work to keep our airports safe and secure would be forced to work without pay. These men and women should be worrying about doing their jobs, not knowing whether they are going to be able to pay their bills and put food on their table. That is not what we want them worrying about. But because of political pressure from the extreme anti-immigration, rightwing party, that is what Republican leaders in the House are demanding. This looming shutdown of the Department of Homeland Security has become to them nothing more than collateral damage. The national impacts of not funding the Department of Homeland Security have been discussed for weeks now. This would also cause problems all the way down to individual fire departments in our local communities. Right now the Whatcom County Fire District 18 located in my State-- close to the northern Canadian border and it is about an hour north of Seattle--is applying for an assistance to firefighters grant which is funded through the Department of Homeland Security. This is a very rural fire district. They only have one paid employee--it happens to be the fire chief--along with a volunteer firefighting force of 16 and a volunteer EMT force of 6. They have applied for a very small $24,000 Federal grant to replace their heavily used and outdated equipment--everything from boots and helmets to gloves and fire hoods--that are now over 11 years old. I have been working with them to help them get that needed equipment which protects those volunteers who put their lives on the line to save others, but if Congress does not fund this department those grants are at risk. That is unacceptable. It is proof this political mess the Republicans have made is not a hypothetical problem. It is something that will have real impacts on every one of our communities across the country. My colleagues are not going to give in and let the Republicans play politics with the Department of Homeland Security. For years now we have seen that strategy doesn't work. It holds us back. I am encouraged the majority leader has said they are willing to bring up a clean Department of Homeland Security appropriations bill to the floor. We need the same commitment from the Speaker of the House of Representatives. Time is running out. The country is waiting. We need to fund Homeland Security. I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Ernst). Without objection, it is so ordered. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 31 (Tuesday, February 24, 2015)] [Senate] [Pages S1044-S1047] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2015--MOTION TO PROCEED--Continued The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Without objection, it is so ordered. Black History Month Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, this week marks the final week of Black History Month, an annual tradition that celebrates Black history and culture but also is a call to action to continue our Nation's march, as halting as it sometimes is, toward equality. This week we take an important step toward awarding a Congressional Gold Medal to the foot soldiers who participated in Bloody Sunday, Turnaround Tuesday, or the Selma to Montgomery Voting Rights March. Senator Scott and I and Senators Shelby and Sessions and the banking committee moved forward on that earlier today. I am proud to be one of the 65 cosponsors. I am also introducing a resolution this week instructing the Postal Service to issue a commemorative stamp honoring the 50th anniversary of the Selma marches. It is far past time for us to honor the brave men and women who risked life and limb to demand full participation in our democracy. We can do this on the Senate floor. We can do it by traveling to Selma. Next week Senator Scott and I will lead a delegation to Selma for the anniversary of the march. I understand my colleague from Ohio may be joining us. I took my daughters Emily and Elizabeth there a number of years ago. I look forward to the journey to Selma with my wife in a couple of weeks, marking the 50th anniversary. Fifty years ago, Dr. King led thousands in that 54-mile march--the second Selma bridge crossing, if you will. They arrived in Montgomery 4 days later to a crowd of 25,000 Black and White supporters. In his speech that day, Dr. King told a story of one of the marchers: Sister Pollard, a 70-year-old African-American women who lived in Montgomery during the bus boycott a little less than a decade earlier. She was asked if she wanted a ride during the march instead of walking. She said: ``No.'' The person said: ``Aren't you tired?'' She said: ``My feet are tired, but my soul is rested.'' Progress is never easy, and as we celebrate Black History Month, we are reminded of the long journey we have traveled and how far we still have to go. This month we celebrate the contributions African Americans have made to the fabric of our Nation. When Carter G. Woodson started what became Black History Month in 1926, my State of Ohio--the Presiding Officer's State--had already produced 19th-century poet Paul Laurence Dunbar; Columbus native Granville T. Woods had already invented the telegraph device that sent messages between moving trains and train stations; Mary Jane Patterson had already become the first Black woman to graduate from Oberlin College, in my part of Ohio; Garrett Morgan, a Clevelander, had already invented the traffic signal; Ohio State Representative John P. Green had introduced a bill to establish Labor Day in Ohio, which later became Labor Day, which we all celebrate; and COL Charles Young, who found freedom in Ripley, OH, in the Presiding Officer's old congressional district, became the highest ranking African-American commanding officer in the U.S. Army in 1894--120 years ago--and the first African-American superintendent of a national park. This month we celebrate these and other pioneering Ohioans: two Pulitzer Prize winners--Nobel Prize-winning writer Toni Morrison from Lorain and former Poet Laureate of the United States Rita Dove from Akron. Olympic Gold Medalist Jesse Owens grew up in Cleveland. Jesse Owens spoke at my brother's high school graduation in Mansfield.

Mr. President, as my colleagues know, for weeks now Senate Democrats have repeatedly blocked the Senate from even considering a $40 billion funding bill for the Department of Homeland Security that would extend through the end of the fiscal year, the end of September. They have done it not once, not twice, not three times, but four times. Four times they have filibustered this Department of Homeland Security funding bill that would pay the salaries of the men and women who protect our ports, our airports, and our border.

They voted, in effect, to reaffirm the President's actions. In justifying these votes, we heard the common refrain, we don't necessarily agree with the President's Executive actions, but an appropriations bill is not the proper vehicle to address them. That is what they said time and time again. So now we have a pretty simple and straightforward message to our Democratic friends who were so concerned and so uncomfortable and who wished the President had not gone around Congress on immigration. We are here to say: Here is your chance. This week the Senate will take up a bill that will address the President's Executive actions that were announced last November. Senator McConnell, the majority leader, made it clear last night that this targeted bill is not tied to the Department of Homeland Security funding. Under the regular rules of the Senate, the process he set in order last night will come to fruition on Friday, and that will be the time for all of our colleagues on this side of the aisle and [[Page S1046]] the ones on the other side of the aisle who expressed disapproval of the President's Executive action to vote for a bill that expresses that disapproval--the so-called Collins bill. My strong preference would be to pass the House bill--that has been filibustered four separate times by our Democratic friends--because it fully funds the Department while reining in the President's overreach. But since the Democrats have refused on four different occasions to even allow the bill to come to the floor with the excuse that it is tied to the Department of Homeland Security funding, we are going to give them an opportunity to put their money where their mouth is. In other words, we are going to see if they can take yes for an answer. If all of the occasions where my colleagues said they were uncomfortable with the President's actions are not enough--if the 22 times the President himself said he didn't have the authority to issue this Executive action--well, we now know that during the recess last week a Federal judge in Texas has given us one more reason. A week ago U.S. District Judge Andrew Hanen in Brownsville, TX, ruled in a lawsuit brought by 26 different States, including Texas, that what the President did was illegal. He issued a temporary injunction blocking implementation of the President's Executive action. If that were the end of it, any amount of money that was appropriated by the Congress to fund the Department of Homeland Security could not legally be used to fund the President's Executive action because there is an injunction in place issued by a Federal court that says you can't do it, and, indeed, the administration has acknowledged that. They stood down, but now they have come back to the judge and asked for a stay of the judge's temporary injunction. They said if they don't get that, they will go to the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals in New Orleans and ask the appellate court to stay the judge's temporary injunction. Judge Hanen's ruling enforces what I and many others have been saying for a long time, that the President acted outside of the law when he went around Congress to unilaterally change our Nation's immigration laws. But the judge's ruling gets to a broader issue, and there is one part of it that I found particularly important. In writing his opinion explaining his ruling, Judge Hanen looked at the Obama administration's case and imagined how you could take their argument and apply it across the board. It is easy to overlook and overreach what the President has said if you perhaps agree with what he actually accomplished, which is, in effect, to give legal status to roughly 5 million people. If you think that is a good idea, you are likely to turn a blind eye to the way the President did it. But if the courts establish the precedent that this President--or any future President, Republican or Democrat--can pick and choose which laws to enforce, what could end up happening? Well, it doesn't take a lot of imagination. Judge Hanen writes: ``then a lack of resources''--which is the argument that was made by the administration--``would be an acceptable reason to cease enforcing environmental laws, or the Voting Rights Act, or even the various laws that protect civil rights and equal opportunity.'' That is what Judge Hanen said in his opinion in repudiating the argument made by the administration that the President had this authority and talked about what kind of dangerous precedent it would set if it were accepted by the court as legal. I am sure I am not the only one who would hate to see our country head down that sort of lawless path where the laws don't make any difference, it is just the preference of whoever is President which determines the direction the country should take. That is a dangerous path. It is completely inconsistent with who we are as a country that believes in the rule of law. So now that the President's actions have been settled in the court of public opinion, where they are deeply unpopular, and ruled upon by a court of law, my friends from the other side of the aisle need to take note because they have a very clear choice. They can continue to give excuses for why they are filibustering this $40 billion Homeland Security appropriations bill or, as I said, they can put their money where their mouth is and vote to stop the President's 2014 Executive action separate and apart from any issue of funding of the Department of Homeland Security. At the end of the day, the Senate will make sure the people who protect our borders and our ports and our skies get paid because that is the responsible thing to do. Senate Democrats, who were so concerned and so uncomfortable with what the President did last fall, are out of excuses, and they are going to have a chance to vote on the Collins amendment on Friday or at some other time mutually agreed upon by the majority and the minority. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democratic leader is recognized. Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I listened carefully to the remarks of my friend and my colleague from Texas. If my friend has a moment as he walks out this door, he should take a sharp left and stop at the staircase and look up. At the top of the staircase the Senator from Texas will see this amazing portrait that has been copied and referred to over and over again. It is an incredible painting that shows President Abraham Lincoln signing the Emancipation Proclamation in the midst of the Civil War while surrounded by his Cabinet. This Emancipation Proclamation freed 3 million slaves in America from involuntary servitude. Was the President signing a bill that had been passed by Congress? No. He was signing an Executive order--the same type of Executive order used by President Obama to address the issue of immigration. All right, Senator Durbin, you found one moment in history. According to arguments you heard on the floor, there could not be very many more. Let's fast forward to the late 1940s with President Harry Truman. President Harry Truman, after World War II, decided to finally end racial discrimination in the ranks of our military. How did he do it? Did he do it by signing a law passed by Congress? No. He signed an Executive order ending the discrimination and segregation taking place in our military. I don't argue that Presidents can exceed their constitutional powers. It has happened. But to argue that Executive orders that have been used by President after President are inherently unconstitutional defies any accurate, honest reading of history. Here are some realities. The immigration system in the United States of America today is broken--broken terribly--to the point where we may have 12 to 13 million undocumented people in this country, where our borders are stronger now than they have ever been, but still have to be fortified to make sure we don't have the unnecessary migration of people into the United States in an illegal status. There are so many things we need to do to fix this broken immigration system, and we addressed them. Two years ago eight Senators came together--four Democrats and four Republicans. I was honored to be part of it. We sat down for months and wrote a comprehensive immigration reform bill. We brought it to the floor of the Senate after considering 100 amendments in the Senate Judiciary Committee, and it passed on the floor with 68 positive votes. Fourteen Republicans joined the Democrats for the bipartisan bill which was supported by the Chamber of Commerce, the AFL-CIO, and conservatives and liberals across America. Pretty good work for a Congress that is blamed many times for just being obstructionists. We passed it with 68 votes, sent it to the House of Representatives, where it languished for almost 2 years, never being called for a vote--never. At that point the President stepped forward and said: I have to do something to deal with the problems of illegal immigration in America. Here is what he proposed--two things, basically. He said: If you are here in America and are the parent of a child who is a U.S. citizen or the parent of a child who is a legal resident alien, you can come forward, pay about $500 as a fee, subject yourself to a criminal background check. If you clear it or you committed no serious crimes and are no threat to America, then we will give you a temporary work permit to be in [[Page S1047]] the United States and work. We want to know who you are, where you live, the members of your family, and where you work. That is what the President proposed, and that is what they want to stop. We would continue the current situation with millions of undocumented people working without background checks, working without any registration to this government, so we know their whereabouts and what they do. That is what they want to end. They think the President went way too far in setting up this process. I think they are wrong. The Republicans had a chance to pass a comprehensive immigration bill and they refused. In refusing, they left the President no alternative. He is trying to make sense out of a broken immigration system. It would be better if the Republicans joined us in the House and the Senate in a bipartisan effort to achieve that. The last point I want to make is this: I think one of the most heartless things I have seen in my time in the House and Senate is the effort by the Republicans to end DACA. DACA was the protection the President gave to DREAMers. DREAMers are children brought to America-- children, infants, toddlers, and young kids--by their parents, who grew up in America and went to school, have no serious criminal issues in their background, and who simply want the chance to be part of America's future. That is all they are asking for. The President's Executive order gives them that chance to prove themselves, and the Republicans want to eliminate that order. I don't understand it. If they take the time to meet some of these young people, they would realize what a waste it would be of such great skill and talent and love of America. I will close--and I see my friend and colleague Senator Murray--and say this: We are a nation of immigrants. Our diversity is our strength. The people who are willing to risk everything in their lives to come to this country, to be part of this great American experiment, to have an opportunity for their next generation to have a chance for a better life, that is what defines us. That is who we are. I stand here--and I have said it so many times and proudly so--the son of an immigrant mother who was brought here at the age of 2. She was the first DREAMer in my house, and she raised a son to serve in the U.S. Senate. That is my story. That is my family's story. That is America's story. It is time for us to fund the Department of Homeland Security and protect America and then have an honest debate about an immigration policy consistent with American values. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington. Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Illinois for his passionate remarks. That rings so true to all of us. I thank him for all his work on the DREAM Act and making sure young people who are raised in this country have the opportunities that all of us do. As we count down the final days before funding for the Department of Homeland Security potentially runs out, I want to take a few minutes to talk about how we got to this point. As this deadline gets closer and closer, I have been continually reminded we have been down this road many times before. This is a manufactured crisis, and it is no different than so many others we have faced in Congress over the last few years. What is happening in Congress right now is not a debate over government spending policies or priorities. That much is certain. This is not a debate over how the Department of Homeland Security should function. It is certainly not a debate about our national security. This is, pure and simple, a political fight Republicans are having with themselves across the two Chambers of the Capitol and across the different factions of the Republican Party. That is not the case for every Republican in the Senate. Several Members have said clearly we should fund the Department of Homeland Security without any strings attached. The fact remains some Republicans are making it clear they are willing to hold hostage the basic operation of our government over rightwing politics and nothing else. While this process might seem complicated, it is actually very simple. Democrats--along with national security experts, law enforcement experts, State and local officials, and three former Secretaries of Homeland Security, including two Republicans--want to do nothing more than fund the Department of Homeland Security cleanly, no strings or unrelated political amendments attached. But because they are so angry about the President's actions months ago to improve our country's immigration laws, some Republicans are demanding to pass a bill that will tear apart families who are working hard to make it in America, put our security at risk, and seriously threaten all of the work we have done recently--including the budget agreement I reached with Congressman Paul Ryan--to keep our government functioning. That is not only bad policy. It doesn't make any sense. The bill passed by Speaker Boehner and House Republicans would be devastating to families across the country, and it would make day-to- day operations for the Department of Homeland Security needlessly difficult. For example, TSA agents who work to keep our airports safe and secure would be forced to work without pay. These men and women should be worrying about doing their jobs, not knowing whether they are going to be able to pay their bills and put food on their table. That is not what we want them worrying about. But because of political pressure from the extreme anti-immigration, rightwing party, that is what Republican leaders in the House are demanding. This looming shutdown of the Department of Homeland Security has become to them nothing more than collateral damage. The national impacts of not funding the Department of Homeland Security have been discussed for weeks now. This would also cause problems all the way down to individual fire departments in our local communities. Right now the Whatcom County Fire District 18 located in my State-- close to the northern Canadian border and it is about an hour north of Seattle--is applying for an assistance to firefighters grant which is funded through the Department of Homeland Security. This is a very rural fire district. They only have one paid employee--it happens to be the fire chief--along with a volunteer firefighting force of 16 and a volunteer EMT force of 6. They have applied for a very small $24,000 Federal grant to replace their heavily used and outdated equipment--everything from boots and helmets to gloves and fire hoods--that are now over 11 years old. I have been working with them to help them get that needed equipment which protects those volunteers who put their lives on the line to save others, but if Congress does not fund this department those grants are at risk. That is unacceptable. It is proof this political mess the Republicans have made is not a hypothetical problem. It is something that will have real impacts on every one of our communities across the country. My colleagues are not going to give in and let the Republicans play politics with the Department of Homeland Security. For years now we have seen that strategy doesn't work. It holds us back. I am encouraged the majority leader has said they are willing to bring up a clean Department of Homeland Security appropriations bill to the floor. We need the same commitment from the Speaker of the House of Representatives. Time is running out. The country is waiting. We need to fund Homeland Security. I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Ernst). Without objection, it is so ordered. ____________________","Congressional Record, Volume 161 Issue 31 (Tuesday, February 24, 2015) [Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 31 (Tuesday, February 24, 2015)] [Senate] [Pages S1044-S1047] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2015--MOTION TO PROCEED--Continued The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Without objection, it is so ordered. Black History Month Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, this week marks the final week of Black History Month, an annual tradition that celebrates Black history and culture but also is a call to action to continue our Nation's march, as halting as it sometimes is, toward equality. This week we take an important step toward awarding a Congressional Gold Medal to the foot soldiers who participated in Bloody Sunday, Turnaround Tuesday, or the Selma to Montgomery Voting Rights March. Senator Scott and I and Senators Shelby and Sessions and the banking committee moved forward on that earlier today. I am proud to be one of the 65 cosponsors. I am also introducing a resolution this week instructing the Postal Service to issue a commemorative stamp honoring the 50th anniversary of the Selma marches. It is far past time for us to honor the brave men and women who risked life and limb to demand full participation in our democracy. We can do this on the Senate floor. We can do it by traveling to Selma. Next week Senator Scott and I will lead a delegation to Selma for the anniversary of the march. I understand my colleague from Ohio may be joining us. I took my daughters Emily and Elizabeth there a number of years ago. I look forward to the journey to Selma with my wife in a couple of weeks, marking the 50th anniversary. Fifty years ago, Dr. King led thousands in that 54-mile march--the second Selma bridge crossing, if you will. They arrived in Montgomery 4 days later to a crowd of 25,000 Black and White supporters. In his speech that day, Dr. King told a story of one of the marchers: Sister Pollard, a 70-year-old African-American women who lived in Montgomery during the bus boycott a little less than a decade earlier. She was asked if she wanted a ride during the march instead of walking. She said: ``No.'' The person said: ``Aren't you tired?'' She said: ``My feet are tired, but my soul is rested.'' Progress is never easy, and as we celebrate Black History Month, we are reminded of the long journey we have traveled and how far we still have to go. This month we celebrate the contributions African Americans have made to the fabric of our Nation. When Carter G. Woodson started what became Black History Month in 1926, my State of Ohio--the Presiding Officer's State--had already produced 19th-century poet Paul Laurence Dunbar; Columbus native Granville T. Woods had already invented the telegraph device that sent messages between moving trains and train stations; Mary Jane Patterson had already become the first Black woman to graduate from Oberlin College, in my part of Ohio; Garrett Morgan, a Clevelander, had already invented the traffic signal; Ohio State Representative John P. Green had introduced a bill to establish Labor Day in Ohio, which later became Labor Day, which we all celebrate; and COL Charles Young, who found freedom in Ripley, OH, in the Presiding Officer's old congressional district, became the highest ranking African-American commanding officer in the U.S. Army in 1894--120 years ago--and the first African-American superintendent of a national park. This month we celebrate these and other pioneering Ohioans: two Pulitzer Prize winners--Nobel Prize-winning writer Toni Morrison from Lorain and former Poet Laureate of the United States Rita Dove from Akron. Olympic Gold Medalist Jesse Owens grew up in Cleveland. Jesse Owens spoke at my brother's high school graduation in Mansfield. Howard Arthur Tibbs from Salem served with the Tuskegee Airmen, and I was honored to meet his family in 2007 when this body posthumously awarded him the Congressional Gold Medal. [[Page S1045]] Congressman Louis Stokes, who so many in this body know, rose from one of the first Federal housing projects in the Nation, in Cleveland, to prominence as a lawyer and legislator. Yesterday Louis Stokes celebrated his 90th birthday. He argued before the Supreme Court in his legal practice, and during his two decades in Congress he was a forceful advocate for the city he loves. This month we honor them and many others. These achievements have come in the face of centuries of oppression, making these achievements all the more remarkable. They have not come to be recognized simply through chance. It took a century of concerted effort--longer than that, really--led by Black Americans such as Dr. King, to give voice to the struggles and the stories, the triumphs and the traditions of the African Americans who have shaped who we are as a country and as a people. These stories are the ones we celebrate this month and the ones we must do more to honor and tell. This month I am introducing legislation to begin the process of designating the Parker House in Ripley, OH, as a national monument. John Parker was a slave who purchased his freedom, became a successful businessman, and helped many others to freedom on the Underground Railroad through crossing the Ohio River and heading north, some to Oberlin and ultimately many to Canada. Stories such as these are too often untold and overlooked. They show us how African Americans have shaped their own destiny in this country. I hope today my colleagues will join me in honoring the African Americans who have made us who we are as a nation. I would add that I hope this 50th anniversary, this trip that a number of colleagues and I will take to Selma, will mark progress in voting rights. We took huge strides in voting rights in the last 50 years. In fact, in 1964 it was a conservative Republican Congressman from north of Dayton by the name of William McCullough, who was the senior Republican on the House Judiciary Committee--Jacqueline Kennedy and others credited Congressman McCullough, perhaps more than any other single Member--even more than Hubert Humphrey or Everett Dirksen--for the Civil Rights Act and Voting Rights Act passing the U.S. House of Representatives and the Senate and being signed by the President. Unfortunately, in the last few years we have seen State legislators and far too many Members of this body try to scale back and roll back some of those gains in voting rights--all in the name of stopping fraud, when in fact voting fraud is much exaggerated by them. It barely exists. But the efforts to roll back voting rights has resulted from that. It is wrong, and it is shameful, especially as we celebrate the 50th anniversary. I am hopeful we can move forward in spite of what this very conservative Supreme Court has done, move forward in voting rights as we honor Black History Month, as we honor 50 years of Selma, and as we honor the work African Americans and Whites have done to make this country a better place to live. Mr. President, I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority whip. Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, as my colleagues know, for weeks now Senate Democrats have repeatedly blocked the Senate from even considering a $40 billion funding bill for the Department of Homeland Security that would extend through the end of the fiscal year, the end of September. They have done it not once, not twice, not three times, but four times. Four times they have filibustered this Department of Homeland Security funding bill that would pay the salaries of the men and women who protect our ports, our airports, and our border. Meanwhile, our friends across the aisle are telling the American people: No, it is not us blocking this funding, it is the Republicans. Well, I beg to differ. The House of Representatives has actually passed a Homeland Security appropriations bill--the bill we tried to get on four different times and the Democrats don't seem satisfied with the ability to offer amendments to change it or modify it in any way that they can command 60 votes to do. Their attitude is: We are not even going to consider it unless we get everything we want right upfront. I guess I can kind of understand why they are of that frame of mind because over the last few years, the Senate has become completely dysfunctional. Under the previous majority leader, there wasn't any opportunity to offer amendments and get votes on those amendments on legislation. It was a ``my way or the highway'' proposition. In other words, what I am saying is the Senate was broken, and after years of running the Senate as an incumbent protection program and voting on only poll-tested messages and blocking amendments, last November the American people said, enough is enough; no more dysfunction. Let's have a Senate and a Congress that represents our interests, not the interests of protecting incumbents against taking tough votes. I believe our colleagues who have blocked consideration of this funding amendment should be, frankly, ashamed of themselves. It doesn't seem as though they have gotten the message. The senior Senator from New York, Senator Schumer, who is a member of the leadership and my friend, told the Huffington Post recently that ``it is really fun to be in the minority.'' By that, I guess he means it is fun to block Homeland Security appropriations bills not once, not twice, not three times, but four separate times. But filibustering this critical funding for the men and women who protect us every day is not my idea of fun, nor is it, I suspect, for the thousands of men and women who work in the Department of Homeland Security, from the Coast Guard to the Border Patrol to all of the people who work day in and day out to try and help keep us safe in the homeland. When given the opportunity four times over the last few weeks to fully fund the Department of Homeland Security while rolling back the President's unconstitutional Executive action, four times Senate Democrats have taken the low road and continued to obstruct. Over the last several weeks, we pointed out the tough talk that came from some Senate Democrats last fall when the President issued his Executive action on immigration back when the President made his intent clear to follow through with a series of unilateral actions that he had previously said, on 22 different occasions, he didn't have the authority to do. Twenty-two times the President said publicly he didn't have the authority to do it, and last November, after being encouraged to wait until after the election so it didn't have a negative blowback on people running for the Senate, he went ahead and did it anyway. As I noted before, some of our colleagues on the other side expressed their concerns at the time. Some said it made them feel uncomfortable, and some said: I wish he wouldn't do it. Well, no kidding. When the President usurps the authority given under the Constitution to the legislative branch of government and seeks to arrogate to himself the power to unilaterally change the law, they should feel uncomfortable. One by one these same folks who were so concerned and so uncomfortable with what the President did last November have come down to the floor and voted in lockstep. They voted, in effect, to reaffirm the President's actions. In justifying these votes, we heard the common refrain, we don't necessarily agree with the President's Executive actions, but an appropriations bill is not the proper vehicle to address them. That is what they said time and time again. So now we have a pretty simple and straightforward message to our Democratic friends who were so concerned and so uncomfortable and who wished the President had not gone around Congress on immigration. We are here to say: Here is your chance. This week the Senate will take up a bill that will address the President's Executive actions that were announced last November. Senator McConnell, the majority leader, made it clear last night that this targeted bill is not tied to the Department of Homeland Security funding. Under the regular rules of the Senate, the process he set in order last night will come to fruition on Friday, and that will be the time for all of our colleagues on this side of the aisle and [[Page S1046]] the ones on the other side of the aisle who expressed disapproval of the President's Executive action to vote for a bill that expresses that disapproval--the so-called Collins bill.

Fourteen Republicans joined the Democrats for the bipartisan bill which was supported by the Chamber of Commerce, the AFL-CIO, and conservatives and liberals across America. Pretty good work for a Congress that is blamed many times for just being obstructionists. We passed it with 68 votes, sent it to the House of Representatives, where it languished for almost 2 years, never being called for a vote--never. At that point the President stepped forward and said: I have to do something to deal with the problems of illegal immigration in America. Here is what he proposed--two things, basically. He said: If you are here in America and are the parent of a child who is a U.S. citizen or the parent of a child who is a legal resident alien, you can come forward, pay about $500 as a fee, subject yourself to a criminal background check. If you clear it or you committed no serious crimes and are no threat to America, then we will give you a temporary work permit to be in [[Page S1047]] the United States and work. We want to know who you are, where you live, the members of your family, and where you work. That is what the President proposed, and that is what they want to stop. We would continue the current situation with millions of undocumented people working without background checks, working without any registration to this government, so we know their whereabouts and what they do. That is what they want to end. They think the President went way too far in setting up this process. I think they are wrong. The Republicans had a chance to pass a comprehensive immigration bill and they refused. In refusing, they left the President no alternative. He is trying to make sense out of a broken immigration system. It would be better if the Republicans joined us in the House and the Senate in a bipartisan effort to achieve that. The last point I want to make is this: I think one of the most heartless things I have seen in my time in the House and Senate is the effort by the Republicans to end DACA. DACA was the protection the President gave to DREAMers. DREAMers are children brought to America-- children, infants, toddlers, and young kids--by their parents, who grew up in America and went to school, have no serious criminal issues in their background, and who simply want the chance to be part of America's future. That is all they are asking for. The President's Executive order gives them that chance to prove themselves, and the Republicans want to eliminate that order. I don't understand it. If they take the time to meet some of these young people, they would realize what a waste it would be of such great skill and talent and love of America. I will close--and I see my friend and colleague Senator Murray--and say this: We are a nation of immigrants. Our diversity is our strength. The people who are willing to risk everything in their lives to come to this country, to be part of this great American experiment, to have an opportunity for their next generation to have a chance for a better life, that is what defines us. That is who we are. I stand here--and I have said it so many times and proudly so--the son of an immigrant mother who was brought here at the age of 2. She was the first DREAMer in my house, and she raised a son to serve in the U.S. Senate. That is my story. That is my family's story. That is America's story. It is time for us to fund the Department of Homeland Security and protect America and then have an honest debate about an immigration policy consistent with American values. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington. Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Illinois for his passionate remarks. That rings so true to all of us. I thank him for all his work on the DREAM Act and making sure young people who are raised in this country have the opportunities that all of us do. As we count down the final days before funding for the Department of Homeland Security potentially runs out, I want to take a few minutes to talk about how we got to this point. As this deadline gets closer and closer, I have been continually reminded we have been down this road many times before. This is a manufactured crisis, and it is no different than so many others we have faced in Congress over the last few years. What is happening in Congress right now is not a debate over government spending policies or priorities. That much is certain. This is not a debate over how the Department of Homeland Security should function. It is certainly not a debate about our national security. This is, pure and simple, a political fight Republicans are having with themselves across the two Chambers of the Capitol and across the different factions of the Republican Party. That is not the case for every Republican in the Senate. Several Members have said clearly we should fund the Department of Homeland Security without any strings attached. The fact remains some Republicans are making it clear they are willing to hold hostage the basic operation of our government over rightwing politics and nothing else. While this process might seem complicated, it is actually very simple. Democrats--along with national security experts, law enforcement experts, State and local officials, and three former Secretaries of Homeland Security, including two Republicans--want to do nothing more than fund the Department of Homeland Security cleanly, no strings or unrelated political amendments attached. But because they are so angry about the President's actions months ago to improve our country's immigration laws, some Republicans are demanding to pass a bill that will tear apart families who are working hard to make it in America, put our security at risk, and seriously threaten all of the work we have done recently--including the budget agreement I reached with Congressman Paul Ryan--to keep our government functioning. That is not only bad policy. It doesn't make any sense. The bill passed by Speaker Boehner and House Republicans would be devastating to families across the country, and it would make day-to- day operations for the Department of Homeland Security needlessly difficult. For example, TSA agents who work to keep our airports safe and secure would be forced to work without pay. These men and women should be worrying about doing their jobs, not knowing whether they are going to be able to pay their bills and put food on their table. That is not what we want them worrying about. But because of political pressure from the extreme anti-immigration, rightwing party, that is what Republican leaders in the House are demanding. This looming shutdown of the Department of Homeland Security has become to them nothing more than collateral damage. The national impacts of not funding the Department of Homeland Security have been discussed for weeks now. This would also cause problems all the way down to individual fire departments in our local communities. Right now the Whatcom County Fire District 18 located in my State-- close to the northern Canadian border and it is about an hour north of Seattle--is applying for an assistance to firefighters grant which is funded through the Department of Homeland Security. This is a very rural fire district. They only have one paid employee--it happens to be the fire chief--along with a volunteer firefighting force of 16 and a volunteer EMT force of 6. They have applied for a very small $24,000 Federal grant to replace their heavily used and outdated equipment--everything from boots and helmets to gloves and fire hoods--that are now over 11 years old. I have been working with them to help them get that needed equipment which protects those volunteers who put their lives on the line to save others, but if Congress does not fund this department those grants are at risk. That is unacceptable. It is proof this political mess the Republicans have made is not a hypothetical problem. It is something that will have real impacts on every one of our communities across the country. My colleagues are not going to give in and let the Republicans play politics with the Department of Homeland Security. For years now we have seen that strategy doesn't work. It holds us back. I am encouraged the majority leader has said they are willing to bring up a clean Department of Homeland Security appropriations bill to the floor. We need the same commitment from the Speaker of the House of Representatives. Time is running out. The country is waiting. We need to fund Homeland Security. I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Ernst). Without objection, it is so ordered. ____________________",package_114_116.csv,29100,29100,29171,"[congressional record volume 161, number 31 (tuesday, february 24, 2015)] [senate] [pages s1044-s1047] from the congressional record online through the government publishing office [ www.gpo.gov ] department of homeland security appropriations act, 2015--motion to proceed--continued the presiding officer. under the previous order, senators are permitted to speak for up to 10 minutes each. mr. bennet. i suggest the absence of a quorum. the presiding officer. the clerk will call the roll. the senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. mr. brown. mr. president, i ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. the presiding officer. without objection, it is so ordered. mr. brown. mr. president, i ask unanimous consent to speak for up to 10 minutes as in morning business. the presiding officer. without objection, it is so ordered. black history month mr. brown. mr. president, this week marks the final week of black history month, an annual tradition that celebrates black history and culture but also is a call to action to continue our nation's march, as halting as it sometimes is, toward equality. this week we take an important step toward awarding a congressional gold medal to the foot soldiers who participated in bloody sunday, turnaround tuesday, or the selma to montgomery voting rights march. senator scott and i and senators shelby and sessions and the banking committee moved forward on that earlier today. i am proud to be one of the 65 cosponsors. i am also introducing a resolution this week instructing the postal service to issue a commemorative stamp honoring the 50th anniversary of the selma marches. it is far past time for us to honor the brave men and women who risked life and limb to demand full participation in our democracy. we can do this on the senate floor. we can do it by traveling to selma. next week senator scott and i will lead a delegation to selma for the anniversary of the march. i understand my colleague from ohio may be joining us. i took my daughters emily and elizabeth there a number of years ago. i look forward to the journey to selma with my wife in a couple of weeks, marking the 50th anniversary. fifty years ago, dr. king led thousands in that 54-mile march--the second selma bridge crossing, if you will. they arrived in montgomery 4 days later to a crowd of 25,000 black and white supporters. in his speech that day, dr. king told a story of one of the marchers: sister pollard, a 70-year-old african-american women who lived in montgomery during the bus boycott a little less than a decade earlier. she was asked if she wanted a ride during the march instead of walking. she said: ``no.'' the person said: ``aren't you tired?'' she said: ``my feet are tired, but my soul is rested.'' progress is never easy, and as we celebrate black history month, we are reminded of the long journey we have traveled and how far we still have to go. this month we celebrate the contributions african americans have made to the fabric of our nation. when carter g. woodson started what became black history month in 1926, my state of ohio--the presiding officer's state--had already produced 19th-century poet paul laurence dunbar; columbus native granville t. woods had already invented the telegraph device that sent messages between moving trains and train stations; mary jane patterson had already become the first black woman to graduate from oberlin college, in my part of ohio; garrett morgan, a clevelander, had already invented the traffic signal; ohio state representative john p. green had introduced a bill to establish labor day in ohio, which later became labor day, which we all celebrate; and col charles young, who found freedom in ripley, oh, in the presiding officer's old congressional district, became the highest ranking african-american commanding officer in the u.s. army in 1894--120 years ago--and the first african-american superintendent of a national park. this month we celebrate these and other pioneering ohioans: two pulitzer prize winners--nobel prize-winning writer toni morrison from lorain and former poet laureate of the united states rita dove from akron. olympic gold medalist jesse owens grew up in cleveland. jesse owens spoke at my brother's high school graduation in mansfield. howard arthur tibbs from salem served with the tuskegee airmen, and i was honored to meet his family in 2007 when this body posthumously awarded him the congressional gold medal. [[page s1045]] congressman louis stokes, who so many in this body know, rose from one of the first federal housing projects in the nation, in cleveland, to prominence as a lawyer and legislator. yesterday louis stokes celebrated his 90th birthday. he argued before the supreme court in his legal practice, and during his two decades in congress he was a forceful advocate for the city he loves. this month we honor them and many others. these achievements have come in the face of centuries of oppression, making these achievements all the more remarkable. they have not come to be recognized simply through chance. it took a century of concerted effort--longer than that, really--led by black americans such as dr. king, to give voice to the struggles and the stories, the triumphs and the traditions of the african americans who have shaped who we are as a country and as a people. these stories are the ones we celebrate this month and the ones we must do more to honor and tell. this month i am introducing legislation to begin the process of designating the parker house in ripley, oh, as a national monument. john parker was a slave who purchased his freedom, became a successful businessman, and helped many others to freedom on the underground railroad through crossing the ohio river and heading north, some to oberlin and ultimately many to canada. stories such as these are too often untold and overlooked. they show us how african americans have shaped their own destiny in this country. i hope today my colleagues will join me in honoring the african americans who have made us who we are as a nation. i would add that i hope this 50th anniversary, this trip that a number of colleagues and i will take to selma, will mark progress in voting rights. we took huge strides in voting rights in the last 50 years. in fact, in 1964 it was a conservative republican congressman from north of dayton by the name of william mccullough, who was the senior republican on the house judiciary committee--jacqueline kennedy and others credited congressman mccullough, perhaps more than any other single member--even more than hubert humphrey or everett dirksen--for the civil rights act and voting rights act passing the u.s. house of representatives and the senate and being signed by the president. unfortunately, in the last few years we have seen state legislators and far too many members of this body try to scale back and roll back some of those gains in voting rights--all in the name of stopping fraud, when in fact voting fraud is much exaggerated by them. it barely exists. but the efforts to roll back voting rights has resulted from that. it is wrong, and it is shameful, especially as we celebrate the 50th anniversary. i am hopeful we can move forward in spite of what this very conservative supreme court has done, move forward in voting rights as we honor black history month, as we honor 50 years of selma, and as we honor the work african americans and whites have done to make this country a better place to live. mr. president, i yield the floor. the presiding officer. the majority whip. mr. cornyn. mr. president, as my colleagues know, for weeks now senate democrats have repeatedly blocked the senate from even considering a $40 billion funding bill for the department of homeland security that would extend through the end of the fiscal year, the end of september. they have done it not once, not twice, not three times, but four times. four times they have filibustered this department of homeland security funding bill that would pay the salaries of the men and women who protect our ports, our airports, and our border. meanwhile, our friends across the aisle are telling the american people: no, it is not us blocking this funding, it is the republicans. well, i beg to differ. the house of representatives has actually passed a homeland security appropriations bill--the bill we tried to get on four different times and the democrats don't seem satisfied with the ability to offer amendments to change it or modify it in any way that they can command 60 votes to do. their attitude is: we are not even going to consider it unless we get everything we want right upfront. i guess i can kind of understand why they are of that frame of mind because over the last few years, the senate has become completely dysfunctional. under the previous majority leader, there wasn't any opportunity to offer amendments and get votes on those amendments on legislation. it was a ``my way or the highway'' proposition. in other words, what i am saying is the senate was broken, and after years of running the senate as an incumbent protection program and voting on only poll-tested messages and blocking amendments, last november the american people said, enough is enough; no more dysfunction. let's have a senate and a congress that represents our interests, not the interests of protecting incumbents against taking tough votes. i believe our colleagues who have blocked consideration of this funding amendment should be, frankly, ashamed of themselves. it doesn't seem as though they have gotten the message. the senior senator from new york, senator schumer, who is a member of the leadership and my friend, told the huffington post recently that ``it is really fun to be in the minority.'' by that, i guess he means it is fun to block homeland security appropriations bills not once, not twice, not three times, but four separate times. but filibustering this critical funding for the men and women who protect us every day is not my idea of fun, nor is it, i suspect, for the thousands of men and women who work in the department of homeland security, from the coast guard to the border patrol to all of the people who work day in and day out to try and help keep us safe in the homeland. when given the opportunity four times over the last few weeks to fully fund the department of homeland security while rolling back the president's unconstitutional executive action, four times senate democrats have taken the low road and continued to obstruct. over the last several weeks, we pointed out the tough talk that came from some senate democrats last fall when the president issued his executive action on immigration back when the president made his intent clear to follow through with a series of unilateral actions that he had previously said, on 22 different occasions, he didn't have the authority to do. twenty-two times the president said publicly he didn't have the authority to do it, and last november, after being encouraged to wait until after the election so it didn't have a negative blowback on people running for the senate, he went ahead and did it anyway. as i noted before, some of our colleagues on the other side expressed their concerns at the time. some said it made them feel uncomfortable, and some said: i wish he wouldn't do it. well, no kidding. when the president usurps the authority given under the constitution to the legislative branch of government and seeks to arrogate to himself the power to unilaterally change the law, they should feel uncomfortable. one by one these same folks who were so concerned and so uncomfortable with what the president did last november have come down to the floor and voted in lockstep. they voted, in effect, to reaffirm the president's actions. in justifying these votes, we heard the common refrain, we don't necessarily agree with the president's executive actions, but an appropriations bill is not the proper vehicle to address them. that is what they said time and time again. so now we have a pretty simple and straightforward message to our democratic friends who were so concerned and so uncomfortable and who wished the president had not gone around congress on immigration. we are here to say: here is your chance. this week the senate will take up a bill that will address the president's executive actions that were announced last november. senator mcconnell, the majority leader, made it clear last night that this targeted bill is not tied to the department of homeland security funding. under the regular rules of the senate, the process he set in order last night will come to fruition on friday, and that will be the time for all of our colleagues on this side of the aisle and [[page s1046]] the ones on the other side of the aisle who expressed disapproval of the president's executive action to vote for a bill that expresses that disapproval--the so-called collins bill. my strong preference would be to pass the house bill--that has been filibustered four separate times by our democratic friends--because it fully funds the department while reining in the president's overreach. but since the democrats have refused on four different occasions to even allow the bill to come to the floor with the excuse that it is tied to the department of homeland security funding, we are going to give them an opportunity to put their money where their mouth is. in other words, we are going to see if they can take yes for an answer. if all of the occasions where my colleagues said they were uncomfortable with the president's actions are not enough--if the 22 times the president himself said he didn't have the authority to issue this executive action--well, we now know that during the recess last week a federal judge in texas has given us one more reason. a week ago u.s. district judge andrew hanen in brownsville, tx, ruled in a lawsuit brought by 26 different states, including texas, that what the president did was illegal. he issued a temporary injunction blocking implementation of the president's executive action. if that were the end of it, any amount of money that was appropriated by the congress to fund the department of homeland security could not legally be used to fund the president's executive action because there is an injunction in place issued by a federal court that says you can't do it, and, indeed, the administration has acknowledged that. they stood down, but now they have come back to the judge and asked for a stay of the judge's temporary injunction. they said if they don't get that, they will go to the fifth circuit court of appeals in new orleans and ask the appellate court to stay the judge's temporary injunction. judge hanen's ruling enforces what i and many others have been saying for a long time, that the president acted outside of the law when he went around congress to unilaterally change our nation's immigration laws. but the judge's ruling gets to a broader issue, and there is one part of it that i found particularly important. in writing his opinion explaining his ruling, judge hanen looked at the obama administration's case and imagined how you could take their argument and apply it across the board. it is easy to overlook and overreach what the president has said if you perhaps agree with what he actually accomplished, which is, in effect, to give legal status to roughly 5 million people. if you think that is a good idea, you are likely to turn a blind eye to the way the president did it. but if the courts establish the precedent that this president--or any future president, republican or democrat--can pick and choose which laws to enforce, what could end up happening? well, it doesn't take a lot of imagination. judge hanen writes: ``then a lack of resources''--which is the argument that was made by the administration--``would be an acceptable reason to cease enforcing environmental laws, or the voting rights act, or even the various laws that protect civil rights and equal opportunity.'' that is what judge hanen said in his opinion in repudiating the argument made by the administration that the president had this authority and talked about what kind of dangerous precedent it would set if it were accepted by the court as legal. i am sure i am not the only one who would hate to see our country head down that sort of lawless path where the laws don't make any difference, it is just the preference of whoever is president which determines the direction the country should take. that is a dangerous path. it is completely inconsistent with who we are as a country that believes in the rule of law. so now that the president's actions have been settled in the court of public opinion, where they are deeply unpopular, and ruled upon by a court of law, my friends from the other side of the aisle need to take note because they have a very clear choice. they can continue to give excuses for why they are filibustering this $40 billion homeland security appropriations bill or, as i said, they can put their money where their mouth is and vote to stop the president's 2014 executive action separate and apart from any issue of funding of the department of homeland security. at the end of the day, the senate will make sure the people who protect our borders and our ports and our skies get paid because that is the responsible thing to do. senate democrats, who were so concerned and so uncomfortable with what the president did last fall, are out of excuses, and they are going to have a chance to vote on the collins amendment on friday or at some other time mutually agreed upon by the majority and the minority. i yield the floor. the presiding officer. the democratic leader is recognized. mr. durbin. mr. president, i listened carefully to the remarks of my friend and my colleague from texas. if my friend has a moment as he walks out this door, he should take a sharp left and stop at the staircase and look up. at the top of the staircase the senator from texas will see this amazing portrait that has been copied and referred to over and over again. it is an incredible painting that shows president abraham lincoln signing the emancipation proclamation in the midst of the civil war while surrounded by his cabinet. this emancipation proclamation freed 3 million slaves in america from involuntary servitude. was the president signing a bill that had been passed by congress? no. he was signing an executive order--the same type of executive order used by president obama to address the issue of immigration. all right, senator durbin, you found one moment in history. according to arguments you heard on the floor, there could not be very many more. let's fast forward to the late 1940s with president harry truman. president harry truman, after world war ii, decided to finally end racial discrimination in the ranks of our military. how did he do it? did he do it by signing a law passed by congress? no. he signed an executive order ending the discrimination and segregation taking place in our military. i don't argue that presidents can exceed their constitutional powers. it has happened. but to argue that executive orders that have been used by president after president are inherently unconstitutional defies any accurate, honest reading of history. here are some realities. the immigration system in the united states of america today is broken--broken terribly--to the point where we may have 12 to 13 million undocumented people in this country, where our borders are stronger now than they have ever been, but still have to be fortified to make sure we don't have the unnecessary migration of people into the united states in an illegal status. there are so many things we need to do to fix this broken immigration system, and we addressed them. two years ago eight senators came together--four democrats and four republicans. i was honored to be part of it. we sat down for months and wrote a comprehensive immigration reform bill. we brought it to the floor of the senate after considering 100 amendments in the senate judiciary committee, and it passed on the floor with 68 positive votes. fourteen republicans joined the democrats for the bipartisan bill which was supported by the chamber of commerce, the afl-cio, and conservatives and liberals across america. pretty good work for a congress that is blamed many times for just being obstructionists. we passed it with 68 votes, sent it to the house of representatives, where it languished for almost 2 years, never being called for a vote--never. at that point the president stepped forward and said: i have to do something to deal with the problems of illegal immigration in america. here is what he proposed--two things, basically. he said: if you are here in america and are the parent of a child who is a u.s. citizen or the parent of a child who is a legal resident alien, you can come forward, pay about $500 as a fee, subject yourself to a criminal background check. if you clear it or you committed no serious crimes and are no threat to america, then we will give you a temporary work permit to be in [[page s1047]] the united states and work. we want to know who you are, where you live, the members of your family, and where you work. that is what the president proposed, and that is what they want to stop. we would continue the current situation with millions of undocumented people working without background checks, working without any registration to this government, so we know their whereabouts and what they do. that is what they want to end. they think the president went way too far in setting up this process. i think they are wrong. the republicans had a chance to pass a comprehensive immigration bill and they refused. in refusing, they left the president no alternative. he is trying to make sense out of a broken immigration system. it would be better if the republicans joined us in the house and the senate in a bipartisan effort to achieve that. the last point i want to make is this: i think one of the most heartless things i have seen in my time in the house and senate is the effort by the republicans to end daca. daca was the protection the president gave to dreamers. dreamers are children brought to america-- children, infants, toddlers, and young kids--by their parents, who grew up in america and went to school, have no serious criminal issues in their background, and who simply want the chance to be part of america's future. that is all they are asking for. the president's executive order gives them that chance to prove themselves, and the republicans want to eliminate that order. i don't understand it. if they take the time to meet some of these young people, they would realize what a waste it would be of such great skill and talent and love of america. i will close--and i see my friend and colleague senator murray--and say this: we are a nation of immigrants. our diversity is our strength. the people who are willing to risk everything in their lives to come to this country, to be part of this great american experiment, to have an opportunity for their next generation to have a chance for a better life, that is what defines us. that is who we are. i stand here--and i have said it so many times and proudly so--the son of an immigrant mother who was brought here at the age of 2. she was the first dreamer in my house, and she raised a son to serve in the u.s. senate. that is my story. that is my family's story. that is america's story. it is time for us to fund the department of homeland security and protect america and then have an honest debate about an immigration policy consistent with american values. i yield the floor. the presiding officer. the senator from washington. mrs. murray. mr. president, i thank the senator from illinois for his passionate remarks. that rings so true to all of us. i thank him for all his work on the dream act and making sure young people who are raised in this country have the opportunities that all of us do. as we count down the final days before funding for the department of homeland security potentially runs out, i want to take a few minutes to talk about how we got to this point. as this deadline gets closer and closer, i have been continually reminded we have been down this road many times before. this is a manufactured crisis, and it is no different than so many others we have faced in congress over the last few years. what is happening in congress

CREC-2015-02-24-pt1-PgS1048,CREC-2015-02-24,114,"DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2015--MOTION TO PROCEED--Continued","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 31 (Tuesday, February 24, 2015)] [Senate] [Pages S1048-S1058] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2015--MOTION TO PROCEED--Continued Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, a number of things have been happening today with regard to the funding for the Department of Homeland Security. There has been a lot of spin that somehow the Republicans are blocking the funding of the Department of Homeland Security. This gives new meaning to the word obfuscation, I suppose, or disingenuousness. The truth is the House of Representatives has fully funded the Department of Homeland Security. It has provided the level of funding the President asked for. It has kept all accounts in Homeland Security as approved through the congressional process. It simply says: Mr. President, we considered your bill--this amnesty bill--that would provide work permits, photo IDs, Social Security numbers, Medicare benefits, and Social Security benefits, and you can't do that. We consider that and reject it. So we are not going to fund that. Now, the President has already told us and the staff they have across the river in Crystal City where they are leasing a new building, and this building is going to house 1,000 workers paid for by the taxpayers of the United States as part of Homeland Security. Are those 1,000 workers going to be utilized to enforce the laws of the United States? Are they going to process applications for citizenship or visas? No, those 1,000 people--costing several hundred million dollars, in truth-- are going to be processing and providing these benefits to people unlawfully in America. So Congress said: Wait a minute. We didn't authorize money for that. You can't spend money to fund exactly the opposite of what we have enacted. So we are just going to put some language in the bill--the normal bill that funds Homeland Security--and say you can't spend the money to violate the law. You can only spend the money to enforce the law, as it was created to do. The bill then comes to the Senate; and what spectacle do we have? We have Democratic Members in lockstep unity blocking even proceeding to this bill, contending we are not funding Homeland Security. Can you imagine that? Now, my colleague, the senior Senator from Illinois, Mr. Durbin, the Democratic whip, came down a couple of weeks ago and said: I am trying to figure out what is blocking this bill. So I took the floor and I said: Senator Durbin, you and your filibusterers are filibustering the bill. That is why it is not being passed. Does anybody want to dispute that? The Republican Senate has repeatedly brought up this bill and filed cloture to move to the bill so we can fund Homeland Security, and the Democrats are relentlessly and unanimously filibustering it, blocking even moving to the bill. Although Senator McConnell said if we did move to the bill, he would allow them to have amendments. So this is the situation we are in. Colleagues, this goes to the core of our constitutional principles about who controls the money in America. Congress is a coequal branch. It is not subordinate to the President. If anything, the legislative branch, through the Constitution, provides maybe even more power to Congress than it does to the Executive and more than it provides the courts. And the most powerful power of Congress is the power of the purse. Congress is not obligated to pay for anything it believes is unwise, and it has an absolute duty not to fund anything that is unconstitutional or illegal, which is what we are dealing with here. So Congress--the House of Representatives--acted wisely and properly in funding Homeland Security and not allowing activities to be carried out that are unlawful and that Congress has rejected. This is so fundamental, so basic. How my colleagues have the gall to come to the floor and have a press conference this afternoon and blame Republicans for shutting down Homeland Security is beyond me. I don't believe the American people are buying it. Now, there are some, even on the Republican side, who say: Oh gosh, the President will blame us even if it is not our fault. So we might as well cave in and give him what he wants. But what he wants is something he can't be given. What he wants is for Congress to capitulate and erode its powers and responsibility. He wants Congress to violate its duty to fund something that is illegal and contrary to Congress's wishes. He can't demand that. He has no right to demand that. Congress cannot fund--cannot and must not fund--an illegal action in hopes that another branch of government will intervene. Now, I say that because some have said: Well, a court in Texas has ruled that a part of this action by the President is unlawful. The court was narrow in its decision. It fundamentally said something similar to: It looks like a regulation to me, and if you are going to pass a regulation, you need to go through a process. And the President didn't go through a process. It is not lawful. It is not legal. You can't enforce it. The judge issued an injunction barring the President from carrying out these plans, he announced, which is plain law, it seems to me. They didn't even go into some of the other ideas of the constitutionality and separation of powers. He just blocked it on that basis. So we are hearing it said that we can fully fund Homeland Security without any restrictions, allowing the President to do this, because the courts stopped it. I think that is unwise for a number of reasons. The first one is we don't know what the courts are going to do. This Congress has a duty to fund only things it believes are appropriate and lawful. So Congress shouldn't fund it on that basis, period. We should stand up for Congresses in years to come--for our children and grandchildren and great-grandchildren--and defend the power of the purse and defend the integrity of this Congress. We know how this country was founded. It was founded on an understanding of the British Parliament, and the British Parliament wrested from the king the power of taxes and money. That was a huge historical development, and it has been part of our tradition since, that Congress has the power of the purse. The Executive can't do it. So we replaced the king with the President, and we adhered in our Constitution to that great tradition of restraint on the Executive by the legislative branch--by the Congress, by the Senate. In the Texas court's injunction, let me go further and note the reasons why I think it is unwise for Congress to say that we, the Senate, have no duty to speak on this issue. The House has already spoken and said we are not going to fund this. But the Senate needs to ask what its position will be. I would point out that the Texas court's injunction addresses only a part of Obama's lawless actions and could be lifted at any time. So the injunction could be lifted at any time. It only covers a part of his actions. If Congress relinquishes the power of the purse, then nothing will be able to prevent the lawlessness or amnesty from going forward. As the Texas court noted in issuing its injunction, ``This genie would be impossible to put back in the bottle.'' That is absolutely true. He is evaluating whether to issue an injunction. [[Page S1049]] Sometimes you don't have to issue an injunction because there is not anything much happening right then. But he says, correctly, that: If this goes forward and millions of people are given amnesty, you can't put that genie back in the bottle in any practical sense. It would be a nightmare to try to do that. Let me point this out: One, the Texas court's injunction only addresses a small part of the President's recent Executive actions in November. The Texas lawsuit challenges only the President's November 20 unconstitutional Executive action. And of that, the injunction prevents the administration from implementing only deferred action for parents of Americans and lawful permanent residents. The Texas court injunction does not address the problematic enforcement priorities encompassed in the President's Executive actions. He set all kinds of priorities that Congress disapproves of and that are bad--unless you don't want the laws enforced, in which case it is good. And we have some who believe in open borders in this country. They deny it when challenged, but they vote that way every time. On November 20, 2014, the memo revised the administration's enforcement priorities which do not encompass certain criminal aliens nor do they encompass all aliens deemed to be subject to mandatory custody under the Immigration and Nationality Act. In fact, these new priorities effectively gut the enforcement of our immigration laws for all but a few select criminal aliens. Congress passed the law that requires the deportation of persons involved in criminal activities and convicted of those activities. The President eviscerated large portions of that in this order, and he should not be allowed to do so. The judge did not address it. Indeed, in response to the ruling, Secretary Johnson stated that the Texas court's order does not ``affect this Department's ability to set and implement enforcement priorities.'' Well, that is a big deal. They set priorities that violate statutory law, and they should not be allowed to do that. We can't effectively eviscerate law by prosecutorial guidelines. According to a February 18, 2015 email from Customs and Border Protection Commissioner R. Gil Kerlikowske regarding the injunction, he said: Officers and agents should continue to process individuals consistent with the enforcement priorities announced by the Secretary in his memorandum of November 20, 2014, titled Policies for the Apprehension, Detention and Removal of Undocumented Immigrants. It deals in large part with criminal activities, people convicted of crimes who are supposed to be deported. The funding bill the House passed would do much more to stop President Obama's unlawful Executive actions on immigration, so the administration does not intend to change its course as it is still actively preparing for its rollout of Executive amnesty. On February 17, just a few days ago, the President told reporters that the administration is still ``doing the preparatory work because this is a big piece of business.'' He said: The Department of Homeland Security will continue in the planning because we want to make sure as soon as these legal issues get resolved, which I anticipate they will in our favor, that we are ready to go. So he is telling the Department of Homeland Security to spend money now to be ready to move forward and immediately process his Executive amnesty--providing Social Security numbers, photo IDs, Medicare and Social Security benefits for people here unlawfully. He says go ahead and do it. The Texas court injunction is only temporary and could be set aside at any time. The administration has already filed for a stay of the injunction in the district court and has announced its intention to appeal. Indeed, as I just read, the President said he expects to win. I don't think he will, but it is a technical part of the ruling. The judge still has many more that he could deal with that could overrule the President's action. He just chose one of them, and that one is rather technical. So who knows for sure what a court might rule. In addition, the ruling does not address the substance of the case. It will take many months to resolve this litigation, and during that time there is a reasonable chance that some court will lift the stay and allow the President to begin implementing the amnesty pending a final ruling on the merits of the case. But Congress can stop it and has a duty to stop it in its appropriations bill. In addition, Democrats refused to fund the lawful functions of the Department of Homeland Security. And this is important: The House- passed Department of Homeland Security funding bill funds all of the lawful, statutorily authorized functions of the Department, including the immigration law enforcement component of the agencies that, under the Obama administration, has been prevented from enforcing the laws. Colleagues, Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers--now, I guess, 2 years ago--filed a lawsuit against their own supervisors declaring that they were being forced to violate their oath to enforce the laws of the United States. I have never seen that. It is so bad that the ICE officers have filed a lawsuit to stop the administration from ordering them to violate plain law. Let me note that the President has already shut down the Department by ordering immigration officers and agents to violate the laws and sabotaging enforcement in a number of ways. These are direct orders of this administration, dismantling systemic enforcement of our laws. So I think the Senate Democrats and the President must answer why they believe funding Executive amnesty and unlawful immigration policies would make this country safer. They say: Well, you won't pass a Homeland Security bill like we want it. You are not making America safe. I say their policies eviscerating law enforcement are making America less safe, as the Immigration and Customs agents do, the ones who process the applicants. Ken Palinkas, the President of the National Citizenship and Immigration Services Council, has written that: This amnesty executed by the President will make us less safe. His amnesty makes us less safe. Passing a bill that stops his amnesty will make us more safe. As a matter of fact, he said that more than one time--a number of times. He is very concerned, as his officers are, that if they carry out these policies, the American people are going to be less safe. In fact, they have said explicitly there is no way they can carry out in any effective manner the unlawful orders of the President of the United States. Is anybody listening to the people who do the work every day? Does anybody care what they think? Apparently not. So they are going to come to the floor and accuse Republicans in the House and on this side of the aisle of not making America safe when their own officers say the President's policies are making America less safe. They say there is no way they can effectively process the individuals they are asked to process. They can't process the numbers today, much less what will happen under this bill when they have to process another 5 million. It is just a very unwise thing. So what did the courts say? I think this is an important quote from the Texas court. A Federal court found that the President had overstepped his bounds. That is what the court fundamentally declared, stating: It is Congress, and Congress alone, who has the power under the Constitution to legislate in the field of immigration. That is absolutely true. It is in the Constitution. As he said: It is Congress, and Congress alone, who has the power under the Constitution to legislate in the field of immigration. So after the President issued his order and his Department issued orders of amnesty on November 20, 2014, the President, amazingly, said this: ``I just took an action to change the law.'' Don't we know from elementary school that Congress passes the law? The President doesn't pass the law. He said 22 times that he didn't have the power to do this, but now he has moved forward and admitted he is changing the law. Well, some of our colleagues think: Oh, if we resist this, the President is going to accuse us of not funding Homeland Security, not protecting the Republic. [[Page S1050]] The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Rounds). The Senator's time has expired. Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for 1 additional minute. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. SESSIONS. But I don't think that is so. They say: Well, the press is unfair. Well, not always. I think sometimes we Republicans are right to complain but not always. This is what the headlines are today. The headlines aren't saying Republicans are blocking the bill. Politico: ``Democrats filibuster Department of Homeland Security bill.'' The Hill: ``Shutdown looms as Dems block DHS bill.'' McClatchy: ``Filibuster continues as Senate Dems block DHS funding bill.'' CNN: ``Senate Dems block Homeland Security funding bill again.'' Washington Post: ``Senate Democrats block DHS spending bill targeting Obama's immigration actions.'' Associated Press: ``Dems Block Action on DHS-Immigration Bill.'' New York Times: ``Senate Democrats Block Vote on Homeland Security Bill.'' Politico: ``Dems filibuster DHS bill.'' Well, that is absolutely true. We are bringing the bill to the floor. We are not blocking it. We want to fully fund Homeland Security. We want the laws enforced. We don't want to spend money from Homeland Security to eviscerate the law of the United States and undermine immigration law in America, and we don't want to fund an unlawful action by the President. I thank the Chair and yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington. Keystone Pipeline Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I rise today to applaud the President's veto of legislation that would have rubberstamped the construction of the Keystone Pipeline. This legislation allowed a circumvention of Federal review processes and allowed corporations not to adhere to various environmental safety standards that are important for the American people. So I am glad the President is vetoing this legislation. The rules for siting cross-border pipelines are well established, and time and time again TransCanada has shown that it doesn't want to play by the rules. So with this veto by the President of the United States, he is clearly saying TransCanada must play by the rules. The President's veto recognizes three important implications for Congress in the intervening and trying to pass this Keystone Pipeline process. First, this bill was premature because it authorized the construction of the pipeline while legal and administrative processes were still ongoing in Nebraska and North and South Dakota and where landowners and tribes are seeking review in the courts and before regulatory bodies. The legislation also eliminates the need for a national interest determination, which is associated with the process of the pipeline, which was a key authority for the U.S. Government to insist on safety and environmental regulations. It is a process that should have allowed the State Department and the President to insist on pipeline safety conditions. Finally, this legislation did not address the loophole for tar sands oil companies to avoid paying for oilspill cleanups. By vetoing this bill, the President refused to throw hundreds of conditions out the window. These are things from 59 different pipeline safety conditions that would have been legally binding--but not if the legislation had passed. My colleagues also remember that we talked about work--that we now have concerns on the existing Keystone Pipeline. So I am glad the President of the United States vetoed this legislation. I hope we will get on to working on other important energy opportunities. I hope my colleagues will not try to override this veto but instead focus on renewing the energy tax credits that help employ hundreds of thousands of people in various industries--anything from solar, to wind, to hybrid electric vehicles--and get on to the other issues that are so important for us in talking about a 21st-century energy strategy. Again, I am glad the President of the United States has vetoed this legislation that would have been a rubberstamp by Congress for a special interest. Instead, let's make sure all environmental and safety conditions are met. I thank the Presiding Officer, and I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The legislative clerk proceeded to call the role. Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, one of the measures that took place in this Executive amnesty that has been too little commented upon since the President signed these orders in November is another program which has not been authorized by law which would add several hundred thousand new workers to our country. This is the headline from an article today: ``DHS Extends Eligibility for Employment Authorization to Certain H-4 Dependent Spouses of H-1B Nonimmigrants Seeking Employment-Based Lawful Permanent Residence.'' The H-1B program was set up for certain individuals to come and work for 3 years and then extend maybe another 3 years only, to take a job in those industries and fields where there is a shortage of workers, and it does allow the spouses to come. But since its beginning it has barred spouses from working; otherwise we would be doubling the number of workers. So this bill now just up and approves spouses of H-1B workers to work. The U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Service, USCIS, estimates that ``the number of individuals eligible to apply for employment authorization under this rule could be as high as 179,600 in the first year and 55,000 annually in subsequent years.'' This is a very large addition to the workforce. One might say: Well, it is good that spouses can work. Well, what if your child wants a job? What if you want a job? What if your spouse wants a job and is looking for a job? Now we will have another 250,000 job applicants, contrary to law. There are many other aspects of the President's Executive order that have not been given attention. I think this one is worth commenting about. There has been no sense at all by President Obama, the Department of Homeland Security, Jeh Johnson, the Democratic Members of this Congress--no concern about the employment prospects of lawful immigrants, green card holders, and native-born Americans. We have high unemployment and the lowest percentage of Americans in the working age group actually holding jobs in America that we have had since 1970. Wages are down. Professor Borjas at Harvard documents that excessive immigration pulls down wages. Since 2007 wages of median-income families are down $4,000. I would say to colleagues that the first thing we should do is focus on getting jobs for Americans who are unemployed. Are we going to keep Americans on welfare and benefits while we bring in more and more foreigners to take jobs when we have Americans ready and willing to take those jobs? They like to suggest these guest workers are doing farm work. They are not. The overwhelming majority of guest workers admitted to the U.S. are not farm workers, but are taking jobs throughout the economy. A farm worker program, with temporary labor, if properly managed, is a good program. I do not oppose that. People come and work for a period of time, and if they return home and come back the next season and make enough money to take care of their families maybe for the whole year, that can work if properly managed. But look at this. The H-1Bs are people with high-tech degrees, high-tech skills. They are competing against college graduates who have computer skills and other skills. This is what we get. This is how it is working in this country. A bunch of companies got together and they signed a letter to Speaker Boehner and Nancy Pelosi, the Democratic leader in the House, asking for immigration reform back in September 2013. They said they needed more H-1B workers, and they pushed for that. [[Page S1051]] I would just note this: Byron York from the Washington Examiner has written about this, and this is what the facts are. They are not hiring people. They don't have a shortage of workers. They are laying off workers in very large numbers. Hewlett-Packard had 29,000 job cuts in 2012--29,000. They signed the letter. Cisco Systems eliminated 4,000 jobs in August 2013 in addition to 8,000 cut in the last 2 years. They signed the letter asking for more H-1B workers. United Technologies cut 3,000 jobs in 2013; American Express, 5,400 jobs in 2013; Procter & Gamble, 5,700 jobs in 2012; and T-Mobile, 2,250 layoffs in 2012. These are companies that are asking for more foreign workers. This is another report that was in the Los Angeles Times just a few days ago: ``A loophole in immigration law is costing thousands of American jobs.'' Since last summer, [Southern California] Edison-- The biggest utility company in California-- which serves nearly 14 million customers, has been firing its domestic IT workers and replacing them with outsourced employees from India. . . . The pay for Edison's domestic IT specialists is about $80,000 to $160,000 not including benefits. Good pay. The two Indian outsourcing firms providing workers to Edison, Tata Consultancy Services and Infosys, pay their recruits an average of about $65,000 to $71,000, according to federal filings. They are laying off hundreds and requiring the California Edison employees to train the H-1B workers who shouldn't be coming into America unless there is a job need that is unfilled. How can you say we don't have qualified people? They are doing the job, and they are expected to train them. This is the kind of thing that is out of control. Somebody needs to defend the legitimate interests of middle America. We need to ask ourselves: Does this make sense? Should the President be doubling up on it with his Executive amnesty that would add 179,600 new workers in the first year of his order and 55,000 more annually on top of the H-1B flow? We have legislation that has moved in this Senate that would more than double the number of H-1B workers coming into the country when the evidence indicates they are not needed. It might make businesses happy; they can pay half the salary of what they would otherwise be paying. But it would not be good for Americans who invested in education, trained themselves, worked themselves into a good job, and have it pulled out from under them. I thank the Chair and yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio. Presidential Leadership Mr. PORTMAN. Mr. President, I wish I could rise today to talk about the underlying legislation we are supposed to be talking about, which is a bill to fund the Department of Homeland Security, and also address the President's Executive order on immigration, which went around the Congress but also went around the American people. A judge in Texas agrees with those of us on this side of the aisle who look at this as an illegal act. Instead, the President ought to work with us. The President should work with the House and the Senate and the elected representatives of the American people to actually pass a law to help fix what is broken in our immigration system. We are not able to get on that legislation, and it is not because we have differences about the bill that we could talk about. We could have votes on amendments and debate this issue, but there are those on the other side of the aisle who have decided they don't even want us to have the opportunity to hash out those differences so we can vote. I think the constituents I represent in Ohio expect us to have that debate, and they want us to have that debate. I hope those on the other side of the aisle will let us have that debate, and we could have a good, honest discussion about this and address both of these problems-- the need to fund the Department and also the need to address this Executive order. I think it is another example where Washington has let down the people I represent. In the meantime, this is no time for political games. It is a dangerous world. We have a real problem, not just here at home in protecting the homeland, but also with fires burning all around the world. It is time we showed some leadership both here in this Chamber and down the street at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue. It is time for Presidential leadership. If you turn on the TV tonight, what you will see is those fires burning. You will see a world more dangerous than the one we had after 9/11. You will see threats to the United States and our allies that seem to grow with every passing day. But even as these threats grow, it seems as though our President is increasingly hesitant to lead. Iran, despite the platitudes of the Obama administration, which seems really eager to find an agreement and make a deal, continues its march toward developing nuclear weapons. ISIS, the group the President once described as the JV team when they were in Iraq flying the black flag of Islam extremism over cities such as Fallujah and Mosul, cities where American marines gave their lives to liberate--the President called them the JV team. Russian soldiers now move freely through eastern Ukraine, and the separatists there are using Russian equipment, they are trained by the Russian military, led by Russian special forces, and they continue to wage war on an American ally, Ukraine. While we all hoped the recent cease-fire would hold, all indications are that Russia and its proxies are taking advantage of that cease-fire in Ukraine to continue their aggression. Across Europe--in France, Denmark, and Belgian--innocent people have been murdered. Some were murdered for opposing terrorists aims, and some for the simple fact they are Jewish. These attacks are not random, as has been suggested by the administration. Unfortunately, they are designed to incite fear and weaken our resolve to oppose Islamic terrorism wherever we find it. We must not allow them to succeed any more than we must stand silent in the face of Iranian threats and Russian aggression. What we must do is take a long, hard look at how we got here and what we must do going forward to change the situation. In my view, a lot of the chaos we are seeing across the globe stems from a lack of leadership. Into that void, chaos ensues. The defining themes in the Obama administration's approach to foreign policy have been a preference for disengagement and an unwillingness to shoulder the responsibility of global leadership the way previous Presidents-- Democrat and Republican alike--have done. As the administration itself has said, they prefer to lead from behind. The President has said that ``the trajectory of this planet overall is one toward less violence, more tolerance.'' I don't know about that. I don't think history moves inexorably toward more justice and more peace. These trajectories don't just happen, people make them happen. Leadership is the key. When America is strong, when we stand unequivocally for freedom and justice and the right of all people to choose their own destiny, when we do not back down in the face of threats and intimidation, that is when we see a world that is more stable, less dangerous, and more free. More wars, more conflicts, more threats to our security--these don't typically arise from American strength. They arise from American weakness. When we look around the world--whether it is in Gaza or Eastern Europe or Iraq or Iran or Syria, the increase in violence and instability has coincided with the growing perception that the United States of America is either unwilling or unable to take a stand against threats to international security and stability. Addressing these complex challenges--and many of them are very complex--requires a sustained and proactive American leadership role and American engagement. It requires strategies that seek to shape outcomes, not be shaped by them. There is a lot at stake. Events in Ukraine, the Middle East, and elsewhere are a direct challenge to the United States-led international order, which has led to unprecedented global prosperity and stability for both the United States and for the world. Confidence in America's willingness to use our unmatched economic, political, and military capabilities to uphold our system deters potential challengers and incentivizes other countries to [[Page S1052]] play by the rules, which reduces the chances of war. If the credibility of this commitment is in doubt, then the stability and openness upon which U.S. economic prosperity and national security depend is jeopardized and the chance for violence, instability, and economic collapse increases. The world is watching. They are watching to see whether this American-led order can withstand these challenges or if we really are entering into a period of the post-American world. In Ukraine, the administration's response has been incomplete, reactionary, and ineffective. There are many political and economic dimensions of this conflict, and Ukraine needs Western support to implement crucial reforms in these areas. But there is also a military dimension to this crisis that we cannot continue to ignore. Sanctions alone have not worked. The so-called cease-fire agreements have not worked. As President Obama, Angela Merkel, and Francois Hollande debate and discuss cease-fires and timelines, Russia is deciding the outcome on the ground in eastern Ukraine this afternoon as we talk. Unless we help provide Ukraine with the tools they need to prevent that from happening, any future agreements will only solidify this reality. Let's allow them to defend themselves. Russia continues to believe that military force is a viable option to achieve its goals, and unless the United States and its European allies and NATO help the Ukrainians prove otherwise, this behavior is unlikely to change. It is well known by now that the President has refused to adopt policies that actually provide Ukraine with the capabilities it needs. A bipartisan coalition, on the other hand, has emerged here in Congress on the need to do more, and we will continue to advocate for a change in course and pursuit of a proactive, comprehensive strategy that actually works. In the Middle East, proactive American leadership requires upholding our commitment to stand unequivocally with Israel. No other nation in the world would be expected to put up with tunnels into their cities with rockets raining down on people's homes. The press got it wrong last year, and with all due respect, I believe the President got it wrong too. There is no moral equivalence in Gaza. I have made a few trips to Israel. I met with their people. I have walked the streets of Sderot and have seen the remains of missiles that were targeted against innocents with hatred and an intent to kill and maim. I have been out to the bomb shelters and the indoor fortified playgrounds built so children can have a chance to play without fear. I have spent time with an Iron Dome battery crew outside Ashkelon. I can tell you this: From what I have learned, the people of Israel want peace. Unfortunately, we know the biggest winner from this administration's wavering support of Israel is Iran. Iran continues to stall on negotiations meant to end their nuclear weapons program. They continue to ask for more time, and the administration continues to grant it. Meanwhile, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is coming to the United States next week to speak of the threat that Iran poses not only to Israel but to the world, and the President seems to be too busy to meet with him. Truly, the world has turned upside down. A key test of U.S. leadership is ensuring that Iran does not retain nuclear capability in their continued march toward weaponization. If it were in my power, I would put the Kirk-Menendez Iran sanctions bill--of which I am an original cosponsor--here on the floor on the Senate today, and, by the way, it would pass. I believe it would pass with over 60 votes because Republicans and Democrats alike recognize that Iran will not negotiate in good faith unless the United States is unequivocal in our commitment to ending the nuclear threat Iran poses. You will recall that this legislation does not impose new sanctions that would be imposed now. These sanctions would be imposed if the Iranians do not agree to halt their nuclear weapons program as required, by the way, by the United Nations. These are leveraged for the White House, and the White House should use that leverage. American leadership is needed for a more stable and peaceful world. I believe the future does not belong to bigotry and hate, but to freedom- loving people of the world, and the United States of America must lead the way. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired. Mr. PORTMAN. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota. Mr. FRANKEN. Mr. President, I rise today to talk about the funding for the Department of Homeland Security and the continuing need for immigration reform. We need to fund the Department of Homeland Security and we should pass a clean DHS funding bill. That is the only bill that can pass the Senate, and that is the only bill that should pass the Senate. Once that bill has passed the Senate and the House and becomes law, then we can and should move on to consider immigration legislation. Republican leadership in the Senate has wasted a lot of time over the past month politicizing immigration and mixing it up with the issue of funding this Federal agency that helps to protect the United States from terrorists and other threats, and those threats are real. Just this past weekend, the terrorist organization al-Shabaab issued a threatening video suggesting that the Mall of America in my State of Minnesota could be a target for a terrorist attack. Look, this issue is not something we should be politicizing. We should enact into law a clean funding bill for DHS, and we should fund the Department for the whole year and not make the Department run for a short time on a continuing resolution and just revisit the issue in the near future. That is not what we want. And then we should and can debate immigration. I have always believed the best way to accomplish meaningful and sustainable immigration reform is through congressional action. In the last Congress, the Senate took such action. As a member of the Judiciary Committee, I was very proud to play an active role in the comprehensive immigration bill the Senate passed with broad bipartisan support. For me, this was a model of how the Senate was supposed to work. Four Senators from each side of the aisle, known as the Gang of 8, came together and crafted a bill which we then marked up in the Judiciary Committee, and I was very pleased that a number of my amendments were included in the bill, which then went to the Senate floor and passed with 68 votes. That bill would have provided a real and comprehensive overhaul of our broken immigration system. It would have significantly strengthened our border security, and it would have helped a lot of people--from small businesses to families in our legal immigration system to the many undocumented immigrants who would have an opportunity, through a tough but fair path, to get right with the law. There are millions of people in our country who want the same things that all of us want--a steady job, excellent education for our children, and a brighter future for their families. But they are living in limbo and often in fear. Our bill would help them come out of the shadows and get right with the law. The Senate passed our bill in June of 2013. I was very hopeful the House would take up and pass the Senate bill. If the House had allowed a vote on the Senate bill, it would have passed the House and been enacted into law. That would have meant real and lasting reform to our broken immigration system. Unfortunately, over the course of the next year and a half the Republican leadership in the House failed to act on the bipartisan immigration reform bill passed in the Senate--again, with 68 votes. The President took a step forward that will help a lot of people and will help to address fixing our broken immigration system. While I still believe Congress needs to act, I think we need to keep the Executive actions in place until we do. I will not support any legislative effort to undo President Obama's Executive actions. We are presented with a choice. Once we pass a bill into law to fund the Department of Homeland Security, we can take a step forward and help a lot more people by passing comprehensive immigration reform or we can take a step backward and harm a lot of people without getting any closer to the comprehensive immigration reform we need. [[Page S1053]] I will vote to move forward, not backward. We need a fully funded Department of Homeland Security, and we need a comprehensively overhauled immigration system. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Ayotte). The clerk will call the roll. The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. BENNET. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Gardner). Without objection, it is so ordered. Childhood Poverty Mr. BENNET. Mr. President, it is a privilege to be here with my colleague from Colorado. I rise to talk about our schools and really to talk about our values and our morality--what we stand for as a country--and to ask whether we are able to look forward and create a better future for our children. To set the record straight, let me be clear. When it comes to our children, I have fallen short, you have fallen short, and this body has fallen short. Let me explain why. We have learned in the last couple of weeks that over half of the public school children in this country are now poor enough that they qualify for free or reduced lunches at school--children who, through no fault of their own, are reaping the whirlwind of 15 years of stagnant middle-class family income and the effects of the worst recession since the Great Depression. By many measures, as the Presiding Officer knows, Colorado's economy leads the Nation. But even in our home State, we see more children living in poverty. In fact, the number of children in poverty is growing faster in Colorado than in most of the other 50 States. As a country and as a State, we are making a lot of progress in a number of dimensions, but we are headed in the wrong direction when it comes to our kids. That is a bad sign for any country but particularly for a democracy that aspires to be the land of opportunity. A girl in poverty in the United States is five times more likely to be a young single mother than a child from a middle-class family, and a boy in poverty is twice as likely to be incarcerated as his middle- class peers. Children from low-income families in this country are about three times less likely to graduate from high school. Someone from a family in poverty stands only a 9-in-100 chance of earning a college degree. Think about that. There are 100 seats in this Chamber. There are 100 desks in this Chamber. If they represented children living in poverty in the United States, that desk, that desk, that desk, those three desks, and three of those desks would represent college graduates. The entire rest of this Chamber would be people that would never earn a college degree or its equivalent and who would be constrained to the margins of our economy and our democracy as a result after that. Interestingly enough, the equivalent number for children in the top quarter of income earners is almost 80 out of 100. So 80 of these desks from a more affluent family--80 of these desks would represent a person who graduated with a college degree or its equivalent, and 20 would represent people that had fallen short, but nine poor children would have a college degree. In other words, in a way that is profoundly at war with our founding ideals, poverty breeds deeper poverty, lack of educational achievement reaps deeper academic failure, and broken families are the surest predictor of more broken families in the next generation and the generations beyond that. This is a sentence of unequal opportunity for all poor Americans, no matter the color of their skin. It is a generational sentence for 7 out of 10 children who will remain at the bottom of the income scale their entire lives. Are there people who defy these odds? Of course there are. As superintendent of the Denver public schools and in this job, I have met scores of children who have overcome the odds--sometimes alone--but often also with the help of a parent who wouldn't quit, a teacher who wouldn't take ``no'' for an answer, a former gang member whose sworn duty is to keep young people out of gangs, a philanthropist who insisted that Denver's kids would go to college. In these exceptional children I have seen the indomitable nature of the human spirit persevere against all odds and have recognized how little I and most of us have achieved by comparison. I have met kids who take three buses both ways to school leaving as early as 5:30 in the morning just to have the benefit of a better school all the way on the other side of town, kids who can't get up in the morning because they have to work until 11 o'clock or 12 o'clock at night in a fast food restaurant to help pay the rent, kids who pour their heart and soul out into their studies and communities only to learn that college is not for them because of an immigration status they did not even know that they had. I met kids who were the primary caregivers of younger brothers and sisters who are taking care of ailing parents and grandparents, who have made it to college for the first time in their family's history who are that 9 in 100, who represent the best of our human spirit. They are our heroes. As one of our Denver public school students, Chaunsea Dyson from South High School, recently told a radio reporter, ``When you are growing up in poverty, when you are 15 or 16 that means you are grown.'' That means you are grown. As the father of three girls who are 15, 14, and 10, I would say that is an awful lot to expect of a 16-year-old, especially one coming from circumstances few in this Chamber could overcome. My point is that while there are many heroic people in our schools--kids, teachers, principals--succeeding in our school system today, heroism is not a standard we tend to count on for the success of human enterprise. We simply can't scale heroism. I wish we could--but we can't--to address the scope of our achievement gap. It is too much to ask, and it is not fair to our kids who have no control over the circumstances of their birth. I don't think there is one Member in this Chamber who could come and say that is not true, that a child could control somehow the circumstances of his or her birth, because one of the enduring truths of being a human being is that we don't get to choose our parents. We don't choose to be born into a home of wealth or poverty, a home that values books or learning or a home which for whatever reason does not. That is a matter of good and bad luck. Yet those circumstances beyond our children's control--absolutely beyond their control--today almost always determine educational outcomes in the United States of America. So the question is, What is our obligation? What is our obligation as a nation to remedy the burden of bad luck for millions of American children? I believe at a minimum it means we have a moral duty to assure that our less lucky children have educational opportunities that let them make the most of their God-given potential. That is certainly what I would want for my own daughters. If we are honest, then by any reckoning we are failing to meet this moral duty and I would say failing very badly. If we ask ourselves why we are failing to do our duty--how can this be--in my mind it comes down to a sad and simple reality: We are treating America's children as if they were someone else's children rather than our own. To demonstrate this let's consider what conditions we have allowed to exist for a child born, through no fault of her own, into poverty in the United States of America in the year 2015. We know that by the age of 4 she will have heard 30 million fewer words than her more affluent peers--30 million. Ask any elementary schoolteacher in the country whether that will make a difference in how prepared she is for kindergarten. Fewer than half of poor children start school with the skills they need to be ready to succeed in kindergarten. Every elementary schoolteacher in America knows that. What are the odds her neighborhood school will meet her needs? How about a school 1 mile away? How about a school 5 miles away? It is not likely in many American cities and rural communities. When she reaches the fourth grade her odds are no better. She is 9 years old and there are 30 children in her classroom. On average, 24 of her classmates cannot read at grade level--24 out of 30. Her chances of being a proficient reader--20 percent--one in five. [[Page S1054]] One in five poor children cannot read at grade level in the fourth grade in the United States of America this week, today, this year. Would any of us accept those odds or outcomes for our own children? Would any one person in this Chamber accept that? Would any of us still be in Washington engaged in the Potemkin debates we are having if our child couldn't read by the fourth grade? Of course not--of course we wouldn't. But we act as if it is not our children who are the casualties, and so we smile and we stroke our chins on the cable TV and pretend this is all somehow out of our hands, too hard to solve, someone else's problem. Here is where it ends. In this knowledge-based global economy, this unforgiving global economy, only 9 out of 100 kids, as I said in poverty, will graduate with a college degree or its equivalent and 91 will not. These are the results we have produced for our children in this unforgiving global economy. But for once let's put aside the finger-pointing and the blame-- although we should take our fair share of responsibility--and let's ask the questions our children might reasonably ask to judge their Nation's leaders. For example, they might ask: Why do we trail behind 35 other developed countries in our math scores? Why does the United States rank 20th in increasing educational attainment from one generation to the next--20th; the least likely country to produce more educated people coming after us than there were before us. Why are American children much more likely to be stuck in the economic class into which they are born than children in at least 12 other countries, including Canada, Japan, Germany, Australia, and Denmark? These seem like reasonable questions. You wouldn't know they were on anybody's mind around here with what concerns us on this floor, but I can tell you it is of concern to people at home. Why are we consigning, they might ask, our children and ourselves to a social economic framework that is increasing, not decreasing, inequality in this country, when other countries in the world are headed in the opposite direction? Why are we putting up with a set of circumstances in which income and equality in America has grown significantly much faster than other industrialized countries in the world? If I were a child living in poverty in this country, those are the questions I would want to know, in addition to the fact that I can't find a school, not just down the street, not just in my neighborhood but in my city or even in the region of my State to go to. To put it another way, I can't find a school in my community that any Member of the Senate would be proud to send their child to. Why can't I find that school? I didn't pick my parents. That was a question of good luck or bad luck. In my case it was bad luck. I know there are profound disagreements about whether the Federal, State or local government should serve our kids and how. I am even sympathetic, believe me, as a former school superintendent, to many arguments about how poorly Washington is often situated to help. But surely as a nation, one way or another, we have a moral obligation. That is our legacy as Americans ``in Order to form a more perfect Union, establish Justice, ensure domestic Tranquility, provide for the common defense, promote the general Welfare, and secure the Blessings of Liberty to ourselves and our Posterity. . . . '' Imagine how less powerful the Preamble to the Constitution would have been if it stopped with ourselves, period--but it didn't. It resolves the question in favor of our posterity--our posterity, not someone else's--our children, not someone else's. What would this debate sound like if we were serious about this moral obligation? Without deciding today who would deliver and pay for these important social goods, something we should debate and understand, consult with our States and our school districts, our parents and our communities; but, without making those decisions today, if we just were treating the country's children as our own children, what would this debate sound like? What would we do? We surely would provide every parent and her child with the choice to access early childhood education from birth to age 5 in order to attack that 30 million word deficit. Surely we would do that. I am not saying we should do it. I don't think we should do that from here, but as a nation we should do that. Surely we would ensure that every child, without exception and regardless of where they live, has the choice to attend a high-performing school from kindergarten to 12th grade. Surely we would do that. We would enable every young person, consistent with most of our postwar history, the chance to attain a college degree or other advanced technical training without bankrupting their family. I saw some data this weekend about this that showed that in 1975--and admittedly it was the high-water mark--the Pell grants covered roughly 76 percent of what it cost to go to college, the average cost of college. Do you know what that number is now? It is 22 percent, mostly because the cost of college has increased so much. Bankruptcy is a real issue. These goals--early childhood education, a great K-12 school, affordable college--might seem obvious and even unimaginative to many of us in this Chamber, but that might be because we take them for granted for our own children. Of course we want high- quality early childhood education, of course we want a high-quality K- 12 school, of course we want our young people to have access to college without bankrupting our family, and that is the experience of a lot of people in this Chamber. The terrible reality for most poor children in America in 2015 is that these simple goals are as out of reach as flying to the Moon, all over this country. Some say we can't afford to change, and I say we can't afford not to change. The costs of failure, as we know, are simply too high. Since the Industrial Revolution, we have had the greatest economy the world has ever known, and if we are to remain so in the 21st century, we must educate our people. We have no other choice. They are our greatest asset. We can do it. I am not proposing today a new Federal program of any kind. However, I will say if it were left up to me, we would have a standing committee in the Senate focused exclusively on our children and their future. Such a committee would, for example, examine every funding stream in the Federal budget related to kids and ask what is working and what is not working. What redundancies exist? How are we going to align every single taxpayer dollar or tax credit to help support the health, education, and well-being of our children? I suspect that in addition to increasing efficiency, we would decide to spend more of our resources in and around schools. That is where our kids are, after all, and that is where the people who have served them in our communities need to be instead of tied up in the redtape of compliance and outdated and unimaginative Federal rules and regulations. In addition to that, we need to explore more efficient ways to finance social welfare programs, promote more creative ways to weave our social safety net in this country, and reform our criminal justice system. A good start would be to graduate children from high school, since around 80 percent of our prison inmates are high-school dropouts. That would help a lot. We need to better engage with the private and nonprofit sectors when the government isn't working well enough. This is all part of a broader but essential conversation, one this body continues to avoid while it wanders from one phony conflict to the next, and one that becomes more difficult and more expensive the longer we wait. Our kids are waiting for us to have this conversation. We are wasting their time. It is one thing for us to waste our own time--although the capacity for doing that around here is beyond belief--but we ought to stop wasting our kids' time. As I said, it is only going to become more difficult and more expensive the longer we wait. In the meantime, we have before us the potential to rewrite the Elementary and Secondary School Act. Fixing so-called No Child Left Behind is only one piece of the puzzle. Given where we are, this is all pretty modest stuff. There are some very encouraging signs, although the law has plenty of flaws. In fact, I said many times that if we had a rally out in front of the Capitol to keep No Child Left Behind the [[Page S1055]] same--if that is what the rally was for--not a single person in America would show up for that rally. Incidentally, while we have this reauthorization in front of us, it is a reauthorization that should have happened 7 years ago. It expired 7 years ago. We are running education policy in this country by waivers from the Department of Education because this Congress cannot do its job. Almost 40 of 50 States have waivers from the law as it exists today. Let's change the law. Let's write it properly. Let's do our work around here instead of spending our time on things the American people don't want us to spend our time on. Although everybody loves to hate No Child Left Behind, and I put myself in that category, it has some good things. It required us to face the facts about how our kids in poverty are doing in our schools. It shed light for the first time on the achievement gap--the brutal achievement gap--we have in this country, and some school districts stepped up. Denver Public Schools is one such district. Over the last decade, Denver Public Schools has implemented a number of changes and has seen real results. My schoolboard and my principals and my teachers and our kids and I would be the first to say we have not yet gotten to a place where you can say the ZIP Code you were born into doesn't determine the education you are going to get, but we are a lot closer in Denver. We are a lot closer there than we are in a lot of other cities in this country. We have seen some real results. Almost 30 percent more students graduated and went to college last year than in 2005. That is not enough. We are not satisfied with that. But if you could say that about every single city in this country, that we were graduating and sending 30 percent more students to college than we were in 2005, that might give us some hope for the future. That might suggest that some outcomes other than the ones we have been seeing with the result of 9 out of 100 poor kids getting a college degree is not where we have to end up, is not where we have to land. I am here to tell you, not as a U.S. Senator, but as someone who was a superintendent of the Denver Public Schools, this is possible. It is possible to change these outcomes in urban districts and in rural districts for children who are unlucky enough to be born into poverty in the greatest Nation on the planet--unlucky enough to be born poor and not born rich. Denver has recognized the importance of providing access to high- quality, early childhood education, and now an estimated 70 percent of Denver's 4-year-olds are enrolled in preschool. That was not true in 2005. As the Presiding Officer knows, we live in a State that doesn't require or pay for 5-year-olds to go to kindergarten. That is a shame. But because of the changes we made in Denver, our 5-year-olds go to kindergarten--a full day if they want it, which most of them do--and 70 percent of the fourth graders in Denver have early childhood education, and it is not only delivered by the Denver Public Schools, but by other providers as well and the Denver public schools. This seems to be having an effect as kids who attend the Denver preschool program track higher in school readiness. They know more about the alphabet, words, and books. They have a higher vocabulary and are able to comprehend basic math. And in kindergarten, first, and second grade, they showed better literacy and math skills than their peers. The dropout rate in Denver has decreased since 2005 by 60 percent. Incidentally, the teen pregnancy rate has also fallen by 60 percent. Denver Public Schools has gone from being the district with the lowest rate of academic growth among major districts in the State to the highest for 3 straight years. I am not taking responsibility for that. I am here, not there. Last year DPS students from low-income families had stronger growth in math and writing than nonfree- and reduced-lunch students Statewide. And Denver's nonfree- and reduced-lunch students showed more growth than their State counterparts in math by nine points. This was once labeled the failing school district in our State, but because of the data that we have as a result of No Child Left Behind, we can actually see what is happening--which kids are growing and which kids are not, which schools are driving growth among kids and which schools are not. You can look at a map of our city and find a school that looks just like your low-performing school with the same percentage of free- and reduced-lunch kids where kids are succeeding beyond their wildest dreams. Then what parents can do is say: I want that school, not this school, for my kid. Because we have a robust system of choice in Denver, parents are able to take advantage of that data, and we simply would not have had the proliferation of high-performing charter schools if it had not been for No Child Left Behind. In addition, Denver has gone beyond that. We have 33 innovation schools where teachers and administrators have the flexibility to modernize their teaching practices and have more autonomy to make decisions at the school level to better meet the needs of individual students. And it is not just Denver. We have seen progress all across the country--not remotely enough, but we have seen progress, and we cannot go backward. In the 3 decades prior to No Child Left Behind being passed--30 years--the average 9-year-old's reading score on the National Assessment of Educational Progress increased only 4 points--4 points in 30 years. Is that acceptable? Contrast that to the gains from 1990 to 2012, which is roughly the life of No Child Left Behind. During that span, 9-year-olds gained 9 points in reading, about 7 times as much annual progress. We have seen similar progress in math--9-year-olds only increased 2 points from 1990 to 1999, but from 1999 to 2012, they gained 12 points. In that same span, African-American students improved by 15 points and Latino students improved by 21 points. The achievement gap shrunk as well. In reading, the gap between White and African-American 9-year-old students dropped from 35 to 23 points. It is still too big, but it is moving in the right direction. This represents progress, but as I have said, in the face of stiff competition worldwide, it is nowhere near enough. Since the year 2000, we have dropped from second to twelfth in the world in the production of college graduates. We need to write a bill that builds on our successes and turns us away from the failed practices of the past, and we cannot do it if we are constrained by the typical politics--the small politics of Washington. We cannot afford to have the same tired fights. We won't always agree on everything, but I know we can find a way to pass a bill that helps our schools and school districts to make the decisions they think are best for the kids they are educating. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired. We are under a 10-minute time limitation. Mr. BENNET. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for 7 more minutes. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. BENNET. I appreciate the indulgence of my colleague from Louisiana. In a significant demonstration of leadership around here, Chairman Alexander and Senator Murray have told us they intend to write a bipartisan bill. Their process has the potential to be a rare exception to the gridlock that has gripped this Senate, along with our bipartisan work on the farm bill and immigration. Senators Alexander and Murray have both expressed a willingness to work together because they appreciate the importance of this task. They understand the consequences of failure. They know enough about this issue, and they care enough about it. In January of 1941, during one of the Nation's most difficult times-- the height of the Great Depression and on the eve of our entry into the Second World War, Franklin Roosevelt declared that there were four universal freedoms that all persons possessed--freedom of speech, freedom of worship, freedom from want, and freedom from fear. Today, in the 21st century, some of these freedoms may be obtainable, but an honest assessment tells us it would be impossible to achieve all of them without something additional, and that is freedom from ignorance. In the end, freedom from ignorance is the surest relief from the shackles of poverty. [[Page S1056]] Where does this leave us as we begin this important but long overdue national conversation on the reauthorization of the Elementary and Secondary School Act? First, for all the reasons I have mentioned, America's children would benefit if we treated our work less as legislators than as parents and grandparents with a real stake in the outcome of what we decide. Second, we must be clear-eyed about the Federal Government's proper role in American education and what is not. As a superintendent, I learned there are many things the Federal Government cannot and should not do when it comes to educating our children. And above all else, Washington cannot and should not micromanage our schools or our school districts or cultivate systems driven by compliance rather than creativity. I believe the evidence of our failures and our successes over the last 15 years suggest three primary Federal responsibilities: equity, accountability, and innovation. After all, the deep and intractable inequities that persisted along lines of race and class and geography in America of the 1960s drove Lyndon Johnson to pass the first Elementary and Secondary Schools Act. They drove the creation of title I, specific funds targeted to the kids who needed the greatest support. Sadly, for all the reasons I said, half a century later the data reveals these profound inequities persist and our students need our help now more than ever. But there is also reason for hope in this data, and maybe that is the most important message I can bring. We now have evidence that sustains support to make the difference in closing the pernicious gaps that remain for low-income kids around the country. Our deep commitment to equity, therefore, is as important today as it was in 1963. This means not just committing title I resources, but continuing to expand efforts to open the best schools and attract the best teachers and principals to our communities in the greatest need. In particular, we must help teachers who are saying they want better preparation, they want an excellent principal in their school, they want a better compensation system and opportunities for leadership that allow them to continue working with students. At DPS we have made some strides. We created the Denver Teacher Residency Program and introduced differentiated pay. We used Federal innovation dollars to help us improve and expand early on. We are creating leadership roles for teachers who demonstrate results with their students. We survey our teachers every year, and their satisfaction rates are higher than the national average. But there is still much more for us to do. Second, those of us working in the field know we must have a clear, shared system of accountability, a system that allows us to monitor, understand, and improve outcomes for students. This requires annual assessments that monitor progress and growth across all our cities and States. It requires breaking down data to show how and if we are closing the gaps for all students in our school districts. It means requiring States to take courageous action to turn around those schools that consistently fail our children. That is not just about paying attention to how we are serving our low-income students in Detroit or Denver. It means examining how well we serve our historically disadvantaged students even when they live in some of the most advantaged neighborhoods. As we do this, we need to work to reduce the amount of testing in our schools. As the father of three daughters in the Denver public schools, I am concerned about how much they are tested. But as their father, I also want to know every year how they are doing against a set of rigorous standards and compared to kids in Denver, across Colorado, and around the world. Will they be ready for college? Do they have the skills they need to succeed in this global economy? Third, we have learned over the last decade there is a vital Federal role when it comes to innovation in our schools. We can help provide the preconditions for success by providing incentives for educators on the ground to apply their own creative thinking to address our most persistent education problems. I say to my colleague from Louisiana, through the Chair, I am coming to the end. I owe him 10 minutes whenever he would like it. I thank him for his indulgence. We will never solve the challenges our teachers and students face in Washington, period. We will not do it from here. We can help local leaders break free from a status quo that will never succeed for enough of America's children. We should help identify the challenges, provide resources to local educators to overcome them in the context that works best for their communities and their students, and we should continue to be the clearinghouse that gathers these stories of successful innovation and provide the resources to invest in scaling what works and sharing these practices across communities and States. Equity, accountability, innovation--that is our charge and the commitment we must keep if we are to build an America where we treat every child as if she were our own. As a parent myself, I am well aware the first responsibility any parent has is the education of her child. I am also aware that many people believe a bad education is just one more outcome produced by corrosive poverty in this country. Fix poverty, and you will fix education. Maybe so, but that is cold comfort for millions of children in our schools today. In the end, we have a duty as a nation to ensure that education liberates our children, rather than reinforces the circumstances into which they were born. In that sense, America's children are our children, our responsibility, not someone else's. Can you really accept an America in which your little girl has just a 1-in-5 chance of being able to read well or a 9-in-100 chance to graduate from college? Can you really demand heroism as a precondition for success? If this were your child, would you still be in the Senate, or would you go home and solve the problem? It has been said the future has no lobby in Washington, DC. Are we really content to have that depressing observation be the ultimate verdict on our leadership? I doubt we are. I would raise this as a bipartisan challenge as I close. I know the Senator from Louisiana knows a lot about what I came to talk about today, and I look forward to working with him on the health committee. Here is my bipartisan challenge. Let's forge a lobby for the future. Let's agree that the obligation we owe the Founders is to create more opportunity, not less, for the children coming after us. Let's pledge that every child in America is our child, and our future rests with her, as it most assuredly does. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana. Mr. CASSIDY. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the House- passed Homeland Security appropriations bill. This bill is not just about whether we should fund the Department of Homeland Security to carry out the very important work of protecting our Nation, but also whether we will provide amnesty to those here illegally. First, let's establish that the Constitution says Congress has authority over our immigration and naturalization laws. The President does not have the authority to waive legal requirements. The Supreme Court has upheld this on numerous occasions. The President has admitted more than 20 times he does not have this authority. That said, now his administration is attempting to block the ruling the judge recently made to protect his amnesty plan. As has been reported in the papers, Judge Hanen in Texas has put an injunction against proceeding with the President's amnesty bill. It is reported the Department of Homeland Security, at the President's direction, is moving forward with plans to seal large contracts with companies to process deferred-action applications for millions of illegal immigrants as soon as possible. American families have seen President Obama rewrite the laws many times, and the outcomes of the recent elections show they do not support President Obama's Executive overreach. The President intends to grant amnesty to 5 million people. This will [[Page S1057]] not be done on a case-by-case basis as the law suggests it should be. It is going to be a rubberstamp, a rubberstamp at the expense of those who are legally attempting to come to our country. It will take longer for those who are attempting to come legally to gain admittance under the law. I support the efforts of those coming to the United States to make a better life for themselves and their family. We all believe in immigration. We just think immigration should be legal. The President has rewritten the law to allow illegal immigrants the ability to receive work permits and drivers licenses which also includes receiving a Social Security number. After a certain period of time they will be eligible for Social Security. This goes far beyond his legal authority. By the way, many of my Democratic colleagues have expressed concerns about the President's action and whether he had the constitutional authority to take the action he has taken. Clearly he does not. While the President says this legal status is temporary, the reality is once work permits have been issued and Social Security cards are given, folks will be allowed to stay. They would not be deemed a priority for removal. On top of that, the temporary status may be renewed. In 2011, the President took Executive action for the Department of Homeland Security to start prioritizing illegal immigrants for removal. In April 2014, several months before he took his most recent action, the Los Angeles Times quoted former ICE Director John Sandweg in an article where he said, If you are a run-of-the-mill immigrant here illegally, your odds of getting deported are close to zero. The Associated Press reported in September 2014 the Department of Homeland Security admitted to a group of immigrant advocates during a confidential meeting that about 70 percent of illegal immigrants traveling as families failed to report back to ICE as ordered after they were released at the border. A few weeks ago Louisiana school administrators and I met, and they expressed concern about how the President's immigration policies have stressed our school systems. Classroom sizes have grown. Their associated costs to hire more teachers, buy textbooks, and the required resources to educate these students all have grown. President Obama is giving Executive amnesty to suit his agenda but is stretching limited local and State resources. By stretching them, it is making it tougher on Americans who are born here. The administration says only 5 million people will be impacted by the President's Executive order. The reality is with numerous options for illegal immigrants to remain in this country, people are going to hear about it. They will attempt to come. This will be a magnet for others to come here illegally. Illegal behavior is being rewarded. If the President's supporters feel compelled to continue blocking the funding bill, it must be clear they feel that Executive amnesty is legal regardless of how the courts have ruled. It is clear they believe that protecting the President's illegal action is more important than providing our men and women with the resources to protect our border. We must fund the Department of Homeland Security. As I have said, many of my colleagues who expressed serious concerns with the President's Executive actions in November are now voting to protect these actions. It is unfortunate they voted four times to prevent this bill--the Homeland Security funding bill--from coming up for debate. They won't even allow debate. Folks say they want funding for the Homeland Security Department, but they won't allow debate. This is unconscionable. I believe it is important we move forward to avoid a shutdown of the Department of Homeland Security. I urge my colleagues to please stop blocking this important legislation we must pass to protect our country and give the men and women of Homeland Security the resources they need and, most importantly, to protect the Constitution. I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the role. The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Daines). Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, in 3\1/2\ days, the Department of Homeland Security may well shut down. I speak as the senior Democrat on the Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs for the last 2 years and, along with Dr. Tom Coburn, our former colleague from Oklahoma, chaired that committee that he and I led. But in 3\1/2\ days, if Congress fails to act responsibly--78 hours, I think, from right now--the Department of Homeland Security may shut down. I have spoken on the floor a number of times in recent weeks about the complex, consistent, and very real threats that our country faces. We are familiar with a lot of them--maybe not all. But over the past several months we have seen horrific images of beheadings, of mass murders, brutal executions at the hands of the Islamic State. Some of our Nation's largest companies and Federal agencies have been victims of massive cyber attacks. They continue to this day. This weekend another terrorist group, the Al Qaeda-linked terrorist group in Somalia called al-Shabaab, vowed they would seek revenge against the United States. They cited the Mall of America in Minnesota as a potential target. It is not just these groups or the lone wolf terrorists they inspire that we need to worry about. Last fall, Ebola ravaged several nations in western Africa and even came to our shores as well. Threats from Mother Nature persist too. Communities and cities in some parts of our country are trying to get through a winter that has already broken snowfall records, and more records are likely to fall. Yet today, here in the Congress, there are some who are questioning whether even to fund the very agencies charged with keeping us safe from these and other evolving threats. That goes beyond being irresponsible. Department of Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson nailed it recently when he said what it was. Here is what he said: ``It is bizarre and absurd that we are even having this discussion.'' I could not agree more. Is this really the message we want to be sending to all those folks across the world who wish us harm? God, I hope not. Here we are, days before this key agency could be forced to shut down preparing for the worst. Some of our colleagues have said that it is not a big deal if the Department shuts down. I could not disagree more strongly, and here is why. If we continue this behavior and fail to pass a clean Department of Homeland Security funding bill by midnight on Friday, this is what will happen at the Department of Homeland Security: Much of the Department's workforce, up to 200,000 people, will be expected to show up for work but work without pay. That includes Border Patrol agents who protect our borders. That includes Coast Guard crews who patrol our waters. That includes the TSA employees who keep our skies safe and make it safe to fly on airplanes and get in and out of our airports. Many of these courageous men and women put their lives in harm's way every day. We expect them to continue doing that. We just are not going to pay them. That is right. We want you to keep doing your job of protecting our Nation. Eventually, those in Congress will get around to doing our job. When we do, you will get paid. Let me ask: How would we like to be treated that way? How would we like to be treated that way? Well, we would not. I think it is shameful that we would even contemplate treating some of our bravest fellow employees like that. It is shameful. Even worse, treating our people like this does not make America any safer. In fact, it makes us less safe in the end. Even if we did avoid a shutdown, we would keep the Department running on a stopgap continuing resolution. We would prevent the men and women who work there from doing their jobs as efficiently and as effectively as they could be, should be, and would like to be. Secretary Johnson described that putting the Department on another continuing resolution--these are his words--``is a little like trying to drive [[Page S1058]] cross-country with no more than five gallons of gas [in the tank] at a time and you don't know when the next gas station is. You can't plan except days and weeks at a time.'' For example, if we pass another stopgap continuing resolution, the Department will not be able to replace obsolete surveillance technology along high-risk areas of our border. We need to replace that. In addition, our Nation will have significantly fewer resources to respond to any future surges of unaccompanied minors along our southwest border. Moreover, we will put construction of a badly needed national security cutter for the Coast Guard on hold. Why does that matter? It matters because our Coast Guard fleet is aging and needs to be modernized. These ships are essential to stopping illegal trafficking off our coasts, such as drug trafficking, human trafficking, and illegal immigration--some of it in vessels that travel at speeds of greater than 50 knots. If that is not enough, try this: It is widely known that employee morale at the Department of Homeland Security is the lowest of all major Federal agencies. Passing yet another continuing resolution I promise you will not make it any better--quite the opposite. Morale will only get worse, and in doing so threaten to degrade the performance of the people we rely on, perhaps more than any other, to keep Americans safe. So let me say it again. This is not the way we should be treating the public servants who in many cases risk their lives to keep our Nation and all Americans safe. This is no way to run a key national agency. Furthermore, as we have learned over the years, this kind of crisis budgeting costs taxpayers millions of dollars in lost productivity, in hiring freezes, in contracts that will have to be renegotiated--not at a lower cost to taxpayers--at higher costs. Now, I understand why some of our colleagues are concerned about the policies and procedures set forth in the President's Executive action on immigration. I get it. They have every right to express those concerns. But the budget of the Department of Homeland Security is not the place to have that debate. A Federal district court in South Texas recently examined what the President put forward and blocked its implementation. Why cannot we just let the judicial process play out and meanwhile do our job by funding the Department of Homeland Security for the balance of this fiscal year? Some of our Republican colleagues agree with this approach. One of our colleagues, Lindsey Graham, said earlier this week: ``I hope Republicans will come together and back the court case, file a friend of the court brief with the court and fund DHS.'' He added: I am willing and ready to pass a DHS funding bill and let this play out in court. The worst possible outcome for this nation is to defund the Department of Homeland Security given the multiple threats we face to our homeland. Our friend, Lindsey's friend, John McCain, also said recently--these are his words, not mine: It's not a good idea to shut down the Department of Homeland Security. . . . Now we have the perfect reason to not shut it down because the courts have decided, at least initially, in our favor. ``Our favor'' is that of the Republican Governors who filed the lawsuit in the South Texas district court. I want to urge my Republican colleagues to go ahead and pursue this potential judicial remedy to address the concerns they have. But while they are doing that, for God's sake, let's bring a clean, fiscal year 2015 appropriations bill for the Department of Homeland Security--the same bill that both Democrats and Republicans agreed to last December--let's bring it to the floor so we can give the Department the funding and the certainty that it desperately needs. Regardless of what happens in the courts, at the end of the day comprehensive immigration reform is the only way we can fix our broken immigration system for the long term. It is the only way we can address the issues the President was trying to resolve in his Executive action in a straightforward way, as we did in the last Congress when we passed by a big bipartisan vote right on this floor--by a 2-to-1 margin-- comprehensive immigration reform. We owe the American people an honest and thorough debate on immigration reform. But let's do it the right way. We have shown that we can do that. We did it a year and a half ago. Let's do it again. Let's do it this year after approving a clean, full-year funding bill for the Department of Homeland Security. I might just add this. The comprehensive immigration reform that we passed here by a 2-to-1 margin a year and a half ago was priced out by the Congressional Budget Office, which is not Democratic or Republican. They looked at it and did all the numbers and everything. They concluded that rather than increasing the budget deficit, that comprehensive immigration reform bill reduced the budget deficit for the next 10 years by $200 billion. Further, for the second 10 years, it reduced our budget deficit by $700 billion. A different study further suggested that the impact on our Nation's economy and on our gross domestic product by the implementation of that same comprehensive immigration reform was that it would not diminish the growth to our economy. It would actually increase it by 5 percent-- 5-percent GDP growth over a two-decade period of time. Those of us who are privileged to serve in the Senate were sent here by our constituents with a critical responsibility: to work together and pass laws that help our Nation and help our economy to grow and to thrive. This debate--or any debate, for that matter--should not be about one political party winning or losing, because the only people who are losing are the constituents we are supposed to serve. As long as we continue to spend our time debating these manufactured funding crises, our constituents--American taxpayers from coast to coast--are going to continue to lose. We as a Congress, I think, lose as well. I believe American voters made it clear in last fall's election. They are tired of all of this kind of behavior. I do not blame them either. But it is simple. They want us to do our job. They want us to work together across these aisles. They want us to get things done that need to get done. They want us to find ways to strengthen the---- I ask unanimous consent for 2 additional minutes. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. CARPER. In closing, let me just note that I am encouraged to hear that Senate Majority Leader McConnell now seems to be moving toward allowing a vote on a clean bill. I hope this change of course is the beginning of the end of this crisis for the Department of Homeland Security and for our country. Whatever we do, it is critical that we consider and pass a clean Department of Homeland Security funding bill first. At this point, every hour that goes by without one creates more uncertainty and more waste. After we do that, let's roll up our sleeves and let's get back to work on a thoughtful, 21st century immigration reform policy for our country, a policy that is fair, a policy that will significantly reduce our Nation's budget deficit, and a policy that will strengthen the economic recovery now underway. I want to thank my friend from Iowa for the kindness in allowing me to proceed for an extra few minutes. I yield the floor. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 31 (Tuesday, February 24, 2015)] [Senate] [Pages S1048-S1058] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2015--MOTION TO PROCEED--Continued Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, a number of things have been happening today with regard to the funding for the Department of Homeland Security. There has been a lot of spin that somehow the Republicans are blocking the funding of the Department of Homeland Security. This gives new meaning to the word obfuscation, I suppose, or disingenuousness. The truth is the House of Representatives has fully funded the Department of Homeland Security. It has provided the level of funding the President asked for. It has kept all accounts in Homeland Security as approved through the congressional process. It simply says: Mr. President, we considered your bill--this amnesty bill--that would provide work permits, photo IDs, Social Security numbers, Medicare benefits, and Social Security benefits, and you can't do that. We consider that and reject it. So we are not going to fund that. Now, the President has already told us and the staff they have across the river in Crystal City where they are leasing a new building, and this building is going to house 1,000 workers paid for by the taxpayers of the United States as part of Homeland Security. Are those 1,000 workers going to be utilized to enforce the laws of the United States? Are they going to process applications for citizenship or visas? No, those 1,000 people--costing several hundred million dollars, in truth-- are going to be processing and providing these benefits to people unlawfully in America. So Congress said: Wait a minute. We didn't authorize money for that. You can't spend money to fund exactly the opposite of what we have enacted. So we are just going to put some language in the bill--the normal bill that funds Homeland Security--and say you can't spend the money to violate the law. You can only spend the money to enforce the law, as it was created to do. The bill then comes to the Senate; and what spectacle do we have? We have Democratic Members in lockstep unity blocking even proceeding to this bill, contending we are not funding Homeland Security. Can you imagine that? Now, my colleague, the senior Senator from Illinois, Mr. Durbin, the Democratic whip, came down a couple of weeks ago and said: I am trying to figure out what is blocking this bill. So I took the floor and I said: Senator Durbin, you and your filibusterers are filibustering the bill. That is why it is not being passed. Does anybody want to dispute that? The Republican Senate has repeatedly brought up this bill and filed cloture to move to the bill so we can fund Homeland Security, and the Democrats are relentlessly and unanimously filibustering it, blocking even moving to the bill. Although Senator McConnell said if we did move to the bill, he would allow them to have amendments. So this is the situation we are in. Colleagues, this goes to the core of our constitutional principles about who controls the money in America. Congress is a coequal branch. It is not subordinate to the President. If anything, the legislative branch, through the Constitution, provides maybe even more power to Congress than it does to the Executive and more than it provides the courts. And the most powerful power of Congress is the power of the purse. Congress is not obligated to pay for anything it believes is unwise, and it has an absolute duty not to fund anything that is unconstitutional or illegal, which is what we are dealing with here. So Congress--the House of Representatives--acted wisely and properly in funding Homeland Security and not allowing activities to be carried out that are unlawful and that Congress has rejected. This is so fundamental, so basic. How my colleagues have the gall to come to the floor and have a press conference this afternoon and blame Republicans for shutting down Homeland Security is beyond me. I don't believe the American people are buying it. Now, there are some, even on the Republican side, who say: Oh gosh, the President will blame us even if it is not our fault. So we might as well cave in and give him what he wants. But what he wants is something he can't be given. What he wants is for Congress to capitulate and erode its powers and responsibility. He wants Congress to violate its duty to fund something that is illegal and contrary to Congress's wishes. He can't demand that. He has no right to demand that. Congress cannot fund--cannot and must not fund--an illegal action in hopes that another branch of government will intervene. Now, I say that because some have said: Well, a court in Texas has ruled that a part of this action by the President is unlawful. The court was narrow in its decision. It fundamentally said something similar to: It looks like a regulation to me, and if you are going to pass a regulation, you need to go through a process. And the President didn't go through a process. It is not lawful. It is not legal. You can't enforce it. The judge issued an injunction barring the President from carrying out these plans, he announced, which is plain law, it seems to me. They didn't even go into some of the other ideas of the constitutionality and separation of powers. He just blocked it on that basis. So we are hearing it said that we can fully fund Homeland Security without any restrictions, allowing the President to do this, because the courts stopped it. I think that is unwise for a number of reasons. The first one is we don't know what the courts are going to do. This Congress has a duty to fund only things it believes are appropriate and lawful. So Congress shouldn't fund it on that basis, period. We should stand up for Congresses in years to come--for our children and grandchildren and great-grandchildren--and defend the power of the purse and defend the integrity of this Congress. We know how this country was founded. It was founded on an understanding of the British Parliament, and the British Parliament wrested from the king the power of taxes and money. That was a huge historical development, and it has been part of our tradition since, that Congress has the power of the purse. The Executive can't do it. So we replaced the king with the President, and we adhered in our Constitution to that great tradition of restraint on the Executive by the legislative branch--by the Congress, by the Senate. In the Texas court's injunction, let me go further and note the reasons why I think it is unwise for Congress to say that we, the Senate, have no duty to speak on this issue. The House has already spoken and said we are not going to fund this. But the Senate needs to ask what its position will be. I would point out that the Texas court's injunction addresses only a part of Obama's lawless actions and could be lifted at any time. So the injunction could be lifted at any time. It only covers a part of his actions. If Congress relinquishes the power of the purse, then nothing will be able to prevent the lawlessness or amnesty from going forward. As the Texas court noted in issuing its injunction, ``This genie would be impossible to put back in the bottle.'' That is absolutely true. He is evaluating whether to issue an injunction. [[Page S1049]] Sometimes you don't have to issue an injunction because there is not anything much happening right then. But he says, correctly, that: If this goes forward and millions of people are given amnesty, you can't put that genie back in the bottle in any practical sense. It would be a nightmare to try to do that. Let me point this out: One, the Texas court's injunction only addresses a small part of the President's recent Executive actions in November. The Texas lawsuit challenges only the President's November 20 unconstitutional Executive action. And of that, the injunction prevents the administration from implementing only deferred action for parents of Americans and lawful permanent residents. The Texas court injunction does not address the problematic enforcement priorities encompassed in the President's Executive actions. He set all kinds of priorities that Congress disapproves of and that are bad--unless you don't want the laws enforced, in which case it is good. And we have some who believe in open borders in this country. They deny it when challenged, but they vote that way every time. On November 20, 2014, the memo revised the administration's enforcement priorities which do not encompass certain criminal aliens nor do they encompass all aliens deemed to be subject to mandatory custody under the Immigration and Nationality Act. In fact, these new priorities effectively gut the enforcement of our immigration laws for all but a few select criminal aliens. Congress passed the law that requires the deportation of persons involved in criminal activities and convicted of those activities. The President eviscerated large portions of that in this order, and he should not be allowed to do so. The judge did not address it. Indeed, in response to the ruling, Secretary Johnson stated that the Texas court's order does not ``affect this Department's ability to set and implement enforcement priorities.'' Well, that is a big deal. They set priorities that violate statutory law, and they should not be allowed to do that. We can't effectively eviscerate law by prosecutorial guidelines. According to a February 18, 2015 email from Customs and Border Protection Commissioner R. Gil Kerlikowske regarding the injunction, he said: Officers and agents should continue to process individuals consistent with the enforcement priorities announced by the Secretary in his memorandum of November 20, 2014, titled Policies for the Apprehension, Detention and Removal of Undocumented Immigrants. It deals in large part with criminal activities, people convicted of crimes who are supposed to be deported. The funding bill the House passed would do much more to stop President Obama's unlawful Executive actions on immigration, so the administration does not intend to change its course as it is still actively preparing for its rollout of Executive amnesty. On February 17, just a few days ago, the President told reporters that the administration is still ``doing the preparatory work because this is a big piece of business.'' He said: The Department of Homeland Security will continue in the planning because we want to make sure as soon as these legal issues get resolved, which I anticipate they will in our favor, that we are ready to go. So he is telling the Department of Homeland Security to spend money now to be ready to move forward and immediately process his Executive amnesty--providing Social Security numbers, photo IDs, Medicare and Social Security benefits for people here unlawfully. He says go ahead and do it. The Texas court injunction is only temporary and could be set aside at any time. The administration has already filed for a stay of the injunction in the district court and has announced its intention to appeal. Indeed, as I just read, the President said he expects to win. I don't think he will, but it is a technical part of the ruling. The judge still has many more that he could deal with that could overrule the President's action. He just chose one of them, and that one is rather technical. So who knows for sure what a court might rule. In addition, the ruling does not address the substance of the case. It will take many months to resolve this litigation, and during that time there is a reasonable chance that some court will lift the stay and allow the President to begin implementing the amnesty pending a final ruling on the merits of the case. But Congress can stop it and has a duty to stop it in its appropriations bill. In addition, Democrats refused to fund the lawful functions of the Department of Homeland Security. And this is important: The House- passed Department of Homeland Security funding bill funds all of the lawful, statutorily authorized functions of the Department, including the immigration law enforcement component of the agencies that, under the Obama administration, has been prevented from enforcing the laws. Colleagues, Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers--now, I guess, 2 years ago--filed a lawsuit against their own supervisors declaring that they were being forced to violate their oath to enforce the laws of the United States. I have never seen that. It is so bad that the ICE officers have filed a lawsuit to stop the administration from ordering them to violate plain law. Let me note that the President has already shut down the Department by ordering immigration officers and agents to violate the laws and sabotaging enforcement in a number of ways. These are direct orders of this administration, dismantling systemic enforcement of our laws. So I think the Senate Democrats and the President must answer why they believe funding Executive amnesty and unlawful immigration policies would make this country safer. They say: Well, you won't pass a Homeland Security bill like we want it. You are not making America safe. I say their policies eviscerating law enforcement are making America less safe, as the Immigration and Customs agents do, the ones who process the applicants. Ken Palinkas, the President of the National Citizenship and Immigration Services Council, has written that: This amnesty executed by the President will make us less safe. His amnesty makes us less safe. Passing a bill that stops his amnesty will make us more safe. As a matter of fact, he said that more than one time--a number of times. He is very concerned, as his officers are, that if they carry out these policies, the American people are going to be less safe. In fact, they have said explicitly there is no way they can carry out in any effective manner the unlawful orders of the President of the United States. Is anybody listening to the people who do the work every day? Does anybody care what they think? Apparently not. So they are going to come to the floor and accuse Republicans in the House and on this side of the aisle of not making America safe when their own officers say the President's policies are making America less safe. They say there is no way they can effectively process the individuals they are asked to process. They can't process the numbers today, much less what will happen under this bill when they have to process another 5 million. It is just a very unwise thing. So what did the courts say? I think this is an important quote from the Texas court. A Federal court found that the President had overstepped his bounds. That is what the court fundamentally declared, stating: It is Congress, and Congress alone, who has the power under the Constitution to legislate in the field of immigration. That is absolutely true. It is in the Constitution. As he said: It is Congress, and Congress alone, who has the power under the Constitution to legislate in the field of immigration. So after the President issued his order and his Department issued orders of amnesty on November 20, 2014, the President, amazingly, said this: ``I just took an action to change the law.'' Don't we know from elementary school that Congress passes the law? The President doesn't pass the law. He said 22 times that he didn't have the power to do this, but now he has moved forward and admitted he is changing the law. Well, some of our colleagues think: Oh, if we resist this, the President is going to accuse us of not funding Homeland Security, not protecting the Republic. [[Page S1050]] The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Rounds). The Senator's time has expired. Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for 1 additional minute. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. SESSIONS. But I don't think that is so. They say: Well, the press is unfair. Well, not always. I think sometimes we Republicans are right to complain but not always. This is what the headlines are today. The headlines aren't saying Republicans are blocking the bill. Politico: ``Democrats filibuster Department of Homeland Security bill.'' The Hill: ``Shutdown looms as Dems block DHS bill.'' McClatchy: ``Filibuster continues as Senate Dems block DHS funding bill.'' CNN: ``Senate Dems block Homeland Security funding bill again.'' Washington Post: ``Senate Democrats block DHS spending bill targeting Obama's immigration actions.'' Associated Press: ``Dems Block Action on DHS-Immigration Bill.'' New York Times: ``Senate Democrats Block Vote on Homeland Security Bill.'' Politico: ``Dems filibuster DHS bill.'' Well, that is absolutely true. We are bringing the bill to the floor. We are not blocking it. We want to fully fund Homeland Security. We want the laws enforced. We don't want to spend money from Homeland Security to eviscerate the law of the United States and undermine immigration law in America, and we don't want to fund an unlawful action by the President. I thank the Chair and yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington. Keystone Pipeline Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I rise today to applaud the President's veto of legislation that would have rubberstamped the construction of the Keystone Pipeline. This legislation allowed a circumvention of Federal review processes and allowed corporations not to adhere to various environmental safety standards that are important for the American people. So I am glad the President is vetoing this legislation. The rules for siting cross-border pipelines are well established, and time and time again TransCanada has shown that it doesn't want to play by the rules. So with this veto by the President of the United States, he is clearly saying TransCanada must play by the rules. The President's veto recognizes three important implications for Congress in the intervening and trying to pass this Keystone Pipeline process. First, this bill was premature because it authorized the construction of the pipeline while legal and administrative processes were still ongoing in Nebraska and North and South Dakota and where landowners and tribes are seeking review in the courts and before regulatory bodies. The legislation also eliminates the need for a national interest determination, which is associated with the process of the pipeline, which was a key authority for the U.S. Government to insist on safety and environmental regulations. It is a process that should have allowed the State Department and the President to insist on pipeline safety conditions. Finally, this legislation did not address the loophole for tar sands oil companies to avoid paying for oilspill cleanups. By vetoing this bill, the President refused to throw hundreds of conditions out the window. These are things from 59 different pipeline safety conditions that would have been legally binding--but not if the legislation had passed. My colleagues also remember that we talked about work--that we now have concerns on the existing Keystone Pipeline. So I am glad the President of the United States vetoed this legislation. I hope we will get on to working on other important energy opportunities. I hope my colleagues will not try to override this veto but instead focus on renewing the energy tax credits that help employ hundreds of thousands of people in various industries--anything from solar, to wind, to hybrid electric vehicles--and get on to the other issues that are so important for us in talking about a 21st-century energy strategy. Again, I am glad the President of the United States has vetoed this legislation that would have been a rubberstamp by Congress for a special interest. Instead, let's make sure all environmental and safety conditions are met. I thank the Presiding Officer, and I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The legislative clerk proceeded to call the role. Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, one of the measures that took place in this Executive amnesty that has been too little commented upon since the President signed these orders in November is another program which has not been authorized by law which would add several hundred thousand new workers to our country. This is the headline from an article today: ``DHS Extends Eligibility for Employment Authorization to Certain H-4 Dependent Spouses of H-1B Nonimmigrants Seeking Employment-Based Lawful Permanent Residence.'' The H-1B program was set up for certain individuals to come and work for 3 years and then extend maybe another 3 years only, to take a job in those industries and fields where there is a shortage of workers, and it does allow the spouses to come. But since its beginning it has barred spouses from working; otherwise we would be doubling the number of workers. So this bill now just up and approves spouses of H-1B workers to work. The U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Service, USCIS, estimates that ``the number of individuals eligible to apply for employment authorization under this rule could be as high as 179,600 in the first year and 55,000 annually in subsequent years.'' This is a very large addition to the workforce. One might say: Well, it is good that spouses can work. Well, what if your child wants a job? What if you want a job? What if your spouse wants a job and is looking for a job? Now we will have another 250,000 job applicants, contrary to law. There are many other aspects of the President's Executive order that have not been given attention. I think this one is worth commenting about. There has been no sense at all by President Obama, the Department of Homeland Security, Jeh Johnson, the Democratic Members of this Congress--no concern about the employment prospects of lawful immigrants, green card holders, and native-born Americans. We have high unemployment and the lowest percentage of Americans in the working age group actually holding jobs in America that we have had since 1970. Wages are down. Professor Borjas at Harvard documents that excessive immigration pulls down wages. Since 2007 wages of median-income families are down $4,000. I would say to colleagues that the first thing we should do is focus on getting jobs for Americans who are unemployed. Are we going to keep Americans on welfare and benefits while we bring in more and more foreigners to take jobs when we have Americans ready and willing to take those jobs? They like to suggest these guest workers are doing farm work. They are not. The overwhelming majority of guest workers admitted to the U.S. are not farm workers, but are taking jobs throughout the economy. A farm worker program, with temporary labor, if properly managed, is a good program. I do not oppose that. People come and work for a period of time, and if they return home and come back the next season and make enough money to take care of their families maybe for the whole year, that can work if properly managed. But look at this. The H-1Bs are people with high-tech degrees, high-tech skills. They are competing against college graduates who have computer skills and other skills. This is what we get. This is how it is working in this country. A bunch of companies got together and they signed a letter to Speaker Boehner and Nancy Pelosi, the Democratic leader in the House, asking for immigration reform back in September 2013. They said they needed more H-1B workers, and they pushed for that. [[Page S1051]] I would just note this: Byron York from the Washington Examiner has written about this, and this is what the facts are. They are not hiring people. They don't have a shortage of workers. They are laying off workers in very large numbers. Hewlett-Packard had 29,000 job cuts in 2012--29,000. They signed the letter. Cisco Systems eliminated 4,000 jobs in August 2013 in addition to 8,000 cut in the last 2 years. They signed the letter asking for more H-1B workers. United Technologies cut 3,000 jobs in 2013; American Express, 5,400 jobs in 2013; Procter & Gamble, 5,700 jobs in 2012; and T-Mobile, 2,250 layoffs in 2012. These are companies that are asking for more foreign workers. This is another report that was in the Los Angeles Times just a few days ago: ``A loophole in immigration law is costing thousands of American jobs.'' Since last summer, [Southern California] Edison-- The biggest utility company in California-- which serves nearly 14 million customers, has been firing its domestic IT workers and replacing them with outsourced employees from India. . . . The pay for Edison's domestic IT specialists is about $80,000 to $160,000 not including benefits. Good pay. The two Indian outsourcing firms providing workers to Edison, Tata Consultancy Services and Infosys, pay their recruits an average of about $65,000 to $71,000, according to federal filings. They are laying off hundreds and requiring the California Edison employees to train the H-1B workers who shouldn't be coming into America unless there is a job need that is unfilled. How can you say we don't have qualified people? They are doing the job, and they are expected to train them. This is the kind of thing that is out of control. Somebody needs to defend the legitimate interests of middle America. We need to ask ourselves: Does this make sense? Should the President be doubling up on it with his Executive amnesty that would add 179,600 new workers in the first year of his order and 55,000 more annually on top of the H-1B flow? We have legislation that has moved in this Senate that would more than double the number of H-1B workers coming into the country when the evidence indicates they are not needed. It might make businesses happy; they can pay half the salary of what they would otherwise be paying. But it would not be good for Americans who invested in education, trained themselves, worked themselves into a good job, and have it pulled out from under them. I thank the Chair and yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio. Presidential Leadership Mr. PORTMAN. Mr. President, I wish I could rise today to talk about the underlying legislation we are supposed to be talking about, which is a bill to fund the Department of Homeland Security, and also address the President's Executive order on immigration, which went around the Congress but also went around the American people. A judge in Texas agrees with those of us on this side of the aisle who look at this as an illegal act. Instead, the President ought to work with us. The President should work with the House and the Senate and the elected representatives of the American people to actually pass a law to help fix what is broken in our immigration system. We are not able to get on that legislation, and it is not because we have differences about the bill that we could talk about. We could have votes on amendments and debate this issue, but there are those on the other side of the aisle who have decided they don't even want us to have the opportunity to hash out those differences so we can vote. I think the constituents I represent in Ohio expect us to have that debate, and they want us to have that debate. I hope those on the other side of the aisle will let us have that debate, and we could have a good, honest discussion about this and address both of these problems-- the need to fund the Department and also the need to address this Executive order. I think it is another example where Washington has let down the people I represent. In the meantime, this is no time for political games. It is a dangerous world. We have a real problem, not just here at home in protecting the homeland, but also with fires burning all around the world. It is time we showed some leadership both here in this Chamber and down the street at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue. It is time for Presidential leadership. If you turn on the TV tonight, what you will see is those fires burning. You will see a world more dangerous than the one we had after 9/11. You will see threats to the United States and our allies that seem to grow with every passing day. But even as these threats grow, it seems as though our President is increasingly hesitant to lead. Iran, despite the platitudes of the Obama administration, which seems really eager to find an agreement and make a deal, continues its march toward developing nuclear weapons. ISIS, the group the President once described as the JV team when they were in Iraq flying the black flag of Islam extremism over cities such as Fallujah and Mosul, cities where American marines gave their lives to liberate--the President called them the JV team. Russian soldiers now move freely through eastern Ukraine, and the separatists there are using Russian equipment, they are trained by the Russian military, led by Russian special forces, and they continue to wage war on an American ally, Ukraine. While we all hoped the recent cease-fire would hold, all indications are that Russia and its proxies are taking advantage of that cease-fire in Ukraine to continue their aggression. Across Europe--in France, Denmark, and Belgian--innocent people have been murdered. Some were murdered for opposing terrorists aims, and some for the simple fact they are Jewish. These attacks are not random, as has been suggested by the administration. Unfortunately, they are designed to incite fear and weaken our resolve to oppose Islamic terrorism wherever we find it. We must not allow them to succeed any more than we must stand silent in the face of Iranian threats and Russian aggression. What we must do is take a long, hard look at how we got here and what we must do going forward to change the situation. In my view, a lot of the chaos we are seeing across the globe stems from a lack of leadership. Into that void, chaos ensues. The defining themes in the Obama administration's approach to foreign policy have been a preference for disengagement and an unwillingness to shoulder the responsibility of global leadership the way previous Presidents-- Democrat and Republican alike--have done. As the administration itself has said, they prefer to lead from behind. The President has said that ``the trajectory of this planet overall is one toward less violence, more tolerance.'' I don't know about that. I don't think history moves inexorably toward more justice and more peace. These trajectories don't just happen, people make them happen. Leadership is the key. When America is strong, when we stand unequivocally for freedom and justice and the right of all people to choose their own destiny, when we do not back down in the face of threats and intimidation, that is when we see a world that is more stable, less dangerous, and more free. More wars, more conflicts, more threats to our security--these don't typically arise from American strength. They arise from American weakness. When we look around the world--whether it is in Gaza or Eastern Europe or Iraq or Iran or Syria, the increase in violence and instability has coincided with the growing perception that the United States of America is either unwilling or unable to take a stand against threats to international security and stability. Addressing these complex challenges--and many of them are very complex--requires a sustained and proactive American leadership role and American engagement. It requires strategies that seek to shape outcomes, not be shaped by them. There is a lot at stake. Events in Ukraine, the Middle East, and elsewhere are a direct challenge to the United States-led international order, which has led to unprecedented global prosperity and stability for both the United States and for the world. Confidence in America's willingness to use our unmatched economic, political, and military capabilities to uphold our system deters potential challengers and incentivizes other countries to [[Page S1052]] play by the rules, which reduces the chances of war. If the credibility of this commitment is in doubt, then the stability and openness upon which U.S. economic prosperity and national security depend is jeopardized and the chance for violence, instability, and economic collapse increases. The world is watching. They are watching to see whether this American-led order can withstand these challenges or if we really are entering into a period of the post-American world. In Ukraine, the administration's response has been incomplete, reactionary, and ineffective. There are many political and economic dimensions of this conflict, and Ukraine needs Western support to implement crucial reforms in these areas. But there is also a military dimension to this crisis that we cannot continue to ignore. Sanctions alone have not worked. The so-called cease-fire agreements have not worked. As President Obama, Angela Merkel, and Francois Hollande debate and discuss cease-fires and timelines, Russia is deciding the outcome on the ground in eastern Ukraine this afternoon as we talk. Unless we help provide Ukraine with the tools they need to prevent that from happening, any future agreements will only solidify this reality. Let's allow them to defend themselves. Russia continues to believe that military force is a viable option to achieve its goals, and unless the United States and its European allies and NATO help the Ukrainians prove otherwise, this behavior is unlikely to change. It is well known by now that the President has refused to adopt policies that actually provide Ukraine with the capabilities it needs. A bipartisan coalition, on the other hand, has emerged here in Congress on the need to do more, and we will continue to advocate for a change in course and pursuit of a proactive, comprehensive strategy that actually works. In the Middle East, proactive American leadership requires upholding our commitment to stand unequivocally with Israel. No other nation in the world would be expected to put up with tunnels into their cities with rockets raining down on people's homes. The press got it wrong last year, and with all due respect, I believe the President got it wrong too. There is no moral equivalence in Gaza. I have made a few trips to Israel. I met with their people. I have walked the streets of Sderot and have seen the remains of missiles that were targeted against innocents with hatred and an intent to kill and maim. I have been out to the bomb shelters and the indoor fortified playgrounds built so children can have a chance to play without fear. I have spent time with an Iron Dome battery crew outside Ashkelon. I can tell you this: From what I have learned, the people of Israel want peace. Unfortunately, we know the biggest winner from this administration's wavering support of Israel is Iran. Iran continues to stall on negotiations meant to end their nuclear weapons program. They continue to ask for more time, and the administration continues to grant it. Meanwhile, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is coming to the United States next week to speak of the threat that Iran poses not only to Israel but to the world, and the President seems to be too busy to meet with him. Truly, the world has turned upside down. A key test of U.S. leadership is ensuring that Iran does not retain nuclear capability in their continued march toward weaponization. If it were in my power, I would put the Kirk-Menendez Iran sanctions bill--of which I am an original cosponsor--here on the floor on the Senate today, and, by the way, it would pass. I believe it would pass with over 60 votes because Republicans and Democrats alike recognize that Iran will not negotiate in good faith unless the United States is unequivocal in our commitment to ending the nuclear threat Iran poses. You will recall that this legislation does not impose new sanctions that would be imposed now. These sanctions would be imposed if the Iranians do not agree to halt their nuclear weapons program as required, by the way, by the United Nations. These are leveraged for the White House, and the White House should use that leverage. American leadership is needed for a more stable and peaceful world. I believe the future does not belong to bigotry and hate, but to freedom- loving people of the world, and the United States of America must lead the way. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired. Mr. PORTMAN. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota. Mr. FRANKEN. Mr. President, I rise today to talk about the funding for the Department of Homeland Security and the continuing need for immigration reform. We need to fund the Department of Homeland Security and we should pass a clean DHS funding bill. That is the only bill that can pass the Senate, and that is the only bill that should pass the Senate. Once that bill has passed the Senate and the House and becomes law, then we can and should move on to consider immigration legislation. Republican leadership in the Senate has wasted a lot of time over the past month politicizing immigration and mixing it up with the issue of funding this Federal agency that helps to protect the United States from terrorists and other threats, and those threats are real. Just this past weekend, the terrorist organization al-Shabaab issued a threatening video suggesting that the Mall of America in my State of Minnesota could be a target for a terrorist attack. Look, this issue is not something we should be politicizing. We should enact into law a clean funding bill for DHS, and we should fund the Department for the whole year and not make the Department run for a short time on a continuing resolution and just revisit the issue in the near future. That is not what we want. And then we should and can debate immigration. I have always believed the best way to accomplish meaningful and sustainable immigration reform is through congressional action. In the last Congress, the Senate took such action. As a member of the Judiciary Committee, I was very proud to play an active role in the comprehensive immigration bill the Senate passed with broad bipartisan support. For me, this was a model of how the Senate was supposed to work. Four Senators from each side of the aisle, known as the Gang of 8, came together and crafted a bill which we then marked up in the Judiciary Committee, and I was very pleased that a number of my amendments were included in the bill, which then went to the Senate floor and passed with 68 votes. That bill would have provided a real and comprehensive overhaul of our broken immigration system. It would have significantly strengthened our border security, and it would have helped a lot of people--from small businesses to families in our legal immigration system to the many undocumented immigrants who would have an opportunity, through a tough but fair path, to get right with the law. There are millions of people in our country who want the same things that all of us want--a steady job, excellent education for our children, and a brighter future for their families. But they are living in limbo and often in fear. Our bill would help them come out of the shadows and get right with the law. The Senate passed our bill in June of 2013. I was very hopeful the House would take up and pass the Senate bill. If the House had allowed a vote on the Senate bill, it would have passed the House and been enacted into law. That would have meant real and lasting reform to our broken immigration system. Unfortunately, over the course of the next year and a half the Republican leadership in the House failed to act on the bipartisan immigration reform bill passed in the Senate--again, with 68 votes. The President took a step forward that will help a lot of people and will help to address fixing our broken immigration system. While I still believe Congress needs to act, I think we need to keep the Executive actions in place until we do. I will not support any legislative effort to undo President Obama's Executive actions. We are presented with a choice. Once we pass a bill into law to fund the Department of Homeland Security, we can take a step forward and help a lot more people by passing comprehensive immigration reform or we can take a step backward and harm a lot of people without getting any closer to the comprehensive immigration reform we need. [[Page S1053]] I will vote to move forward, not backward. We need a fully funded Department of Homeland Security, and we need a comprehensively overhauled immigration system. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Ayotte). The clerk will call the roll. The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. BENNET. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Gardner). Without objection, it is so ordered. Childhood Poverty Mr. BENNET. Mr. President, it is a privilege to be here with my colleague from Colorado. I rise to talk about our schools and really to talk about our values and our morality--what we stand for as a country--and to ask whether we are able to look forward and create a better future for our children. To set the record straight, let me be clear. When it comes to our children, I have fallen short, you have fallen short, and this body has fallen short. Let me explain why. We have learned in the last couple of weeks that over half of the public school children in this country are now poor enough that they qualify for free or reduced lunches at school--children who, through no fault of their own, are reaping the whirlwind of 15 years of stagnant middle-class family income and the effects of the worst recession since the Great Depression. By many measures, as the Presiding Officer knows, Colorado's economy leads the Nation. But even in our home State, we see more children living in poverty. In fact, the number of children in poverty is growing faster in Colorado than in most of the other 50 States. As a country and as a State, we are making a lot of progress in a number of dimensions, but we are headed in the wrong direction when it comes to our kids. That is a bad sign for any country but particularly for a democracy that aspires to be the land of opportunity. A girl in poverty in the United States is five times more likely to be a young single mother than a child from a middle-class family, and a boy in poverty is twice as likely to be incarcerated as his middle- class peers. Children from low-income families in this country are about three times less likely to graduate from high school. Someone from a family in poverty stands only a 9-in-100 chance of earning a college degree. Think about that. There are 100 seats in this Chamber. There are 100 desks in this Chamber. If they represented children living in poverty in the United States, that desk, that desk, that desk, those three desks, and three of those desks would represent college graduates. The entire rest of this Chamber would be people that would never earn a college degree or its equivalent and who would be constrained to the margins of our economy and our democracy as a result after that. Interestingly enough, the equivalent number for children in the top quarter of income earners is almost 80 out of 100. So 80 of these desks from a more affluent family--80 of these desks would represent a person who graduated with a college degree or its equivalent, and 20 would represent people that had fallen short, but nine poor children would have a college degree. In other words, in a way that is profoundly at war with our founding ideals, poverty breeds deeper poverty, lack of educational achievement reaps deeper academic failure, and broken families are the surest predictor of more broken families in the next generation and the generations beyond that. This is a sentence of unequal opportunity for all poor Americans, no matter the color of their skin. It is a generational sentence for 7 out of 10 children who will remain at the bottom of the income scale their entire lives. Are there people who defy these odds? Of course there are. As superintendent of the Denver public schools and in this job, I have met scores of children who have overcome the odds--sometimes alone--but often also with the help of a parent who wouldn't quit, a teacher who wouldn't take ``no'' for an answer, a former gang member whose sworn duty is to keep young people out of gangs, a philanthropist who insisted that Denver's kids would go to college. In these exceptional children I have seen the indomitable nature of the human spirit persevere against all odds and have recognized how little I and most of us have achieved by comparison. I have met kids who take three buses both ways to school leaving as early as 5:30 in the morning just to have the benefit of a better school all the way on the other side of town, kids who can't get up in the morning because they have to work until 11 o'clock or 12 o'clock at night in a fast food restaurant to help pay the rent, kids who pour their heart and soul out into their studies and communities only to learn that college is not for them because of an immigration status they did not even know that they had. I met kids who were the primary caregivers of younger brothers and sisters who are taking care of ailing parents and grandparents, who have made it to college for the first time in their family's history who are that 9 in 100, who represent the best of our human spirit. They are our heroes. As one of our Denver public school students, Chaunsea Dyson from South High School, recently told a radio reporter, ``When you are growing up in poverty, when you are 15 or 16 that means you are grown.'' That means you are grown. As the father of three girls who are 15, 14, and 10, I would say that is an awful lot to expect of a 16-year-old, especially one coming from circumstances few in this Chamber could overcome. My point is that while there are many heroic people in our schools--kids, teachers, principals--succeeding in our school system today, heroism is not a standard we tend to count on for the success of human enterprise. We simply can't scale heroism. I wish we could--but we can't--to address the scope of our achievement gap. It is too much to ask, and it is not fair to our kids who have no control over the circumstances of their birth. I don't think there is one Member in this Chamber who could come and say that is not true, that a child could control somehow the circumstances of his or her birth, because one of the enduring truths of being a human being is that we don't get to choose our parents. We don't choose to be born into a home of wealth or poverty, a home that values books or learning or a home which for whatever reason does not. That is a matter of good and bad luck. Yet those circumstances beyond our children's control--absolutely beyond their control--today almost always determine educational outcomes in the United States of America. So the question is, What is our obligation? What is our obligation as a nation to remedy the burden of bad luck for millions of American children? I believe at a minimum it means we have a moral duty to assure that our less lucky children have educational opportunities that let them make the most of their God-given potential. That is certainly what I would want for my own daughters. If we are honest, then by any reckoning we are failing to meet this moral duty and I would say failing very badly. If we ask ourselves why we are failing to do our duty--how can this be--in my mind it comes down to a sad and simple reality: We are treating America's children as if they were someone else's children rather than our own. To demonstrate this let's consider what conditions we have allowed to exist for a child born, through no fault of her own, into poverty in the United States of America in the year 2015. We know that by the age of 4 she will have heard 30 million fewer words than her more affluent peers--30 million. Ask any elementary schoolteacher in the country whether that will make a difference in how prepared she is for kindergarten. Fewer than half of poor children start school with the skills they need to be ready to succeed in kindergarten. Every elementary schoolteacher in America knows that. What are the odds her neighborhood school will meet her needs? How about a school 1 mile away? How about a school 5 miles away? It is not likely in many American cities and rural communities. When she reaches the fourth grade her odds are no better. She is 9 years old and there are 30 children in her classroom. On average, 24 of her classmates cannot read at grade level--24 out of 30. Her chances of being a proficient reader--20 percent--one in five. [[Page S1054]] One in five poor children cannot read at grade level in the fourth grade in the United States of America this week, today, this year. Would any of us accept those odds or outcomes for our own children? Would any one person in this Chamber accept that? Would any of us still be in Washington engaged in the Potemkin debates we are having if our child couldn't read by the fourth grade? Of course not--of course we wouldn't. But we act as if it is not our children who are the casualties, and so we smile and we stroke our chins on the cable TV and pretend this is all somehow out of our hands, too hard to solve, someone else's problem. Here is where it ends. In this knowledge-based global economy, this unforgiving global economy, only 9 out of 100 kids, as I said in poverty, will graduate with a college degree or its equivalent and 91 will not. These are the results we have produced for our children in this unforgiving global economy. But for once let's put aside the finger-pointing and the blame-- although we should take our fair share of responsibility--and let's ask the questions our children might reasonably ask to judge their Nation's leaders. For example, they might ask: Why do we trail behind 35 other developed countries in our math scores? Why does the United States rank 20th in increasing educational attainment from one generation to the next--20th; the least likely country to produce more educated people coming after us than there were before us. Why are American children much more likely to be stuck in the economic class into which they are born than children in at least 12 other countries, including Canada, Japan, Germany, Australia, and Denmark? These seem like reasonable questions. You wouldn't know they were on anybody's mind around here with what concerns us on this floor, but I can tell you it is of concern to people at home. Why are we consigning, they might ask, our children and ourselves to a social economic framework that is increasing, not decreasing, inequality in this country, when other countries in the world are headed in the opposite direction? Why are we putting up with a set of circumstances in which income and equality in America has grown significantly much faster than other industrialized countries in the world? If I were a child living in poverty in this country, those are the questions I would want to know, in addition to the fact that I can't find a school, not just down the street, not just in my neighborhood but in my city or even in the region of my State to go to. To put it another way, I can't find a school in my community that any Member of the Senate would be proud to send their child to. Why can't I find that school? I didn't pick my parents. That was a question of good luck or bad luck. In my case it was bad luck. I know there are profound disagreements about whether the Federal, State or local government should serve our kids and how. I am even sympathetic, believe me, as a former school superintendent, to many arguments about how poorly Washington is often situated to help. But surely as a nation, one way or another, we have a moral obligation. That is our legacy as Americans ``in Order to form a more perfect Union, establish Justice, ensure domestic Tranquility, provide for the common defense, promote the general Welfare, and secure the Blessings of Liberty to ourselves and our Posterity. . . . '' Imagine how less powerful the Preamble to the Constitution would have been if it stopped with ourselves, period--but it didn't. It resolves the question in favor of our posterity--our posterity, not someone else's--our children, not someone else's. What would this debate sound like if we were serious about this moral obligation? Without deciding today who would deliver and pay for these important social goods, something we should debate and understand, consult with our States and our school districts, our parents and our communities; but, without making those decisions today, if we just were treating the country's children as our own children, what would this debate sound like? What would we do? We surely would provide every parent and her child with the choice to access early childhood education from birth to age 5 in order to attack that 30 million word deficit. Surely we would do that. I am not saying we should do it. I don't think we should do that from here, but as a nation we should do that. Surely we would ensure that every child, without exception and regardless of where they live, has the choice to attend a high-performing school from kindergarten to 12th grade. Surely we would do that. We would enable every young person, consistent with most of our postwar history, the chance to attain a college degree or other advanced technical training without bankrupting their family. I saw some data this weekend about this that showed that in 1975--and admittedly it was the high-water mark--the Pell grants covered roughly 76 percent of what it cost to go to college, the average cost of college. Do you know what that number is now? It is 22 percent, mostly because the cost of college has increased so much. Bankruptcy is a real issue. These goals--early childhood education, a great K-12 school, affordable college--might seem obvious and even unimaginative to many of us in this Chamber, but that might be because we take them for granted for our own children. Of course we want high- quality early childhood education, of course we want a high-quality K- 12 school, of course we want our young people to have access to college without bankrupting our family, and that is the experience of a lot of people in this Chamber. The terrible reality for most poor children in America in 2015 is that these simple goals are as out of reach as flying to the Moon, all over this country. Some say we can't afford to change, and I say we can't afford not to change. The costs of failure, as we know, are simply too high. Since the Industrial Revolution, we have had the greatest economy the world has ever known, and if we are to remain so in the 21st century, we must educate our people. We have no other choice. They are our greatest asset. We can do it. I am not proposing today a new Federal program of any kind. However, I will say if it were left up to me, we would have a standing committee in the Senate focused exclusively on our children and their future. Such a committee would, for example, examine every funding stream in the Federal budget related to kids and ask what is working and what is not working. What redundancies exist? How are we going to align every single taxpayer dollar or tax credit to help support the health, education, and well-being of our children? I suspect that in addition to increasing efficiency, we would decide to spend more of our resources in and around schools. That is where our kids are, after all, and that is where the people who have served them in our communities need to be instead of tied up in the redtape of compliance and outdated and unimaginative Federal rules and regulations. In addition to that, we need to explore more efficient ways to finance social welfare programs, promote more creative ways to weave our social safety net in this country, and reform our criminal justice system. A good start would be to graduate children from high school, since around 80 percent of our prison inmates are high-school dropouts. That would help a lot. We need to better engage with the private and nonprofit sectors when the government isn't working well enough. This is all part of a broader but essential conversation, one this body continues to avoid while it wanders from one phony conflict to the next, and one that becomes more difficult and more expensive the longer we wait. Our kids are waiting for us to have this conversation. We are wasting their time. It is one thing for us to waste our own time--although the capacity for doing that around here is beyond belief--but we ought to stop wasting our kids' time. As I said, it is only going to become more difficult and more expensive the longer we wait. In the meantime, we have before us the potential to rewrite the Elementary and Secondary School Act. Fixing so-called No Child Left Behind is only one piece of the puzzle. Given where we are, this is all pretty modest stuff. There are some very encouraging signs, although the law has plenty of flaws. In fact, I said many times that if we had a rally out in front of the Capitol to keep No Child Left Behind the [[Page S1055]] same--if that is what the rally was for--not a single person in America would show up for that rally. Incidentally, while we have this reauthorization in front of us, it is a reauthorization that should have happened 7 years ago. It expired 7 years ago. We are running education policy in this country by waivers from the Department of Education because this Congress cannot do its job. Almost 40 of 50 States have waivers from the law as it exists today. Let's change the law. Let's write it properly. Let's do our work around here instead of spending our time on things the American people don't want us to spend our time on. Although everybody loves to hate No Child Left Behind, and I put myself in that category, it has some good things. It required us to face the facts about how our kids in poverty are doing in our schools. It shed light for the first time on the achievement gap--the brutal achievement gap--we have in this country, and some school districts stepped up. Denver Public Schools is one such district. Over the last decade, Denver Public Schools has implemented a number of changes and has seen real results. My schoolboard and my principals and my teachers and our kids and I would be the first to say we have not yet gotten to a place where you can say the ZIP Code you were born into doesn't determine the education you are going to get, but we are a lot closer in Denver. We are a lot closer there than we are in a lot of other cities in this country. We have seen some real results. Almost 30 percent more students graduated and went to college last year than in 2005. That is not enough. We are not satisfied with that. But if you could say that about every single city in this country, that we were graduating and sending 30 percent more students to college than we were in 2005, that might give us some hope for the future. That might suggest that some outcomes other than the ones we have been seeing with the result of 9 out of 100 poor kids getting a college degree is not where we have to end up, is not where we have to land. I am here to tell you, not as a U.S. Senator, but as someone who was a superintendent of the Denver Public Schools, this is possible. It is possible to change these outcomes in urban districts and in rural districts for children who are unlucky enough to be born into poverty in the greatest Nation on the planet--unlucky enough to be born poor and not born rich. Denver has recognized the importance of providing access to high- quality, early childhood education, and now an estimated 70 percent of Denver's 4-year-olds are enrolled in preschool. That was not true in 2005. As the Presiding Officer knows, we live in a State that doesn't require or pay for 5-year-olds to go to kindergarten. That is a shame. But because of the changes we made in Denver, our 5-year-olds go to kindergarten--a full day if they want it, which most of them do--and 70 percent of the fourth graders in Denver have early childhood education, and it is not only delivered by the Denver Public Schools, but by other providers as well and the Denver public schools. This seems to be having an effect as kids who attend the Denver preschool program track higher in school readiness. They know more about the alphabet, words, and books. They have a higher vocabulary and are able to comprehend basic math. And in kindergarten, first, and second grade, they showed better literacy and math skills than their peers. The dropout rate in Denver has decreased since 2005 by 60 percent. Incidentally, the teen pregnancy rate has also fallen by 60 percent. Denver Public Schools has gone from being the district with the lowest rate of academic growth among major districts in the State to the highest for 3 straight years. I am not taking responsibility for that. I am here, not there. Last year DPS students from low-income families had stronger growth in math and writing than nonfree- and reduced-lunch students Statewide. And Denver's nonfree- and reduced-lunch students showed more growth than their State counterparts in math by nine points. This was once labeled the failing school district in our State, but because of the data that we have as a result of No Child Left Behind, we can actually see what is happening--which kids are growing and which kids are not, which schools are driving growth among kids and which schools are not. You can look at a map of our city and find a school that looks just like your low-performing school with the same percentage of free- and reduced-lunch kids where kids are succeeding beyond their wildest dreams. Then what parents can do is say: I want that school, not this school, for my kid. Because we have a robust system of choice in Denver, parents are able to take advantage of that data, and we simply would not have had the proliferation of high-performing charter schools if it had not been for No Child Left Behind. In addition, Denver has gone beyond that. We have 33 innovation schools where teachers and administrators have the flexibility to modernize their teaching practices and have more autonomy to make decisions at the school level to better meet the needs of individual students. And it is not just Denver. We have seen progress all across the country--not remotely enough, but we have seen progress, and we cannot go backward. In the 3 decades prior to No Child Left Behind being passed--30 years--the average 9-year-old's reading score on the National Assessment of Educational Progress increased only 4 points--4 points in 30 years. Is that acceptable? Contrast that to the gains from 1990 to 2012, which is roughly the life of No Child Left Behind. During that span, 9-year-olds gained 9 points in reading, about 7 times as much annual progress. We have seen similar progress in math--9-year-olds only increased 2 points from 1990 to 1999, but from 1999 to 2012, they gained 12 points. In that same span, African-American students improved by 15 points and Latino students improved by 21 points. The achievement gap shrunk as well. In reading, the gap between White and African-American 9-year-old students dropped from 35 to 23 points. It is still too big, but it is moving in the right direction. This represents progress, but as I have said, in the face of stiff competition worldwide, it is nowhere near enough. Since the year 2000, we have dropped from second to twelfth in the world in the production of college graduates. We need to write a bill that builds on our successes and turns us away from the failed practices of the past, and we cannot do it if we are constrained by the typical politics--the small politics of Washington. We cannot afford to have the same tired fights. We won't always agree on everything, but I know we can find a way to pass a bill that helps our schools and school districts to make the decisions they think are best for the kids they are educating. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired. We are under a 10-minute time limitation. Mr. BENNET. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for 7 more minutes. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. BENNET. I appreciate the indulgence of my colleague from Louisiana. In a significant demonstration of leadership around here, Chairman Alexander and Senator Murray have told us they intend to write a bipartisan bill. Their process has the potential to be a rare exception to the gridlock that has gripped this Senate, along with our bipartisan work on the farm bill and immigration. Senators Alexander and Murray have both expressed a willingness to work together because they appreciate the importance of this task. They understand the consequences of failure. They know enough about this issue, and they care enough about it. In January of 1941, during one of the Nation's most difficult times-- the height of the Great Depression and on the eve of our entry into the Second World War, Franklin Roosevelt declared that there were four universal freedoms that all persons possessed--freedom of speech, freedom of worship, freedom from want, and freedom from fear. Today, in the 21st century, some of these freedoms may be obtainable, but an honest assessment tells us it would be impossible to achieve all of them without something additional, and that is freedom from ignorance. In the end, freedom from ignorance is the surest relief from the shackles of poverty. [[Page S1056]] Where does this leave us as we begin this important but long overdue national conversation on the reauthorization of the Elementary and Secondary School Act? First, for all the reasons I have mentioned, America's children would benefit if we treated our work less as legislators than as parents and grandparents with a real stake in the outcome of what we decide. Second, we must be clear-eyed about the Federal Government's proper role in American education and what is not. As a superintendent, I learned there are many things the Federal Government cannot and should not do when it comes to educating our children. And above all else, Washington cannot and should not micromanage our schools or our school districts or cultivate systems driven by compliance rather than creativity. I believe the evidence of our failures and our successes over the last 15 years suggest three primary Federal responsibilities: equity, accountability, and innovation. After all, the deep and intractable inequities that persisted along lines of race and class and geography in America of the 1960s drove Lyndon Johnson to pass the first Elementary and Secondary Schools Act. They drove the creation of title I, specific funds targeted to the kids who needed the greatest support. Sadly, for all the reasons I said, half a century later the data reveals these profound inequities persist and our students need our help now more than ever. But there is also reason for hope in this data, and maybe that is the most important message I can bring. We now have evidence that sustains support to make the difference in closing the pernicious gaps that remain for low-income kids around the country. Our deep commitment to equity, therefore, is as important today as it was in 1963. This means not just committing title I resources, but continuing to expand efforts to open the best schools and attract the best teachers and principals to our communities in the greatest need. In particular, we must help teachers who are saying they want better preparation, they want an excellent principal in their school, they want a better compensation system and opportunities for leadership that allow them to continue working with students. At DPS we have made some strides. We created the Denver Teacher Residency Program and introduced differentiated pay. We used Federal innovation dollars to help us improve and expand early on. We are creating leadership roles for teachers who demonstrate results with their students. We survey our teachers every year, and their satisfaction rates are higher than the national average. But there is still much more for us to do. Second, those of us working in the field know we must have a clear, shared system of accountability, a system that allows us to monitor, understand, and improve outcomes for students. This requires annual assessments that monitor progress and growth across all our cities and States. It requires breaking down data to show how and if we are closing the gaps for all students in our school districts. It means requiring States to take courageous action to turn around those schools that consistently fail our children. That is not just about paying attention to how we are serving our low-income students in Detroit or Denver. It means examining how well we serve our historically disadvantaged students even when they live in some of the most advantaged neighborhoods. As we do this, we need to work to reduce the amount of testing in our schools. As the father of three daughters in the Denver public schools, I am concerned about how much they are tested. But as their father, I also want to know every year how they are doing against a set of rigorous standards and compared to kids in Denver, across Colorado, and around the world. Will they be ready for college? Do they have the skills they need to succeed in this global economy? Third, we have learned over the last decade there is a vital Federal role when it comes to innovation in our schools. We can help provide the preconditions for success by providing incentives for educators on the ground to apply their own creative thinking to address our most persistent education problems. I say to my colleague from Louisiana, through the Chair, I am coming to the end. I owe him 10 minutes whenever he would like it. I thank him for his indulgence. We will never solve the challenges our teachers and students face in Washington, period. We will not do it from here. We can help local leaders break free from a status quo that will never succeed for enough of America's children. We should help identify the challenges, provide resources to local educators to overcome them in the context that works best for their communities and their students, and we should continue to be the clearinghouse that gathers these stories of successful innovation and provide the resources to invest in scaling what works and sharing these practices across communities and States. Equity, accountability, innovation--that is our charge and the commitment we must keep if we are to build an America where we treat every child as if she were our own. As a parent myself, I am well aware the first responsibility any parent has is the education of her child. I am also aware that many people believe a bad education is just one more outcome produced by corrosive poverty in this country. Fix poverty, and you will fix education. Maybe so, but that is cold comfort for millions of children in our schools today. In the end, we have a duty as a nation to ensure that education liberates our children, rather than reinforces the circumstances into which they were born. In that sense, America's children are our children, our responsibility, not someone else's. Can you really accept an America in which your little girl has just a 1-in-5 chance of being able to read well or a 9-in-100 chance to graduate from college? Can you really demand heroism as a precondition for success? If this were your child, would you still be in the Senate, or would you go home and solve the problem? It has been said the future has no lobby in Washington, DC. Are we really content to have that depressing observation be the ultimate verdict on our leadership? I doubt we are. I would raise this as a bipartisan challenge as I close. I know the Senator from Louisiana knows a lot about what I came to talk about today, and I look forward to working with him on the health committee. Here is my bipartisan challenge. Let's forge a lobby for the future. Let's agree that the obligation we owe the Founders is to create more opportunity, not less, for the children coming after us. Let's pledge that every child in America is our child, and our future rests with her, as it most assuredly does. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana. Mr. CASSIDY. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the House- passed Homeland Security appropriations bill. This bill is not just about whether we should fund the Department of Homeland Security to carry out the very important work of protecting our Nation, but also whether we will provide amnesty to those here illegally. First, let's establish that the Constitution says Congress has authority over our immigration and naturalization laws. The President does not have the authority to waive legal requirements. The Supreme Court has upheld this on numerous occasions. The President has admitted more than 20 times he does not have this authority. That said, now his administration is attempting to block the ruling the judge recently made to protect his amnesty plan. As has been reported in the papers, Judge Hanen in Texas has put an injunction against proceeding with the President's amnesty bill. It is reported the Department of Homeland Security, at the President's direction, is moving forward with plans to seal large contracts with companies to process deferred-action applications for millions of illegal immigrants as soon as possible. American families have seen President Obama rewrite the laws many times, and the outcomes of the recent elections show they do not support President Obama's Executive overreach. The President intends to grant amnesty to 5 million people. This will [[Page S1057]] not be done on a case-by-case basis as the law suggests it should be. It is going to be a rubberstamp, a rubberstamp at the expense of those who are legally attempting to come to our country. It will take longer for those who are attempting to come legally to gain admittance under the law. I support the efforts of those coming to the United States to make a better life for themselves and their family. We all believe in immigration. We just think immigration should be legal. The President has rewritten the law to allow illegal immigrants the ability to receive work permits and drivers licenses which also includes receiving a Social Security number. After a certain period of time they will be eligible for Social Security. This goes far beyond his legal authority. By the way, many of my Democratic colleagues have expressed concerns about the President's action and whether he had the constitutional authority to take the action he has taken. Clearly he does not. While the President says this legal status is temporary, the reality is once work permits have been issued and Social Security cards are given, folks will be allowed to stay. They would not be deemed a priority for removal. On top of that, the temporary status may be renewed. In 2011, the President took Executive action for the Department of Homeland Security to start prioritizing illegal immigrants for removal. In April 2014, several months before he took his most recent action, the Los Angeles Times quoted former ICE Director John Sandweg in an article where he said, If you are a run-of-the-mill immigrant here illegally, your odds of getting deported are close to zero. The Associated Press reported in September 2014 the Department of Homeland Security admitted to a group of immigrant advocates during a confidential meeting that about 70 percent of illegal immigrants traveling as families failed to report back to ICE as ordered after they were released at the border. A few weeks ago Louisiana school administrators and I met, and they expressed concern about how the President's immigration policies have stressed our school systems. Classroom sizes have grown. Their associated costs to hire more teachers, buy textbooks, and the required resources to educate these students all have grown. President Obama is giving Executive amnesty to suit his agenda but is stretching limited local and State resources. By stretching them, it is making it tougher on Americans who are born here. The administration says only 5 million people will be impacted by the President's Executive order. The reality is with numerous options for illegal immigrants to remain in this country, people are going to hear about it. They will attempt to come. This will be a magnet for others to come here illegally. Illegal behavior is being rewarded. If the President's supporters feel compelled to continue blocking the funding bill, it must be clear they feel that Executive amnesty is legal regardless of how the courts have ruled. It is clear they believe that protecting the President's illegal action is more important than providing our men and women with the resources to protect our border. We must fund the Department of Homeland Security. As I have said, many of my colleagues who expressed serious concerns with the President's Executive actions in November are now voting to protect these actions. It is unfortunate they voted four times to prevent this bill--the Homeland Security funding bill--from coming up for debate. They won't even allow debate. Folks say they want funding for the Homeland Security Department, but they won't allow debate. This is unconscionable. I believe it is important we move forward to avoid a shutdown of the Department of Homeland Security. I urge my colleagues to please stop blocking this important legislation we must pass to protect our country and give the men and women of Homeland Security the resources they need and, most importantly, to protect the Constitution. I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the role. The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Daines). Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, in 3\1/2\ days, the Department of Homeland Security may well shut down. I speak as the senior Democrat on the Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs for the last 2 years and, along with Dr. Tom Coburn, our former colleague from Oklahoma, chaired that committee that he and I led. But in 3\1/2\ days, if Congress fails to act responsibly--78 hours, I think, from right now--the Department of Homeland Security may shut down. I have spoken on the floor a number of times in recent weeks about the complex, consistent, and very real threats that our country faces. We are familiar with a lot of them--maybe not all. But over the past several months we have seen horrific images of beheadings, of mass murders, brutal executions at the hands of the Islamic State. Some of our Nation's largest companies and Federal agencies have been victims of massive cyber attacks. They continue to this day. This weekend another terrorist group, the Al Qaeda-linked terrorist group in Somalia called al-Shabaab, vowed they would seek revenge against the United States. They cited the Mall of America in Minnesota as a potential target. It is not just these groups or the lone wolf terrorists they inspire that we need to worry about. Last fall, Ebola ravaged several nations in western Africa and even came to our shores as well. Threats from Mother Nature persist too. Communities and cities in some parts of our country are trying to get through a winter that has already broken snowfall records, and more records are likely to fall. Yet today, here in the Congress, there are some who are questioning whether even to fund the very agencies charged with keeping us safe from these and other evolving threats. That goes beyond being irresponsible. Department of Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson nailed it recently when he said what it was. Here is what he said: ``It is bizarre and absurd that we are even having this discussion.'' I could not agree more. Is this really the message we want to be sending to all those folks across the world who wish us harm? God, I hope not. Here we are, days before this key agency could be forced to shut down preparing for the worst. Some of our colleagues have said that it is not a big deal if the Department shuts down. I could not disagree more strongly, and here is why. If we continue this behavior and fail to pass a clean Department of Homeland Security funding bill by midnight on Friday, this is what will happen at the Department of Homeland Security: Much of the Department's workforce, up to 200,000 people, will be expected to show up for work but work without pay. That includes Border Patrol agents who protect our borders. That includes Coast Guard crews who patrol our waters. That includes the TSA employees who keep our skies safe and make it safe to fly on airplanes and get in and out of our airports. Many of these courageous men and women put their lives in harm's way every day. We expect them to continue doing that. We just are not going to pay them. That is right. We want you to keep doing your job of protecting our Nation. Eventually, those in Congress will get around to doing our job. When we do, you will get paid. Let me ask: How would we like to be treated that way? How would we like to be treated that way? Well, we would not. I think it is shameful that we would even contemplate treating some of our bravest fellow employees like that. It is shameful. Even worse, treating our people like this does not make America any safer. In fact, it makes us less safe in the end. Even if we did avoid a shutdown, we would keep the Department running on a stopgap continuing resolution. We would prevent the men and women who work there from doing their jobs as efficiently and as effectively as they could be, should be, and would like to be. Secretary Johnson described that putting the Department on another continuing resolution--these are his words--``is a little like trying to drive [[Page S1058]] cross-country with no more than five gallons of gas [in the tank] at a time and you don't know when the next gas station is. You can't plan except days and weeks at a time.'' For example, if we pass another stopgap continuing resolution, the Department will not be able to replace obsolete surveillance technology along high-risk areas of our border. We need to replace that. In addition, our Nation will have significantly fewer resources to respond to any future surges of unaccompanied minors along our southwest border. Moreover, we will put construction of a badly needed national security cutter for the Coast Guard on hold. Why does that matter? It matters because our Coast Guard fleet is aging and needs to be modernized. These ships are essential to stopping illegal trafficking off our coasts, such as drug trafficking, human trafficking, and illegal immigration--some of it in vessels that travel at speeds of greater than 50 knots. If that is not enough, try this: It is widely known that employee morale at the Department of Homeland Security is the lowest of all major Federal agencies. Passing yet another continuing resolution I promise you will not make it any better--quite the opposite. Morale will only get worse, and in doing so threaten to degrade the performance of the people we rely on, perhaps more than any other, to keep Americans safe. So let me say it again. This is not the way we should be treating the public servants who in many cases risk their lives to keep our Nation and all Americans safe. This is no way to run a key national agency. Furthermore, as we have learned over the years, this kind of crisis budgeting costs taxpayers millions of dollars in lost productivity, in hiring freezes, in contracts that will have to be renegotiated--not at a lower cost to taxpayers--at higher costs. Now, I understand why some of our colleagues are concerned about the policies and procedures set forth in the President's Executive action on immigration. I get it. They have every right to express those concerns. But the budget of the Department of Homeland Security is not the place to have that debate. A Federal district court in South Texas recently examined what the President put forward and blocked its implementation. Why cannot we just let the judicial process play out and meanwhile do our job by funding the Department of Homeland Security for the balance of this fiscal year? Some of our Republican colleagues agree with this approach. One of our colleagues, Lindsey Graham, said earlier this week: ``I hope Republicans will come together and back the court case, file a friend of the court brief with the court and fund DHS.'' He added: I am willing and ready to pass a DHS funding bill and let this play out in court. The worst possible outcome for this nation is to defund the Department of Homeland Security given the multiple threats we face to our homeland. Our friend, Lindsey's friend, John McCain, also said recently--these are his words, not mine: It's not a good idea to shut down the Department of Homeland Security. . . . Now we have the perfect reason to not shut it down because the courts have decided, at least initially, in our favor. ``Our favor'' is that of the Republican Governors who filed the lawsuit in the South Texas district court. I want to urge my Republican colleagues to go ahead and pursue this potential judicial remedy to address the concerns they have. But while they are doing that, for God's sake, let's bring a clean, fiscal year 2015 appropriations bill for the Department of Homeland Security--the same bill that both Democrats and Republicans agreed to last December--let's bring it to the floor so we can give the Department the funding and the certainty that it desperately needs. Regardless of what happens in the courts, at the end of the day comprehensive immigration reform is the only way we can fix our broken immigration system for the long term. It is the only way we can address the issues the President was trying to resolve in his Executive action in a straightforward way, as we did in the last Congress when we passed by a big bipartisan vote right on this floor--by a 2-to-1 margin-- comprehensive immigration reform. We owe the American people an honest and thorough debate on immigration reform. But let's do it the right way. We have shown that we can do that. We did it a year and a half ago. Let's do it again. Let's do it this year after approving a clean, full-year funding bill for the Department of Homeland Security. I might just add this. The comprehensive immigration reform that we passed here by a 2-to-1 margin a year and a half ago was priced out by the Congressional Budget Office, which is not Democratic or Republican. They looked at it and did all the numbers and everything. They concluded that rather than increasing the budget deficit, that comprehensive immigration reform bill reduced the budget deficit for the next 10 years by $200 billion. Further, for the second 10 years, it reduced our budget deficit by $700 billion. A different study further suggested that the impact on our Nation's economy and on our gross domestic product by the implementation of that same comprehensive immigration reform was that it would not diminish the growth to our economy. It would actually increase it by 5 percent-- 5-percent GDP growth over a two-decade period of time. Those of us who are privileged to serve in the Senate were sent here by our constituents with a critical responsibility: to work together and pass laws that help our Nation and help our economy to grow and to thrive. This debate--or any debate, for that matter--should not be about one political party winning or losing, because the only people who are losing are the constituents we are supposed to serve. As long as we continue to spend our time debating these manufactured funding crises, our constituents--American taxpayers from coast to coast--are going to continue to lose. We as a Congress, I think, lose as well. I believe American voters made it clear in last fall's election. They are tired of all of this kind of behavior. I do not blame them either. But it is simple. They want us to do our job. They want us to work together across these aisles. They want us to get things done that need to get done. They want us to find ways to strengthen the---- I ask unanimous consent for 2 additional minutes. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. CARPER. In closing, let me just note that I am encouraged to hear that Senate Majority Leader McConnell now seems to be moving toward allowing a vote on a clean bill. I hope this change of course is the beginning of the end of this crisis for the Department of Homeland Security and for our country. Whatever we do, it is critical that we consider and pass a clean Department of Homeland Security funding bill first. At this point, every hour that goes by without one creates more uncertainty and more waste. After we do that, let's roll up our sleeves and let's get back to work on a thoughtful, 21st century immigration reform policy for our country, a policy that is fair, a policy that will significantly reduce our Nation's budget deficit, and a policy that will strengthen the economic recovery now underway. I want to thank my friend from Iowa for the kindness in allowing me to proceed for an extra few minutes. I yield the floor. ____________________","Congressional Record, Volume 161 Issue 31 (Tuesday, February 24, 2015) [Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 31 (Tuesday, February 24, 2015)] [Senate] [Pages S1048-S1058] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2015--MOTION TO PROCEED--Continued Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, a number of things have been happening today with regard to the funding for the Department of Homeland Security. There has been a lot of spin that somehow the Republicans are blocking the funding of the Department of Homeland Security. This gives new meaning to the word obfuscation, I suppose, or disingenuousness. The truth is the House of Representatives has fully funded the Department of Homeland Security. It has provided the level of funding the President asked for. It has kept all accounts in Homeland Security as approved through the congressional process. It simply says: Mr. President, we considered your bill--this amnesty bill--that would provide work permits, photo IDs, Social Security numbers, Medicare benefits, and Social Security benefits, and you can't do that. We consider that and reject it. So we are not going to fund that. Now, the President has already told us and the staff they have across the river in Crystal City where they are leasing a new building, and this building is going to house 1,000 workers paid for by the taxpayers of the United States as part of Homeland Security. Are those 1,000 workers going to be utilized to enforce the laws of the United States? Are they going to process applications for citizenship or visas? No, those 1,000 people--costing several hundred million dollars, in truth-- are going to be processing and providing these benefits to people unlawfully in America. So Congress said: Wait a minute. We didn't authorize money for that. You can't spend money to fund exactly the opposite of what we have enacted. So we are just going to put some language in the bill--the normal bill that funds Homeland Security--and say you can't spend the money to violate the law. You can only spend the money to enforce the law, as it was created to do. The bill then comes to the Senate; and what spectacle do we have? We have Democratic Members in lockstep unity blocking even proceeding to this bill, contending we are not funding Homeland Security. Can you imagine that? Now, my colleague, the senior Senator from Illinois, Mr. Durbin, the Democratic whip, came down a couple of weeks ago and said: I am trying to figure out what is blocking this bill. So I took the floor and I said: Senator Durbin, you and your filibusterers are filibustering the bill. That is why it is not being passed. Does anybody want to dispute that? The Republican Senate has repeatedly brought up this bill and filed cloture to move to the bill so we can fund Homeland Security, and the Democrats are relentlessly and unanimously filibustering it, blocking even moving to the bill. Although Senator McConnell said if we did move to the bill, he would allow them to have amendments. So this is the situation we are in. Colleagues, this goes to the core of our constitutional principles about who controls the money in America. Congress is a coequal branch. It is not subordinate to the President. If anything, the legislative branch, through the Constitution, provides maybe even more power to Congress than it does to the Executive and more than it provides the courts. And the most powerful power of Congress is the power of the purse. Congress is not obligated to pay for anything it believes is unwise, and it has an absolute duty not to fund anything that is unconstitutional or illegal, which is what we are dealing with here. So Congress--the House of Representatives--acted wisely and properly in funding Homeland Security and not allowing activities to be carried out that are unlawful and that Congress has rejected. This is so fundamental, so basic. How my colleagues have the gall to come to the floor and have a press conference this afternoon and blame Republicans for shutting down Homeland Security is beyond me. I don't believe the American people are buying it. Now, there are some, even on the Republican side, who say: Oh gosh, the President will blame us even if it is not our fault. So we might as well cave in and give him what he wants. But what he wants is something he can't be given. What he wants is for Congress to capitulate and erode its powers and responsibility. He wants Congress to violate its duty to fund something that is illegal and contrary to Congress's wishes. He can't demand that. He has no right to demand that. Congress cannot fund--cannot and must not fund--an illegal action in hopes that another branch of government will intervene. Now, I say that because some have said: Well, a court in Texas has ruled that a part of this action by the President is unlawful. The court was narrow in its decision. It fundamentally said something similar to: It looks like a regulation to me, and if you are going to pass a regulation, you need to go through a process. And the President didn't go through a process. It is not lawful. It is not legal. You can't enforce it. The judge issued an injunction barring the President from carrying out these plans, he announced, which is plain law, it seems to me. They didn't even go into some of the other ideas of the constitutionality and separation of powers. He just blocked it on that basis. So we are hearing it said that we can fully fund Homeland Security without any restrictions, allowing the President to do this, because the courts stopped it. I think that is unwise for a number of reasons. The first one is we don't know what the courts are going to do. This Congress has a duty to fund only things it believes are appropriate and lawful. So Congress shouldn't fund it on that basis, period. We should stand up for Congresses in years to come--for our children and grandchildren and great-grandchildren--and defend the power of the purse and defend the integrity of this Congress. We know how this country was founded. It was founded on an understanding of the British Parliament, and the British Parliament wrested from the king the power of taxes and money. That was a huge historical development, and it has been part of our tradition since, that Congress has the power of the purse. The Executive can't do it. So we replaced the king with the President, and we adhered in our Constitution to that great tradition of restraint on the Executive by the legislative branch--by the Congress, by the Senate. In the Texas court's injunction, let me go further and note the reasons why I think it is unwise for Congress to say that we, the Senate, have no duty to speak on this issue. The House has already spoken and said we are not going to fund this. But the Senate needs to ask what its position will be. I would point out that the Texas court's injunction addresses only a part of Obama's lawless actions and could be lifted at any time. So the injunction could be lifted at any time. It only covers a part of his actions. If Congress relinquishes the power of the purse, then nothing will be able to prevent the lawlessness or amnesty from going forward. As the Texas court noted in issuing its injunction, ``This genie would be impossible to put back in the bottle.'' That is absolutely true. He is evaluating whether to issue an injunction. [[Page S1049]] Sometimes you don't have to issue an injunction because there is not anything much happening right then. But he says, correctly, that: If this goes forward and millions of people are given amnesty, you can't put that genie back in the bottle in any practical sense. It would be a nightmare to try to do that. Let me point this out: One, the Texas court's injunction only addresses a small part of the President's recent Executive actions in November. The Texas lawsuit challenges only the President's November 20 unconstitutional Executive action. And of that, the injunction prevents the administration from implementing only deferred action for parents of Americans and lawful permanent residents. The Texas court injunction does not address the problematic enforcement priorities encompassed in the President's Executive actions. He set all kinds of priorities that Congress disapproves of and that are bad--unless you don't want the laws enforced, in which case it is good. And we have some who believe in open borders in this country. They deny it when challenged, but they vote that way every time. On November 20, 2014, the memo revised the administration's enforcement priorities which do not encompass certain criminal aliens nor do they encompass all aliens deemed to be subject to mandatory custody under the Immigration and Nationality Act. In fact, these new priorities effectively gut the enforcement of our immigration laws for all but a few select criminal aliens. Congress passed the law that requires the deportation of persons involved in criminal activities and convicted of those activities. The President eviscerated large portions of that in this order, and he should not be allowed to do so. The judge did not address it. Indeed, in response to the ruling, Secretary Johnson stated that the Texas court's order does not ``affect this Department's ability to set and implement enforcement priorities.'' Well, that is a big deal. They set priorities that violate statutory law, and they should not be allowed to do that. We can't effectively eviscerate law by prosecutorial guidelines. According to a February 18, 2015 email from Customs and Border Protection Commissioner R. Gil Kerlikowske regarding the injunction, he said: Officers and agents should continue to process individuals consistent with the enforcement priorities announced by the Secretary in his memorandum of November 20, 2014, titled Policies for the Apprehension, Detention and Removal of Undocumented Immigrants. It deals in large part with criminal activities, people convicted of crimes who are supposed to be deported. The funding bill the House passed would do much more to stop President Obama's unlawful Executive actions on immigration, so the administration does not intend to change its course as it is still actively preparing for its rollout of Executive amnesty. On February 17, just a few days ago, the President told reporters that the administration is still ``doing the preparatory work because this is a big piece of business.'' He said: The Department of Homeland Security will continue in the planning because we want to make sure as soon as these legal issues get resolved, which I anticipate they will in our favor, that we are ready to go. So he is telling the Department of Homeland Security to spend money now to be ready to move forward and immediately process his Executive amnesty--providing Social Security numbers, photo IDs, Medicare and Social Security benefits for people here unlawfully. He says go ahead and do it. The Texas court injunction is only temporary and could be set aside at any time. The administration has already filed for a stay of the injunction in the district court and has announced its intention to appeal. Indeed, as I just read, the President said he expects to win. I don't think he will, but it is a technical part of the ruling. The judge still has many more that he could deal with that could overrule the President's action. He just chose one of them, and that one is rather technical. So who knows for sure what a court might rule. In addition, the ruling does not address the substance of the case. It will take many months to resolve this litigation, and during that time there is a reasonable chance that some court will lift the stay and allow the President to begin implementing the amnesty pending a final ruling on the merits of the case. But Congress can stop it and has a duty to stop it in its appropriations bill. In addition, Democrats refused to fund the lawful functions of the Department of Homeland Security. And this is important: The House- passed Department of Homeland Security funding bill funds all of the lawful, statutorily authorized functions of the Department, including the immigration law enforcement component of the agencies that, under the Obama administration, has been prevented from enforcing the laws. Colleagues, Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers--now, I guess, 2 years ago--filed a lawsuit against their own supervisors declaring that they were being forced to violate their oath to enforce the laws of the United States. I have never seen that. It is so bad that the ICE officers have filed a lawsuit to stop the administration from ordering them to violate plain law. Let me note that the President has already shut down the Department by ordering immigration officers and agents to violate the laws and sabotaging enforcement in a number of ways. These are direct orders of this administration, dismantling systemic enforcement of our laws. So I think the Senate Democrats and the President must answer why they believe funding Executive amnesty and unlawful immigration policies would make this country safer. They say: Well, you won't pass a Homeland Security bill like we want it. You are not making America safe. I say their policies eviscerating law enforcement are making America less safe, as the Immigration and Customs agents do, the ones who process the applicants. Ken Palinkas, the President of the National Citizenship and Immigration Services Council, has written that: This amnesty executed by the President will make us less safe. His amnesty makes us less safe. Passing a bill that stops his amnesty will make us more safe. As a matter of fact, he said that more than one time--a number of times. He is very concerned, as his officers are, that if they carry out these policies, the American people are going to be less safe. In fact, they have said explicitly there is no way they can carry out in any effective manner the unlawful orders of the President of the United States. Is anybody listening to the people who do the work every day? Does anybody care what they think? Apparently not. So they are going to come to the floor and accuse Republicans in the House and on this side of the aisle of not making America safe when their own officers say the President's policies are making America less safe. They say there is no way they can effectively process the individuals they are asked to process. They can't process the numbers today, much less what will happen under this bill when they have to process another 5 million. It is just a very unwise thing. So what did the courts say? I think this is an important quote from the Texas court. A Federal court found that the President had overstepped his bounds. That is what the court fundamentally declared, stating: It is Congress, and Congress alone, who has the power under the Constitution to legislate in the field of immigration. That is absolutely true. It is in the Constitution. As he said: It is Congress, and Congress alone, who has the power under the Constitution to legislate in the field of immigration. So after the President issued his order and his Department issued orders of amnesty on November 20, 2014, the President, amazingly, said this: ``I just took an action to change the law.'' Don't we know from elementary school that Congress passes the law? The President doesn't pass the law. He said 22 times that he didn't have the power to do this, but now he has moved forward and admitted he is changing the law. Well, some of our colleagues think: Oh, if we resist this, the President is going to accuse us of not funding Homeland Security, not protecting the Republic. [[Page S1050]] The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Rounds). The Senator's time has expired. Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for 1 additional minute. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. SESSIONS. But I don't think that is so. They say: Well, the press is unfair. Well, not always. I think sometimes we Republicans are right to complain but not always. This is what the headlines are today. The headlines aren't saying Republicans are blocking the bill. Politico: ``Democrats filibuster Department of Homeland Security bill.'' The Hill: ``Shutdown looms as Dems block DHS bill.'' McClatchy: ``Filibuster continues as Senate Dems block DHS funding bill.'' CNN: ``Senate Dems block Homeland Security funding bill again.'' Washington Post: ``Senate Democrats block DHS spending bill targeting Obama's immigration actions.'' Associated Press: ``Dems Block Action on DHS-Immigration Bill.'' New York Times: ``Senate Democrats Block Vote on Homeland Security Bill.'' Politico: ``Dems filibuster DHS bill.'' Well, that is absolutely true. We are bringing the bill to the floor. We are not blocking it. We want to fully fund Homeland Security. We want the laws enforced. We don't want to spend money from Homeland Security to eviscerate the law of the United States and undermine immigration law in America, and we don't want to fund an unlawful action by the President. I thank the Chair and yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington. Keystone Pipeline Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I rise today to applaud the President's veto of legislation that would have rubberstamped the construction of the Keystone Pipeline. This legislation allowed a circumvention of Federal review processes and allowed corporations not to adhere to various environmental safety standards that are important for the American people. So I am glad the President is vetoing this legislation. The rules for siting cross-border pipelines are well established, and time and time again TransCanada has shown that it doesn't want to play by the rules. So with this veto by the President of the United States, he is clearly saying TransCanada must play by the rules. The President's veto recognizes three important implications for Congress in the intervening and trying to pass this Keystone Pipeline process. First, this bill was premature because it authorized the construction of the pipeline while legal and administrative processes were still ongoing in Nebraska and North and South Dakota and where landowners and tribes are seeking review in the courts and before regulatory bodies. The legislation also eliminates the need for a national interest determination, which is associated with the process of the pipeline, which was a key authority for the U.S. Government to insist on safety and environmental regulations. It is a process that should have allowed the State Department and the President to insist on pipeline safety conditions. Finally, this legislation did not address the loophole for tar sands oil companies to avoid paying for oilspill cleanups. By vetoing this bill, the President refused to throw hundreds of conditions out the window. These are things from 59 different pipeline safety conditions that would have been legally binding--but not if the legislation had passed. My colleagues also remember that we talked about work--that we now have concerns on the existing Keystone Pipeline. So I am glad the President of the United States vetoed this legislation. I hope we will get on to working on other important energy opportunities. I hope my colleagues will not try to override this veto but instead focus on renewing the energy tax credits that help employ hundreds of thousands of people in various industries--anything from solar, to wind, to hybrid electric vehicles--and get on to the other issues that are so important for us in talking about a 21st-century energy strategy. Again, I am glad the President of the United States has vetoed this legislation that would have been a rubberstamp by Congress for a special interest. Instead, let's make sure all environmental and safety conditions are met. I thank the Presiding Officer, and I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The legislative clerk proceeded to call the role. Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, one of the measures that took place in this Executive amnesty that has been too little commented upon since the President signed these orders in November is another program which has not been authorized by law which would add several hundred thousand new workers to our country. This is the headline from an article today: ``DHS Extends Eligibility for Employment Authorization to Certain H-4 Dependent Spouses of H-1B Nonimmigrants Seeking Employment-Based Lawful Permanent Residence.'' The H-1B program was set up for certain individuals to come and work for 3 years and then extend maybe another 3 years only, to take a job in those industries and fields where there is a shortage of workers, and it does allow the spouses to come. But since its beginning it has barred spouses from working; otherwise we would be doubling the number of workers. So this bill now just up and approves spouses of H-1B workers to work. The U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Service, USCIS, estimates that ``the number of individuals eligible to apply for employment authorization under this rule could be as high as 179,600 in the first year and 55,000 annually in subsequent years.'' This is a very large addition to the workforce. One might say: Well, it is good that spouses can work. Well, what if your child wants a job? What if you want a job? What if your spouse wants a job and is looking for a job? Now we will have another 250,000 job applicants, contrary to law. There are many other aspects of the President's Executive order that have not been given attention. I think this one is worth commenting about. There has been no sense at all by President Obama, the Department of Homeland Security, Jeh Johnson, the Democratic Members of this Congress--no concern about the employment prospects of lawful immigrants, green card holders, and native-born Americans. We have high unemployment and the lowest percentage of Americans in the working age group actually holding jobs in America that we have had since 1970. Wages are down. Professor Borjas at Harvard documents that excessive immigration pulls down wages. Since 2007 wages of median-income families are down $4,000. I would say to colleagues that the first thing we should do is focus on getting jobs for Americans who are unemployed. Are we going to keep Americans on welfare and benefits while we bring in more and more foreigners to take jobs when we have Americans ready and willing to take those jobs? They like to suggest these guest workers are doing farm work. They are not. The overwhelming majority of guest workers admitted to the U.S. are not farm workers, but are taking jobs throughout the economy. A farm worker program, with temporary labor, if properly managed, is a good program. I do not oppose that. People come and work for a period of time, and if they return home and come back the next season and make enough money to take care of their families maybe for the whole year, that can work if properly managed. But look at this. The H-1Bs are people with high-tech degrees, high-tech skills. They are competing against college graduates who have computer skills and other skills. This is what we get. This is how it is working in this country. A bunch of companies got together and they signed a letter to Speaker Boehner and Nancy Pelosi, the Democratic leader in the House, asking for immigration reform back in September 2013. They said they needed more H-1B workers, and they pushed for that. [[Page S1051]] I would just note this: Byron York from the Washington Examiner has written about this, and this is what the facts are. They are not hiring people. They don't have a shortage of workers. They are laying off workers in very large numbers. Hewlett-Packard had 29,000 job cuts in 2012--29,000. They signed the letter. Cisco Systems eliminated 4,000 jobs in August 2013 in addition to 8,000 cut in the last 2 years. They signed the letter asking for more H-1B workers. United Technologies cut 3,000 jobs in 2013; American Express, 5,400 jobs in 2013; Procter & Gamble, 5,700 jobs in 2012; and T-Mobile, 2,250 layoffs in 2012. These are companies that are asking for more foreign workers. This is another report that was in the Los Angeles Times just a few days ago: ``A loophole in immigration law is costing thousands of American jobs.'' Since last summer, [Southern California] Edison-- The biggest utility company in California-- which serves nearly 14 million customers, has been firing its domestic IT workers and replacing them with outsourced employees from India. . . . The pay for Edison's domestic IT specialists is about $80,000 to $160,000 not including benefits. Good pay. The two Indian outsourcing firms providing workers to Edison, Tata Consultancy Services and Infosys, pay their recruits an average of about $65,000 to $71,000, according to federal filings. They are laying off hundreds and requiring the California Edison employees to train the H-1B workers who shouldn't be coming into America unless there is a job need that is unfilled. How can you say we don't have qualified people? They are doing the job, and they are expected to train them. This is the kind of thing that is out of control. Somebody needs to defend the legitimate interests of middle America. We need to ask ourselves: Does this make sense? Should the President be doubling up on it with his Executive amnesty that would add 179,600 new workers in the first year of his order and 55,000 more annually on top of the H-1B flow? We have legislation that has moved in this Senate that would more than double the number of H-1B workers coming into the country when the evidence indicates they are not needed. It might make businesses happy; they can pay half the salary of what they would otherwise be paying. But it would not be good for Americans who invested in education, trained themselves, worked themselves into a good job, and have it pulled out from under them. I thank the Chair and yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio. Presidential Leadership Mr. PORTMAN. Mr. President, I wish I could rise today to talk about the underlying legislation we are supposed to be talking about, which is a bill to fund the Department of Homeland Security, and also address the President's Executive order on immigration, which went around the Congress but also went around the American people. A judge in Texas agrees with those of us on this side of the aisle who look at this as an illegal act. Instead, the President ought to work with us. The President should work with the House and the Senate and the elected representatives of the American people to actually pass a law to help fix what is broken in our immigration system. We are not able to get on that legislation, and it is not because we have differences about the bill that we could talk about. We could have votes on amendments and debate this issue, but there are those on the other side of the aisle who have decided they don't even want us to have the opportunity to hash out those differences so we can vote. I think the constituents I represent in Ohio expect us to have that debate, and they want us to have that debate. I hope those on the other side of the aisle will let us have that debate, and we could have a good, honest discussion about this and address both of these problems-- the need to fund the Department and also the need to address this Executive order. I think it is another example where Washington has let down the people I represent. In the meantime, this is no time for political games. It is a dangerous world. We have a real problem, not just here at home in protecting the homeland, but also with fires burning all around the world. It is time we showed some leadership both here in this Chamber and down the street at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue. It is time for Presidential leadership. If you turn on the TV tonight, what you will see is those fires burning. You will see a world more dangerous than the one we had after 9/11. You will see threats to the United States and our allies that seem to grow with every passing day. But even as these threats grow, it seems as though our President is increasingly hesitant to lead. Iran, despite the platitudes of the Obama administration, which seems really eager to find an agreement and make a deal, continues its march toward developing nuclear weapons. ISIS, the group the President once described as the JV team when they were in Iraq flying the black flag of Islam extremism over cities such as Fallujah and Mosul, cities where American marines gave their lives to liberate--the President called them the JV team. Russian soldiers now move freely through eastern Ukraine, and the separatists there are using Russian equipment, they are trained by the Russian military, led by Russian special forces, and they continue to wage war on an American ally, Ukraine. While we all hoped the recent cease-fire would hold, all indications are that Russia and its proxies are taking advantage of that cease-fire in Ukraine to continue their aggression. Across Europe--in France, Denmark, and Belgian--innocent people have been murdered. Some were murdered for opposing terrorists aims, and some for the simple fact they are Jewish. These attacks are not random, as has been suggested by the administration. Unfortunately, they are designed to incite fear and weaken our resolve to oppose Islamic terrorism wherever we find it. We must not allow them to succeed any more than we must stand silent in the face of Iranian threats and Russian aggression. What we must do is take a long, hard look at how we got here and what we must do going forward to change the situation. In my view, a lot of the chaos we are seeing across the globe stems from a lack of leadership. Into that void, chaos ensues. The defining themes in the Obama administration's approach to foreign policy have been a preference for disengagement and an unwillingness to shoulder the responsibility of global leadership the way previous Presidents-- Democrat and Republican alike--have done. As the administration itself has said, they prefer to lead from behind. The President has said that ``the trajectory of this planet overall is one toward less violence, more tolerance.'' I don't know about that. I don't think history moves inexorably toward more justice and more peace. These trajectories don't just happen, people make them happen. Leadership is the key. When America is strong, when we stand unequivocally for freedom and justice and the right of all people to choose their own destiny, when we do not back down in the face of threats and intimidation, that is when we see a world that is more stable, less dangerous, and more free. More wars, more conflicts, more threats to our security--these don't typically arise from American strength. They arise from American weakness. When we look around the world--whether it is in Gaza or Eastern Europe or Iraq or Iran or Syria, the increase in violence and instability has coincided with the growing perception that the United States of America is either unwilling or unable to take a stand against threats to international security and stability. Addressing these complex challenges--and many of them are very complex--requires a sustained and proactive American leadership role and American engagement. It requires strategies that seek to shape outcomes, not be shaped by them. There is a lot at stake. Events in Ukraine, the Middle East, and elsewhere are a direct challenge to the United States-led international order, which has led to unprecedented global prosperity and stability for both the United States and for the world. Confidence in America's willingness to use our unmatched economic, political, and military capabilities to uphold our system deters potential challengers and incentivizes other countries to [[Page S1052]] play by the rules, which reduces the chances of war. If the credibility of this commitment is in doubt, then the stability and openness upon which U.S. economic prosperity and national security depend is jeopardized and the chance for violence, instability, and economic collapse increases. The world is watching. They are watching to see whether this American-led order can withstand these challenges or if we really are entering into a period of the post-American world. In Ukraine, the administration's response has been incomplete, reactionary, and ineffective. There are many political and economic dimensions of this conflict, and Ukraine needs Western support to implement crucial reforms in these areas. But there is also a military dimension to this crisis that we cannot continue to ignore. Sanctions alone have not worked. The so-called cease-fire agreements have not worked. As President Obama, Angela Merkel, and Francois Hollande debate and discuss cease-fires and timelines, Russia is deciding the outcome on the ground in eastern Ukraine this afternoon as we talk. Unless we help provide Ukraine with the tools they need to prevent that from happening, any future agreements will only solidify this reality. Let's allow them to defend themselves. Russia continues to believe that military force is a viable option to achieve its goals, and unless the United States and its European allies and NATO help the Ukrainians prove otherwise, this behavior is unlikely to change. It is well known by now that the President has refused to adopt policies that actually provide Ukraine with the capabilities it needs. A bipartisan coalition, on the other hand, has emerged here in Congress on the need to do more, and we will continue to advocate for a change in course and pursuit of a proactive, comprehensive strategy that actually works. In the Middle East, proactive American leadership requires upholding our commitment to stand unequivocally with Israel. No other nation in the world would be expected to put up with tunnels into their cities with rockets raining down on people's homes. The press got it wrong last year, and with all due respect, I believe the President got it wrong too. There is no moral equivalence in Gaza. I have made a few trips to Israel. I met with their people. I have walked the streets of Sderot and have seen the remains of missiles that were targeted against innocents with hatred and an intent to kill and maim. I have been out to the bomb shelters and the indoor fortified playgrounds built so children can have a chance to play without fear. I have spent time with an Iron Dome battery crew outside Ashkelon. I can tell you this: From what I have learned, the people of Israel want peace. Unfortunately, we know the biggest winner from this administration's wavering support of Israel is Iran. Iran continues to stall on negotiations meant to end their nuclear weapons program. They continue to ask for more time, and the administration continues to grant it. Meanwhile, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is coming to the United States next week to speak of the threat that Iran poses not only to Israel but to the world, and the President seems to be too busy to meet with him. Truly, the world has turned upside down. A key test of U.S. leadership is ensuring that Iran does not retain nuclear capability in their continued march toward weaponization. If it were in my power, I would put the Kirk-Menendez Iran sanctions bill--of which I am an original cosponsor--here on the floor on the Senate today, and, by the way, it would pass. I believe it would pass with over 60 votes because Republicans and Democrats alike recognize that Iran will not negotiate in good faith unless the United States is unequivocal in our commitment to ending the nuclear threat Iran poses. You will recall that this legislation does not impose new sanctions that would be imposed now. These sanctions would be imposed if the Iranians do not agree to halt their nuclear weapons program as required, by the way, by the United Nations. These are leveraged for the White House, and the White House should use that leverage. American leadership is needed for a more stable and peaceful world. I believe the future does not belong to bigotry and hate, but to freedom- loving people of the world, and the United States of America must lead the way. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired. Mr. PORTMAN. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota. Mr. FRANKEN. Mr. President, I rise today to talk about the funding for the Department of Homeland Security and the continuing need for immigration reform. We need to fund the Department of Homeland Security and we should pass a clean DHS funding bill. That is the only bill that can pass the Senate, and that is the only bill that should pass the Senate. Once that bill has passed the Senate and the House and becomes law, then we can and should move on to consider immigration legislation. Republican leadership in the Senate has wasted a lot of time over the past month politicizing immigration and mixing it up with the issue of funding this Federal agency that helps to protect the United States from terrorists and other threats, and those threats are real. Just this past weekend, the terrorist organization al-Shabaab issued a threatening video suggesting that the Mall of America in my State of Minnesota could be a target for a terrorist attack. Look, this issue is not something we should be politicizing. We should enact into law a clean funding bill for DHS, and we should fund the Department for the whole year and not make the Department run for a short time on a continuing resolution and just revisit the issue in the near future. That is not what we want. And then we should and can debate immigration. I have always believed the best way to accomplish meaningful and sustainable immigration reform is through congressional action. In the last Congress, the Senate took such action. As a member of the Judiciary Committee, I was very proud to play an active role in the comprehensive immigration bill the Senate passed with broad bipartisan support. For me, this was a model of how the Senate was supposed to work. Four Senators from each side of the aisle, known as the Gang of 8, came together and crafted a bill which we then marked up in the Judiciary Committee, and I was very pleased that a number of my amendments were included in the bill, which then went to the Senate floor and passed with 68 votes. That bill would have provided a real and comprehensive overhaul of our broken immigration system. It would have significantly strengthened our border security, and it would have helped a lot of people--from small businesses to families in our legal immigration system to the many undocumented immigrants who would have an opportunity, through a tough but fair path, to get right with the law. There are millions of people in our country who want the same things that all of us want--a steady job, excellent education for our children, and a brighter future for their families. But they are living in limbo and often in fear. Our bill would help them come out of the shadows and get right with the law. The Senate passed our bill in June of 2013. I was very hopeful the House would take up and pass the Senate bill. If the House had allowed a vote on the Senate bill, it would have passed the House and been enacted into law. That would have meant real and lasting reform to our broken immigration system. Unfortunately, over the course of the next year and a half the Republican leadership in the House failed to act on the bipartisan immigration reform bill passed in the Senate--again, with 68 votes. The President took a step forward that will help a lot of people and will help to address fixing our broken immigration system. While I still believe Congress needs to act, I think we need to keep the Executive actions in place until we do. I will not support any legislative effort to undo President Obama's Executive actions. We are presented with a choice. Once we pass a bill into law to fund the Department of Homeland Security, we can take a step forward and help a lot more people by passing comprehensive immigration reform or we can take a step backward and harm a lot of people without getting any closer to the comprehensive immigration reform we need. [[Page S1053]] I will vote to move forward, not backward. We need a fully funded Department of Homeland Security, and we need a comprehensively overhauled immigration system. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Ayotte). The clerk will call the roll. The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. BENNET. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Gardner). Without objection, it is so ordered. Childhood Poverty Mr. BENNET. Mr. President, it is a privilege to be here with my colleague from Colorado. I rise to talk about our schools and really to talk about our values and our morality--what we stand for as a country--and to ask whether we are able to look forward and create a better future for our children. To set the record straight, let me be clear. When it comes to our children, I have fallen short, you have fallen short, and this body has fallen short. Let me explain why. We have learned in the last couple of weeks that over half of the public school children in this country are now poor enough that they qualify for free or reduced lunches at school--children who, through no fault of their own, are reaping the whirlwind of 15 years of stagnant middle-class family income and the effects of the worst recession since the Great Depression. By many measures, as the Presiding Officer knows, Colorado's economy leads the Nation. But even in our home State, we see more children living in poverty. In fact, the number of children in poverty is growing faster in Colorado than in most of the other 50 States. As a country and as a State, we are making a lot of progress in a number of dimensions, but we are headed in the wrong direction when it comes to our kids. That is a bad sign for any country but particularly for a democracy that aspires to be the land of opportunity. A girl in poverty in the United States is five times more likely to be a young single mother than a child from a middle-class family, and a boy in poverty is twice as likely to be incarcerated as his middle- class peers. Children from low-income families in this country are about three times less likely to graduate from high school. Someone from a family in poverty stands only a 9-in-100 chance of earning a college degree. Think about that. There are 100 seats in this Chamber. There are 100 desks in this Chamber. If they represented children living in poverty in the United States, that desk, that desk, that desk, those three desks, and three of those desks would represent college graduates. The entire rest of this Chamber would be people that would never earn a college degree or its equivalent and who would be constrained to the margins of our economy and our democracy as a result after that. Interestingly enough, the equivalent number for children in the top quarter of income earners is almost 80 out of 100. So 80 of these desks from a more affluent family--80 of these desks would represent a person who graduated with a college degree or its equivalent, and 20 would represent people that had fallen short, but nine poor children would have a college degree. In other words, in a way that is profoundly at war with our founding ideals, poverty breeds deeper poverty, lack of educational achievement reaps deeper academic failure, and broken families are the surest predictor of more broken families in the next generation and the generations beyond that. This is a sentence of unequal opportunity for all poor Americans, no matter the color of their skin. It is a generational sentence for 7 out of 10 children who will remain at the bottom of the income scale their entire lives. Are there people who defy these odds? Of course there are. As superintendent of the Denver public schools and in this job, I have met scores of children who have overcome the odds--sometimes alone--but often also with the help of a parent who wouldn't quit, a teacher who wouldn't take ``no'' for an answer, a former gang member whose sworn duty is to keep young people out of gangs, a philanthropist who insisted that Denver's kids would go to college. In these exceptional children I have seen the indomitable nature of the human spirit persevere against all odds and have recognized how little I and most of us have achieved by comparison. I have met kids who take three buses both ways to school leaving as early as 5:30 in the morning just to have the benefit of a better school all the way on the other side of town, kids who can't get up in the morning because they have to work until 11 o'clock or 12 o'clock at night in a fast food restaurant to help pay the rent, kids who pour their heart and soul out into their studies and communities only to learn that college is not for them because of an immigration status they did not even know that they had. I met kids who were the primary caregivers of younger brothers and sisters who are taking care of ailing parents and grandparents, who have made it to college for the first time in their family's history who are that 9 in 100, who represent the best of our human spirit. They are our heroes. As one of our Denver public school students, Chaunsea Dyson from South High School, recently told a radio reporter, ``When you are growing up in poverty, when you are 15 or 16 that means you are grown.'' That means you are grown. As the father of three girls who are 15, 14, and 10, I would say that is an awful lot to expect of a 16-year-old, especially one coming from circumstances few in this Chamber could overcome. My point is that while there are many heroic people in our schools--kids, teachers, principals--succeeding in our school system today, heroism is not a standard we tend to count on for the success of human enterprise. We simply can't scale heroism. I wish we could--but we can't--to address the scope of our achievement gap. It is too much to ask, and it is not fair to our kids who have no control over the circumstances of their birth. I don't think there is one Member in this Chamber who could come and say that is not true, that a child could control somehow the circumstances of his or her birth, because one of the enduring truths of being a human being is that we don't get to choose our parents. We don't choose to be born into a home of wealth or poverty, a home that values books or learning or a home which for whatever reason does not. That is a matter of good and bad luck. Yet those circumstances beyond our children's control--absolutely beyond their control--today almost always determine educational outcomes in the United States of America. So the question is, What is our obligation? What is our obligation as a nation to remedy the burden of bad luck for millions of American children? I believe at a minimum it means we have a moral duty to assure that our less lucky children have educational opportunities that let them make the most of their God-given potential. That is certainly what I would want for my own daughters. If we are honest, then by any reckoning we are failing to meet this moral duty and I would say failing very badly. If we ask ourselves why we are failing to do our duty--how can this be--in my mind it comes down to a sad and simple reality: We are treating America's children as if they were someone else's children rather than our own. To demonstrate this let's consider what conditions we have allowed to exist for a child born, through no fault of her own, into poverty in the United States of America in the year 2015. We know that by the age of 4 she will have heard 30 million fewer words than her more affluent peers--30 million. Ask any elementary schoolteacher in the country whether that will make a difference in how prepared she is for kindergarten. Fewer than half of poor children start school with the skills they need to be ready to succeed in kindergarten. Every elementary schoolteacher in America knows that. What are the odds her neighborhood school will meet her needs? How about a school 1 mile away? How about a school 5 miles away? It is not likely in many American cities and rural communities. When she reaches the fourth grade her odds are no better. She is 9 years old and there are 30 children in her classroom. On average, 24 of her classmates cannot read at grade level--24 out of 30. Her chances of being a proficient reader--20 percent--one in five. [[Page S1054]] One in five poor children cannot read at grade level in the fourth grade in the United States of America this week, today, this year. Would any of us accept those odds or outcomes for our own children? Would any one person in this Chamber accept that? Would any of us still be in Washington engaged in the Potemkin debates we are having if our child couldn't read by the fourth grade? Of course not--of course we wouldn't. But we act as if it is not our children who are the casualties, and so we smile and we stroke our chins on the cable TV and pretend this is all somehow out of our hands, too hard to solve, someone else's problem. Here is where it ends. In this knowledge-based global economy, this unforgiving global economy, only 9 out of 100 kids, as I said in poverty, will graduate with a college degree or its equivalent and 91 will not. These are the results we have produced for our children in this unforgiving global economy. But for once let's put aside the finger-pointing and the blame-- although we should take our fair share of responsibility--and let's ask the questions our children might reasonably ask to judge their Nation's leaders. For example, they might ask: Why do we trail behind 35 other developed countries in our math scores? Why does the United States rank 20th in increasing educational attainment from one generation to the next--20th; the least likely country to produce more educated people coming after us than there were before us. Why are American children much more likely to be stuck in the economic class into which they are born than children in at least 12 other countries, including Canada, Japan, Germany, Australia, and Denmark? These seem like reasonable questions. You wouldn't know they were on anybody's mind around here with what concerns us on this floor, but I can tell you it is of concern to people at home. Why are we consigning, they might ask, our children and ourselves to a social economic framework that is increasing, not decreasing, inequality in this country, when other countries in the world are headed in the opposite direction? Why are we putting up with a set of circumstances in which income and equality in America has grown significantly much faster than other industrialized countries in the world? If I were a child living in poverty in this country, those are the questions I would want to know, in addition to the fact that I can't find a school, not just down the street, not just in my neighborhood but in my city or even in the region of my State to go to. To put it another way, I can't find a school in my community that any Member of the Senate would be proud to send their child to. Why can't I find that school? I didn't pick my parents. That was a question of good luck or bad luck. In my case it was bad luck. I know there are profound disagreements about whether the Federal, State or local government should serve our kids and how. I am even sympathetic, believe me, as a former school superintendent, to many arguments about how poorly Washington is often situated to help. But surely as a nation, one way or another, we have a moral obligation. That is our legacy as Americans ``in Order to form a more perfect Union, establish Justice, ensure domestic Tranquility, provide for the common defense, promote the general Welfare, and secure the Blessings of Liberty to ourselves and our Posterity. . . . '' Imagine how less powerful the Preamble to the Constitution would have been if it stopped with ourselves, period--but it didn't. It resolves the question in favor of our posterity--our posterity, not someone else's--our children, not someone else's. What would this debate sound like if we were serious about this moral obligation? Without deciding today who would deliver and pay for these important social goods, something we should debate and understand, consult with our States and our school districts, our parents and our communities; but, without making those decisions today, if we just were treating the country's children as our own children, what would this debate sound like? What would we do? We surely would provide every parent and her child with the choice to access early childhood education from birth to age 5 in order to attack that 30 million word deficit. Surely we would do that. I am not saying we should do it. I don't think we should do that from here, but as a nation we should do that. Surely we would ensure that every child, without exception and regardless of where they live, has the choice to attend a high-performing school from kindergarten to 12th grade. Surely we would do that. We would enable every young person, consistent with most of our postwar history, the chance to attain a college degree or other advanced technical training without bankrupting their family. I saw some data this weekend about this that showed that in 1975--and admittedly it was the high-water mark--the Pell grants covered roughly 76 percent of what it cost to go to college, the average cost of college. Do you know what that number is now? It is 22 percent, mostly because the cost of college has increased so much. Bankruptcy is a real issue. These goals--early childhood education, a great K-12 school, affordable college--might seem obvious and even unimaginative to many of us in this Chamber, but that might be because we take them for granted for our own children. Of course we want high- quality early childhood education, of course we want a high-quality K- 12 school, of course we want our young people to have access to college without bankrupting our family, and that is the experience of a lot of people in this Chamber. The terrible reality for most poor children in America in 2015 is that these simple goals are as out of reach as flying to the Moon, all over this country. Some say we can't afford to change, and I say we can't afford not to change. The costs of failure, as we know, are simply too high. Since the Industrial Revolution, we have had the greatest economy the world has ever known, and if we are to remain so in the 21st century, we must educate our people. We have no other choice. They are our greatest asset. We can do it. I am not proposing today a new Federal program of any kind. However, I will say if it were left up to me, we would have a standing committee in the Senate focused exclusively on our children and their future. Such a committee would, for example, examine every funding stream in the Federal budget related to kids and ask what is working and what is not working. What redundancies exist? How are we going to align every single taxpayer dollar or tax credit to help support the health, education, and well-being of our children? I suspect that in addition to increasing efficiency, we would decide to spend more of our resources in and around schools. That is where our kids are, after all, and that is where the people who have served them in our communities need to be instead of tied up in the redtape of compliance and outdated and unimaginative Federal rules and regulations. In addition to that, we need to explore more efficient ways to finance social welfare programs, promote more creative ways to weave our social safety net in this country, and reform our criminal justice system. A good start would be to graduate children from high school, since around 80 percent of our prison inmates are high-school dropouts. That would help a lot. We need to better engage with the private and nonprofit sectors when the government isn't working well enough. This is all part of a broader but essential conversation, one this body continues to avoid while it wanders from one phony conflict to the next, and one that becomes more difficult and more expensive the longer we wait. Our kids are waiting for us to have this conversation. We are wasting their time. It is one thing for us to waste our own time--although the capacity for doing that around here is beyond belief--but we ought to stop wasting our kids' time. As I said, it is only going to become more difficult and more expensive the longer we wait. In the meantime, we have before us the potential to rewrite the Elementary and Secondary School Act. Fixing so-called No Child Left Behind is only one piece of the puzzle. Given where we are, this is all pretty modest stuff. There are some very encouraging signs, although the law has plenty of flaws. In fact, I said many times that if we had a rally out in front of the Capitol to keep No Child Left Behind the [[Page S1055]] same--if that is what the rally was for--not a single person in America would show up for that rally. Incidentally, while we have this reauthorization in front of us, it is a reauthorization that should have happened 7 years ago. It expired 7 years ago. We are running education policy in this country by waivers from the Department of Education because this Congress cannot do its job. Almost 40 of 50 States have waivers from the law as it exists today. Let's change the law. Let's write it properly. Let's do our work around here instead of spending our time on things the American people don't want us to spend our time on. Although everybody loves to hate No Child Left Behind, and I put myself in that category, it has some good things. It required us to face the facts about how our kids in poverty are doing in our schools. It shed light for the first time on the achievement gap--the brutal achievement gap--we have in this country, and some school districts stepped up. Denver Public Schools is one such district. Over the last decade, Denver Public Schools has implemented a number of changes and has seen real results. My schoolboard and my principals and my teachers and our kids and I would be the first to say we have not yet gotten to a place where you can say the ZIP Code you were born into doesn't determine the education you are going to get, but we are a lot closer in Denver. We are a lot closer there than we are in a lot of other cities in this country. We have seen some real results. Almost 30 percent more students graduated and went to college last year than in 2005. That is not enough. We are not satisfied with that. But if you could say that about every single city in this country, that we were graduating and sending 30 percent more students to college than we were in 2005, that might give us some hope for the future. That might suggest that some outcomes other than the ones we have been seeing with the result of 9 out of 100 poor kids getting a college degree is not where we have to end up, is not where we have to land. I am here to tell you, not as a U.S. Senator, but as someone who was a superintendent of the Denver Public Schools, this is possible. It is possible to change these outcomes in urban districts and in rural districts for children who are unlucky enough to be born into poverty in the greatest Nation on the planet--unlucky enough to be born poor and not born rich. Denver has recognized the importance of providing access to high- quality, early childhood education, and now an estimated 70 percent of Denver's 4-year-olds are enrolled in preschool. That was not true in 2005. As the Presiding Officer knows, we live in a State that doesn't require or pay for 5-year-olds to go to kindergarten. That is a shame. But because of the changes we made in Denver, our 5-year-olds go to kindergarten--a full day if they want it, which most of them do--and 70 percent of the fourth graders in Denver have early childhood education, and it is not only delivered by the Denver Public Schools, but by other providers as well and the Denver public schools. This seems to be having an effect as kids who attend the Denver preschool program track higher in school readiness. They know more about the alphabet, words, and books. They have a higher vocabulary and are able to comprehend basic math. And in kindergarten, first, and second grade, they showed better literacy and math skills than their peers. The dropout rate in Denver has decreased since 2005 by 60 percent. Incidentally, the teen pregnancy rate has also fallen by 60 percent. Denver Public Schools has gone from being the district with the lowest rate of academic growth among major districts in the State to the highest for 3 straight years. I am not taking responsibility for that. I am here, not there. Last year DPS students from low-income families had stronger growth in math and writing than nonfree- and reduced-lunch students Statewide. And Denver's nonfree- and reduced-lunch students showed more growth than their State counterparts in math by nine points. This was once labeled the failing school district in our State, but because of the data that we have as a result of No Child Left Behind, we can actually see what is happening--which kids are growing and which kids are not, which schools are driving growth among kids and which schools are not. You can look at a map of our city and find a school that looks just like your low-performing school with the same percentage of free- and reduced-lunch kids where kids are succeeding beyond their wildest dreams. Then what parents can do is say: I want that school, not this school, for my kid. Because we have a robust system of choice in Denver, parents are able to take advantage of that data, and we simply would not have had the proliferation of high-performing charter schools if it had not been for No Child Left Behind. In addition, Denver has gone beyond that. We have 33 innovation schools where teachers and administrators have the flexibility to modernize their teaching practices and have more autonomy to make decisions at the school level to better meet the needs of individual students. And it is not just Denver. We have seen progress all across the country--not remotely enough, but we have seen progress, and we cannot go backward. In the 3 decades prior to No Child Left Behind being passed--30 years--the average 9-year-old's reading score on the National Assessment of Educational Progress increased only 4 points--4 points in 30 years. Is that acceptable? Contrast that to the gains from 1990 to 2012, which is roughly the life of No Child Left Behind. During that span, 9-year-olds gained 9 points in reading, about 7 times as much annual progress. We have seen similar progress in math--9-year-olds only increased 2 points from 1990 to 1999, but from 1999 to 2012, they gained 12 points. In that same span, African-American students improved by 15 points and Latino students improved by 21 points. The achievement gap shrunk as well. In reading, the gap between White and African-American 9-year-old students dropped from 35 to 23 points. It is still too big, but it is moving in the right direction. This represents progress, but as I have said, in the face of stiff competition worldwide, it is nowhere near enough. Since the year 2000, we have dropped from second to twelfth in the world in the production of college graduates. We need to write a bill that builds on our successes and turns us away from the failed practices of the past, and we cannot do it if we are constrained by the typical politics--the small politics of Washington. We cannot afford to have the same tired fights. We won't always agree on everything, but I know we can find a way to pass a bill that helps our schools and school districts to make the decisions they think are best for the kids they are educating. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired. We are under a 10-minute time limitation. Mr. BENNET. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for 7 more minutes. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. BENNET. I appreciate the indulgence of my colleague from Louisiana. In a significant demonstration of leadership around here, Chairman Alexander and Senator Murray have told us they intend to write a bipartisan bill. Their process has the potential to be a rare exception to the gridlock that has gripped this Senate, along with our bipartisan work on the farm bill and immigration. Senators Alexander and Murray have both expressed a willingness to work together because they appreciate the importance of this task. They understand the consequences of failure. They know enough about this issue, and they care enough about it. In January of 1941, during one of the Nation's most difficult times-- the height of the Great Depression and on the eve of our entry into the Second World War, Franklin Roosevelt declared that there were four universal freedoms that all persons possessed--freedom of speech, freedom of worship, freedom from want, and freedom from fear. Today, in the 21st century, some of these freedoms may be obtainable, but an honest assessment tells us it would be impossible to achieve all of them without something additional, and that is freedom from ignorance. In the end, freedom from ignorance is the surest relief from the shackles of poverty. [[Page S1056]] Where does this leave us as we begin this important but long overdue national conversation on the reauthorization of the Elementary and Secondary School Act? First, for all the reasons I have mentioned, America's children would benefit if we treated our work less as legislators than as parents and grandparents with a real stake in the outcome of what we decide. Second, we must be clear-eyed about the Federal Government's proper role in American education and what is not. As a superintendent, I learned there are many things the Federal Government cannot and should not do when it comes to educating our children. And above all else, Washington cannot and should not micromanage our schools or our school districts or cultivate systems driven by compliance rather than creativity. I believe the evidence of our failures and our successes over the last 15 years suggest three primary Federal responsibilities: equity, accountability, and innovation. After all, the deep and intractable inequities that persisted along lines of race and class and geography in America of the 1960s drove Lyndon Johnson to pass the first Elementary and Secondary Schools Act. They drove the creation of title I, specific funds targeted to the kids who needed the greatest support. Sadly, for all the reasons I said, half a century later the data reveals these profound inequities persist and our students need our help now more than ever. But there is also reason for hope in this data, and maybe that is the most important message I can bring. We now have evidence that sustains support to make the difference in closing the pernicious gaps that remain for low-income kids around the country. Our deep commitment to equity, therefore, is as important today as it was in 1963. This means not just committing title I resources, but continuing to expand efforts to open the best schools and attract the best teachers and principals to our communities in the greatest need. In particular, we must help teachers who are saying they want better preparation, they want an excellent principal in their school, they want a better compensation system and opportunities for leadership that allow them to continue working with students. At DPS we have made some strides. We created the Denver Teacher Residency Program and introduced differentiated pay. We used Federal innovation dollars to help us improve and expand early on. We are creating leadership roles for teachers who demonstrate results with their students. We survey our teachers every year, and their satisfaction rates are higher than the national average. But there is still much more for us to do. Second, those of us working in the field know we must have a clear, shared system of accountability, a system that allows us to monitor, understand, and improve outcomes for students. This requires annual assessments that monitor progress and growth across all our cities and States. It requires breaking down data to show how and if we are closing the gaps for all students in our school districts. It means requiring States to take courageous action to turn around those schools that consistently fail our children. That is not just about paying attention to how we are serving our low-income students in Detroit or Denver. It means examining how well we serve our historically disadvantaged students even when they live in some of the most advantaged neighborhoods. As we do this, we need to work to reduce the amount of testing in our schools. As the father of three daughters in the Denver public schools, I am concerned about how much they are tested. But as their father, I also want to know every year how they are doing against a set of rigorous standards and compared to kids in Denver, across Colorado, and around the world. Will they be ready for college? Do they have the skills they need to succeed in this global economy? Third, we have learned over the last decade there is a vital Federal role when it comes to innovation in our schools. We can help provide the preconditions for success by providing incentives for educators on the ground to apply their own creative thinking to address our most persistent education problems. I say to my colleague from Louisiana, through the Chair, I am coming to the end. I owe him 10 minutes whenever he would like it. I thank him for his indulgence. We will never solve the challenges our teachers and students face in Washington, period. We will not do it from here. We can help local leaders break free from a status quo that will never succeed for enough of America's children. We should help identify the challenges, provide resources to local educators to overcome them in the context that works best for their communities and their students, and we should continue to be the clearinghouse that gathers these stories of successful innovation and provide the resources to invest in scaling what works and sharing these practices across communities and States. Equity, accountability, innovation--that is our charge and the commitment we must keep if we are to build an America where we treat every child as if she were our own. As a parent myself, I am well aware the first responsibility any parent has is the education of her child. I am also aware that many people believe a bad education is just one more outcome produced by corrosive poverty in this country. Fix poverty, and you will fix education. Maybe so, but that is cold comfort for millions of children in our schools today. In the end, we have a duty as a nation to ensure that education liberates our children, rather than reinforces the circumstances into which they were born. In that sense, America's children are our children, our responsibility, not someone else's. Can you really accept an America in which your little girl has just a 1-in-5 chance of being able to read well or a 9-in-100 chance to graduate from college? Can you really demand heroism as a precondition for success? If this were your child, would you still be in the Senate, or would you go home and solve the problem? It has been said the future has no lobby in Washington, DC. Are we really content to have that depressing observation be the ultimate verdict on our leadership? I doubt we are. I would raise this as a bipartisan challenge as I close. I know the Senator from Louisiana knows a lot about what I came to talk about today, and I look forward to working with him on the health committee. Here is my bipartisan challenge. Let's forge a lobby for the future. Let's agree that the obligation we owe the Founders is to create more opportunity, not less, for the children coming after us. Let's pledge that every child in America is our child, and our future rests with her, as it most assuredly does. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana. Mr. CASSIDY. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the House- passed Homeland Security appropriations bill. This bill is not just about whether we should fund the Department of Homeland Security to carry out the very important work of protecting our Nation, but also whether we will provide amnesty to those here illegally. First, let's establish that the Constitution says Congress has authority over our immigration and naturalization laws. The President does not have the authority to waive legal requirements. The Supreme Court has upheld this on numerous occasions. The President has admitted more than 20 times he does not have this authority. That said, now his administration is attempting to block the ruling the judge recently made to protect his amnesty plan. As has been reported in the papers, Judge Hanen in Texas has put an injunction against proceeding with the President's amnesty bill. It is reported the Department of Homeland Security, at the President's direction, is moving forward with plans to seal large contracts with companies to process deferred-action applications for millions of illegal immigrants as soon as possible. American families have seen President Obama rewrite the laws many times, and the outcomes of the recent elections show they do not support President Obama's Executive overreach. The President intends to grant amnesty to 5 million people. This will [[Page S1057]] not be done on a case-by-case basis as the law suggests it should be. It is going to be a rubberstamp, a rubberstamp at the expense of those who are legally attempting to come to our country. It will take longer for those who are attempting to come legally to gain admittance under the law. I support the efforts of those coming to the United States to make a better life for themselves and their family. We all believe in immigration. We just think immigration should be legal. The President has rewritten the law to allow illegal immigrants the ability to receive work permits and drivers licenses which also includes receiving a Social Security number. After a certain period of time they will be eligible for Social Security. This goes far beyond his legal authority. By the way, many of my Democratic colleagues have expressed concerns about the President's action and whether he had the constitutional authority to take the action he has taken. Clearly he does not. While the President says this legal status is temporary, the reality is once work permits have been issued and Social Security cards are given, folks will be allowed to stay. They would not be deemed a priority for removal. On top of that, the temporary status may be renewed. In 2011, the President took Executive action for the Department of Homeland Security to start prioritizing illegal immigrants for removal. In April 2014, several months before he took his most recent action, the Los Angeles Times quoted former ICE Director John Sandweg in an article where he said, If you are a run-of-the-mill immigrant here illegally, your odds of getting deported are close to zero. The Associated Press reported in September 2014 the Department of Homeland Security admitted to a group of immigrant advocates during a confidential meeting that about 70 percent of illegal immigrants traveling as families failed to report back to ICE as ordered after they were released at the border. A few weeks ago Louisiana school administrators and I met, and they expressed concern about how the President's immigration policies have stressed our school systems. Classroom sizes have grown. Their associated costs to hire more teachers, buy textbooks, and the required resources to educate these students all have grown. President Obama is giving Executive amnesty to suit his agenda but is stretching limited local and State resources. By stretching them, it is making it tougher on Americans who are born here. The administration says only 5 million people will be impacted by the President's Executive order. The reality is with numerous options for illegal immigrants to remain in this country, people are going to hear about it. They will attempt to come. This will be a magnet for others to come here illegally. Illegal behavior is being rewarded. If the President's supporters feel compelled to continue blocking the funding bill, it must be clear they feel that Executive amnesty is legal regardless of how the courts have ruled. It is clear they believe that protecting the President's illegal action is more important than providing our men and women with the resources to protect our border. We must fund the Department of Homeland Security. As I have said, many of my colleagues who expressed serious concerns with the President's Executive actions in November are now voting to protect these actions. It is unfortunate they voted four times to prevent this bill--the Homeland Security funding bill--from coming up for debate. They won't even allow debate. Folks say they want funding for the Homeland Security Department, but they won't allow debate. This is unconscionable. I believe it is important we move forward to avoid a shutdown of the Department of Homeland Security. I urge my colleagues to please stop blocking this important legislation we must pass to protect our country and give the men and women of Homeland Security the resources they need and, most importantly, to protect the Constitution. I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the role. The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Daines). Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, in 3\1/2\ days, the Department of Homeland Security may well shut down. I speak as the senior Democrat on the Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs for the last 2 years and, along with Dr. Tom Coburn, our former colleague from Oklahoma, chaired that committee that he and I led. But in 3\1/2\ days, if Congress fails to act responsibly--78 hours, I think, from right now--the Department of Homeland Security may shut down. I have spoken on the floor a number of times in recent weeks about the complex, consistent, and very real threats that our country faces. We are familiar with a lot of them--maybe not all. But over the past several months we have seen horrific images of beheadings, of mass murders, brutal executions at the hands of the Islamic State. Some of our Nation's largest companies and Federal agencies have been victims of massive cyber attacks. They continue to this day. This weekend another terrorist group, the Al Qaeda-linked terrorist group in Somalia called al-Shabaab, vowed they would seek revenge against the United States. They cited the Mall of America in Minnesota as a potential target. It is not just these groups or the lone wolf terrorists they inspire that we need to worry about. Last fall, Ebola ravaged several nations in western Africa and even came to our shores as well. Threats from Mother Nature persist too. Communities and cities in some parts of our country are trying to get through a winter that has already broken snowfall records, and more records are likely to fall. Yet today, here in the Congress, there are some who are questioning whether even to fund the very agencies charged with keeping us safe from these and other evolving threats. That goes beyond being irresponsible. Department of Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson nailed it recently when he said what it was. Here is what he said: ``It is bizarre and absurd that we are even having this discussion.'' I could not agree more. Is this really the message we want to be sending to all those folks across the world who wish us harm? God, I hope not. Here we are, days before this key agency could be forced to shut down preparing for the worst. Some of our colleagues have said that it is not a big deal if the Department shuts down. I could not disagree more strongly, and here is why. If we continue this behavior and fail to pass a clean Department of Homeland Security funding bill by midnight on Friday, this is what will happen at the Department of Homeland Security: Much of the Department's workforce, up to 200,000 people, will be expected to show up for work but work without pay. That includes Border Patrol agents who protect our borders. That includes Coast Guard crews who patrol our waters. That includes the TSA employees who keep our skies safe and make it safe to fly on airplanes and get in and out of our airports. Many of these courageous men and women put their lives in harm's way every day. We expect them to continue doing that. We just are not going to pay them. That is right. We want you to keep doing your job of protecting our Nation. Eventually, those in Congress will get around to doing our job. When we do, you will get paid. Let me ask: How would we like to be treated that way? How would we like to be treated that way? Well, we would not. I think it is shameful that we would even contemplate treating some of our bravest fellow employees like that. It is shameful. Even worse, treating our people like this does not make America any safer. In fact, it makes us less safe in the end. Even if we did avoid a shutdown, we would keep the Department running on a stopgap continuing resolution. We would prevent the men and women who work there from doing their jobs as efficiently and as effectively as they could be, should be, and would like to be. Secretary Johnson described that putting the Department on another continuing resolution--these are his words--``is a little like trying to drive [[Page S1058]] cross-country with no more than five gallons of gas [in the tank] at a time and you don't know when the next gas station is. You can't plan except days and weeks at a time.'' For example, if we pass another stopgap continuing resolution, the Department will not be able to replace obsolete surveillance technology along high-risk areas of our border. We need to replace that. In addition, our Nation will have significantly fewer resources to respond to any future surges of unaccompanied minors along our southwest border. Moreover, we will put construction of a badly needed national security cutter for the Coast Guard on hold. Why does that matter? It matters because our Coast Guard fleet is aging and needs to be modernized. These ships are essential to stopping illegal trafficking off our coasts, such as drug trafficking, human trafficking, and illegal immigration--some of it in vessels that travel at speeds of greater than 50 knots. If that is not enough, try this: It is widely known that employee morale at the Department of Homeland Security is the lowest of all major Federal agencies. Passing yet another continuing resolution I promise you will not make it any better--quite the opposite. Morale will only get worse, and in doing so threaten to degrade the performance of the people we rely on, perhaps more than any other, to keep Americans safe. So let me say it again. This is not the way we should be treating the public servants who in many cases risk their lives to keep our Nation and all Americans safe. This is no way to run a key national agency. Furthermore, as we have learned over the years, this kind of crisis budgeting costs taxpayers millions of dollars in lost productivity, in hiring freezes, in contracts that will have to be renegotiated--not at a lower cost to taxpayers--at higher costs. Now, I understand why some of our colleagues are concerned about the policies and procedures set forth in the President's Executive action on immigration. I get it. They have every right to express those concerns. But the budget of the Department of Homeland Security is not the place to have that debate. A Federal district court in South Texas recently examined what the President put forward and blocked its implementation. Why cannot we just let the judicial process play out and meanwhile do our job by funding the Department of Homeland Security for the balance of this fiscal year? Some of our Republican colleagues agree with this approach. One of our colleagues, Lindsey Graham, said earlier this week: ``I hope Republicans will come together and back the court case, file a friend of the court brief with the court and fund DHS.'' He added: I am willing and ready to pass a DHS funding bill and let this play out in court. The worst possible outcome for this nation is to defund the Department of Homeland Security given the multiple threats we face to our homeland. Our friend, Lindsey's friend, John McCain, also said recently--these are his words, not mine: It's not a good idea to shut down the Department of Homeland Security. . . . Now we have the perfect reason to not shut it down because the courts have decided, at least initially, in our favor. ``Our favor'' is that of the Republican Governors who filed the lawsuit in the South Texas district court. I want to urge my Republican colleagues to go ahead and pursue this potential judicial remedy to address the concerns they have. But while they are doing that, for God's sake, let's bring a clean, fiscal year 2015 appropriations bill for the Department of Homeland Security--the same bill that both Democrats and Republicans agreed to last December--let's bring it to the floor so we can give the Department the funding and the certainty that it desperately needs. Regardless of what happens in the courts, at the end of the day comprehensive immigration reform is the only way we can fix our broken immigration system for the long term. It is the only way we can address the issues the President was trying to resolve in his Executive action in a straightforward way, as we did in the last Congress when we passed by a big bipartisan vote right on this floor--by a 2-to-1 margin-- comprehensive immigration reform. We owe the American people an honest and thorough debate on immigration reform. But let's do it the right way. We have shown that we can do that. We did it a year and a half ago. Let's do it again. Let's do it this year after approving a clean, full-year funding bill for the Department of Homeland Security. I might just add this. The comprehensive immigration reform that we passed here by a 2-to-1 margin a year and a half ago was priced out by the Congressional Budget Office, which is not Democratic or Republican. They looked at it and did all the numbers and everything. They concluded that rather than increasing the budget deficit, that comprehensive immigration reform bill reduced the budget deficit for the next 10 years by $200 billion. Further, for the second 10 years, it reduced our budget deficit by $700 billion. A different study further suggested that the impact on our Nation's economy and on our gross domestic product by the implementation of that same comprehensive immigration reform was that it would not diminish the growth to our economy. It would actually increase it by 5 percent-- 5-percent GDP growth over a two-decade period of time. Those of us who are privileged to serve in the Senate were sent here by our constituents with a critical responsibility: to work together and pass laws that help our Nation and help our economy to grow and to thrive. This debate--or any debate, for that matter--should not be about one political party winning or losing, because the only people who are losing are the constituents we are supposed to serve. As long as we continue to spend our time debating these manufactured funding crises, our constituents--American taxpayers from coast to coast--are going to continue to lose. We as a Congress, I think, lose as well. I believe American voters made it clear in last fall's election. They are tired of all of this kind of behavior. I do not blame them either. But it is simple. They want us to do our job. They want us to work together across these aisles. They want us to get things done that need to get done. They want us to find ways to strengthen the---- I ask unanimous consent for 2 additional minutes. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. CARPER. In closing, let me just note that I am encouraged to hear that Senate Majority Leader McConnell now seems to be moving toward allowing a vote on a clean bill. I hope this change of course is the beginning of the end of this crisis for the Department of Homeland Security and for our country. Whatever we do, it is critical that we consider and pass a clean Department of Homeland Security funding bill first. At this point, every hour that goes by without one creates more uncertainty and more waste. After we do that, let's roll up our sleeves and let's get back to work on a thoughtful, 21st century immigration reform policy for our country, a policy that is fair, a policy that will significantly reduce our Nation's budget deficit, and a policy that will strengthen the economic recovery now underway. I want to thank my friend from Iowa for the kindness in allowing me to proceed for an extra few minutes. I yield the floor. ____________________",package_114_116.csv,89843,89843,89914,"[congressional record volume 161, number 31 (tuesday, february 24, 2015)] [senate] [pages s1048-s1058] from the congressional record online through the government publishing office [ www.gpo.gov ] department of homeland security appropriations act, 2015--motion to proceed--continued mr. sessions. madam president, a number of things have been happening today with regard to the funding for the department of homeland security. there has been a lot of spin that somehow the republicans are blocking the funding of the department of homeland security. this gives new meaning to the word obfuscation, i suppose, or disingenuousness. the truth is the house of representatives has fully funded the department of homeland security. it has provided the level of funding the president asked for. it has kept all accounts in homeland security as approved through the congressional process. it simply says: mr. president, we considered your bill--this amnesty bill--that would provide work permits, photo ids, social security numbers, medicare benefits, and social security benefits, and you can't do that. we consider that and reject it. so we are not going to fund that. now, the president has already told us and the staff they have across the river in crystal city where they are leasing a new building, and this building is going to house 1,000 workers paid for by the taxpayers of the united states as part of homeland security. are those 1,000 workers going to be utilized to enforce the laws of the united states? are they going to process applications for citizenship or visas? no, those 1,000 people--costing several hundred million dollars, in truth-- are going to be processing and providing these benefits to people unlawfully in america. so congress said: wait a minute. we didn't authorize money for that. you can't spend money to fund exactly the opposite of what we have enacted. so we are just going to put some language in the bill--the normal bill that funds homeland security--and say you can't spend the money to violate the law. you can only spend the money to enforce the law, as it was created to do. the bill then comes to the senate; and what spectacle do we have? we have democratic members in lockstep unity blocking even proceeding to this bill, contending we are not funding homeland security. can you imagine that? now, my colleague, the senior senator from illinois, mr. durbin, the democratic whip, came down a couple of weeks ago and said: i am trying to figure out what is blocking this bill. so i took the floor and i said: senator durbin, you and your filibusterers are filibustering the bill. that is why it is not being passed. does anybody want to dispute that? the republican senate has repeatedly brought up this bill and filed cloture to move to the bill so we can fund homeland security, and the democrats are relentlessly and unanimously filibustering it, blocking even moving to the bill. although senator mcconnell said if we did move to the bill, he would allow them to have amendments. so this is the situation we are in. colleagues, this goes to the core of our constitutional principles about who controls the money in america. congress is a coequal branch. it is not subordinate to the president. if anything, the legislative branch, through the constitution, provides maybe even more power to congress than it does to the executive and more than it provides the courts. and the most powerful power of congress is the power of the purse. congress is not obligated to pay for anything it believes is unwise, and it has an absolute duty not to fund anything that is unconstitutional or illegal, which is what we are dealing with here. so congress--the house of representatives--acted wisely and properly in funding homeland security and not allowing activities to be carried out that are unlawful and that congress has rejected. this is so fundamental, so basic. how my colleagues have the gall to come to the floor and have a press conference this afternoon and blame republicans for shutting down homeland security is beyond me. i don't believe the american people are buying it. now, there are some, even on the republican side, who say: oh gosh, the president will blame us even if it is not our fault. so we might as well cave in and give him what he wants. but what he wants is something he can't be given. what he wants is for congress to capitulate and erode its powers and responsibility. he wants congress to violate its duty to fund something that is illegal and contrary to congress's wishes. he can't demand that. he has no right to demand that. congress cannot fund--cannot and must not fund--an illegal action in hopes that another branch of government will intervene. now, i say that because some have said: well, a court in texas has ruled that a part of this action by the president is unlawful. the court was narrow in its decision. it fundamentally said something similar to: it looks like a regulation to me, and if you are going to pass a regulation, you need to go through a process. and the president didn't go through a process. it is not lawful. it is not legal. you can't enforce it. the judge issued an injunction barring the president from carrying out these plans, he announced, which is plain law, it seems to me. they didn't even go into some of the other ideas of the constitutionality and separation of powers. he just blocked it on that basis. so we are hearing it said that we can fully fund homeland security without any restrictions, allowing the president to do this, because the courts stopped it. i think that is unwise for a number of reasons. the first one is we don't know what the courts are going to do. this congress has a duty to fund only things it believes are appropriate and lawful. so congress shouldn't fund it on that basis, period. we should stand up for congresses in years to come--for our children and grandchildren and great-grandchildren--and defend the power of the purse and defend the integrity of this congress. we know how this country was founded. it was founded on an understanding of the british parliament, and the british parliament wrested from the king the power of taxes and money. that was a huge historical development, and it has been part of our tradition since, that congress has the power of the purse. the executive can't do it. so we replaced the king with the president, and we adhered in our constitution to that great tradition of restraint on the executive by the legislative branch--by the congress, by the senate. in the texas court's injunction, let me go further and note the reasons why i think it is unwise for congress to say that we, the senate, have no duty to speak on this issue. the house has already spoken and said we are not going to fund this. but the senate needs to ask what its position will be. i would point out that the texas court's injunction addresses only a part of obama's lawless actions and could be lifted at any time. so the injunction could be lifted at any time. it only covers a part of his actions. if congress relinquishes the power of the purse, then nothing will be able to prevent the lawlessness or amnesty from going forward. as the texas court noted in issuing its injunction, ``this genie would be impossible to put back in the bottle.'' that is absolutely true. he is evaluating whether to issue an injunction. [[page s1049]] sometimes you don't have to issue an injunction because there is not anything much happening right then. but he says, correctly, that: if this goes forward and millions of people are given amnesty, you can't put that genie back in the bottle in any practical sense. it would be a nightmare to try to do that. let me point this out: one, the texas court's injunction only addresses a small part of the president's recent executive actions in november. the texas lawsuit challenges only the president's november 20 unconstitutional executive action. and of that, the injunction prevents the administration from implementing only deferred action for parents of americans and lawful permanent residents. the texas court injunction does not address the problematic enforcement priorities encompassed in the president's executive actions. he set all kinds of priorities that congress disapproves of and that are bad--unless you don't want the laws enforced, in which case it is good. and we have some who believe in open borders in this country. they deny it when challenged, but they vote that way every time. on november 20, 2014, the memo revised the administration's enforcement priorities which do not encompass certain criminal aliens nor do they encompass all aliens deemed to be subject to mandatory custody under the immigration and nationality act. in fact, these new priorities effectively gut the enforcement of our immigration laws for all but a few select criminal aliens. congress passed the law that requires the deportation of persons involved in criminal activities and convicted of those activities. the president eviscerated large portions of that in this order, and he should not be allowed to do so. the judge did not address it. indeed, in response to the ruling, secretary johnson stated that the texas court's order does not ``affect this department's ability to set and implement enforcement priorities.'' well, that is a big deal. they set priorities that violate statutory law, and they should not be allowed to do that. we can't effectively eviscerate law by prosecutorial guidelines. according to a february 18, 2015 email from customs and border protection commissioner r. gil kerlikowske regarding the injunction, he said: officers and agents should continue to process individuals consistent with the enforcement priorities announced by the secretary in his memorandum of november 20, 2014, titled policies for the apprehension, detention and removal of undocumented immigrants. it deals in large part with criminal activities, people convicted of crimes who are supposed to be deported. the funding bill the house passed would do much more to stop president obama's unlawful executive actions on immigration, so the administration does not intend to change its course as it is still actively preparing for its rollout of executive amnesty. on february 17, just a few days ago, the president told reporters that the administration is still ``doing the preparatory work because this is a big piece of business.'' he said: the department of homeland security will continue in the planning because we want to make sure as soon as these legal issues get resolved, which i anticipate they will in our favor, that we are ready to go. so he is telling the department of homeland security to spend money now to be ready to move forward and immediately process his executive amnesty--providing social security numbers, photo ids, medicare and social security benefits for people here unlawfully. he says go ahead and do it. the texas court injunction is only temporary and could be set aside at any time. the administration has already filed for a stay of the injunction in the district court and has announced its intention to appeal. indeed, as i just read, the president said he expects to win. i don't think he will, but it is a technical part of the ruling. the judge still has many more that he could deal with that could overrule the president's action. he just chose one of them, and that one is rather technical. so who knows for sure what a court might rule. in addition, the ruling does not address the substance of the case. it will take many months to resolve this litigation, and during that time there is a reasonable chance that some court will lift the stay and allow the president to begin implementing the amnesty pending a final ruling on the merits of the case. but congress can stop it and has a duty to stop it in its appropriations bill. in addition, democrats refused to fund the lawful functions of the department of homeland security. and this is important: the house- passed department of homeland security funding bill funds all of the lawful, statutorily authorized functions of the department, including the immigration law enforcement component of the agencies that, under the obama administration, has been prevented from enforcing the laws. colleagues, immigration and customs enforcement officers--now, i guess, 2 years ago--filed a lawsuit against their own supervisors declaring that they were being forced to violate their oath to enforce the laws of the united states. i have never seen that. it is so bad that the ice officers have filed a lawsuit to stop the administration from ordering them to violate plain law. let me note that the president has already shut down the department by ordering immigration officers and agents to violate the laws and sabotaging enforcement in a number of ways. these are direct orders of this administration, dismantling systemic enforcement of our laws. so i think the senate democrats and the president must answer why they believe funding executive amnesty and unlawful immigration policies would make this country safer. they say: well, you won't pass a homeland security bill like we want it. you are not making america safe. i say their policies eviscerating law enforcement are making america less safe, as the immigration and customs agents do, the ones who process the applicants. ken palinkas, the president of the national citizenship and immigration services council, has written that: this amnesty executed by the president will make us less safe. his amnesty makes us less safe. passing a bill that stops his amnesty will make us more safe. as a matter of fact, he said that more than one time--a number of times. he is very concerned, as his officers are, that if they carry out these policies, the american people are going to be less safe. in fact, they have said explicitly there is no way they can carry out in any effective manner the unlawful orders of the president of the united states. is anybody listening to the people who do the work every day? does anybody care what they think? apparently not. so they are going to come to the floor and accuse republicans in the house and on this side of the aisle of not making america safe when their own officers say the president's policies are making america less safe. they say there is no way they can effectively process the individuals they are asked to process. they can't process the numbers today, much less what will happen under this bill when they have to process another 5 million. it is just a very unwise thing. so what did the courts say? i think this is an important quote from the texas court. a federal court found that the president had overstepped his bounds. that is what the court fundamentally declared, stating: it is congress, and congress alone, who has the power under the constitution to legislate in the field of immigration. that is absolutely true. it is in the constitution. as he said: it is congress, and congress alone, who has the power under the constitution to legislate in the field of immigration. so after the president issued his order and his department issued orders of amnesty on november 20, 2014, the president, amazingly, said this: ``i just took an action to change the law.'' don't we know from elementary school that congress passes the law? the president doesn't pass the law. he said 22 times that he didn't have the power to do this, but now he has moved forward and admitted he is changing the law. well, some of our colleagues think: oh, if we resist this, the president is going to accuse us of not funding homeland security, not protecting the republic. [[page s1050]] the presiding officer (mr. rounds). the senator's time has expired. mr. sessions. mr. president, i ask unanimous consent for 1 additional minute. the presiding officer. without objection, it is so ordered. mr. sessions. but i don't think that is so. they say: well, the press is unfair. well, not always. i think sometimes we republicans are right to complain but not always. this is what the headlines are today. the headlines aren't saying republicans are blocking the bill. politico: ``democrats filibuster department of homeland security bill.'' the hill: ``shutdown looms as dems block dhs bill.'' mcclatchy: ``filibuster continues as senate dems block dhs funding bill.'' cnn: ``senate dems block homeland security funding bill again.'' washington post: ``senate democrats block dhs spending bill targeting obama's immigration actions.'' associated press: ``dems block action on dhs-immigration bill.'' new york times: ``senate democrats block vote on homeland security bill.'' politico: ``dems filibuster dhs bill.'' well, that is absolutely true. we are bringing the bill to the floor. we are not blocking it. we want to fully fund homeland security. we want the laws enforced. we don't want to spend money from homeland security to eviscerate the law of the united states and undermine immigration law in america, and we don't want to fund an unlawful action by the president. i thank the chair and yield the floor. the presiding officer. the senator from washington. keystone pipeline ms. cantwell. mr. president, i rise today to applaud the president's veto of legislation that would have rubberstamped the construction of the keystone pipeline. this legislation allowed a circumvention of federal review processes and allowed corporations not to adhere to various environmental safety standards that are important for the american people. so i am glad the president is vetoing this legislation. the rules for siting cross-border pipelines are well established, and time and time again transcanada has shown that it doesn't want to play by the rules. so with this veto by the president of the united states, he is clearly saying transcanada must play by the rules. the president's veto recognizes three important implications for congress in the intervening and trying to pass this keystone pipeline process. first, this bill was premature because it authorized the construction of the pipeline while legal and administrative processes were still ongoing in nebraska and north and south dakota and where landowners and tribes are seeking review in the courts and before regulatory bodies. the legislation also eliminates the need for a national interest determination, which is associated with the process of the pipeline, which was a key authority for the u.s. government to insist on safety and environmental regulations. it is a process that should have allowed the state department and the president to insist on pipeline safety conditions. finally, this legislation did not address the loophole for tar sands oil companies to avoid paying for oilspill cleanups. by vetoing this bill, the president refused to throw hundreds of conditions out the window. these are things from 59 different pipeline safety conditions that would have been legally binding--but not if the legislation had passed. my colleagues also remember that we talked about work--that we now have concerns on the existing keystone pipeline. so i am glad the president of the united states vetoed this legislation. i hope we will get on to working on other important energy opportunities. i hope my colleagues will not try to override this veto but instead focus on renewing the energy tax credits that help employ hundreds of thousands of people in various industries--anything from solar, to wind, to hybrid electric vehicles--and get on to the other issues that are so important for us in talking about a 21st-century energy strategy. again, i am glad the president of the united states has vetoed this legislation that would have been a rubberstamp by congress for a special interest. instead, let's make sure all environmental and safety conditions are met. i thank the presiding officer, and i yield the floor. i suggest the absence of a quorum. the presiding officer. the clerk will call the roll. the legislative clerk proceeded to call the role. mr. sessions. mr. president, i ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. the presiding officer. without objection, it is so ordered. mr. sessions. mr. president, one of the measures that took place in this executive amnesty that has been too little commented upon since the president signed these orders in november is another program which has not been authorized by law which would add several hundred thousand new workers to our country. this is the headline from an article today: ``dhs extends eligibility for employment authorization to certain h-4 dependent spouses of h-1b nonimmigrants seeking employment-based lawful permanent residence.'' the h-1b program was set up for certain individuals to come and work for 3 years and then extend maybe another 3 years only, to take a job in those industries and fields where there is a shortage of workers, and it does allow the spouses to come. but since its beginning it has barred spouses from working; otherwise we would be doubling the number of workers. so this bill now just up and approves spouses of h-1b workers to work. the u.s. citizenship and immigration service, uscis, estimates that ``the number of individuals eligible to apply for employment authorization under this rule could be as high as 179,600 in the first year and 55,000 annually in subsequent years.'' this is a very large addition to the workforce. one might say: well, it is good that spouses can work. well, what if your child wants a job? what if you want a job? what if your spouse wants a job and is looking for a job? now we will have another 250,000 job applicants, contrary to law. there are many other aspects of the president's executive order that have not been given attention. i think this one is worth commenting about. there has been no sense at all by president obama, the department of homeland security, jeh johnson, the democratic members of this congress--no concern about the employment prospects of lawful immigrants, green card holders, and native-born americans. we have high unemployment and the lowest percentage of americans in the working age group actually holding jobs in america that we have had since 1970. wages are down. professor borjas at harvard documents that excessive immigration pulls down wages. since 2007 wages of median-income families are down $4,000. i would say to colleagues that the first thing we should do is focus on getting jobs for americans who are unemployed. are we going to keep americans on welfare and benefits while we bring in more and more foreigners to take jobs when we have americans ready and willing to take those jobs? they like to suggest these guest workers are doing farm work. they are not. the overwhelming majority of guest workers admitted to the u.s. are not farm workers, but are taking jobs throughout the economy. a farm worker program, with temporary labor, if properly managed, is a good program. i do not oppose that. people come and work for a period of time, and if they return home and come back the next season and make enough money to take care of their families maybe for the whole year, that can work if properly managed. but look at this. the h-1bs are people with high-tech degrees, high-tech skills. they are competing against college graduates who have computer skills and other skills. this is what we get. this is how it is working in this country. a bunch of companies got together and they signed a letter to speaker boehner and nancy pelosi, the democratic leader in the house, asking for immigration reform back in september 2013. they said they needed more h-1b workers, and they pushed for that. [[page s1051]] i would just note this: byron york from the washington examiner has written about this, and this is what the facts are. they are not hiring people. they don't have a shortage of workers. they are laying off workers in very large numbers. hewlett-packard had 29,000 job cuts in 2012--29,000. they signed the letter. cisco systems eliminated 4,000 jobs in august 2013 in addition to 8,000 cut in the last 2 years. they signed the letter asking for more h-1b workers. united technologies cut 3,000 jobs in 2013; american express, 5,400 jobs in 2013; procter & gamble, 5,700 jobs in 2012; and t-mobile, 2,250 layoffs in 2012. these are companies that are asking for more foreign workers. this is another report that was in the los angeles times just a few days ago: ``a loophole in immigration law is costing thousands of american jobs.'' since last summer, [southern california] edison-- the biggest utility company in california-- which serves nearly 14 million customers, has been firing its domestic it workers and replacing them with outsourced employees from india. . . . the pay for edison's domestic it specialists is about $80,000 to $160,000 not including benefits. good pay. the two indian outsourcing firms providing workers to edison, tata consultancy services and infosys, pay their recruits an average of about $65,000 to $71,000, according to federal filings. they are laying off hundreds and requiring the california edison employees to train the h-1b workers who shouldn't be coming into america unless there is a job need that is unfilled. how can you say we don't have qualified people? they are doing the job, and they are expected to train them. this is the kind of thing that is out of control. somebody needs to defend the legitimate interests of middle america. we need to ask ourselves: does this make sense? should the president be doubling up on it with his executive amnesty that would add 179,600 new workers in the first year of his order and 55,000 more annually on top of the h-1b flow? we have legislation that has moved in this senate that would more than double the number of h-1b workers coming into the country when the evidence indicates they are not needed. it might make businesses happy; they can pay half the salary of what they would otherwise be paying. but it would not be good for americans who invested in education, trained themselves, worked themselves into a good job, and have it pulled out from under them. i thank the chair and yield the floor. the presiding officer. the senator from ohio. presidential leadership mr. portman. mr. president, i wish i could rise today to talk about the underlying legislation we are supposed to be talking about, which is a bill to fund the department of homeland security, and also address the president's executive order on immigration, which went around the congress but also went around the american people. a judge in texas agrees with those of us on this side of the aisle who look at this as an illegal act. instead, the president ought to work with us. the president should work with the house and the senate and the elected representatives of the american people to actually pass a law to help fix what is broken in our immigration system. we are not able to get on that legislation, and it is not because we have differences about the bill that we could talk about. we could have votes on amendments and debate this issue, but there are those on the other side of the aisle who have decided they don't even want us to have the opportunity to hash out those differences so we can vote. i think the constituents i represent in ohio expect us to have that debate, and they want us to have that debate. i hope those on the other side of the aisle will let us have that debate, and we could have a good, honest discussion about this and address both of these problems-- the need to fund the department and also the need to address this executive order. i think it is another example where washington has let down the people i represent. in the meantime, this is no time for political games. it is a dangerous world. we have a real problem, not just here at home in protecting the homeland, but also with fires burning all around the world. it is time we showed some leadership both here in this chamber and down the street at 1600 pennsylvania avenue. it is time for presidential leadership. if you turn on the tv tonight, what you will see is those fires burning. you will see a world more dangerous than the one we had after 9/11. you will see threats to the united states and our allies that seem to grow with every passing day. but even as these threats grow, it seems as though our president is increasingly hesitant to lead. iran, despite the platitudes of the obama administration, which seems really eager to find an agreement and make a deal, continues its march toward developing nuclear weapons. isis, the group the president once described as the jv team when they were in iraq flying the black flag of islam extremism over cities such as fallujah and mosul, cities where american marines gave their lives to liberate--the president called them the jv team. russian soldiers now move freely through eastern ukraine, and the separatists there are using russian equipment, they are trained by the russian military, led by russian special forces, and they continue to wage war on an american ally, ukraine. while we all hoped the recent cease-fire would hold, all indications are that russia and its proxies are taking advantage of that cease-fire in ukraine to continue their aggression. across europe--in france, denmark, and belgian--innocent people have been murdered. some were murdered for opposing terrorists aims, and some for the simple fact they are jewish. these attacks are not random, as has been suggested by the administration. unfortunately, they are designed to incite fear and weaken our resolve to oppose islamic terrorism wherever we find it. we must not allow them to succeed any more than we must stand silent in the face of iranian threats and russian aggression. what we must do is take a long, hard look at how we got here and what we must do going forward to change the situation. in my view, a lot of the chaos we are seeing across the globe stems from a lack of leadership. into that void, chaos ensues. the defining themes in the obama administration's approach to foreign policy have been a preference for disengagement and an unwillingness to shoulder the responsibility of global leadership the way previous presidents-- democrat and republican alike--have done. as the administration itself has said, they prefer to lead from behind. the president has said that ``the trajectory of this planet overall is one toward less violence, more tolerance.'' i don't know about that. i don't think history moves inexorably toward more justice and more peace. these trajectories don't just happen, people make them happen. leadership is the key. when america is strong, when we stand unequivocally for freedom and justice and the right of all people to choose their own destiny, when we do not back down in the face of threats and intimidation, that is when we see a world that is more stable, less dangerous, and more free. more wars, more conflicts, more threats to our security--these don't typically arise from american strength. they arise from american weakness. when we look around the world--whether it is in gaza or eastern europe or iraq or iran or syria, the increase in violence and instability has coincided with the growing perception that the united states of america is either unwilling or unable to take a stand against threats to international security and stability. addressing these complex challenges--and many of them are very complex--requires a sustained and proactive american leadership role and american engagement. it requires strategies that seek to shape outcomes, not be shaped by them. there is a lot at stake. events in ukraine, the middle east, and elsewhere are a direct challenge to the united states-led international order, which has led to unprecedented global prosperity and stability for both the united states and for the world. confidence in america's willingness to use our unmatched economic, political, and military capabilities to uphold our system deters potential challengers and incentivizes other countries to [[page s1052]] play by the rules, which reduces the chances of war. if the credibility of this commitment is in doubt, then the stability and openness upon which u.s. economic prosperity and national security depend is jeopardized and the chance for violence, instability, and economic collapse increases. the world is watching. they are watching to see whether this american-led order can withstand these challenges or if we really are entering into a period of the post-american world. in ukraine, the administration's response has been incomplete, reactionary, and ineffective. there are many political and economic dimensions of this conflict, and ukraine needs western support to implement crucial reforms in these areas. but there is also a military dimension to this crisis that we cannot continue to ignore. sanctions alone have not worked. the so-called cease-fire agreements have not worked. as president obama, angela merkel, and francois hollande debate and discuss cease-fires and timelines, russia is deciding the outcome on the ground in eastern ukraine this afternoon as we talk. unless we help provide ukraine with the tools they need to prevent that from happening, any future agreements will only solidify this reality. let's allow them to defend themselves. russia continues to believe that military force is a viable option to achieve its goals, and unless the united states and its european allies and nato help the ukrainians prove otherwise, this behavior is unlikely to change. it is well known by now that the president has refused to adopt policies that actually provide ukraine with the capabilities it needs. a bipartisan coalition, on the other hand, has emerged here in congress on the need to do more, and we will continue to advocate for a change in course and pursuit of a proactive, comprehensive strategy that actually works. in the middle east, proactive american leadership requires upholding our commitment to stand unequivocally with israel. no other nation in the world would be expected to put up with tunnels into their cities with rockets raining down on people's homes. the press got it wrong last year, and with all due respect, i believe the president got it wrong too. there is no moral equivalence in gaza. i have made a few trips to israel. i met with their people. i have walked the streets of sderot and have seen the remains of missiles that were targeted against innocents with hatred and an intent to kill and maim. i have been out to the bomb shelters and the indoor fortified playgrounds built so children can have a chance to play without fear. i have spent time with an iron dome battery crew outside ashkelon. i can tell you this: from what i have learned, the people of israel want peace. unfortunately, we know the biggest winner from this administration's wavering support of israel is iran. iran continues to stall on negotiations meant to end their nuclear weapons program. they continue to ask for more time, and the administration continues to grant it. meanwhile, prime minister benjamin netanyahu is coming to the united states next week to speak of the threat that iran poses not only to israel but to the world, and the president seems to be too busy to meet with him. truly, the world has turned upside down. a key test of u.s. leadership is ensuring that iran does not retain nuclear capability in their continued march toward weaponization. if it were in my power, i would put the kirk-menendez iran sanctions bill--of which i am an original cosponsor--here on the floor on the senate today, and, by the way, it would pass. i believe it would pass with over 60 votes because republicans and democrats alike recognize that iran will not negotiate in good faith unless the united states is unequivocal in our commitment to ending the nuclear threat iran poses. you will recall that this legislation does not impose new sanctions that would be imposed now. these sanctions would be imposed if the iranians do not agree to halt their nuclear weapons program as required, by the way, by the united nations. these are leveraged for the white house, and the white house should use that leverage. american leadership is needed for a more stable and peaceful world. i believe the future does not belong to bigotry and hate, but to freedom- loving people of the world, and the united states of america must lead the way. the presiding officer. the senator's time has expired. mr. portman. i yield the floor. the presiding officer. the senator from minnesota. mr. franken. mr. president, i rise today to talk about the funding for the department of homeland security and the continuing need for immigration reform. we need to fund the department of homeland security and we should pass a clean dhs funding bill. that is the only bill that can pass the senate, and that is the only bill that should pass the senate. once that bill has passed the senate and the house and becomes law, then we can and should move on to consider immigration legislation. republican leadership in the senate has wasted a lot of time over the past month politicizing immigration and mixing it up with the issue of funding this federal agency that helps to protect the united states from terrorists and other threats, and those threats are real. just this past weekend, the terrorist organization al-shabaab issued a threatening video suggesting that the mall of america in my state of minnesota could be a target for a terrorist attack. look, this issue is not something we should be politicizing. we should enact into law a clean funding bill for dhs, and we should fund the department for the whole year and not make the department run for a short time on a continuing resolution and just revisit the issue in the near future. that is not what we want. and then we should and can debate immigration. i have always believed the best way to accomplish meaningful and sustainable immigration reform is through congressional action. in the last congress, the senate took such action. as a member of the judiciary committee, i was very proud to play an active role in the comprehensive immigration bill the senate passed with broad bipartisan support. for me, this was a model of how the senate was supposed to work. four senators from each side of the aisle, known as the gang of 8, came together and crafted a bill which we then marked up in the judiciary committee, and i was very pleased that a number of my amendments were included in the bill, which then went to the senate floor and passed with 68 votes. that bill would have provided a real and comprehensive overhaul of our broken immigration system. it would have significantly strengthened our border security, and it would have helped a lot of people--from small businesses to families in our legal immigration system to the many undocumented immigrants who would have an opportunity, through a tough but fair path, to get right with the law. there are millions of people in our country who want the same things that all of us want--a steady job, excellent education for our children, and a brighter future for their families. but they are living in limbo and often in fear. our bill would help them come out of the shadows and get right with the law. the senate passed our bill in june of 2013. i was very hopeful the house would take up and pass the senate bill. if the house had allowed a vote on the senate bill, it would have passed the house and been enacted into law. that would have meant real and lasting reform to our broken immigration system. unfortunately, over the course of the next year and a half the republican leadership in the house failed to act on the bipartisan immigration reform bill passed in the senate--again, with 68 votes. the president took a step forward that will help a lot of people and will help to address fixing our broken immigration system. while i still believe congress needs to act, i think we need to keep the executive actions in place until we do. i will not support any legislative effort to undo president obama's executive actions. we are presented with a choice. once we pass a bill into law to fund the department of homeland security, we can take a step forward and help a lot more people by passing comprehensive immigration reform or we can take a step backward and harm a lot of people without getting any closer to the comprehensive immigration reform we need. [[page s1053]] i will vote to move forward, not backward. we need a fully funded department of homeland security, and we need a comprehensively overhauled immigration system. i suggest the absence of a quorum. the presiding officer (ms. ayotte). the clerk will call the roll. the senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. mr. bennet. mr. president, i ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. the presiding officer (mr. gardner). without objection, it is so ordered. childhood poverty mr. bennet. mr. president, it is a privilege to be here with my colleague from colorado. i rise to talk about our schools and really to talk about our values and our morality--what we stand for as a country--and to ask whether we are able to look forward and create a better future for our children. to set the record straight, let me be clear. when it comes to our children, i have fallen short, you have fallen short, and this body has fallen short. let me explain why. we have learned in the last couple of weeks that over half of the public school children in this country are now poor enough that they qualify for free or reduced lunches at school--children who, through no fault of their own, are reaping the whirlwind of 15 years of stagnant middle-class family income and the effects of the worst recession since the great depression. by many measures, as the presiding officer knows, colorado's economy leads the nation. but even in our home state, we see more children living in poverty. in fact, the number of children in poverty is growing faster in colorado than in most of the other 50 states. as a country and as a state, we are making a lot of progress in a number of dimensions, but we are headed in the wrong direction when it comes to our kids. that is a bad sign for any country but particularly for a democracy that aspires to be the land of opportunity. a girl in poverty in the united states is five times more likely to be a young single mother than a child from a middle-class family, and a boy in poverty is twice as likely to be incarcerated as his middle- class peers. children from low-income families in this country are about three times less likely to graduate from high school. someone from a family in poverty stands only a 9-in-100 chance of earning a college degree. think about that. there are 100 seats in this chamber. there are 100 desks in this chamber. if they represented children living in poverty in the united states, that desk, that desk, that desk, those three desks, and three of those desks would represent college graduates. the entire rest of this chamber would be people that would never earn a college degree or its equivalent and who would be constrained to the margins of our economy and our democracy as a result after that. interestingly enough, the equivalent number for children in the top quarter of income earners is almost 80 out of 100. so 80 of these desks from a more affluent family--80 of these desks would represent a person who graduated with a college degree or its equivalent, and 20 would represent people that had fallen short, but nine poor children would have a college degree. in other words, in a way that is profoundly at war with our founding ideals, poverty breeds deeper poverty, lack of educational achievement reaps deeper academic failure, and broken families are the surest predictor of more broken families in the next generation and the generations beyond that. this is a sentence of unequal opportunity for all poor americans, no matter the color of their skin. it is a generational sentence for 7 out of 10 children who will remain at the bottom of the income scale their entire lives. are there people who defy these odds? of course there are. as superintendent of the denver public schools and in this job, i have met scores of children who have overcome the odds--sometimes alone--but often also with the help of a parent who wouldn't quit, a teacher who wouldn't take ``no'' for an answer, a former gang member whose sworn duty is to keep young people out of gangs, a philanthropist who insisted that denver's kids would go to college. in these exceptional children i have seen the indomitable nature of the human spirit persevere against all odds and have recognized how little i and most of us have achieved by comparison. i have met kids who take three buses both ways to school leaving as early as 5:30 in the morning just to have the benefit of a better school all the way on the other side of town, kids who can't get up in the morning because they have to work until 11 o'clock or 12 o'clock at night in a fast food restaurant to help pay the rent, kids who pour their heart and soul out into their studies and communities only to learn that college is not for them because of an immigration status they did not even know that they had. i met kids who were the primary caregivers of younger brothers and sisters who are taking care of ailing parents and grandparents, who have made it to college for the first time in their family's history who are that 9 in 100, who represent the best of our human spirit. they are our heroes. as one of our denver public school students, chaunsea dyson from south high school, recently told a radio reporter, ``when you are growing up in poverty, when you are 15 or 16 that means you are grown.'' that means you are grown. as the father of three girls who are 15, 14, and 10, i would say that is an awful lot to expect of a 16-year-old, especially one coming from circumstances few in this chamber could overcome. my point is that while there are many heroic people in our schools--kids, teachers, principals--succeeding in our school system today, heroism is not a standard we tend to count on for the success of human enterprise. we simply can't scale heroism. i wish we could--but we can't--to address the scope of our achievement gap. it is too much to ask, and it is not fair to our kids who have no control over the circumstances of their birth. i don't think there is one member in this chamber who could come and say that is not true, that a child could control somehow the circumstances of his or her birth, because one of the enduring truths of being a human being is that we don't get to choose our parents. we don't choose to be born into a home of wealth or poverty, a home that values books or learning or a home which for whatever reason does not. that is a matter of good and bad luck. yet those circumstances beyond our children's control--absolutely beyond their control--today almost always determine educational outcomes in the united states of america. so the question is, what is our obligation? what is our obligation as a nation to remedy the burden of bad luck for millions of american children? i believe at a minimum it means we have a moral duty to assure that our less lucky children have educational opportunities that let them make the most of their god-given potential. that is certainly what i would want for my own daughters. if we are honest, then by any reckoning we are failing to meet this moral duty and i would say failing very badly. if we ask ourselves why we are failing to do our duty--how can this be--in my mind it comes down to a sad and simple reality: we are treating america's children as if they were someone else's children rather than our own. to demonstrate this let's consider what conditions we have allowed to exist for a child born, through no fault of her own, into poverty in the united states of america in the year 2015. we know that by the age of 4 she will have heard 30 million fewer words than her more affluent peers--30 million. ask any elementary schoolteacher in the country whether that will make a difference in how prepared she is for kindergarten. fewer than half of poor children start school with the skills they need to be ready to succeed in kindergarten. every elementary schoolteacher in america knows that. what are the odds her neighborhood school will meet her needs? how about a school 1 mile away? how about a school 5 miles away? it is not likely in many american cities and rural communities. when she reaches the fourth grade her odds are no better. she is 9 years old and there are 30 children in her classroom. on average, 24 of her classmates cannot read at grade level--24 out of 30. her chances of being a proficient reader--20 percent--one in five. [[page s1054]] one in five poor children cannot read at grade level in the fourth grade in the united states of america this week, today, this year. would any of us accept those odds or outcomes for our own children? would any one person in this chamber accept that? would any of us still be in washington engaged in the potemkin debates we are having if our child couldn't read by the fourth grade? of course not--of course we wouldn't. but we act as if it is not our children who are the casualties, and so we smile and we stroke our chins on the cable tv and pretend this is all somehow out of our hands, too hard to solve, someone else's problem. here is where it ends. in this knowledge-based global economy, this unforgiving global economy, only 9 out of 100 kids, as i said in poverty, will graduate with a college degree or its equivalent and 91 will not. these are the results we have produced for our children in this unforgiving global economy. but for once let's put aside the finger-pointing and the blame-- although we should take our fair share of responsibility--and let's ask the questions our children might reasonably ask to judge their nation's leaders. for example, they might ask: why do we trail behind 35 other developed countries in our math scores? why does the united states rank 20th in increasing educational attainment from one generation to the next--20th; the least likely country to produce more educated people coming after us than there were before us. why are american children much more likely to be stuck in the economic class into which they are born than children in at least 12 other countries, including canada, japan, germany, australia, and denmark? these seem like reasonable questions. you wouldn't know they were on anybody's mind around here with what concerns us on this floor, but i can tell you it is of concern to people at home. why are we consigning, they might ask, our children and ourselves to a social economic framework that is increasing, not decreasing, inequality in this country, when other countries in the world are headed in the opposite direction? why are we putting up with a set of circumstances in which income and equality in america has grown significantly much faster than other industrialized countries in the world? if i were a child living in poverty in this country, those are the questions i would want to know, in addition to the fact that i can't find a school, not just down the street, not just in my neighborhood but in my city or even in the region of my state to go to. to put it another way, i can't find a school in my community that any member of the senate would be proud to send their child to. why can't i find that school? i didn't pick my parents. that was a question of good luck or bad luck. in my case it was bad luck. i know there are profound disagreements about whether the federal, state or local government should serve our kids and how. i am even sympathetic, believe me, as a former school superintendent, to many arguments about how poorly washington is often situated to help. but surely as a nation, one way or another, we have a moral obligation. that is our legacy as americans ``in order to form a more perfect union, establish justice, ensure domestic tranquility, provide for the common defense, promote the general welfare, and secure the blessings of liberty to ourselves and our posterity. . . . '' imagine how less powerful the preamble to the constitution would have been if it stopped with ourselves, period--but it didn't. it resolves the question in favor of our posterity--our posterity, not someone else's--our children, not someone else's. what would this debate sound like if we were serious about this moral obligation? without deciding today who would deliver and pay for these important social goods, something we should debate and understand, consult with our states and our school districts, our parents and our communities; but, without making those decisions today, if we just were treating the country's children as our own children, what would this debate sound like? what would we do? we surely would provide every parent and her child with the choice to access early childhood education from birth to age 5 in order to attack that 30 million word deficit. surely we would do that. i am not saying we should do it. i don't think we should do that from here, but as a nation we should do that. surely we would ensure that every child, without exception and regardless of where they live, has the choice to attend a high-performing school from kindergarten to 12th grade. surely we would do that. we would enable every young person, consistent with most of our postwar history, the chance to attain a college degree or other advanced technical training without bankrupting their family. i saw some data this weekend about this that showed that in 1975--and admittedly it was the high-water mark--the pell grants covered roughly 76 percent of what it cost to go to college, the average cost of college. do you know what that number is now? it is 22 percent, mostly because the cost of college has increased so much. bankruptcy is a real issue. these goals--early childhood education, a great k-12 school, affordable college--might seem obvious and even unimaginative to many of us in this chamber, but that might be because we take them for granted for our own children. of course we want high- quality early childhood education, of course we want a high-quality k- 12 school, of course we want our young people to have access to college without bankrupting our family, and that is the experience of a lot of people in this chamber. the terrible reality for most poor children in america in 2015 is that these simple goals are as out of reach as flying to the moon, all over this country. some say we can't afford to change, and i say we can't afford not to change. the costs of failure, as we know, are simply too high. since the industrial revolution, we have had the greatest economy the world has ever known, and if we are to remain so in the 21st century, we must educate our people. we have no other choice. they are our greatest asset. we can do it. i am not proposing today a new federal program of any kind. however, i will say if it were left up to me, we would have a standing committee in the senate focused exclusively on our children and their future. such a committee would, for example, examine every funding stream in the federal budget related to kids and ask what is working and what is not working. what redundancies exist? how are we going to align every single taxpayer dollar or tax credit to help support the health, education, and well-being of our children? i suspect that in addition to increasing efficiency, we would decide to spend more of our resources in and around schools. that is where our kids are, after all, and that is where the people who have served them in our communities need to be instead of tied up in the redtape of compliance and outdated and unimaginative federal rules and regulations. in addition to that, we need to explore more efficient ways to finance social welfare programs, promote more creative ways to weave our social safety net in this country, and reform our criminal justice system. a good start would be to graduate children from high school, since around 80 percent of our prison inmates are high-school dropouts. that would help a lot. we need to better engage with the private and nonprofit sectors when the government isn't working well enough. this is all part of a broader but essential conversation, one this body continues to avoid while it wanders from one phony conflict to the next, and one that becomes more difficult and more expensive the longer we wait. our kids are waiting for us to have this conversation. we are wasting their time. it is one thing for us to waste our own time--although the capacity for doing that around here is beyond belief--but we ought to stop wasting our kids' time. as i said, it is only going to become more difficult and more expensive the longer we wait. in the meantime, we have before us the potential to rewrite the elementary and secondary school act. fixing so-called no child left behind is only one piece of the puzzle. given where we are, this is all pretty modest stuff. there are some very encouraging signs, although the law has plenty of flaws. in fact, i said many times that if we had a rally out in front of the capitol to keep no child left behind the [[page s1055]] same--if that is what the rally was for--not a single person in america would show up for that rally. incidentally, while we have this reauthorization in front of us, it is a reauthorization that should have happened 7 years ago. it expired 7 years ago. we are running education policy in this country by waivers from the department of education because this congress cannot do its job. almost 40 of 50 states have waivers from the law as it exists today. let's change the law. let's write it properly. let's do our work around here instead of spending our time on things the american people don't want us to spend our time on. although everybody loves to hate no child left behind, and i put myself in that category, it has some good things. it required us to face the facts about how our kids in poverty are doing in our schools. it shed light for the first time on the achievement gap--the brutal achievement gap--we have in this country, and some school districts stepped up. denver public schools is one such district. over the last decade, denver public schools has implemented a number of changes and has seen real results. my schoolboard and my principals and my teachers and our kids and i would be the first to say we have not yet gotten to a place where you can say the zip code you were born into doesn't determine the education you are going to get, but we are a lot closer in denver. we are a lot closer there than we are in a lot of other cities in this country. we have seen some real results. almost 30 percent more students graduated and went to college last year than in 2005. that is not enough. we are not satisfied with that. but if you could say that about every single city in this country, that we were graduating and sending 30 percent more students to college than we were in 2005, that might give us some hope for the future. that might suggest that some outcomes other than the ones we have been seeing with the result of 9 out of 100 poor kids getting a college degree is not where we have to end up, is not where we have to land. i am here to tell you, not as a u.s. senator, but as someone who was a superintendent of the denver public schools, this is possible. it is possible to change these outcomes in urban districts and in rural districts for children who are unlucky enough to be born into poverty in the greatest nation on the planet--unlucky enough to be born poor and not born rich. denver has recognized the importance of providing access to high- quality, early childhood education, and now an estimated 70 percent of denver's 4-year-olds are enrolled in preschool. that was not true in 2005. as the presiding officer knows, we live in a state that doesn't require or pay for 5-year-olds to go to kindergarten. that is a shame. but because of the changes we made in denver, our 5-year-olds go to kindergarten--a full day if they want it, which most of them do--and 70 percent of the fourth graders in denver have early childhood education, and it is not only delivered by the denver public schools, but by other providers as well and the denver public schools. this seems to be having an effect as kids who attend the denver preschool program track higher in school readiness. they know more about the alphabet, words, and books. they have a higher vocabulary and are able to comprehend basic math. and in kindergarten, first, and second grade, they showed better literacy and math skills than their peers. the dropout rate in denver has decreased since 2005 by 60 percent. incidentally, the teen pregnancy rate has also fallen by 60 percent. denver public schools has gone from being the district with the lowest rate of academic growth among major districts in the state to the highest for 3 straight years. i am not taking responsibility for that. i am here, not there. last year dps students from low-income families had stronger growth in math and writing than nonfree- and reduced-lunch students statewide. and denver's nonfree- and reduced-lunch students showed more growth than their state counterparts in math by nine points. this was once labeled the failing school district in our state, but because of the data that we have as a result of no child left behind, we can actually see what is happening--which kids are growing and which kids are not, which schools are driving growth among kids and which schools are not. you can look at a map of our city and find a school that looks just like your low-performing school with the same percentage of free- and reduced-lunch kids where kids are succeeding beyond their wildest dreams. then what parents can do is say: i want that school, not this school, for my kid. because we have a robust system of choice in denver, parents are able to take advantage of that data, and we simply would not have had the proliferation of high-performing charter schools if it had not been for no child left behind. in addition, denver has gone beyond that. we have 33 innovation schools where teachers and administrators have the flexibility to modernize their teaching practices and have more autonomy to make decisions at the school level to better meet the needs of individual students. and it is not just denver. we have seen progress all across the country--not remotely enough, but we have seen progress, and we cannot go backward. in the 3 decades prior to no child left behind being passed--30 years--the average 9-year-old's reading score on the national assessment of educational progress increased only 4 points--4 points in 30 years. is that acceptable? contrast that to the gains from 1990 to 2012, which is roughly the life of no child left behind. during that span, 9-year-olds gained 9 points in reading, about 7 times as much annual progress. we have seen similar progress in math--9-year-olds only increased 2 points from 1990 to 1999, but from 1999 to 2012, they gained 12 points. in that same span, african-american students improved by 15 points and latino students improved by 21 points. the achievement gap shrunk as well. in reading, the gap between white and african-american 9-year-old students dropped from 35 to 23 points. it is still too big, but it is moving in the right direction. this represents progress, but as i have said, in the face of stiff competition worldwide, it is nowhere near enough. since the year 2000, we have dropped from second to twelfth in the world in the production of college graduates. we need to write a bill that builds on our successes and turns us away from the failed practices of the past, and we cannot do it if we are constrained by the typical politics--the small politics of washington. we cannot afford to have the same tired fights. we won't always agree on everything, but i know we can find a way to pass a bill that helps our schools and school districts to make the decisions they think are best for the kids they are educating. the presiding officer. the senator's time has expired. we are under a 10-minute time limitation. mr. bennet. mr. president, i ask unanimous consent for 7 more minutes. the presiding officer. is there objection? without objection, it is so ordered. mr. bennet. i appreciate the indulgence of my colleague from louisiana. in a significant demonstration of leadership around here, chairman alexander and senator murray have told us they intend to write a bipartisan bill. their process has the potential to be a rare exception to the gridlock that has gripped this senate, along with our bipartisan work on the farm bill and immigration. senators alexander and murray have both expressed a willingness to work together because they appreciate the importance of this task. they understand the consequences of failure. they know enough about this issue, and they care enough about it. in january of 1941, during one of the nation's most difficult times-- the height of the great depression and on the eve of our entry into the second world war, franklin roosevelt declared that there were four universal freedoms that all persons possessed--freedom of speech, freedom of worship, freedom from want, and freedom from fear. today, in the 21st century, some of these freedoms may be obtainable, but an honest assessment tells us it would be impossible to achieve all of them without something additional, and that is freedom from ignorance. in the end, freedom from ignorance is the surest relief from the shackles of poverty. [[page s1056]] where does this leave us as we begin this important but long overdue national conversation on the reauthorization of the elementary and secondary school act? first, for all the reasons i have mentioned, america's children would benefit if we treated our work less as legislators than as parents and grandparents with a real stake in the outcome of what we decide. second, we must be clear-eyed about the federal government's proper role in american education and what is not. as a superintendent, i learned there are many things the federal government cannot and should not do when it comes to educating our children. and above all else, washington cannot and should not micromanage our schools or our school districts or cultivate systems driven by compliance rather than creativity. i believe the evidence of our failures and our successes over the last 15 years suggest three primary federal responsibilities: equity, accountability, and innovation. after all, the deep and intractable inequities that persisted along lines of race and class and geography in america of the 1960s drove lyndon johnson to pass the first elementary and secondary schools act. they drove the creation of title i, specific funds targeted to the kids who needed the greatest support. sadly, for all the reasons i said, half a century later the data reveals these profound inequities persist and our students need our help now more than ever. but there is also reason for hope in this data, and maybe that is the most important message i can bring. we now have evidence that sustains support to make the difference in closing the pernicious gaps that remain for low-income kids around the country. our deep commitment to equity, therefore, is as important today as it was in 1963. this means not just committing title i resources, but continuing to expand efforts to open the best schools and attract the best teachers and principals to our communities in the greatest need. in particular, we must help teachers who are saying they want better preparation, they want an excellent principal in their school, they want a better compensation system and opportunities for leadership that allow them to continue working with students. at dps we have made some strides. we created the denver teacher residency program and introduced differentiated pay. we used federal innovation dollars to help us improve and expand early on. we are creating leadership roles for teachers who demonstrate results with their students. we survey our teachers every year, and their satisfaction rates are higher than the national average. but there is still much more for us to do. second, those of us working in the field know we must have a clear, shared system of accountability, a system that allows us to monitor, understand, and improve outcomes for students. this requires annual assessments that monitor progress and growth across all our cities and states. it requires breaking down data to show how and if we are closing the gaps for all students in our school districts. it means requiring states to take courageous action to turn around those schools that consistently fail our children. that is not just about paying attention to how we are serving our low-income students in detroit or denver. it means examining how well we serve our historically disadvantaged students even when they live in some of the most advantaged neighborhoods. as we do this, we need to work to reduce the amount of testing in our schools. as the father of three daughters in the denver public schools, i am concerned about how much they are tested. but as their father, i also want to know every year how they are doing against a set of rigorous standards and compared to kids in denver, across colorado, and around the world. will they be ready for college? do they have the skills they need to succeed in this global economy? third, we have learned over the last decade there is a vital federal role when it comes to innovation in our schools. we can help provide the preconditions for success by providing incentives for educators on the ground to apply their own creative thinking to address our most persistent education problems. i say to my colleague from louisiana, through the chair, i am coming to the end. i owe him 10 minutes whenever he would like it. i thank him for his indulgence. we will never solve the challenges our teachers and students face in washington, period. we will not do it from here. we can help local leaders break free from a status quo that will never succeed for enough of america's children. we should help identify the challenges, provide resources to local educators to overcome them in the context that works best for their communities and their students, and we should continue to be the clearinghouse that gathers these stories of successful innovation and provide the resources to invest in scaling what works and sharing these practices across communities and states. equity, accountability, innovation--that is our charge and the commitment we must keep if we are to build an america where we treat every child as if she were our own. as a parent myself, i am well aware the first responsibility any parent has is the education of her child. i am also aware that many people believe a bad education is just one more outcome produced by corrosive poverty in this country. fix poverty, and you will fix education. maybe so, but that is cold comfort for millions of children in our schools today. in the end, we have a duty as a nation to ensure that education liberates our children, rather than reinforces the circumstances into which they were born. in that sense, america's children are our children, our responsibility, not someone else's. can you really accept an america in which your little girl has just a 1-in-5 chance of being able to read well or a 9-in-100 chance to graduate from college? can you really demand heroism as a precondition for success? if this were your child, would you still be in the senate, or would you go home and solve the problem? it has been said the future has no lobby in washington, dc. are we really content to have that depressing observation be the ultimate verdict on our leadership? i doubt we are. i would raise this as a bipartisan challenge as i close. i know the senator from louisiana knows a lot about what i came to talk about today, and i look forward to working with him on the health committee. here is my bipartisan challenge. let's forge a lobby for the future. let's agree that the obligation we owe the founders is to create more opportunity, not less, for the children coming after us. let's pledge that every child in america is our child, and our future rests with her, as it most assuredly does. i yield the floor. the presiding officer. the senator from louisiana. mr. cassidy. mr. president, i rise today in support of the house- passed homeland security appropriations bill. this bill is not just about whether we should fund the department of homeland security to carry out the very important work of protecting our nation, but also whether we will provide amnesty to those here illegally. first, let's establish that the constitution says congress has authority over our immigration and naturalization laws. the president does not have the authority to waive legal requirements. the supreme court has upheld this on numerous occasions. the president has admitted more than 20 times he does not have this authority. that said, now his administration is attempting to block the ruling the judge recently made to protect his amnesty plan. as has been reported in the papers, judge hanen in texas has put an injunction against proceeding with the president's amnesty bill. it is reported the department of homeland security, at the president's direction, is moving forward with plans to seal large contracts with companies to process deferred-action applications for millions of illegal immigrants as soon as possible. american families have seen president obama rewrite the laws many times, and the outcomes of the recent elections show they do not support president obama's executive overreach. the president intends to grant amnesty to 5 million people. this will [[page s1057]] not be done on a case-by-case basis as the law suggests it should be. it is going to be a rubberstamp, a rubberstamp at the expense of those who are legally attempting to come to our country. it will take longer for those who are attempting to come legally to gain admittance under the law. i support the efforts of those coming to the united states to make a better life for themselves and their family. we all believe in immigration. we just think immigration should be legal. the president has rewritten the law to allow illegal immigrants the ability to receive work permits and drivers licenses which also includes receiving a social security number. after a certain period of time they will be eligible for social security. this goes far beyond his legal authority. by the way, many of my democratic colleagues have expressed concerns about the president's action and whether he had the constitutional authority to take the action he has taken. clearly he does not. while the president says this legal status is temporary, the reality is once work permits have been issued and social security cards are given, folks will be allowed to stay. they would not be deemed a priority for removal. on top of that, the temporary status may be renewed. in 2011, the president took executive action for the department of homeland security to start prioritizing illegal immigrants for removal. in april 2014, several months before he took his most recent action, the los angeles times quoted former ice director john sandweg in an article where he said, if you are a run-of-the-mill immigrant here illegally, your odds of getting deported are close to zero. the associated press reported in september 2014 the department of homeland security admitted to a group of immigrant advocates during a confidential meeting that about 70 percent of illegal immigrants traveling as families failed to report back to ice as ordered after they were released at the border. a few weeks ago louisiana school administrators and i met, and they expressed concern about how the president's immigration policies have stressed our school systems. classroom sizes have grown. their associated costs to hire more teachers, buy textbooks, and the required resources to educate these students all have grown. president obama is giving executive amnesty to suit his agenda but is stretching limited local and state resources. by stretching them, it is making it tougher on americans who are born here. the administration says only 5 million people will be impacted by the president's executive order. the reality is with numerous options for illegal immigrants to remain in this country, people are going to hear about it. they will attempt to come. this will be a magnet for others to come here illegally. illegal behavior is being rewarded. if the president's supporters feel compelled to continue blocking the funding bill, it must be clear they feel that executive amnesty is legal regardless of how the courts have ruled. it is clear they believe that protecting the president's illegal action is more important than providing our men and women with the resources to protect our border. we must fund the department of homeland security. as i have said, many of my colleagues who expressed serious concerns with the president's executive actions in november are now voting to protect these actions. it is unfortunate they voted four times to prevent this bill--the homeland security funding bill--from coming up for debate. they won't even allow debate. folks say they want funding for the homeland security department, but they won't allow debate. this is unconscionable. i believe it is important we move forward to avoid a shutdown of the department of homeland security. i urge my colleagues to please stop blocking this important legislation we must pass to protect our country and give the men and women of homeland security the resources they need and, most importantly, to protect the constitution. i yield the floor. i suggest the absence of a quorum. the presiding officer. the clerk will call the role. the senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. mr. carper. mr. president, i ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. the presiding officer (mr. daines). without objection, it is so ordered. mr. carper. mr. president, in 3\1/2\ days, the department of homeland security may well shut down. i speak as the senior democrat on the committee on homeland security and governmental affairs for the last 2 years and, along with dr. tom coburn, our former colleague from oklahoma, chaired that committee that he and i led. but in 3\1/2\ days, if congress fails to act responsibly--78 hours, i think, from right now--the department of homeland security may shut down. i have spoken on the floor a number of times in recent weeks about the complex, consistent, and very real threats that our country faces. we are familiar with a lot of them--maybe not all. but over the past several months we have seen horrific images of beheadings, of mass murders, brutal executions at the hands of the islamic state. some of our nation's largest companies and federal agencies have been victims of massive cyber attacks. they continue to this day. this weekend another terrorist group, the al qaeda-linked terrorist group in somalia called al-shabaab, vowed they would seek revenge against the united states. they cited the mall of america in minnesota as a potential target. it is not just these groups or the lone wolf terrorists they inspire that we need to worry about. last fall, ebola ravaged several nations in western africa and even came to our shores as well. threats from mother nature persist too. communities and cities in some parts of our country are trying to get through a winter that has already broken snowfall records, and more records are likely to fall. yet today, here in the congress, there are some who are questioning whether even to fund the very agencies charged with keeping us safe from these and other evolving threats. that goes beyond being irresponsible. department of homeland security secretary jeh johnson nailed it recently when he said what it was. here is what he said: ``it is bizarre and absurd that we are even having this discussion.'' i could not agree more. is this really the message we want to be sending to all those folks across the world who wish us harm? god, i hope not. here we are, days before this key agency could be forced to shut down preparing for the worst. some of our colleagues have said that it is not a big deal if the department shuts down. i could not disagree more strongly, and here is why. if we continue this behavior and fail to pass a clean department of homeland security funding bill by midnight on friday, this is what will happen at the department of homeland security: much of the department's workforce, up to 200,000 people, will be expected to show up for work but work without pay. that includes border patrol agents who protect our borders. that includes coast guard crews who patrol our waters. that includes the tsa employees who keep our skies safe and make it safe to fly on airplanes and get in and out of our airports. many of these courageous men and women put their lives in harm's way every day. we expect them to continue doing that. we just are not going to pay them. that is right. we want you to keep doing your job of protecting our nation. eventually, those in congress will get around to doing our job. when we do, you will get paid. let me ask: how would we like to be treated that way? how would we like to be treated that way? well, we would not. i think it is shameful that we would even contemplate treating some of our bravest fellow employees like that. it is shameful. even worse, treating our people like this does not make america any safer. in fact, it makes us less safe in the end. even if we did avoid a shutdown, we would keep the department running on a stopgap continuing resolution. we would prevent the men and women who work there from doing their jobs as efficiently and as effectively as they could be, should be, and would like to be. secretary johnson described that putting the department on another continuing resolution--these are his words--``is a little like trying to drive [[page s1058]] cross-country with no more than five gallons of gas [in the tank] at a time and you don't know when the next gas station is. you can't plan except days and weeks at a time.'' for example, if we pass another stopgap continuing resolution, the department will not be able to replace obsolete surveillance technology along high-risk areas of our border. we need to replace that. in addition, our nation will have significantly fewer resources to respond to any future surges of unaccompanied minors along our southwest border. moreover, we will put construction of a badly needed national security cutter for the coast guard on hold. why does that matter? it matters because our coast guard fleet is aging and needs to be modernized. these ships are essential to stopping illegal trafficking off our coasts, such as drug trafficking, human trafficking, and illegal immigration--some of it in vessels that travel at speeds of greater than 50 knots. if that is not enough, try this: it is widely known that employee morale at the department of homeland security is the lowest of all major federal agencies. passing yet another continuing resolution i promise you will not make it any better--quite the opposite. morale will only get worse, and in doing so threaten to degrade the performance of the people we rely on, perhaps more than any other, to keep americans safe. so let me say it again. this is not the way we should be treating the public servants who in many cases risk their lives to keep our nation and all americans safe. this is no way to run a key national agency. furthermore, as we have learned over the years, this kind of crisis budgeting costs taxpayers millions of dollars in lost productivity, in hiring freezes, in contracts that will have to be renegotiated--not at a lower cost to taxpayers--at higher costs. now, i understand why some of our colleagues are concerned about the policies and procedures set forth in the president's executive action on immigration. i get it. they have every right to express those concerns. but the budget of the department of homeland security is not the place to have that debate. a federal district court in south texas recently examined what the president put forward and blocked its implementation. why cannot we just let the judicial process play out and meanwhile do our job by funding the department of homeland security for the balance of this fiscal year? some of our republican colleagues agree with this approach. one of our colleagues, lindsey graham, said earlier this week: ``i hope republicans will come together and back the court case, file a friend of the court brief with the court and fund dhs.'' he added: i am willing and ready to pass a dhs funding bill and let this play out in court. the worst possible outcome for this nation is to defund the department of homeland security given the multiple threats we face to our homeland. our friend, lindsey's friend, john mccain, also said recently--these are his words, not mine: it's not a good idea to shut down the department of homeland security. . . . now we have the perfect reason to not shut it down because the courts have decided, at least initially, in our favor. ``our favor'' is that of the republican governors who filed the lawsuit in the south texas district court. i want to urge my republican colleagues to go ahead and pursue this potential judicial remedy to address the concerns they have. but while they are doing that, for god's sake, let's bring a clean, fiscal year 2015 appropriations bill for the department of homeland security--the same bill that both democrats and republicans agreed to last december--let's bring it to the floor so we can give the department the funding and the certainty that it desperately needs. regardless of what happens in the courts, at the end of the day comprehensive immigration reform is the only way we can fix our broken immigration system for the long term. it is the only way we can address the issues the president was trying to resolve in his executive action in a straightforward way, as we did in the last congress when we passed by a big bipartisan vote right on this floor--by a 2-to-1 margin-- comprehensive immigration reform. we owe the american people an honest and thorough debate on immigration reform. but let's do it the right way. we have shown that we can do that. we did it a year and a half ago. let's do it again. let's do it this year after approving a clean, full-year funding bill for the department of homeland security. i might just add this. the comprehensive immigration reform that we passed here by a 2-to-1 margin a year and a half ago was priced out by the congressional budget office, which is not democratic or republican. they looked at it and did all the numbers and everything. they concluded that rather than increasing the budget deficit, that comprehensive immigration reform bill reduced the budget deficit for the next 10 years by $200 billion. further, for the second 10 years, it reduced our budget deficit by $700 billion. a different study further suggested that the impact on our nation's economy and on our gross domestic product by the implementation of that same comprehensive immigration reform was that it would not diminish the growth to our economy. it would actually increase it by 5 percent-- 5-percent gdp growth over a two-decade period of time. those of us who are privileged to serve in the senate were sent here by our constituents with a critical responsibility: to work together and pass laws that help our nation and help our economy to grow and to thrive. this debate--or any debate, for that matter--should not be about one political party winning or losing, because the only people who are losing are the constituents we are supposed to serve. as long as we continue to spend our time debating these manufactured funding crises, our constituents--american taxpayers from coast to coast--are going to continue to lose. we as a congress, i think, lose as well. i believe american voters made it clear in last fall's election. they are tired of all of this kind of behavior. i do not blame them either. but it is simple. they want us to do our job. they want us to work together across these aisles. they want us to get things done that need to get done. they want us to find ways to strengthen the---- i ask unanimous consent for 2 additional minutes. the presiding officer. without objection, it is so ordered. mr. carper. in closing, let me just note that i am encouraged to hear that senate majority leader mcconnell now seems to be moving toward allowing a vote on a clean bill. i hope this change of course is the beginning of the end of this crisis for the department of homeland security and for our country. whatever we do, it is critical that we consider and pass a clean department of homeland security funding bill first. at this point, every hour that goes by without one creates more uncertainty and more waste. after we do that, let's roll up our sleeves and let's get back to work on a thoughtful, 21st century immigration reform policy for our country, a policy that is fair, a policy that will significantly reduce our nation's budget deficit, and a policy that will strengthen the economic recovery now underway. i want to thank my friend from iowa for the kindness in allowing me to proceed for an extra few minutes. i yield the floor.

Members thereof shall be appointed by the Senate in accordance with the provisions of Paragraph 1 of Rule XXIV of the Standing Rules of the Senate at the beginning of each Congress. For purposes of paragraph 4 of Rule XXV of the Standing Rules of the Senate, service of a Senator as a member or chairman of the Select Committee shall not be taken into account.

During the transaction of routine business any member of the Select Committee constituting the quorum shall have the right to postpone further discussion of a pending matter until such time as a majority of the members of the Select Committee are present. (3) The Select Committee may fix a lesser number as a quorum for the purpose of taking sworn testimony. (d)(1) A member of the Select Committee shall be ineligible to participate in-- (A) any preliminary inquiry or adjudicatory review relating to-- (i) the conduct of-- (I) such member; (II) any officer or employee the member supervises; or (III) any employee of any officer the member supervises; or (ii) any complaint filed by the member; and (B) the determinations and recommendations of the Select Committee with respect to any preliminary inquiry or adjudicatory review described in subparagraph (A).

(3) Whenever any member of the Select Committee is ineligible under paragraph (1) to participate in any preliminary inquiry or adjudicatory review or disqualifies himself or herself under paragraph (2) from participating in any preliminary inquiry or adjudicatory review, another Senator shall, subject to the provisions of subsection (d), be appointed to serve as a member of the Select Committee solely for purposes of such preliminary inquiry or adjudicatory review and the determinations and recommendations of the Select Committee with respect to such preliminary inquiry or adjudicatory review. Any Member of the Senate appointed for such purposes shall be of the same party as the Member who is ineligible or disqualifies himself or herself. Sec. 2. (a) It shall be the duty of the Select Committee to-- (1) receive complaints and investigate allegations of improper conduct which may reflect upon the Senate, violations of law, violations of the Senate Code of Official Conduct and violations of rules and regulations of the Senate, relating to the conduct of individuals in the performance of their duties as Members of the Senate, or as officers or employees of the Senate, and to make appropriate findings of fact and conclusions with respect thereto; (2)(A) recommend to the Senate by report or resolution by a majority vote of the full committee disciplinary action to be taken with respect to such violations which the Select Committee shall determine, after according to the individual concerned due notice and opportunity for a hearing, to have occurred; (B) pursuant to subparagraph (A) recommend discipline, including-- (i) in the case of a Member, a recommendation to the Senate for expulsion, censure, payment of restitution, recommendation to a Member's party conference regarding the Member's seniority or positions of responsibility, or a combination of these; and (ii) in the case of an officer or employee, dismissal, suspension, payment of restitution, or a combination of these; (3) subject to the provisions of subsection (e), by a unanimous vote of 6 members, order that a Member, officer, or employee be reprimanded or pay restitution, or both, if the Select Committee determines, after according to the Member, officer, or employee due notice and opportunity for a hearing, that misconduct occurred warranting discipline less serious than discipline by the full Senate; (4) in the circumstances described in subsection (d)(3), issue a public or private letter of admonition to a Member, officer, or employee, which shall not be subject to appeal to the Senate; (5) recommend to the Senate, by report or resolution, such additional rules or regulations as the Select Committee shall determine to be necessary or desirable to insure proper standards of conduct by Members of the Senate, and by officers or employees of the Senate, in the performance of their duties and the discharge of their responsibilities; (6) by a majority vote of the full committee, report violations of any law, including the provision of false information to the Select Committee, to the proper Federal and State authorities; and (7) develop and implement programs and materials designed to educate Members, officers, and employees about the laws, rules, regulations, and standards of conduct applicable to such individuals in the performance of their duties. (b) For the purposes of this resolution-- (1) the term ``sworn complaint'' means a written statement of facts, submitted under penalty of perjury, within the personal knowledge of the complainant alleging a violation of law, the Senate Code of Official Conduct, or any other rule or regulation of the Senate relating to the conduct of individuals in the performance of their duties as Members, officers, or employees of the Senate; (2) the term ``preliminary inquiry'' means a proceeding undertaken by the Select Committee following the receipt of a complaint or allegation of, or information about, misconduct by a Member, officer, or employee of the Senate to determine whether there is substantial credible evidence which provides substantial cause for the Select Committee to conclude that a violation within the jurisdiction of the Select Committee has occurred; and (3) the term ``adjudicatory review'' means a proceeding undertaken by the Select Committee after a finding, on the basis of a preliminary inquiry, that there is substantial credible evidence which provides substantial cause for the Select Committee to conclude that a violation within the jurisdiction of the Select Committee has occurred. (c) (1) No-- (A) adjudicatory review of conduct of a Member or officer of the Senate may be conducted; [[Page S1061]] (B) report, resolution, or recommendation relating to such an adjudicatory review of conduct may be made; and (C) letter of admonition pursuant to subsection (d)(3) may be issued, unless approved by the affirmative recorded vote of no fewer than 4 members of the Select Committee. (2) No other resolution, report, recommendation, interpretative ruling, or advisory opinion may be made without an affirmative vote of a majority of the Members of the Select Committee voting. (d) (1) When the Select Committee receives a sworn complaint or other allegation or information about a Member, officer, or employee of the Senate, it shall promptly conduct a preliminary inquiry into matters raised by that complaint, allegation, or information. The preliminary inquiry shall be of duration and scope necessary to determine whether there is substantial credible evidence which provides substantial cause for the Select Committee to conclude that a violation within the jurisdiction of the Select Committee has occurred. The Select Committee may delegate to the chairman and vice chairman the discretion to determine the appropriate duration, scope, and conduct of a preliminary inquiry. (2) If, as a result of a preliminary inquiry under paragraph (1), the Select Committee determines by a recorded vote that there is not such substantial credible evidence, the Select Committee shall dismiss the matter. The Select Committee may delegate to the chairman and vice chairman the authority, on behalf of the Select Committee, to dismiss any matter that they determine, after a preliminary inquiry, lacks substantial merit. The Select Committee shall inform the individual who provided to the Select Committee the complaint, allegation, or information, and the individual who is the subject of the complaint, allegation, or information, of the dismissal, together with an explanation of the basis for the dismissal. (3) If, as a result of a preliminary inquiry under paragraph (1), the Select Committee determines that a violation is inadvertent, technical, or otherwise of a de minimis nature, the Select Committee may dispose of the matter by issuing a public or private letter of admonition, which shall not be considered discipline. The Select Committee may issue a public letter of admonition upon a similar determination at the conclusion of an adjudicatory review. (4) If, as a result of a preliminary inquiry under paragraph (1), the Select Committee determines that there is such substantial credible evidence and the matter cannot be appropriately disposed of under paragraph (3), the Select Committee shall promptly initiate an adjudicatory review. Upon the conclusion of such adjudicatory review, the Select Committee shall report to the Senate, as soon as practicable, the results of such adjudicatory review, together with its recommendations (if any) pursuant to subsection (a)(2). (e) (1) Any individual who is the subject of a reprimand or order of restitution, or both, pursuant to subsection (a)(3) may, within 30 days of the Select Committee's report to the Senate of its action imposing a reprimand or order of restitution, or both, appeal to the Senate by providing written notice of the basis for the appeal to the Select Committee and the presiding officer of the Senate. The presiding officer of the Senate shall cause the notice of the appeal to be printed in the Congressional Record and the Senate Journal. (2) A motion to proceed to consideration of an appeal pursuant to paragraph (1) shall be highly privileged and not debatable. If the motion to proceed to consideration of the appeal is agreed to, the appeal shall be decided on the basis of the Select Committee's report to the Senate. Debate on the appeal shall be limited to 10 hours, which shall be divided equally between, and controlled by, those favoring and those opposing the appeal. (f) The Select Committee may, in its discretion, employ hearing examiners to hear testimony and make findings of fact and/or recommendations to the Select Committee concerning the disposition of complaints. (g) Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, no adjudicatory review shall be initiated of any alleged violation of any law, the Senate Code of Official Conduct, rule, or regulation which was not in effect at the time the alleged violation occurred. No provisions of the Senate Code of Official Conduct shall apply to or require disclosure of any act, relationship, or transaction which occurred prior to the effective date of the applicable provision of the Code. The Select Committee may initiate an adjudicatory review of any alleged violation of a rule or law which was in effect prior to the enactment of the Senate Code of Official Conduct if the alleged violation occurred while such rule or law was in effect and the violation was not a matter resolved on the merits by the predecessor Select Committee. (h) The Select Committee shall adopt written rules setting forth procedures to be used in conducting preliminary inquiries and adjudicatory reviews. (i) The Select Committee from time to time shall transmit to the Senate its recommendation as to any legislative measures which it may consider to be necessary for the effective discharge of its duties.

(b) (1) The Select Committee is authorized to retain and compensate counsel not employed by the Senate (or by any department or agency of the executive branch of the Government) whenever the Select Committee determines that the retention of outside counsel is necessary or appropriate for any action regarding any complaint or allegation, which, in the determination of the Select Committee is more appropriately conducted by counsel not employed by the Government of the United States as a regular employee. (2) Any adjudicatory review as defined in section 2(b)(3) shall be conducted by outside counsel as authorized in paragraph (1), unless the Select Committee determines not to use outside counsel.

(4) The Select Committee may in its discretion render an advisory opinion in writing within a reasonable time in response to a written request by any employee of the Senate concerning the application of any law, the Senate Code of Official Conduct, or any rule or regulation of the Senate within its jurisdiction to a specific factual situation pertinent to the conduct or proposed conduct of the person seeking the advisory opinion. (5) Notwithstanding any provision of the Senate Code of Official Conduct or any rule or regulation of the Senate, any person who relies upon any provision or finding of an advisory opinion in accordance with the provisions of paragraphs (3) and (4) and who acts in good faith in accordance with the provisions and findings of such advisory opinion shall not, as a result of any such act, be subject to any sanction by the Senate.

RULE 3: PROCEDURES FOR CONDUCTING A PRELIMINARY INQUIRY (a) DEFINITION OF PRELIMINARY INQUIRY: A ``preliminary inquiry'' is a proceeding undertaken by the Committee following the receipt of a complaint or allegation of, or information about, misconduct by a Member, officer, or employee of the Senate to determine whether there is substantial credible evidence which provides substantial cause for the Committee to conclude that a violation within the jurisdiction of the Committee has occurred. (b) BASIS FOR PRELIMINARY INQUIRY: The Committee shall promptly commence a preliminary inquiry whenever it has received a sworn complaint, or other allegation of, or information about, alleged misconduct or violations pursuant to Rule 2. (c) SCOPE OF PRELIMINARY INQUIRY: (1) The preliminary inquiry shall be of such duration and scope as is necessary to determine whether there is substantial credible evidence which provides substantial cause for the Committee to conclude that a violation within the jurisdiction of the Committee has occurred. The Chairman and Vice Chairman, acting jointly, on behalf of the Committee may supervise and determine the appropriate duration, scope, and conduct of a preliminary inquiry. Whether a preliminary inquiry is conducted jointly by the Chairman and Vice Chairman or by the Committee as a whole, the day to day supervision of a preliminary inquiry rests with the Chairman and Vice Chairman, acting jointly. (2) A preliminary inquiry may include any inquiries, interviews, sworn statements, depositions, or subpoenas deemed appropriate to obtain information upon which to make any determination provided for by this Rule. (d) OPPORTUNITY FOR RESPONSE: A preliminary inquiry may include an opportunity for any known respondent or his or her designated representative to present either a written or oral statement, or to respond orally to questions from the Committee. Such an oral statement or answers shall be transcribed and signed by the person providing the statement or answers. (e) STATUS REPORTS: The Committee staff or outside counsel shall periodically report to the Committee in the form and according to the schedule prescribed by the Committee. The reports shall be confidential. (f) FINAL REPORT: When the preliminary inquiry is completed, the staff or outside counsel shall make a confidential report, oral or written, to the Committee on findings and recommendations, as appropriate. (g) COMMITTEE ACTION: As soon as practicable following submission of the report on the preliminary inquiry, the Committee shall determine by a recorded vote whether there is substantial credible evidence which provides substantial cause for the Committee to conclude that a violation within the jurisdiction of the Committee has occurred. The Committee may make any of the following determinations: (1) The Committee may determine that there is not such substantial credible evidence and, in such case, the Committee shall dismiss the matter. The Committee, or Chairman and Vice Chairman acting jointly on behalf of the Committee, may dismiss any matter which, after a preliminary inquiry, is determined to lack substantial merit. The Committee shall inform the complainant of the dismissal. (2) The Committee may determine that there is such substantial credible evidence, but that the alleged violation is inadvertent, technical, or otherwise of a de minimis nature. In such case, the Committee may dispose of the matter by issuing a public or private letter of admonition, which shall not be considered discipline and which shall not be subject to appeal to the Senate. The issuance of a letter of admonition must be approved by the affirmative recorded vote of no fewer than four members of the Committee voting. (3) The Committee may determine that there is such substantial credible evidence and that the matter cannot be appropriately disposed of under paragraph (2). In such case, the Committee shall promptly initiate an adjudicatory review in accordance with Rule 4. No adjudicatory review of conduct of a Member, officer, or employee of the Senate may be initiated except by the affirmative recorded vote of not less than four members of the Committee. RULE 4: PROCEDURES FOR CONDUCTING AN ADJUDICATORY REVIEW (a) DEFINITION OF ADJUDICATORY REVIEW: An ``adjudicatory review'' is a proceeding undertaken by the Committee after a finding, on the basis of a preliminary inquiry, that there is substantial cause for the Committee to conclude that a violation within the jurisdiction of the Committee has occurred. (b) SCOPE OF ADJUDICATORY REVIEW: When the Committee decides to conduct an adjudicatory review, it shall be of such duration and scope as is necessary for the Committee to determine whether a violation within its jurisdiction has occurred. An adjudicatory review shall be conducted by outside counsel as authorized by section 3(b)(1) of Senate Resolution 338 unless the Committee determines not to use outside counsel. In the course of the adjudicatory review, designated outside counsel, or if the Committee determines not to use outside counsel, the Committee or its staff, may conduct any inquiries or interviews, take sworn statements, use compulsory process as described in Rule 6, or take any other actions that the Committee deems appropriate to secure the evidence necessary to make a determination. (c) NOTICE TO RESPONDENT: The Committee shall give written notice to any known respondent who is the subject of an adjudicatory review. The notice shall be sent to the respondent no later than five working [[Page S1066]] days after the Committee has voted to conduct an adjudicatory review. The notice shall include a statement of the nature of the possible violation, and description of the evidence indicating that a possible violation occurred. The Committee may offer the respondent an opportunity to present a statement, orally or in writing, or to respond to questions from members of the Committee, the Committee staff, or outside counsel. (d) RIGHT TO A HEARING: The Committee shall accord a respondent an opportunity for a hearing before it recommends disciplinary action against that respondent to the Senate or before it imposes an order of restitution or reprimand (not requiring discipline by the full Senate). (e) PROGRESS REPORTS TO COMMITTEE: The Committee staff or outside counsel shall periodically report to the Committee concerning the progress of the adjudicatory review. Such reports shall be delivered to the Committee in the form and according to the schedule prescribed by the Committee, and shall be confidential. (f) FINAL REPORT OF ADJUDICATORY REVIEW TO COMMITTEE: Upon completion of an adjudicatory review, including any hearings held pursuant to Rule 5, the outside counsel or the staff shall submit a confidential written report to the Committee, which shall detail the factual findings of the adjudicatory review and which may recommend disciplinary action, if appropriate. Findings of fact of the adjudicatory review shall be detailed in this report whether or not disciplinary action is recommended. (g) COMMITTEE ACTION: (1) As soon as practicable following submission of the report of the staff or outside counsel on the adjudicatory review, the Committee shall prepare and submit a report to the Senate, including a recommendation or proposed resolution to the Senate concerning disciplinary action, if appropriate. A report shall be issued, stating in detail the Committee's findings of fact, whether or not disciplinary action is recommended. The report shall also explain fully the reasons underlying the Committee's recommendation concerning disciplinary action, if any. No adjudicatory review of conduct of a Member, officer or employee of the Senate may be conducted, or report or resolution or recommendation relating to such an adjudicatory review of conduct may be made, except by the affirmative recorded vote of not less than four members of the Committee. (2) Pursuant to S. Res. 338, as amended, section 2(a), subsections (2), (3), and (4), after receipt of the report prescribed by paragraph (f) of this rule, the Committee may make any of the following recommendations for disciplinary action or issue an order for reprimand or restitution, as follows: (i) In the case of a Member, a recommendation to the Senate for expulsion, censure, payment of restitution, recommendation to a Member's party conference regarding the Member's seniority or positions of responsibility, or a combination of these; (ii) In the case of an officer or employee, a recommendation to the Senate of dismissal, suspension, payment of restitution, or a combination of these; (iii) In the case where the Committee determines, after according to the Member, officer, or employee due notice and opportunity for a hearing, that misconduct occurred warranting discipline less serious than discipline by the full Senate, and subject to the provisions of paragraph (h) of this rule relating to appeal, by a unanimous vote of six members order that a Member, officer or employee be reprimanded or pay restitution or both; (iv) In the case where the Committee determines that misconduct is inadvertent, technical, or otherwise of a de minimis nature, issue a public or private letter of admonition to a Member, officer or employee, which shall not be subject to appeal to the Senate. (3) In the case where the Committee determines, upon consideration of all the evidence, that the facts do not warrant a finding that there is substantial credible evidence which provides substantial cause for the Committee to conclude that a violation within the jurisdiction of the Committee has occurred, the Committee may dismiss the matter. (4) Promptly, after the conclusion of the adjudicatory review, the Committee's report and recommendation, if any, shall be forwarded to the Secretary of the Senate, and a copy shall be provided to the complainant and the respondent. The full report and recommendation, if any, shall be printed and made public, unless the Committee determines by the recorded vote of not less than four members of the Committee that it should remain confidential. (h) RIGHT OF APPEAL: (1) Any individual who is the subject of a reprimand or order of restitution, or both, pursuant to subsection (g)(2)(iii), may, within 30 days of the Committee's report to the Senate of its action imposing a reprimand or order of restitution, or both, appeal to the Senate by providing written notice of the appeal to the Committee and the presiding officer of the Senate. The presiding officer shall cause the notice of the appeal to be printed in the Congressional Record and the Senate Journal. (2) S. Res. 338 provides that a motion to proceed to consideration of an appeal pursuant to paragraph (1) shall be highly privileged and not debatable. If the motion to proceed to consideration of the appeal is agreed to, the appeal shall be decided on the basis of the Committee's report to the Senate. Debate on the appeal shall be limited to 10 hours, which shall be divided equally between, and controlled by, those favoring and those opposing the appeal. RULE 5: PROCEDURES FOR HEARINGS (a) RIGHT TO HEARING: The Committee may hold a public or executive hearing in any preliminary inquiry, adjudicatory review, or other proceeding. The Committee shall accord a respondent an opportunity for a hearing before it recommends disciplinary action against that respondent to the Senate or before it imposes an order of restitution or reprimand.

(d) (1) When the Select Committee receives a sworn complaint or other allegation or information about a Member, officer, or employee of the Senate, it shall promptly conduct a preliminary inquiry into matters raised by that complaint, allegation, or information. The preliminary inquiry shall be of duration and scope necessary to determine whether there is substantial credible evidence which provides substantial cause for the Select Committee to conclude that a violation within the jurisdiction of the Select Committee has occurred. The Select Committee may delegate to the chairman and vice chairman the discretion to determine the appropriate duration, scope, and conduct of a preliminary inquiry. (2) If, as a result of a preliminary inquiry under paragraph (1), the Select Committee determines by a recorded vote that there is not such substantial credible evidence, the Select Committee shall dismiss the matter.

The Select Committee shall inform the individual who provided to the Select Committee the complaint, allegation, or information, and the individual who is the subject of the complaint, allegation, or information, of the dismissal, together with an explanation of the basis for the dismissal. (3) If, as a result of a preliminary inquiry under paragraph (1), the Select Committee determines that a violation is inadvertent, technical, or otherwise of a de minimis nature, the Select Committee may dispose of the matter by issuing a public or private letter of admonition, which shall not be considered discipline. The Select Committee may issue a public letter of admonition upon a similar determination at the conclusion of an adjudicatory review. (4) If, as a result of a preliminary inquiry under paragraph (1), the Select Committee determines that there is such substantial credible evidence and the matter cannot be appropriately disposed of under paragraph (3), the Select Committee shall promptly initiate an adjudicatory review. Upon the conclusion of such adjudicatory review, the Select Committee shall report to the Senate, as soon as practicable, the results of such adjudicatory review, together with its recommendations (if any) pursuant to subsection (a)(2). (e) (1) Any individual who is the subject of a reprimand or order of restitution, or both, pursuant to subsection (a)(3) may, within 30 days of the Select Committee's report to the Senate of its action imposing a reprimand or order of restitution, or both, appeal to the Senate by providing written notice of the basis for the appeal to the Select Committee and the presiding officer of the Senate.

(f) The Select Committee may, in its discretion, employ hearing examiners to hear testimony and make findings of fact and/or recommendations to the Select Committee concerning the disposition of complaints. (g) Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, no adjudicatory review shall be initiated of any alleged violation of any law, the Senate Code of Official Conduct, rule, or regulation which was not in effect at the time the alleged violation occurred. No provisions of the Senate Code of Official Conduct shall apply to or require disclosure of any act, relationship, or transaction which occurred prior to the effective date of the applicable provision of the Code. The Select Committee may initiate an adjudicatory review of any alleged violation of a rule or law which was in effect prior to the enactment of the Senate Code of Official Conduct if the alleged violation occurred while such rule or law was in effect and the violation was not a matter resolved on the merits by the predecessor Select Committee.

RULE 3: PROCEDURES FOR CONDUCTING A PRELIMINARY INQUIRY (a) DEFINITION OF PRELIMINARY INQUIRY: A ``preliminary inquiry'' is a proceeding undertaken by the Committee following the receipt of a complaint or allegation of, or information about, misconduct by a Member, officer, or employee of the Senate to determine whether there is substantial credible evidence which provides substantial cause for the Committee to conclude that a violation within the jurisdiction of the Committee has occurred. (b) BASIS FOR PRELIMINARY INQUIRY: The Committee shall promptly commence a preliminary inquiry whenever it has received a sworn complaint, or other allegation of, or information about, alleged misconduct or violations pursuant to Rule 2. (c) SCOPE OF PRELIMINARY INQUIRY: (1) The preliminary inquiry shall be of such duration and scope as is necessary to determine whether there is substantial credible evidence which provides substantial cause for the Committee to conclude that a violation within the jurisdiction of the Committee has occurred. The Chairman and Vice Chairman, acting jointly, on behalf of the Committee may supervise and determine the appropriate duration, scope, and conduct of a preliminary inquiry. Whether a preliminary inquiry is conducted jointly by the Chairman and Vice Chairman or by the Committee as a whole, the day to day supervision of a preliminary inquiry rests with the Chairman and Vice Chairman, acting jointly. (2) A preliminary inquiry may include any inquiries, interviews, sworn statements, depositions, or subpoenas deemed appropriate to obtain information upon which to make any determination provided for by this Rule. (d) OPPORTUNITY FOR RESPONSE: A preliminary inquiry may include an opportunity for any known respondent or his or her designated representative to present either a written or oral statement, or to respond orally to questions from the Committee. Such an oral statement or answers shall be transcribed and signed by the person providing the statement or answers. (e) STATUS REPORTS: The Committee staff or outside counsel shall periodically report to the Committee in the form and according to the schedule prescribed by the Committee. The reports shall be confidential. (f) FINAL REPORT: When the preliminary inquiry is completed, the staff or outside counsel shall make a confidential report, oral or written, to the Committee on findings and recommendations, as appropriate. (g) COMMITTEE ACTION: As soon as practicable following submission of the report on the preliminary inquiry, the Committee shall determine by a recorded vote whether there is substantial credible evidence which provides substantial cause for the Committee to conclude that a violation within the jurisdiction of the Committee has occurred. The Committee may make any of the following determinations: (1) The Committee may determine that there is not such substantial credible evidence and, in such case, the Committee shall dismiss the matter. The Committee, or Chairman and Vice Chairman acting jointly on behalf of the Committee, may dismiss any matter which, after a preliminary inquiry, is determined to lack substantial merit. The Committee shall inform the complainant of the dismissal. (2) The Committee may determine that there is such substantial credible evidence, but that the alleged violation is inadvertent, technical, or otherwise of a de minimis nature. In such case, the Committee may dispose of the matter by issuing a public or private letter of admonition, which shall not be considered discipline and which shall not be subject to appeal to the Senate. The issuance of a letter of admonition must be approved by the affirmative recorded vote of no fewer than four members of the Committee voting. (3) The Committee may determine that there is such substantial credible evidence and that the matter cannot be appropriately disposed of under paragraph (2). In such case, the Committee shall promptly initiate an adjudicatory review in accordance with Rule 4. No adjudicatory review of conduct of a Member, officer, or employee of the Senate may be initiated except by the affirmative recorded vote of not less than four members of the Committee. RULE 4: PROCEDURES FOR CONDUCTING AN ADJUDICATORY REVIEW (a) DEFINITION OF ADJUDICATORY REVIEW: An ``adjudicatory review'' is a proceeding undertaken by the Committee after a finding, on the basis of a preliminary inquiry, that there is substantial cause for the Committee to conclude that a violation within the jurisdiction of the Committee has occurred. (b) SCOPE OF ADJUDICATORY REVIEW: When the Committee decides to conduct an adjudicatory review, it shall be of such duration and scope as is necessary for the Committee to determine whether a violation within its jurisdiction has occurred. An adjudicatory review shall be conducted by outside counsel as authorized by section 3(b)(1) of Senate Resolution 338 unless the Committee determines not to use outside counsel. In the course of the adjudicatory review, designated outside counsel, or if the Committee determines not to use outside counsel, the Committee or its staff, may conduct any inquiries or interviews, take sworn statements, use compulsory process as described in Rule 6, or take any other actions that the Committee deems appropriate to secure the evidence necessary to make a determination. (c) NOTICE TO RESPONDENT: The Committee shall give written notice to any known respondent who is the subject of an adjudicatory review. The notice shall be sent to the respondent no later than five working [[Page S1066]] days after the Committee has voted to conduct an adjudicatory review. The notice shall include a statement of the nature of the possible violation, and description of the evidence indicating that a possible violation occurred. The Committee may offer the respondent an opportunity to present a statement, orally or in writing, or to respond to questions from members of the Committee, the Committee staff, or outside counsel. (d) RIGHT TO A HEARING: The Committee shall accord a respondent an opportunity for a hearing before it recommends disciplinary action against that respondent to the Senate or before it imposes an order of restitution or reprimand (not requiring discipline by the full Senate). (e) PROGRESS REPORTS TO COMMITTEE: The Committee staff or outside counsel shall periodically report to the Committee concerning the progress of the adjudicatory review. Such reports shall be delivered to the Committee in the form and according to the schedule prescribed by the Committee, and shall be confidential. (f) FINAL REPORT OF ADJUDICATORY REVIEW TO COMMITTEE: Upon completion of an adjudicatory review, including any hearings held pursuant to Rule 5, the outside counsel or the staff shall submit a confidential written report to the Committee, which shall detail the factual findings of the adjudicatory review and which may recommend disciplinary action, if appropriate. Findings of fact of the adjudicatory review shall be detailed in this report whether or not disciplinary action is recommended. (g) COMMITTEE ACTION: (1) As soon as practicable following submission of the report of the staff or outside counsel on the adjudicatory review, the Committee shall prepare and submit a report to the Senate, including a recommendation or proposed resolution to the Senate concerning disciplinary action, if appropriate. A report shall be issued, stating in detail the Committee's findings of fact, whether or not disciplinary action is recommended. The report shall also explain fully the reasons underlying the Committee's recommendation concerning disciplinary action, if any. No adjudicatory review of conduct of a Member, officer or employee of the Senate may be conducted, or report or resolution or recommendation relating to such an adjudicatory review of conduct may be made, except by the affirmative recorded vote of not less than four members of the Committee. (2) Pursuant to S. Res. 338, as amended, section 2(a), subsections (2), (3), and (4), after receipt of the report prescribed by paragraph (f) of this rule, the Committee may make any of the following recommendations for disciplinary action or issue an order for reprimand or restitution, as follows: (i) In the case of a Member, a recommendation to the Senate for expulsion, censure, payment of restitution, recommendation to a Member's party conference regarding the Member's seniority or positions of responsibility, or a combination of these; (ii) In the case of an officer or employee, a recommendation to the Senate of dismissal, suspension, payment of restitution, or a combination of these; (iii) In the case where the Committee determines, after according to the Member, officer, or employee due notice and opportunity for a hearing, that misconduct occurred warranting discipline less serious than discipline by the full Senate, and subject to the provisions of paragraph (h) of this rule relating to appeal, by a unanimous vote of six members order that a Member, officer or employee be reprimanded or pay restitution or both; (iv) In the case where the Committee determines that misconduct is inadvertent, technical, or otherwise of a de minimis nature, issue a public or private letter of admonition to a Member, officer or employee, which shall not be subject to appeal to the Senate. (3) In the case where the Committee determines, upon consideration of all the evidence, that the facts do not warrant a finding that there is substantial credible evidence which provides substantial cause for the Committee to conclude that a violation within the jurisdiction of the Committee has occurred, the Committee may dismiss the matter. (4) Promptly, after the conclusion of the adjudicatory review, the Committee's report and recommendation, if any, shall be forwarded to the Secretary of the Senate, and a copy shall be provided to the complainant and the respondent. The full report and recommendation, if any, shall be printed and made public, unless the Committee determines by the recorded vote of not less than four members of the Committee that it should remain confidential. (h) RIGHT OF APPEAL: (1) Any individual who is the subject of a reprimand or order of restitution, or both, pursuant to subsection (g)(2)(iii), may, within 30 days of the Committee's report to the Senate of its action imposing a reprimand or order of restitution, or both, appeal to the Senate by providing written notice of the appeal to the Committee and the presiding officer of the Senate. The presiding officer shall cause the notice of the appeal to be printed in the Congressional Record and the Senate Journal. (2) S. Res. 338 provides that a motion to proceed to consideration of an appeal pursuant to paragraph (1) shall be highly privileged and not debatable. If the motion to proceed to consideration of the appeal is agreed to, the appeal shall be decided on the basis of the Committee's report to the Senate. Debate on the appeal shall be limited to 10 hours, which shall be divided equally between, and controlled by, those favoring and those opposing the appeal. RULE 5: PROCEDURES FOR HEARINGS (a) RIGHT TO HEARING: The Committee may hold a public or executive hearing in any preliminary inquiry, adjudicatory review, or other proceeding. The Committee shall accord a respondent an opportunity for a hearing before it recommends disciplinary action against that respondent to the Senate or before it imposes an order of restitution or reprimand. (See Rule 4(d).)

(d) (1) When the Select Committee receives a sworn complaint or other allegation or information about a Member, officer, or employee of the Senate, it shall promptly conduct a preliminary inquiry into matters raised by that complaint, allegation, or information. The preliminary inquiry shall be of duration and scope necessary to determine whether there is substantial credible evidence which provides substantial cause for the Select Committee to conclude that a violation within the jurisdiction of the Select Committee has occurred. The Select Committee may delegate to the chairman and vice chairman the discretion to determine the appropriate duration, scope, and conduct of a preliminary inquiry. (2) If, as a result of a preliminary inquiry under paragraph (1), the Select Committee determines by a recorded vote that there is not such substantial credible evidence, the Select Committee shall dismiss the matter.

(3) If, as a result of a preliminary inquiry under paragraph (1), the Select Committee determines that a violation is inadvertent, technical, or otherwise of a de minimis nature, the Select Committee may dispose of the matter by issuing a public or private letter of admonition, which shall not be considered discipline. The Select Committee may issue a public letter of admonition upon a similar determination at the conclusion of an adjudicatory review. (4) If, as a result of a preliminary inquiry under paragraph (1), the Select Committee determines that there is such substantial credible evidence and the matter cannot be appropriately disposed of under paragraph (3), the Select Committee shall promptly initiate an adjudicatory review. Upon the conclusion of such adjudicatory review, the Select Committee shall report to the Senate, as soon as practicable, the results of such adjudicatory review, together with its recommendations (if any) pursuant to subsection (a)(2). (e) (1) Any individual who is the subject of a reprimand or order of restitution, or both, pursuant to subsection (a)(3) may, within 30 days of the Select Committee's report to the Senate of its action imposing a reprimand or order of restitution, or both, appeal to the Senate by providing written notice of the basis for the appeal to the Select Committee and the presiding officer of the Senate.

(f) The Select Committee may, in its discretion, employ hearing examiners to hear testimony and make findings of fact and/or recommendations to the Select Committee concerning the disposition of complaints. (g) Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, no adjudicatory review shall be initiated of any alleged violation of any law, the Senate Code of Official Conduct, rule, or regulation which was not in effect at the time the alleged violation occurred. No provisions of the Senate Code of Official Conduct shall apply to or require disclosure of any act, relationship, or transaction which occurred prior to the effective date of the applicable provision of the Code. The Select Committee may initiate an adjudicatory review of any alleged violation of a rule or law which was in effect prior to the enactment of the Senate Code of Official Conduct if the alleged violation occurred while such rule or law was in effect and the violation was not a matter resolved on the merits by the predecessor Select Committee.

RULE 3: PROCEDURES FOR CONDUCTING A PRELIMINARY INQUIRY (a) DEFINITION OF PRELIMINARY INQUIRY: A ``preliminary inquiry'' is a proceeding undertaken by the Committee following the receipt of a complaint or allegation of, or information about, misconduct by a Member, officer, or employee of the Senate to determine whether there is substantial credible evidence which provides substantial cause for the Committee to conclude that a violation within the jurisdiction of the Committee has occurred. (b) BASIS FOR PRELIMINARY INQUIRY: The Committee shall promptly commence a preliminary inquiry whenever it has received a sworn complaint, or other allegation of, or information about, alleged misconduct or violations pursuant to Rule 2. (c) SCOPE OF PRELIMINARY INQUIRY: (1) The preliminary inquiry shall be of such duration and scope as is necessary to determine whether there is substantial credible evidence which provides substantial cause for the Committee to conclude that a violation within the jurisdiction of the Committee has occurred. The Chairman and Vice Chairman, acting jointly, on behalf of the Committee may supervise and determine the appropriate duration, scope, and conduct of a preliminary inquiry. Whether a preliminary inquiry is conducted jointly by the Chairman and Vice Chairman or by the Committee as a whole, the day to day supervision of a preliminary inquiry rests with the Chairman and Vice Chairman, acting jointly. (2) A preliminary inquiry may include any inquiries, interviews, sworn statements, depositions, or subpoenas deemed appropriate to obtain information upon which to make any determination provided for by this Rule. (d) OPPORTUNITY FOR RESPONSE: A preliminary inquiry may include an opportunity for any known respondent or his or her designated representative to present either a written or oral statement, or to respond orally to questions from the Committee. Such an oral statement or answers shall be transcribed and signed by the person providing the statement or answers. (e) STATUS REPORTS: The Committee staff or outside counsel shall periodically report to the Committee in the form and according to the schedule prescribed by the Committee. The reports shall be confidential. (f) FINAL REPORT: When the preliminary inquiry is completed, the staff or outside counsel shall make a confidential report, oral or written, to the Committee on findings and recommendations, as appropriate. (g) COMMITTEE ACTION: As soon as practicable following submission of the report on the preliminary inquiry, the Committee shall determine by a recorded vote whether there is substantial credible evidence which provides substantial cause for the Committee to conclude that a violation within the jurisdiction of the Committee has occurred. The Committee may make any of the following determinations: (1) The Committee may determine that there is not such substantial credible evidence and, in such case, the Committee shall dismiss the matter. The Committee, or Chairman and Vice Chairman acting jointly on behalf of the Committee, may dismiss any matter which, after a preliminary inquiry, is determined to lack substantial merit. The Committee shall inform the complainant of the dismissal. (2) The Committee may determine that there is such substantial credible evidence, but that the alleged violation is inadvertent, technical, or otherwise of a de minimis nature. In such case, the Committee may dispose of the matter by issuing a public or private letter of admonition, which shall not be considered discipline and which shall not be subject to appeal to the Senate. The issuance of a letter of admonition must be approved by the affirmative recorded vote of no fewer than four members of the Committee voting. (3) The Committee may determine that there is such substantial credible evidence and that the matter cannot be appropriately disposed of under paragraph (2). In such case, the Committee shall promptly initiate an adjudicatory review in accordance with Rule 4. No adjudicatory review of conduct of a Member, officer, or employee of the Senate may be initiated except by the affirmative recorded vote of not less than four members of the Committee. RULE 4: PROCEDURES FOR CONDUCTING AN ADJUDICATORY REVIEW (a) DEFINITION OF ADJUDICATORY REVIEW: An ``adjudicatory review'' is a proceeding undertaken by the Committee after a finding, on the basis of a preliminary inquiry, that there is substantial cause for the Committee to conclude that a violation within the jurisdiction of the Committee has occurred. (b) SCOPE OF ADJUDICATORY REVIEW: When the Committee decides to conduct an adjudicatory review, it shall be of such duration and scope as is necessary for the Committee to determine whether a violation within its jurisdiction has occurred. An adjudicatory review shall be conducted by outside counsel as authorized by section 3(b)(1) of Senate Resolution 338 unless the Committee determines not to use outside counsel. In the course of the adjudicatory review, designated outside counsel, or if the Committee determines not to use outside counsel, the Committee or its staff, may conduct any inquiries or interviews, take sworn statements, use compulsory process as described in Rule 6, or take any other actions that the Committee deems appropriate to secure the evidence necessary to make a determination. (c) NOTICE TO RESPONDENT: The Committee shall give written notice to any known respondent who is the subject of an adjudicatory review. The notice shall be sent to the respondent no later than five working [[Page S1066]] days after the Committee has voted to conduct an adjudicatory review. The notice shall include a statement of the nature of the possible violation, and description of the evidence indicating that a possible violation occurred. The Committee may offer the respondent an opportunity to present a statement, orally or in writing, or to respond to questions from members of the Committee, the Committee staff, or outside counsel. (d) RIGHT TO A HEARING: The Committee shall accord a respondent an opportunity for a hearing before it recommends disciplinary action against that respondent to the Senate or before it imposes an order of restitution or reprimand (not requiring discipline by the full Senate). (e) PROGRESS REPORTS TO COMMITTEE: The Committee staff or outside counsel shall periodically report to the Committee concerning the progress of the adjudicatory review. Such reports shall be delivered to the Committee in the form and according to the schedule prescribed by the Committee, and shall be confidential. (f) FINAL REPORT OF ADJUDICATORY REVIEW TO COMMITTEE: Upon completion of an adjudicatory review, including any hearings held pursuant to Rule 5, the outside counsel or the staff shall submit a confidential written report to the Committee, which shall detail the factual findings of the adjudicatory review and which may recommend disciplinary action, if appropriate. Findings of fact of the adjudicatory review shall be detailed in this report whether or not disciplinary action is recommended. (g) COMMITTEE ACTION: (1) As soon as practicable following submission of the report of the staff or outside counsel on the adjudicatory review, the Committee shall prepare and submit a report to the Senate, including a recommendation or proposed resolution to the Senate concerning disciplinary action, if appropriate. A report shall be issued, stating in detail the Committee's findings of fact, whether or not disciplinary action is recommended. The report shall also explain fully the reasons underlying the Committee's recommendation concerning disciplinary action, if any. No adjudicatory review of conduct of a Member, officer or employee of the Senate may be conducted, or report or resolution or recommendation relating to such an adjudicatory review of conduct may be made, except by the affirmative recorded vote of not less than four members of the Committee. (2) Pursuant to S. Res. 338, as amended, section 2(a), subsections (2), (3), and (4), after receipt of the report prescribed by paragraph (f) of this rule, the Committee may make any of the following recommendations for disciplinary action or issue an order for reprimand or restitution, as follows: (i) In the case of a Member, a recommendation to the Senate for expulsion, censure, payment of restitution, recommendation to a Member's party conference regarding the Member's seniority or positions of responsibility, or a combination of these; (ii) In the case of an officer or employee, a recommendation to the Senate of dismissal, suspension, payment of restitution, or a combination of these; (iii) In the case where the Committee determines, after according to the Member, officer, or employee due notice and opportunity for a hearing, that misconduct occurred warranting discipline less serious than discipline by the full Senate, and subject to the provisions of paragraph (h) of this rule relating to appeal, by a unanimous vote of six members order that a Member, officer or employee be reprimanded or pay restitution or both; (iv) In the case where the Committee determines that misconduct is inadvertent, technical, or otherwise of a de minimis nature, issue a public or private letter of admonition to a Member, officer or employee, which shall not be subject to appeal to the Senate. (3) In the case where the Committee determines, upon consideration of all the evidence, that the facts do not warrant a finding that there is substantial credible evidence which provides substantial cause for the Committee to conclude that a violation within the jurisdiction of the Committee has occurred, the Committee may dismiss the matter. (4) Promptly, after the conclusion of the adjudicatory review, the Committee's report and recommendation, if any, shall be forwarded to the Secretary of the Senate, and a copy shall be provided to the complainant and the respondent. The full report and recommendation, if any, shall be printed and made public, unless the Committee determines by the recorded vote of not less than four members of the Committee that it should remain confidential. (h) RIGHT OF APPEAL: (1) Any individual who is the subject of a reprimand or order of restitution, or both, pursuant to subsection (g)(2)(iii), may, within 30 days of the Committee's report to the Senate of its action imposing a reprimand or order of restitution, or both, appeal to the Senate by providing written notice of the appeal to the Committee and the presiding officer of the Senate. The presiding officer shall cause the notice of the appeal to be printed in the Congressional Record and the Senate Journal. (2) S. Res. 338 provides that a motion to proceed to consideration of an appeal pursuant to paragraph (1) shall be highly privileged and not debatable. If the motion to proceed to consideration of the appeal is agreed to, the appeal shall be decided on the basis of the Committee's report to the Senate. Debate on the appeal shall be limited to 10 hours, which shall be divided equally between, and controlled by, those favoring and those opposing the appeal. RULE 5: PROCEDURES FOR HEARINGS (a) RIGHT TO HEARING: The Committee may hold a public or executive hearing in any preliminary inquiry, adjudicatory review, or other proceeding. The Committee shall accord a respondent an opportunity for a hearing before it recommends disciplinary action against that respondent to the Senate or before it imposes an order of restitution or reprimand. (See Rule 4(d).) (b) NON-PUBLIC HEARINGS: The Committee may at any time during a hearing determine in accordance with paragraph 5(b) of Rule XXVI of the Standing Rules of the Senate whether to receive the testimony of specific witnesses in executive session.

Mr. President, this month marks another important anniversary for many Bahrainis. Four years ago, more than a 100,000 people took to the streets of Manama, camping out at Pearl Roundabout and peacefully protesting their lack of access to Bahrain's political system and their government's abuse of basic human rights. Bahrain's rulers responded to these calls for reform as authoritarian regimes so often do: with force. In the years since, an estimated 3,000 Bahrainis have been arrested, more than 150 protestors have been killed and more than 100 people have had their citizenship revoked. Indeed, the Bahraini regime continues to go to great lengths to stifle peaceful protest and quell any dissent by closing down media outlets and filling up already overcrowded prisons with political prisoners and human rights defenders. While many Bahrainis feel their struggle has been forgotten by the world, I want them to know that it will not go unremembered or unmarked here in the U.S. Senate. The regime continues to go to great lengths to convince the world that it is making progress but I am sad to report that I cannot share that conclusion. Not while the regime refuses to permit a visit by Juan Mendez, the U.N.'s top torture investigator. Not while opposition leaders sit in Bahraini jails. And not while the State Department's last Human Rights Report lists abuses that include ``restrictions on civil liberties,'' ``arbitrary deprivation of life,'' and ``arrest and detention of protesters on vague charges, in some cases leading to their torture in detention.'' Four years after the peaceful protests began, Bahrain's rulers continue to commit human rights violations while taking only superficial steps toward a meaningful political solution. As a result, several attempts to conclude a national dialogue among Bahrain's interests and parties have only resulted in stalemate. Unsurprisingly, the regime cracked down on the largest political opposition bloc in the lead-up to the November 2014 elections, resulting in a large-scale boycott of the election by voters. The regime arrested a senior opposition leader 1 month later, an action that the State Department warned ``will only inflame tensions'' and further dampen potential for a renewed political dialogue. The regime responded not by releasing that leader, but by doubling down and moving to criminalize the political party he leads. On this somber anniversary, I want to take the occasion to urge the Bahraini regime to implement true and meaningful reforms, to cease the use of violence and repression against peaceful protesters, and to engage in credible dialogue about the future of Bahrain. To be clear, my aim is not to dictate to Bahrain's rulers what their government ought to look like; indeed, those decisions can only be made by the people of Bahrain. But Bahrain has long been an ally of the United States, and I believe this country has an obligation to hold friends to a higher standard. To those who will say that human rights abuses are bad but that stability and cooperation in the region must come before such concerns, I say that you are offering a false choice. I worry there will come a day when peaceful protesters, seeing no hope for redress, ask themselves if they, too, should not resort to violence. Indeed, the prospect of further violence and instability--or full-blown civil war-- could have a profound impact on regional security and on the thousands of United States military personnel stationed in Bahrain. That is why I will continue coming down to this floor on this sad anniversary and keep using my voice in this body to raise awareness of this important issue. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 31 (Tuesday, February 24, 2015)] [Senate] [Page S1071] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] BAHRAIN Mr. WYDEN.

Today I wish to honor Delaware County's Janet Murnaghan, who will be receiving the Women of Achievement Award from the Delaware County Women's Commission on March 11. Mrs. Murnaghan was chosen as an awardee for representing women of Delaware County in an extraordinary way, specifically by displaying incredible thoughtfulness, persistence and passion in caring for her daughter, Sarah. It was my privilege to nominate Janet for this accolade in celebration of Women's History Month. Janet, her husband, Fran, and I first met 2 years ago at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia. Their daughter was battling cystic fibrosis and was in dire need of new lungs to save her young life. Though their daughter, Sarah, would have likely ranked near the top of the donor list for a new lung because of her medical need, a Federal policy prevented children under the age of 12 from being considered for mature lungs until all adult candidates in the region were ruled out. Sarah faced long odds at receiving a lifesaving transplant due to the short supply of pediatric donors. This obstacle would not stop Janet and the Murnaghan family. Sarah's mother took the fight to social media, to national TV and eventually directly to then Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius. Janet argued that children under age 12 should be considered for adult lung transplants using the same criteria as adults as long as doctors demonstrated the operation's viability. The Murnaghan family was eventually forced to pursue legal action to prevent Secretary Sebelius from enforcing the under-12 rule. Even in the most difficult moments, Mrs. Murnaghan remained levelheaded and resilient. Her determination was rewarded as a Federal judge issued a temporary restraining order, allowing young Sarah to receive the lifesaving transplant. While the first set of lungs failed due to their poor quality, the second set was perfect. Sarah is now breathing on her own, bike riding with her siblings, and has already returned to school. Janet and Sarah could not declare victory just yet. Though there was success in Sarah's specific case, the rule preventing children from receiving adult lungs was still in place. Last summer, thanks to Janet Murnaghan and other advocates, the transplant network permanently revised the under-12 policy. Without Janet taking a leadership role on behalf of her daughter and children across the Nation, this policy might not have been changed. She has certainly set herself apart as a woman of achievement. On behalf of the Senate, I wish to extend my compliments to my friend, Janet Murnaghan, as she receives this much-deserved, prestigious award. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 31 (Tuesday, February 24, 2015)] [Senate] [Page S1072] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] CONGRATULATING JANET MURNAGHAN Mr. TOOMEY.

CREC-2015-02-24-pt1-PgS1071-3,CREC-2015-02-24,114,TRIBUTE TO ALYCIA FARRELL,"[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 31 (Tuesday, February 24, 2015)] [Senate] [Pages S1071-S1072] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] TRIBUTE TO ALYCIA FARRELL Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, it is sometimes said that the work of the staff is little noticed until something goes wrong. Today, I wish to make comments about a member of the staff of the Appropriations Committee for a different reason: the outstanding record of service to the Senate and the Nation by Alycia Farrell. [[Page S1072]] Alycia came to Washington, DC, to study at the Elliott School of International Affairs at the George Washington University. She joined the Senate Committee on Appropriations under the late chairman, Ted Stevens, in 2001. A year later, she was promoted to a professional staff member for the Subcommittee on Military Construction and in 2003 moved to the Subcommittee on Defense. Alycia's responsibilities on the Subcommittee on Defense for the last 12 years have been varied and complex. Her areas of expertise have included oversight of military health programs, where she has been instrumental in pushing for reforms to better serve the men and women in uniform and their families. She has tackled the most important issues in military health care over the last decade, including increasing funding for traumatic brain injury, suicide prevention, and implementing electronic health record systems for our veterans.

Today, I wish to make comments about a member of the staff of the Appropriations Committee for a different reason: the outstanding record of service to the Senate and the Nation by Alycia Farrell.

Domingo was one of these committed citizens. As a resident of Union City, Domingo chose to give back to his neighbors through the political process. He spent many hours organizing neighborhoods and people in support of issues he believed would make his city and State a better place for people to live and work. Domingo did the hard, behind-the-scenes job of organizing communities at the grassroots level. I am eternally grateful for the effort Domingo gave on my behalf; it is because of his loyal public service that I am able to do my work on behalf of the citizens of New Jersey today.

CREC-2015-02-24-pt1-PgS1076,CREC-2015-02-24,114,STATEMENTS ON INTRODUCED BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS,"[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 31 (Tuesday, February 24, 2015)] [Senate] [Pages S1076-S1078] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] STATEMENTS ON INTRODUCED BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS By Mr. CARDIN (for himself and Ms. Collins): S. 539. A bill to amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to repeal the Medicare outpatient rehabilitation therapy caps; to the Committee on Finance. Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I rise in support of the Medicare Access to Rehabilitation Services Act, which I am introducing today with my colleague Senator Collins. This important bill repeals the monetary caps that limit Medicare beneficiaries' access to medically necessary outpatient physical therapy, occupational therapy, and speech-language pathology services. Limits on outpatient rehabilitation therapy services under Medicare were first imposed in 1997 as part of the Balanced Budget Act. The decision to impose limits on these services was not based on data, quality-of-care concerns, or clinical judgment--its sole purpose was to limit spending in order to balance the federal budget. Since 1997, Congress has acted over 12 times to prevent the implementation of the therapy caps through moratoriums and an exceptions process. While these short-term actions have provided necessary relief to our seniors, a long-term solution is essential to bring permanent relief and much- needed stability for both patients and providers. We need a full repeal of the existing caps on physical therapy, occupational therapy, and speech-language pathology services. These annual financial caps limit services often needed after a stroke, traumatic brain injury, or spinal cord injury, or to effectively manage conditions such as Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis, and arthritis. Arbitrary caps on these vital Medicare outpatient therapy services are simply unacceptable. They also discriminate against the oldest and sickest Medicare beneficiaries, who typically require the most intensive therapy, and disadvantage Medicare beneficiaries who live in regions with higher health care costs. In a 2009 report issued by the Medicare Payment Advisory Committee, MEDPAC, it was estimated that the [[Page S1077]] therapy cap, if enforced without an exceptions process, could negatively impact 931,000 Medicare beneficiaries. Arbitrarily capping outpatient rehabilitation therapy services would likely cause some beneficiaries to delay necessary care, force others to assume higher out-of pocket costs, and disrupt the continuum of care for many seniors and individuals with disabilities. I urge my colleagues to join me and Senator Collins in supporting the Medicare Access to Rehabilitation Services Act to ensure that our seniors have access to the outpatient rehabilitation therapy services that they need. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record. There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows: S. 539 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. This Act may be cited as the ``Medicare Access to Rehabilitation Services Act of 2015''. SEC. 2. OUTPATIENT THERAPY CAP REPEAL. Section 1833 of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1395(l)) is amended by striking subsection (g). ______ By Ms. COLLINS (for herself and Ms. Heitkamp): S. 540. A bill to amend the Richard B. Russell National School Lunch Act to require the Secretary of Agriculture to make loan guarantees and grants to finance certain improvements to school lunch facilities, to train school food service personnel, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry. Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I am pleased today to join my friend and colleague from North Dakota, Senator Heitkamp, in introducing the School Food Modernization Act to assist schools in providing healthier meals to students throughout the country. School meals play a vital role in the lives of our young people. More than 30 million children participate in the National School Lunch Program every school day. In Maine, 40 percent of children qualify for free or reduced-price meals based on household income. The food served at schools to these children affects their health and well-being. Many children consume up to half their daily caloric intake at school. In fact, children often get their most nutritious meal of the day at school instead of at home. At the same time, too many of our children are at risk of serious disease. One-third of the children in this country are overweight or obese, which increases their risk for heart disease, high blood pressure, Type 2 Diabetes and other chronic diseases. These conditions may have a lifelong effect on their health as they grow to adulthood. In response to concerns about the health of our children, our schools have stepped up to the plate. Nationwide, schools are working diligently to meet the new U.S. Department of Agriculture standards and serve healthier meals. For example, in the New Sweden Consolidated School in Aroostook County, ME, food service manager Melanie Lagasse prepares meals from scratch instead of opening cans or pushing a defrost button. The school's 64 students, ranging from preschool to eighth grade, have grown to relish the chicken stew, baked fish, and meatloaf that she makes fresh. Many schools, however, lack the right tools for preparing meals rich in fresh ingredients and must rely on workarounds that are expensive, inefficient, and unsustainable. Schools built decades ago lack the tools and the infrastructure necessary beyond reheating and holding food for meal service. To serve healthier meals to their students, 99 percent of Maine school districts need at least one piece of equipment and almost half, 48 percent, of districts need kitchen infrastructure upgrades. The median equipment need per school is $45,000. Even more costly would be making the required changes to infrastructure. Forty-eight percent of Maine schools need some kind of infrastructure change to serve healthy meals. For example, 41 percent of schools need more physical space, 22 percent need more electrical capacity, 21 percent need more plumbing capacity, and 19 percent need more ventilation. Add the equipment costs together with the infrastructure costs and it is estimated that overall, $58.8 million would be needed just in Maine to serve healthy meals to all of our students. That far exceeds the $111,000 in grants that the USDA awarded Maine during the last two fiscal years for new equipment. Our bill authorizes loan guarantee assistance and grants for school equipment and infrastructure improvements, thereby helping food service personnel meet nutrition standards. First, it would establish a loan guarantee assistance program within USDA to help schools acquire new equipment to prepare and serve healthier, more nutritious meals to students. School administrators and other eligible borrowers could obtain Federal guarantees for 80 percent of the loan value needed to construct, remodel, or expand their kitchens, dining, or food storage infrastructure. Second, the bill would provide targeted grant assistance to give school administrators and food service directors the seed funding needed to upgrade kitchen infrastructure or to purchase high-quality, durable kitchen equipment such as commercial ovens, steamers, and stoves. Finally, to aid school food service personnel in meeting the nutrition guidelines, the legislation would strengthen training and provide technical assistance by authorizing USDA to provide support on a competitive basis to highly qualified third-party trainers to develop and administer training and technical assistance, including online programs. We need to start our school children off on the right food every day. If they are going to be able to learn and compete, they need to be healthy and their minds and bodies fully nourished. This bill will help us achieve that goal. ______ By Mrs. FEINSTEIN (for herself, Mr. Whitehouse, Mr. Schumer, Mr. Durbin, Mr. Blumenthal, Mrs. Boxer, Mr. Reed, Mr. Menendez, Mrs. Gillibrand, Mr. Murphy, Ms. Warren, and Mr. Markey): S. 551. A bill to increase public safety by permitting the Attorney General to deny the transfer of firearms or the issuance of firearms and explosives licenses to known or suspected dangerous terrorists; to the Committee on the Judiciary. Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today to address what I believe is a national security and public safety weakness. The United States currently has a system in place to keep known or suspected terrorists off of airplanes. But even though they can't fly, these very same terrorists can walk into any gun store anywhere in the country and purchase a firearm. If a terrorist is too dangerous to board an airplane, that same individual is too dangerous to possess a gun. That's why we are introducing the Denying Firearms and Explosives to Dangerous Terrorists Act, a bill to fix this glaring loophole in our background check system. This is not a hypothetical issue. Individuals with links to terrorism regularly purchase guns in the United States. According to data just received from the Government Accountability Office, between February 2004 and December 2014, there were at least 2,233 cases in which a known or suspected terrorist--individuals who at the time were on federal terrorist watch lists--tried to buy a firearm or obtain a firearm or explosives license or permit. In 91 percent of these cases, a total of 2,043 separate occasions, those known or suspected terrorists successfully passed a background check. The Kouachi brothers, the terrorists who killed 12 people at Charlie Hebdo in Paris, are reportedly on the U.S. no fly list. However, if they had made it to the United States, the fact that they were on terrorist watch lists would have done nothing to prevent them from legally buying firearms or explosives. One of the alleged Boston Marathon bombers, Tamerlan Tsarnaev, was reportedly placed on two terrorist watch lists in 2011. He later killed three and injured 170 with homemade explosives and killed a police officer with a handgun. [[Page S1078]] In 2009, Abdulhakim Mujahid Muhammad opened fire at a military recruiting station in Little Rock, Arkansas. He killed one and critically injured another. According to press reports, Muhammad had been under investigation by the FBI for suspected links to terrorism after traveling to Yemen, where he was arrested for using a Somali passport. Those actions certainly would have placed him on terrorist watch lists, but would not have kept him from buying firearms. The bill that we are introducing today is very simple. It would close this dangerous loophole by giving the Attorney General discretion to prevent someone from buying explosives or a gun if that individual is a known or suspected terrorist and may use the firearm in connection with terrorism. It would also give the Attorney General discretion to prevent someone from obtaining a license to sell guns or explosives if that individual is a known or suspected terrorist and may use the firearm in connection with terrorism. The Attorney General could use a range of tools to make this decision, most notable terrorist watch lists and the no fly list. In addition to making the decision at the discretion of the Attorney General, the bill includes other safeguards to make sure innocent individuals are not denied the ability to buy firearms or explosives. The first safeguard is that very high standards already exist for an individual to be designated as a known or suspected terrorist. The FBI or the National Counterterrorism Center must nominate the individual to be included in the Terrorist Screening Database. There must be sufficient identifying data about the person to ensure they can be accurately matched with the terrorist on the watch list. The circumstances must meet the ``reasonable suspicion'' standard. This means the facts of the case must be strong enough to reasonably determine the person is known or suspected to be engaged in terrorism. The second safeguard is that every provision in current law allowing individuals to appeal the denial of a firearm or explosive purchase will also apply to this bill. The office within the FBI that handles the background check system, known as the NICS Section, or the National Instant Criminal Background Check System Section, must provide the reason for denial upon request. Individuals then have the right to correct any inaccurate records in the background check system. If a purchase is still denied, individuals can take the Justice Department to court to overturn the decision. Gun safety safety bills are often labeled as Democratic bills. That is not the case here. This bill was first proposed by the Justice Department under President George W. Bush, who recognized that keeping guns away from terrorists is good policy. Attorney General Holder has also testified that the Justice Department under President Obama continues to support this proposal. The bill has also been endorsed by Everytown for Gun Safety. This group represents more than 1,000 current and former mayors, both Republican and Democrat. The legislation has also been endorsed by the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence, the Violence Policy Center, Americans for Responsible Solutions, and the Coalition to Stop Gun Violence. I would also like to thank the bill's cosponsors: Senators Whitehouse, Schumer, Durbin, Blumenthal, Boxer, Reed, Menendez, Gillibrand, Murphy, Warren, and Markey. All of you are champions for stronger gun safety laws. The terrorist attack in Paris should be a wake-up call for everyone. This sort of terrorist attack is very possible here in the United States, and the ability for known and suspected terrorists to buy guns and explosives makes it even more likely. Congress should close this loophole in our background check system and ensure that known and suspected terrorists can't easily gain access to these weapons. I urge my colleagues to support this bill. ______ By Mr. RISCH (for himself, Mr. Cardin, Ms. Ayotte, and Mrs. Shaheen): S. 552. A bill to amend the Small Business Investment Act of 1958 to provide for increased limitations on leverage for multiple licenses under common control; to the Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship. Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I am pleased join my colleague, Senator Risch, in introducing the Small Business Investment Company Capital, SBIC, Act of 2015. And I am pleased that Congressman Chabot, Chairman of the House Small Business Committee, is introducing the same bill on the House side today. This bipartisan legislation makes a common-sense change to the Small Business Investment Company, SBIC, program run by the Small Business Administration, SBA. This change will provide increased support to some of the program's most successful participants, SBICs that run multiple funds at a time. At no additional cost to the taxpayer, the SBIC Act will raise the limit that a ``family of funds'' can borrow with an SBA guarantee from $225 million to $350 million The SBIC program guarantees loans to qualified investment funds, or SBICs. In turn, these SBICs invest in promising small businesses by combining the SBA loan with privately raised capital, often at a 2:1 ratio. It is important to note that while these SBICs are licensed and regulated by the SBA, they are privately owned and operated. Since its inception, the SBIC Debenture program has been incredibly successful. SBICs have invested more than $70 billion in nearly 170,000 small businesses. Recently, the program has experienced rapid growth. In 2013, SBA guaranteed loans to SBICs equaling $3.5 billion, a 70 percent increase in financing dollars from three years ago and the highest amount of financings in the past decade. This success is largely attributed to Congressional action that raised the ceiling for maximum investments for the SBIC program each year from $3 billion to $4 billion. Senator Landrieu, Senator Risch, and I worked with a bipartisan coalition to increase this ceiling and ensure SBIC funds have access to sufficient capital to invest in promising small businesses. Nowhere is the success of this increase seen more than in Maryland. Since the start of fiscal year 2015, SBICs have already invested nearly $65 million in Maryland small businesses. Yet, this success could be enhanced even more if Congress increased the amount SBICs with a family of funds can borrow from the SBA. SBICs that run multiple funds at a time are known as ``families of funds.'' While many of our Nation's most successful and reliable SBICs have a family of funds, their success is being restricted by the current lending limit. Simply raising the limit from $225 million to $350 million would provide these proven fund managers the additional capital needed to invest in small businesses and stimulate local economies. Put simply, by increasing the ``family of funds'' lending limit to $350 million, proven investors can invest in more promising small businesses. The SBIC Act enhances the SBA's ability to support these successful investors as they finance small businesses that will continue to create jobs in this country. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 31 (Tuesday, February 24, 2015)] [Senate] [Pages S1076-S1078] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] STATEMENTS ON INTRODUCED BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS By Mr. CARDIN (for himself and Ms. Collins): S. 539.

This sort of terrorist attack is very possible here in the United States, and the ability for known and suspected terrorists to buy guns and explosives makes it even more likely. Congress should close this loophole in our background check system and ensure that known and suspected terrorists can't easily gain access to these weapons. I urge my colleagues to support this bill. ______ By Mr. RISCH (for himself, Mr. Cardin, Ms. Ayotte, and Mrs. Shaheen): S. 552. A bill to amend the Small Business Investment Act of 1958 to provide for increased limitations on leverage for multiple licenses under common control; to the Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship. Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I am pleased join my colleague, Senator Risch, in introducing the Small Business Investment Company Capital, SBIC, Act of 2015. And I am pleased that Congressman Chabot, Chairman of the House Small Business Committee, is introducing the same bill on the House side today. This bipartisan legislation makes a common-sense change to the Small Business Investment Company, SBIC, program run by the Small Business Administration, SBA. This change will provide increased support to some of the program's most successful participants, SBICs that run multiple funds at a time. At no additional cost to the taxpayer, the SBIC Act will raise the limit that a ``family of funds'' can borrow with an SBA guarantee from $225 million to $350 million The SBIC program guarantees loans to qualified investment funds, or SBICs. In turn, these SBICs invest in promising small businesses by combining the SBA loan with privately raised capital, often at a 2:1 ratio. It is important to note that while these SBICs are licensed and regulated by the SBA, they are privately owned and operated. Since its inception, the SBIC Debenture program has been incredibly successful. SBICs have invested more than $70 billion in nearly 170,000 small businesses. Recently, the program has experienced rapid growth. In 2013, SBA guaranteed loans to SBICs equaling $3.5 billion, a 70 percent increase in financing dollars from three years ago and the highest amount of financings in the past decade. This success is largely attributed to Congressional action that raised the ceiling for maximum investments for the SBIC program each year from $3 billion to $4 billion. Senator Landrieu, Senator Risch, and I worked with a bipartisan coalition to increase this ceiling and ensure SBIC funds have access to sufficient capital to invest in promising small businesses. Nowhere is the success of this increase seen more than in Maryland. Since the start of fiscal year 2015, SBICs have already invested nearly $65 million in Maryland small businesses. Yet, this success could be enhanced even more if Congress increased the amount SBICs with a family of funds can borrow from the SBA. SBICs that run multiple funds at a time are known as ``families of funds.'' While many of our Nation's most successful and reliable SBICs have a family of funds, their success is being restricted by the current lending limit. Simply raising the limit from $225 million to $350 million would provide these proven fund managers the additional capital needed to invest in small businesses and stimulate local economies. Put simply, by increasing the ``family of funds'' lending limit to $350 million, proven investors can invest in more promising small businesses. The SBIC Act enhances the SBA's ability to support these successful investors as they finance small businesses that will continue to create jobs in this country. ____________________","Congressional Record, Volume 161 Issue 31 (Tuesday, February 24, 2015) [Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 31 (Tuesday, February 24, 2015)] [Senate] [Pages S1076-S1078] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] STATEMENTS ON INTRODUCED BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS By Mr. CARDIN (for himself and Ms. Collins): S. 539. A bill to amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to repeal the Medicare outpatient rehabilitation therapy caps; to the Committee on Finance. Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I rise in support of the Medicare Access to Rehabilitation Services Act, which I am introducing today with my colleague Senator Collins. This important bill repeals the monetary caps that limit Medicare beneficiaries' access to medically necessary outpatient physical therapy, occupational therapy, and speech-language pathology services. Limits on outpatient rehabilitation therapy services under Medicare were first imposed in 1997 as part of the Balanced Budget Act. The decision to impose limits on these services was not based on data, quality-of-care concerns, or clinical judgment--its sole purpose was to limit spending in order to balance the federal budget. Since 1997, Congress has acted over 12 times to prevent the implementation of the therapy caps through moratoriums and an exceptions process. While these short-term actions have provided necessary relief to our seniors, a long-term solution is essential to bring permanent relief and much- needed stability for both patients and providers. We need a full repeal of the existing caps on physical therapy, occupational therapy, and speech-language pathology services. These annual financial caps limit services often needed after a stroke, traumatic brain injury, or spinal cord injury, or to effectively manage conditions such as Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis, and arthritis. Arbitrary caps on these vital Medicare outpatient therapy services are simply unacceptable. They also discriminate against the oldest and sickest Medicare beneficiaries, who typically require the most intensive therapy, and disadvantage Medicare beneficiaries who live in regions with higher health care costs. In a 2009 report issued by the Medicare Payment Advisory Committee, MEDPAC, it was estimated that the [[Page S1077]] therapy cap, if enforced without an exceptions process, could negatively impact 931,000 Medicare beneficiaries. Arbitrarily capping outpatient rehabilitation therapy services would likely cause some beneficiaries to delay necessary care, force others to assume higher out-of pocket costs, and disrupt the continuum of care for many seniors and individuals with disabilities. I urge my colleagues to join me and Senator Collins in supporting the Medicare Access to Rehabilitation Services Act to ensure that our seniors have access to the outpatient rehabilitation therapy services that they need. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record. There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows: S. 539 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. This Act may be cited as the ``Medicare Access to Rehabilitation Services Act of 2015''. SEC. 2. OUTPATIENT THERAPY CAP REPEAL. Section 1833 of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1395(l)) is amended by striking subsection (g). ______ By Ms. COLLINS (for herself and Ms. Heitkamp): S. 540. A bill to amend the Richard B. Russell National School Lunch Act to require the Secretary of Agriculture to make loan guarantees and grants to finance certain improvements to school lunch facilities, to train school food service personnel, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry. Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I am pleased today to join my friend and colleague from North Dakota, Senator Heitkamp, in introducing the School Food Modernization Act to assist schools in providing healthier meals to students throughout the country. School meals play a vital role in the lives of our young people. More than 30 million children participate in the National School Lunch Program every school day. In Maine, 40 percent of children qualify for free or reduced-price meals based on household income. The food served at schools to these children affects their health and well-being. Many children consume up to half their daily caloric intake at school. In fact, children often get their most nutritious meal of the day at school instead of at home. At the same time, too many of our children are at risk of serious disease. One-third of the children in this country are overweight or obese, which increases their risk for heart disease, high blood pressure, Type 2 Diabetes and other chronic diseases. These conditions may have a lifelong effect on their health as they grow to adulthood. In response to concerns about the health of our children, our schools have stepped up to the plate. Nationwide, schools are working diligently to meet the new U.S. Department of Agriculture standards and serve healthier meals. For example, in the New Sweden Consolidated School in Aroostook County, ME, food service manager Melanie Lagasse prepares meals from scratch instead of opening cans or pushing a defrost button. The school's 64 students, ranging from preschool to eighth grade, have grown to relish the chicken stew, baked fish, and meatloaf that she makes fresh. Many schools, however, lack the right tools for preparing meals rich in fresh ingredients and must rely on workarounds that are expensive, inefficient, and unsustainable. Schools built decades ago lack the tools and the infrastructure necessary beyond reheating and holding food for meal service. To serve healthier meals to their students, 99 percent of Maine school districts need at least one piece of equipment and almost half, 48 percent, of districts need kitchen infrastructure upgrades. The median equipment need per school is $45,000. Even more costly would be making the required changes to infrastructure. Forty-eight percent of Maine schools need some kind of infrastructure change to serve healthy meals. For example, 41 percent of schools need more physical space, 22 percent need more electrical capacity, 21 percent need more plumbing capacity, and 19 percent need more ventilation. Add the equipment costs together with the infrastructure costs and it is estimated that overall, $58.8 million would be needed just in Maine to serve healthy meals to all of our students. That far exceeds the $111,000 in grants that the USDA awarded Maine during the last two fiscal years for new equipment. Our bill authorizes loan guarantee assistance and grants for school equipment and infrastructure improvements, thereby helping food service personnel meet nutrition standards. First, it would establish a loan guarantee assistance program within USDA to help schools acquire new equipment to prepare and serve healthier, more nutritious meals to students. School administrators and other eligible borrowers could obtain Federal guarantees for 80 percent of the loan value needed to construct, remodel, or expand their kitchens, dining, or food storage infrastructure. Second, the bill would provide targeted grant assistance to give school administrators and food service directors the seed funding needed to upgrade kitchen infrastructure or to purchase high-quality, durable kitchen equipment such as commercial ovens, steamers, and stoves. Finally, to aid school food service personnel in meeting the nutrition guidelines, the legislation would strengthen training and provide technical assistance by authorizing USDA to provide support on a competitive basis to highly qualified third-party trainers to develop and administer training and technical assistance, including online programs. We need to start our school children off on the right food every day. If they are going to be able to learn and compete, they need to be healthy and their minds and bodies fully nourished. This bill will help us achieve that goal. ______ By Mrs. FEINSTEIN (for herself, Mr. Whitehouse, Mr. Schumer, Mr. Durbin, Mr. Blumenthal, Mrs. Boxer, Mr. Reed, Mr. Menendez, Mrs. Gillibrand, Mr. Murphy, Ms. Warren, and Mr. Markey): S. 551. A bill to increase public safety by permitting the Attorney General to deny the transfer of firearms or the issuance of firearms and explosives licenses to known or suspected dangerous terrorists; to the Committee on the Judiciary. Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today to address what I believe is a national security and public safety weakness. The United States currently has a system in place to keep known or suspected terrorists off of airplanes. But even though they can't fly, these very same terrorists can walk into any gun store anywhere in the country and purchase a firearm. If a terrorist is too dangerous to board an airplane, that same individual is too dangerous to possess a gun. That's why we are introducing the Denying Firearms and Explosives to Dangerous Terrorists Act, a bill to fix this glaring loophole in our background check system. This is not a hypothetical issue. Individuals with links to terrorism regularly purchase guns in the United States. According to data just received from the Government Accountability Office, between February 2004 and December 2014, there were at least 2,233 cases in which a known or suspected terrorist--individuals who at the time were on federal terrorist watch lists--tried to buy a firearm or obtain a firearm or explosives license or permit. In 91 percent of these cases, a total of 2,043 separate occasions, those known or suspected terrorists successfully passed a background check. The Kouachi brothers, the terrorists who killed 12 people at Charlie Hebdo in Paris, are reportedly on the U.S. no fly list. However, if they had made it to the United States, the fact that they were on terrorist watch lists would have done nothing to prevent them from legally buying firearms or explosives. One of the alleged Boston Marathon bombers, Tamerlan Tsarnaev, was reportedly placed on two terrorist watch lists in 2011. He later killed three and injured 170 with homemade explosives and killed a police officer with a handgun. [[Page S1078]] In 2009, Abdulhakim Mujahid Muhammad opened fire at a military recruiting station in Little Rock, Arkansas. He killed one and critically injured another. According to press reports, Muhammad had been under investigation by the FBI for suspected links to terrorism after traveling to Yemen, where he was arrested for using a Somali passport. Those actions certainly would have placed him on terrorist watch lists, but would not have kept him from buying firearms. The bill that we are introducing today is very simple. It would close this dangerous loophole by giving the Attorney General discretion to prevent someone from buying explosives or a gun if that individual is a known or suspected terrorist and may use the firearm in connection with terrorism. It would also give the Attorney General discretion to prevent someone from obtaining a license to sell guns or explosives if that individual is a known or suspected terrorist and may use the firearm in connection with terrorism. The Attorney General could use a range of tools to make this decision, most notable terrorist watch lists and the no fly list. In addition to making the decision at the discretion of the Attorney General, the bill includes other safeguards to make sure innocent individuals are not denied the ability to buy firearms or explosives. The first safeguard is that very high standards already exist for an individual to be designated as a known or suspected terrorist. The FBI or the National Counterterrorism Center must nominate the individual to be included in the Terrorist Screening Database. There must be sufficient identifying data about the person to ensure they can be accurately matched with the terrorist on the watch list. The circumstances must meet the ``reasonable suspicion'' standard. This means the facts of the case must be strong enough to reasonably determine the person is known or suspected to be engaged in terrorism. The second safeguard is that every provision in current law allowing individuals to appeal the denial of a firearm or explosive purchase will also apply to this bill. The office within the FBI that handles the background check system, known as the NICS Section, or the National Instant Criminal Background Check System Section, must provide the reason for denial upon request. Individuals then have the right to correct any inaccurate records in the background check system. If a purchase is still denied, individuals can take the Justice Department to court to overturn the decision. Gun safety safety bills are often labeled as Democratic bills. That is not the case here. This bill was first proposed by the Justice Department under President George W. Bush, who recognized that keeping guns away from terrorists is good policy. Attorney General Holder has also testified that the Justice Department under President Obama continues to support this proposal. The bill has also been endorsed by Everytown for Gun Safety. This group represents more than 1,000 current and former mayors, both Republican and Democrat. The legislation has also been endorsed by the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence, the Violence Policy Center, Americans for Responsible Solutions, and the Coalition to Stop Gun Violence. I would also like to thank the bill's cosponsors: Senators Whitehouse, Schumer, Durbin, Blumenthal, Boxer, Reed, Menendez, Gillibrand, Murphy, Warren, and Markey. All of you are champions for stronger gun safety laws. The terrorist attack in Paris should be a wake-up call for everyone.

A bill to amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to repeal the Medicare outpatient rehabilitation therapy caps; to the Committee on Finance. Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I rise in support of the Medicare Access to Rehabilitation Services Act, which I am introducing today with my colleague Senator Collins. This important bill repeals the monetary caps that limit Medicare beneficiaries' access to medically necessary outpatient physical therapy, occupational therapy, and speech-language pathology services. Limits on outpatient rehabilitation therapy services under Medicare were first imposed in 1997 as part of the Balanced Budget Act. The decision to impose limits on these services was not based on data, quality-of-care concerns, or clinical judgment--its sole purpose was to limit spending in order to balance the federal budget. Since 1997, Congress has acted over 12 times to prevent the implementation of the therapy caps through moratoriums and an exceptions process. While these short-term actions have provided necessary relief to our seniors, a long-term solution is essential to bring permanent relief and much- needed stability for both patients and providers. We need a full repeal of the existing caps on physical therapy, occupational therapy, and speech-language pathology services. These annual financial caps limit services often needed after a stroke, traumatic brain injury, or spinal cord injury, or to effectively manage conditions such as Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis, and arthritis. Arbitrary caps on these vital Medicare outpatient therapy services are simply unacceptable. They also discriminate against the oldest and sickest Medicare beneficiaries, who typically require the most intensive therapy, and disadvantage Medicare beneficiaries who live in regions with higher health care costs. In a 2009 report issued by the Medicare Payment Advisory Committee, MEDPAC, it was estimated that the [[Page S1077]] therapy cap, if enforced without an exceptions process, could negatively impact 931,000 Medicare beneficiaries. Arbitrarily capping outpatient rehabilitation therapy services would likely cause some beneficiaries to delay necessary care, force others to assume higher out-of pocket costs, and disrupt the continuum of care for many seniors and individuals with disabilities. I urge my colleagues to join me and Senator Collins in supporting the Medicare Access to Rehabilitation Services Act to ensure that our seniors have access to the outpatient rehabilitation therapy services that they need. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record. There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows: S. 539 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, SECTION 1.

A bill to increase public safety by permitting the Attorney General to deny the transfer of firearms or the issuance of firearms and explosives licenses to known or suspected dangerous terrorists; to the Committee on the Judiciary. Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today to address what I believe is a national security and public safety weakness. The United States currently has a system in place to keep known or suspected terrorists off of airplanes. But even though they can't fly, these very same terrorists can walk into any gun store anywhere in the country and purchase a firearm. If a terrorist is too dangerous to board an airplane, that same individual is too dangerous to possess a gun. That's why we are introducing the Denying Firearms and Explosives to Dangerous Terrorists Act, a bill to fix this glaring loophole in our background check system. This is not a hypothetical issue. Individuals with links to terrorism regularly purchase guns in the United States. According to data just received from the Government Accountability Office, between February 2004 and December 2014, there were at least 2,233 cases in which a known or suspected terrorist--individuals who at the time were on federal terrorist watch lists--tried to buy a firearm or obtain a firearm or explosives license or permit. In 91 percent of these cases, a total of 2,043 separate occasions, those known or suspected terrorists successfully passed a background check. The Kouachi brothers, the terrorists who killed 12 people at Charlie Hebdo in Paris, are reportedly on the U.S. no fly list. However, if they had made it to the United States, the fact that they were on terrorist watch lists would have done nothing to prevent them from legally buying firearms or explosives. One of the alleged Boston Marathon bombers, Tamerlan Tsarnaev, was reportedly placed on two terrorist watch lists in 2011. He later killed three and injured 170 with homemade explosives and killed a police officer with a handgun. [[Page S1078]] In 2009, Abdulhakim Mujahid Muhammad opened fire at a military recruiting station in Little Rock, Arkansas. He killed one and critically injured another. According to press reports, Muhammad had been under investigation by the FBI for suspected links to terrorism after traveling to Yemen, where he was arrested for using a Somali passport. Those actions certainly would have placed him on terrorist watch lists, but would not have kept him from buying firearms. The bill that we are introducing today is very simple. It would close this dangerous loophole by giving the Attorney General discretion to prevent someone from buying explosives or a gun if that individual is a known or suspected terrorist and may use the firearm in connection with terrorism. It would also give the Attorney General discretion to prevent someone from obtaining a license to sell guns or explosives if that individual is a known or suspected terrorist and may use the firearm in connection with terrorism. The Attorney General could use a range of tools to make this decision, most notable terrorist watch lists and the no fly list. In addition to making the decision at the discretion of the Attorney General, the bill includes other safeguards to make sure innocent individuals are not denied the ability to buy firearms or explosives. The first safeguard is that very high standards already exist for an individual to be designated as a known or suspected terrorist. The FBI or the National Counterterrorism Center must nominate the individual to be included in the Terrorist Screening Database. There must be sufficient identifying data about the person to ensure they can be accurately matched with the terrorist on the watch list. The circumstances must meet the ``reasonable suspicion'' standard. This means the facts of the case must be strong enough to reasonably determine the person is known or suspected to be engaged in terrorism. The second safeguard is that every provision in current law allowing individuals to appeal the denial of a firearm or explosive purchase will also apply to this bill. The office within the FBI that handles the background check system, known as the NICS Section, or the National Instant Criminal Background Check System Section, must provide the reason for denial upon request. Individuals then have the right to correct any inaccurate records in the background check system. If a purchase is still denied, individuals can take the Justice Department to court to overturn the decision. Gun safety safety bills are often labeled as Democratic bills. That is not the case here. This bill was first proposed by the Justice Department under President George W. Bush, who recognized that keeping guns away from terrorists is good policy. Attorney General Holder has also testified that the Justice Department under President Obama continues to support this proposal. The bill has also been endorsed by Everytown for Gun Safety. This group represents more than 1,000 current and former mayors, both Republican and Democrat. The legislation has also been endorsed by the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence, the Violence Policy Center, Americans for Responsible Solutions, and the Coalition to Stop Gun Violence. I would also like to thank the bill's cosponsors: Senators Whitehouse, Schumer, Durbin, Blumenthal, Boxer, Reed, Menendez, Gillibrand, Murphy, Warren, and Markey.

The second safeguard is that every provision in current law allowing individuals to appeal the denial of a firearm or explosive purchase will also apply to this bill. The office within the FBI that handles the background check system, known as the NICS Section, or the National Instant Criminal Background Check System Section, must provide the reason for denial upon request. Individuals then have the right to correct any inaccurate records in the background check system. If a purchase is still denied, individuals can take the Justice Department to court to overturn the decision. Gun safety safety bills are often labeled as Democratic bills. That is not the case here. This bill was first proposed by the Justice Department under President George W. Bush, who recognized that keeping guns away from terrorists is good policy. Attorney General Holder has also testified that the Justice Department under President Obama continues to support this proposal. The bill has also been endorsed by Everytown for Gun Safety. This group represents more than 1,000 current and former mayors, both Republican and Democrat. The legislation has also been endorsed by the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence, the Violence Policy Center, Americans for Responsible Solutions, and the Coalition to Stop Gun Violence. I would also like to thank the bill's cosponsors: Senators Whitehouse, Schumer, Durbin, Blumenthal, Boxer, Reed, Menendez, Gillibrand, Murphy, Warren, and Markey. All of you are champions for stronger gun safety laws. The terrorist attack in Paris should be a wake-up call for everyone. This sort of terrorist attack is very possible here in the United States, and the ability for known and suspected terrorists to buy guns and explosives makes it even more likely. Congress should close this loophole in our background check system and ensure that known and suspected terrorists can't easily gain access to these weapons. I urge my colleagues to support this bill. ______",package_114_116.csv,6304,6304,6375,"[congressional record volume 161, number 31 (tuesday, february 24, 2015)] [senate] [pages s1077-s1078] from the congressional record online through the government publishing office [ www.gpo.gov ] by mrs. feinstein (for herself, mr. whitehouse, mr. schumer, mr. durbin, mr. blumenthal, mrs. boxer, mr. reed, mr. menendez, mrs. gillibrand, mr. murphy, ms. warren, and mr. markey): s. 551. a bill to increase public safety by permitting the attorney general to deny the transfer of firearms or the issuance of firearms and explosives licenses to known or suspected dangerous terrorists; to the committee on the judiciary. mrs. feinstein. mr. president, i rise today to address what i believe is a national security and public safety weakness. the united states currently has a system in place to keep known or suspected terrorists off of airplanes. but even though they can't fly, these very same terrorists can walk into any gun store anywhere in the country and purchase a firearm. if a terrorist is too dangerous to board an airplane, that same individual is too dangerous to possess a gun. that's why we are introducing the denying firearms and explosives to dangerous terrorists act, a bill to fix this glaring loophole in our background check system. this is not a hypothetical issue. individuals with links to terrorism regularly purchase guns in the united states. according to data just received from the government accountability office, between february 2004 and december 2014, there were at least 2,233 cases in which a known or suspected terrorist--individuals who at the time were on federal terrorist watch lists--tried to buy a firearm or obtain a firearm or explosives license or permit. in 91 percent of these cases, a total of 2,043 separate occasions, those known or suspected terrorists successfully passed a background check. the kouachi brothers, the terrorists who killed 12 people at charlie hebdo in paris, are reportedly on the u.s. no fly list. however, if they had made it to the united states, the fact that they were on terrorist watch lists would have done nothing to prevent them from legally buying firearms or explosives. one of the alleged boston marathon bombers, tamerlan tsarnaev, was reportedly placed on two terrorist watch lists in 2011. he later killed three and injured 170 with homemade explosives and killed a police officer with a handgun. [[page s1078]] in 2009, abdulhakim mujahid muhammad opened fire at a military recruiting station in little rock, arkansas. he killed one and critically injured another. according to press reports, muhammad had been under investigation by the fbi for suspected links to terrorism after traveling to yemen, where he was arrested for using a somali passport. those actions certainly would have placed him on terrorist watch lists, but would not have kept him from buying firearms. the bill that we are introducing today is very simple. it would close this dangerous loophole by giving the attorney general discretion to prevent someone from buying explosives or a gun if that individual is a known or suspected terrorist and may use the firearm in connection with terrorism. it would also give the attorney general discretion to prevent someone from obtaining a license to sell guns or explosives if that individual is a known or suspected terrorist and may use the firearm in connection with terrorism. the attorney general could use a range of tools to make this decision, most notable terrorist watch lists and the no fly list. in addition to making the decision at the discretion of the attorney general, the bill includes other safeguards to make sure innocent individuals are not denied the ability to buy firearms or explosives. the first safeguard is that very high standards already exist for an individual to be designated as a known or suspected terrorist. the fbi or the national counterterrorism center must nominate the individual to be included in the terrorist screening database. there must be sufficient identifying data about the person to ensure they can be accurately matched with the terrorist on the watch list. the circumstances must meet the ``reasonable suspicion'' standard. this means the facts of the case must be strong enough to reasonably determine the person is known or suspected to be engaged in terrorism. the second safeguard is that every provision in current law allowing individuals to appeal the denial of a firearm or explosive purchase will also apply to this bill. the office within the fbi that handles the background check system, known as the nics section, or the national instant criminal background check system section, must provide the reason for denial upon request. individuals then have the right to correct any inaccurate records in the background check system. if a purchase is still denied, individuals can take the justice department to court to overturn the decision. gun safety safety bills are often labeled as democratic bills. that is not the case here. this bill was first proposed by the justice department under president george w. bush, who recognized that keeping guns away from terrorists is good policy. attorney general holder has also testified that the justice department under president obama continues to support this proposal. the bill has also been endorsed by everytown for gun safety. this group represents more than 1,000 current and former mayors, both republican and democrat. the legislation has also been endorsed by the brady campaign to prevent gun violence, the violence policy center, americans for responsible solutions, and the coalition to stop gun violence. i would also like to thank the bill's cosponsors: senators whitehouse, schumer, durbin, blumenthal, boxer, reed, menendez, gillibrand, murphy, warren, and markey. all of you are champions for stronger gun safety laws. the terrorist attack in paris should be a wake-up call for everyone. this sort of terrorist attack is very possible here in the united states, and the ability for known and suspected terrorists to buy guns and explosives makes it even more likely. congress should close this loophole in our background check system and ensure that known and suspected terrorists can't easily gain access to these weapons. i urge my colleagues to support this bill. ______",6304

A bill to amend the Richard B. Russell National School Lunch Act to require the Secretary of Agriculture to make loan guarantees and grants to finance certain improvements to school lunch facilities, to train school food service personnel, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry. Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I am pleased today to join my friend and colleague from North Dakota, Senator Heitkamp, in introducing the School Food Modernization Act to assist schools in providing healthier meals to students throughout the country. School meals play a vital role in the lives of our young people. More than 30 million children participate in the National School Lunch Program every school day. In Maine, 40 percent of children qualify for free or reduced-price meals based on household income. The food served at schools to these children affects their health and well-being. Many children consume up to half their daily caloric intake at school. In fact, children often get their most nutritious meal of the day at school instead of at home. At the same time, too many of our children are at risk of serious disease. One-third of the children in this country are overweight or obese, which increases their risk for heart disease, high blood pressure, Type 2 Diabetes and other chronic diseases. These conditions may have a lifelong effect on their health as they grow to adulthood. In response to concerns about the health of our children, our schools have stepped up to the plate. Nationwide, schools are working diligently to meet the new U.S. Department of Agriculture standards and serve healthier meals. For example, in the New Sweden Consolidated School in Aroostook County, ME, food service manager Melanie Lagasse prepares meals from scratch instead of opening cans or pushing a defrost button. The school's 64 students, ranging from preschool to eighth grade, have grown to relish the chicken stew, baked fish, and meatloaf that she makes fresh. Many schools, however, lack the right tools for preparing meals rich in fresh ingredients and must rely on workarounds that are expensive, inefficient, and unsustainable. Schools built decades ago lack the tools and the infrastructure necessary beyond reheating and holding food for meal service. To serve healthier meals to their students, 99 percent of Maine school districts need at least one piece of equipment and almost half, 48 percent, of districts need kitchen infrastructure upgrades. The median equipment need per school is $45,000. Even more costly would be making the required changes to infrastructure. Forty-eight percent of Maine schools need some kind of infrastructure change to serve healthy meals. For example, 41 percent of schools need more physical space, 22 percent need more electrical capacity, 21 percent need more plumbing capacity, and 19 percent need more ventilation. Add the equipment costs together with the infrastructure costs and it is estimated that overall, $58.8 million would be needed just in Maine to serve healthy meals to all of our students. That far exceeds the $111,000 in grants that the USDA awarded Maine during the last two fiscal years for new equipment. Our bill authorizes loan guarantee assistance and grants for school equipment and infrastructure improvements, thereby helping food service personnel meet nutrition standards. First, it would establish a loan guarantee assistance program within USDA to help schools acquire new equipment to prepare and serve healthier, more nutritious meals to students. School administrators and other eligible borrowers could obtain Federal guarantees for 80 percent of the loan value needed to construct, remodel, or expand their kitchens, dining, or food storage infrastructure. Second, the bill would provide targeted grant assistance to give school administrators and food service directors the seed funding needed to upgrade kitchen infrastructure or to purchase high-quality, durable kitchen equipment such as commercial ovens, steamers, and stoves. Finally, to aid school food service personnel in meeting the nutrition guidelines, the legislation would strengthen training and provide technical assistance by authorizing USDA to provide support on a competitive basis to highly qualified third-party trainers to develop and administer training and technical assistance, including online programs. We need to start our school children off on the right food every day. If they are going to be able to learn and compete, they need to be healthy and their minds and bodies fully nourished. This bill will help us achieve that goal. ______","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 31 (Tuesday, February 24, 2015)] [Senate] [Page S1077] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] By Ms. COLLINS (for herself and Ms. Heitkamp): S. 540.

A bill to amend the Small Business Investment Act of 1958 to provide for increased limitations on leverage for multiple licenses under common control; to the Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship. Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I am pleased join my colleague, Senator Risch, in introducing the Small Business Investment Company Capital, SBIC, Act of 2015. And I am pleased that Congressman Chabot, Chairman of the House Small Business Committee, is introducing the same bill on the House side today. This bipartisan legislation makes a common-sense change to the Small Business Investment Company, SBIC, program run by the Small Business Administration, SBA. This change will provide increased support to some of the program's most successful participants, SBICs that run multiple funds at a time. At no additional cost to the taxpayer, the SBIC Act will raise the limit that a ``family of funds'' can borrow with an SBA guarantee from $225 million to $350 million The SBIC program guarantees loans to qualified investment funds, or SBICs. In turn, these SBICs invest in promising small businesses by combining the SBA loan with privately raised capital, often at a 2:1 ratio. It is important to note that while these SBICs are licensed and regulated by the SBA, they are privately owned and operated. Since its inception, the SBIC Debenture program has been incredibly successful. SBICs have invested more than $70 billion in nearly 170,000 small businesses. Recently, the program has experienced rapid growth. In 2013, SBA guaranteed loans to SBICs equaling $3.5 billion, a 70 percent increase in financing dollars from three years ago and the highest amount of financings in the past decade. This success is largely attributed to Congressional action that raised the ceiling for maximum investments for the SBIC program each year from $3 billion to $4 billion. Senator Landrieu, Senator Risch, and I worked with a bipartisan coalition to increase this ceiling and ensure SBIC funds have access to sufficient capital to invest in promising small businesses. Nowhere is the success of this increase seen more than in Maryland. Since the start of fiscal year 2015, SBICs have already invested nearly $65 million in Maryland small businesses. Yet, this success could be enhanced even more if Congress increased the amount SBICs with a family of funds can borrow from the SBA. SBICs that run multiple funds at a time are known as ``families of funds.'' While many of our Nation's most successful and reliable SBICs have a family of funds, their success is being restricted by the current lending limit. Simply raising the limit from $225 million to $350 million would provide these proven fund managers the additional capital needed to invest in small businesses and stimulate local economies. Put simply, by increasing the ``family of funds'' lending limit to $350 million, proven investors can invest in more promising small businesses. The SBIC Act enhances the SBA's ability to support these successful investors as they finance small businesses that will continue to create jobs in this country. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 31 (Tuesday, February 24, 2015)] [Senate] [Page S1078] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] By Mr. RISCH (for himself, Mr. Cardin, Ms. Ayotte, and Mrs. Shaheen): S. 552.

While many of our Nation's most successful and reliable SBICs have a family of funds, their success is being restricted by the current lending limit. Simply raising the limit from $225 million to $350 million would provide these proven fund managers the additional capital needed to invest in small businesses and stimulate local economies. Put simply, by increasing the ``family of funds'' lending limit to $350 million, proven investors can invest in more promising small businesses. The SBIC Act enhances the SBA's ability to support these successful investors as they finance small businesses that will continue to create jobs in this country. ____________________",package_114_116.csv,3394,3394,3465,"[congressional record volume 161, number 31 (tuesday, february 24, 2015)] [senate] [page s1078] from the congressional record online through the government publishing office [ www.gpo.gov ] by mr. risch (for himself, mr. cardin, ms. ayotte, and mrs. shaheen): s. 552. a bill to amend the small business investment act of 1958 to provide for increased limitations on leverage for multiple licenses under common control; to the committee on small business and entrepreneurship. mr. cardin. mr. president, i am pleased join my colleague, senator risch, in introducing the small business investment company capital, sbic, act of 2015. and i am pleased that congressman chabot, chairman of the house small business committee, is introducing the same bill on the house side today. this bipartisan legislation makes a common-sense change to the small business investment company, sbic, program run by the small business administration, sba. this change will provide increased support to some of the program's most successful participants, sbics that run multiple funds at a time. at no additional cost to the taxpayer, the sbic act will raise the limit that a ``family of funds'' can borrow with an sba guarantee from $225 million to $350 million the sbic program guarantees loans to qualified investment funds, or sbics. in turn, these sbics invest in promising small businesses by combining the sba loan with privately raised capital, often at a 2:1 ratio. it is important to note that while these sbics are licensed and regulated by the sba, they are privately owned and operated. since its inception, the sbic debenture program has been incredibly successful. sbics have invested more than $70 billion in nearly 170,000 small businesses. recently, the program has experienced rapid growth. in 2013, sba guaranteed loans to sbics equaling $3.5 billion, a 70 percent increase in financing dollars from three years ago and the highest amount of financings in the past decade. this success is largely attributed to congressional action that raised the ceiling for maximum investments for the sbic program each year from $3 billion to $4 billion. senator landrieu, senator risch, and i worked with a bipartisan coalition to increase this ceiling and ensure sbic funds have access to sufficient capital to invest in promising small businesses. nowhere is the success of this increase seen more than in maryland. since the start of fiscal year 2015, sbics have already invested nearly $65 million in maryland small businesses. yet, this success could be enhanced even more if congress increased the amount sbics with a family of funds can borrow from the sba. sbics that run multiple funds at a time are known as ``families of funds.'' while many of our nation's most successful and reliable sbics have a family of funds, their success is being restricted by the current lending limit. simply raising the limit from $225 million to $350 million would provide these proven fund managers the additional capital needed to invest in small businesses and stimulate local economies. put simply, by increasing the ``family of funds'' lending limit to $350 million, proven investors can invest in more promising small businesses. the sbic act enhances the sba's ability to support these successful investors as they finance small businesses that will continue to create jobs in this country. ____________________",3394

Mr. McCONNELL (for Mr. Menendez) proposed an amendment to the resolution S. Res. 65, supporting efforts to bring an end to violence perpetrated by Boko Haram, and urging the Government of Nigeria to conduct transparent, peaceful, and credible elections; as follows: Whereas Nigeria is the most populous nation in Africa, with the largest economy; Whereas the Governments of the United States and Nigeria have had a strong bilateral relationship, and Nigeria has been a valued partner of the United States since its transition to civilian rule; Whereas the Government of Nigeria is currently confronted with threats to internal security by terrorists, insurgents, and communal violence that have caused considerable population displacement, and at the [[Page S1080]] same time must administer transparent and peaceful elections with a credible outcome; Whereas the government and those who aspire to hold office in Nigeria must demonstrate the political will to address both of these challenges in a responsible way, including by ensuring full enfranchisement, with particular emphasis on developing a means for enfranchisement for the hundreds of thousands displaced by violence; Whereas the members of Jama'atu Ahlis Sunna Lidda'awati wal-Jihad, commonly known as Boko Haram, have terrorized the people of Nigeria with increasing violence since 2009, targeting military, government, and civilian sites in Nigeria, including schools, mosques, churches, markets, villages, and agricultural centers, and killing thousands and abducting hundreds of civilians in Nigeria and the surrounding countries; Whereas the Department of State named several individuals linked to Boko Haram, including its leader, Abubakar Shekau, as Specially Designated Global Terrorists in 2012, and designated Boko Haram as a Foreign Terrorist Organization (FTO) in November 2013; Whereas, in May 2014, the United Nations Security Council added Boko Haram to its al Qaeda sanctions list, and on January 19, 2015, the United Nations Security Council issued a presidential statement condemning the recent escalation of attacks in northeastern Nigeria and surrounding countries and expressing concern that the situation was undermining peace and security in West and Central Africa; Whereas Boko Haram calls for the universal implementation of what it considers ``pure'' Shari'ah law, has called on all Christians to leave northern Nigeria, and perpetrates targeted violent attacks against Christians, churches, schools, mosques, and Muslim critics; Whereas the over 200 school girls abducted by Boko Haram on April 14, 2014, from the Government Girls Secondary School in the northeastern state of Borno, whose kidnapping sparked domestic and international outrage spawning the Twitter campaign #BringBackOurGirls, are still missing; Whereas the militant group is an increasing menace to the countries along Nigeria's northeastern border, prompting the African Union, the Lake Chad Basin Commission, the European Union, and the United Nations Security Council to recognize that there must be a regional response; Whereas the United States Government has stepped forward to offer assistance through intelligence sharing, bilateral and international sanctioning of Boko Haram leaders, counterterrorism assistance through the Global Security Contingency Fund program for countries in the region to counter the militant group, and humanitarian services to populations affected by and vulnerable to Boko Haram violence; Whereas Boko Haram emerged partially as a response to underdevelopment in northeastern Nigeria, and inequality, elite impunity, and alleged human rights abuses by security forces may be fueling anti-government sentiment; Whereas it is clear that a military approach alone will not eliminate the threat of Boko Haram, and gross human rights abuses and atrocities by security forces causes insecurity and mistrust among the civilian population; Whereas it is imperative that the Government of Nigeria implement a comprehensive, civilian security focused plan that prioritizes protecting civilians and also addresses legitimate political and economic grievances of citizens in northern Nigeria; Whereas Nigeria is scheduled to hold national elections in the coming weeks, and the elections appear to be the most closely contested in Nigeria since the return to civilian rule; Whereas election-related violence has occurred in Nigeria in successive elections, including in 2011, when nearly 800 people died in clashes following the presidential election; Whereas President Goodluck Ebele Azikiwe Jonathan, General Muhammadu Buhari, and other presidential candidates pledged to reverse this trend by signing the ``Abuja Accord'' on January 14, 2015, in which they committed themselves and their campaigns to refraining from public statements that incite violence, to running issue-based campaigns that do not seek to divide citizens along religious or ethnic lines, and to supporting the impartial conduct of the electoral commission and the security services; Whereas Secretary of State John Kerry visited Nigeria on January 25, 2015, to emphasize the importance of ensuring the upcoming elections are peaceful, nonviolent, and credible; Whereas, despite the Nigerian Independent National Electoral Commission's (INEC) views that preparations were ``sufficient to conduct free, fair and credible elections as scheduled,'' at the repeated urging of security officials, INEC announced on February 7, 2015, the postponement of the elections by six weeks, and elections will now take place on March 28 and April 11, 2015; Whereas tensions in the country remain high, and either electoral fraud or violence could undermine the credibility of the upcoming election; Whereas the people of Nigeria aspire for a fair, competently executed, and secure electoral process, as well as an outcome that can be accepted peacefully by all citizens; and Whereas it is in the best interest of the United States to maintain close ties with a politically stable, democratic and economically sound Nigeria: Now, therefore, be it ______ SA 254.

Mr. McCONNELL (for Mr. Menendez) proposed an amendment to the resolution S. Res. 65, supporting efforts to bring an end to violence perpetrated by Boko Haram, and urging the Government of Nigeria to conduct transparent, peaceful, and credible elections; as follows: Whereas Nigeria is the most populous nation in Africa, with the largest economy; Whereas the Governments of the United States and Nigeria have had a strong bilateral relationship, and Nigeria has been a valued partner of the United States since its transition to civilian rule; Whereas the Government of Nigeria is currently confronted with threats to internal security by terrorists, insurgents, and communal violence that have caused considerable population displacement, and at the [[Page S1080]] same time must administer transparent and peaceful elections with a credible outcome; Whereas the government and those who aspire to hold office in Nigeria must demonstrate the political will to address both of these challenges in a responsible way, including by ensuring full enfranchisement, with particular emphasis on developing a means for enfranchisement for the hundreds of thousands displaced by violence; Whereas the members of Jama'atu Ahlis Sunna Lidda'awati wal-Jihad, commonly known as Boko Haram, have terrorized the people of Nigeria with increasing violence since 2009, targeting military, government, and civilian sites in Nigeria, including schools, mosques, churches, markets, villages, and agricultural centers, and killing thousands and abducting hundreds of civilians in Nigeria and the surrounding countries; Whereas the Department of State named several individuals linked to Boko Haram, including its leader, Abubakar Shekau, as Specially Designated Global Terrorists in 2012, and designated Boko Haram as a Foreign Terrorist Organization (FTO) in November 2013; Whereas, in May 2014, the United Nations Security Council added Boko Haram to its al Qaeda sanctions list, and on January 19, 2015, the United Nations Security Council issued a presidential statement condemning the recent escalation of attacks in northeastern Nigeria and surrounding countries and expressing concern that the situation was undermining peace and security in West and Central Africa; Whereas Boko Haram calls for the universal implementation of what it considers ``pure'' Shari'ah law, has called on all Christians to leave northern Nigeria, and perpetrates targeted violent attacks against Christians, churches, schools, mosques, and Muslim critics; Whereas the over 200 school girls abducted by Boko Haram on April 14, 2014, from the Government Girls Secondary School in the northeastern state of Borno, whose kidnapping sparked domestic and international outrage spawning the Twitter campaign #BringBackOurGirls, are still missing; Whereas the militant group is an increasing menace to the countries along Nigeria's northeastern border, prompting the African Union, the Lake Chad Basin Commission, the European Union, and the United Nations Security Council to recognize that there must be a regional response; Whereas the United States Government has stepped forward to offer assistance through intelligence sharing, bilateral and international sanctioning of Boko Haram leaders, counterterrorism assistance through the Global Security Contingency Fund program for countries in the region to counter the militant group, and humanitarian services to populations affected by and vulnerable to Boko Haram violence; Whereas Boko Haram emerged partially as a response to underdevelopment in northeastern Nigeria, and inequality, elite impunity, and alleged human rights abuses by security forces may be fueling anti-government sentiment; Whereas it is clear that a military approach alone will not eliminate the threat of Boko Haram, and gross human rights abuses and atrocities by security forces causes insecurity and mistrust among the civilian population; Whereas it is imperative that the Government of Nigeria implement a comprehensive, civilian security focused plan that prioritizes protecting civilians and also addresses legitimate political and economic grievances of citizens in northern Nigeria; Whereas Nigeria is scheduled to hold national elections in the coming weeks, and the elections appear to be the most closely contested in Nigeria since the return to civilian rule; Whereas election-related violence has occurred in Nigeria in successive elections, including in 2011, when nearly 800 people died in clashes following the presidential election; Whereas President Goodluck Ebele Azikiwe Jonathan, General Muhammadu Buhari, and other presidential candidates pledged to reverse this trend by signing the ``Abuja Accord'' on January 14, 2015, in which they committed themselves and their campaigns to refraining from public statements that incite violence, to running issue-based campaigns that do not seek to divide citizens along religious or ethnic lines, and to supporting the impartial conduct of the electoral commission and the security services; Whereas Secretary of State John Kerry visited Nigeria on January 25, 2015, to emphasize the importance of ensuring the upcoming elections are peaceful, nonviolent, and credible; Whereas, despite the Nigerian Independent National Electoral Commission's (INEC) views that preparations were ``sufficient to conduct free, fair and credible elections as scheduled,'' at the repeated urging of security officials, INEC announced on February 7, 2015, the postponement of the elections by six weeks, and elections will now take place on March 28 and April 11, 2015; Whereas tensions in the country remain high, and either electoral fraud or violence could undermine the credibility of the upcoming election; Whereas the people of Nigeria aspire for a fair, competently executed, and secure electoral process, as well as an outcome that can be accepted peacefully by all citizens; and Whereas it is in the best interest of the United States to maintain close ties with a politically stable, democratic and economically sound Nigeria: Now, therefore, be it ______","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 31 (Tuesday, February 24, 2015)] [Senate] [Pages S1079-S1080] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] SA 253.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Foreign Relations Committee be discharged from further consideration of S. Res. 65 and the Senate proceed to its immediate consideration. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk will report the resolution by title. The senior assistant legislative clerk read as follows: A resolution (S. Res. 65) supporting efforts to bring an end to violence perpetrated by Boko Haram, and urging the Government of Nigeria to conduct transparent, peaceful, and credible elections. There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the resolution. Mr. McCONNELL. I further ask unanimous consent that the Menendez amendment to the resolution be agreed to. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The amendment (No. 252) in the nature of a substitute was agreed to, as follows: (Purpose: To provide a complete substitute) Strike all after the resolving clause and insert the following: ``That the Senate-- (1) condemns Boko Haram for its violent attacks, particularly the indiscriminate targeting of civilians, especially women and girls, and the use of children as fighters and suicide bombers; (2) stands with-- (A) the people of Nigeria in their right to live free from fear or intimidation by state or nonstate actors, regardless of their ethnic, religious, or regional affiliation; (B) the people of Cameroon, Chad, and Niger who are increasingly at risk of becoming victims of Boko Haram's violence; and (C) the international community in its efforts to defeat Boko Haram; (3) supports the Abuja Accord, and calls on candidates, party officials, and adherents of all political movements to comply with the code of conduct spelled out therein, by refraining from any rhetoric or action that seeks to demonize or delegitimize opponents, sow division among Nigerians, or otherwise inflame tensions; (4) condemns any and all abuses of civilians by security forces of the Government of Nigeria; (5) urges the Government of Nigeria to-- (A) adhere to the new timeline for elections announced by INEC on February 7, 2015; (B) refrain from using security concerns as a pretext for impeding the democratic process and using the security apparatus for political purposes in connection with the elections; (C) ensure elections are credible, transparent, and peaceful; (D) prioritize the safety and security of Nigerians vulnerable to Boko Haram attacks; (E) implement a comprehensive, civilian security-focused response to defeat Boko Haram that addresses political and economic grievances of citizens in the north; (F) improve the capacity and conduct of Nigeria's security forces, including respect for human rights, and take steps to hold accountable through a transparent process those members of the security forces responsible for abuses; (G) recognize that security forces are intended to protect the safety and security of all citizens equally; and (H) cooperate with regional and international partners to defeat Boko Haram; (6) urges all Nigerians to engage in the electoral process, to insist on full enfranchisement, and to reject inflammatory or divisive rhetoric or actions; and (7) reaffirms that the people of the United States will continue to stand with the people of Nigeria in support of peace and democracy. Mr. McCONNELL. I know of no further debate on this measure. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there any further debate? Hearing none, the question is on agreeing to the resolution. The resolution (S. Res. 65), as amended, was agreed to. Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I further ask unanimous consent that the Menendez substitute amendment to the preamble be considered; that the Rubio amendment to the Menendez amendment to the preamble be considered and agreed to; that the Menendez substitute, as amended, be agreed to; that the preamble, as amended, be agreed to; and the motions to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table with no intervening action or debate. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The amendment (No. 253) is as follows: (Purpose: To amend the preamble) Amend the preamble to read as follows: Whereas Nigeria is the most populous nation in Africa, with the largest economy; Whereas the Governments of the United States and Nigeria have had a strong bilateral relationship, and Nigeria has been a valued partner of the United States since its transition to civilian rule; Whereas the Government of Nigeria is currently confronted with threats to internal security by terrorists, insurgents, and communal violence that have caused considerable population displacement, and at the same time must administer transparent and peaceful elections with a credible outcome; Whereas the government and those who aspire to hold office in Nigeria must demonstrate the political will to address both of these challenges in a responsible way, including by ensuring full enfranchisement, with particular emphasis on developing a means for enfranchisement for the hundreds of thousands displaced by violence; Whereas the members of Jama'atu Ahlis Sunna Lidda'awati wal-Jihad, commonly known as Boko Haram, have terrorized the people of Nigeria with increasing violence since 2009, targeting military, government, and civilian sites in Nigeria, including schools, mosques, churches, markets, villages, and agricultural centers, and killing thousands and abducting hundreds of civilians in Nigeria and the surrounding countries; Whereas the Department of State named several individuals linked to Boko Haram, including its leader, Abubakar Shekau, as Specially Designated Global Terrorists in 2012, and designated Boko Haram as a Foreign Terrorist Organization (FTO) in November 2013; Whereas, in May 2014, the United Nations Security Council added Boko Haram to its al Qaeda sanctions list, and on January 19, 2015, the United Nations Security Council issued a presidential statement condemning the recent escalation of attacks in northeastern Nigeria and surrounding countries and expressing concern that the situation was undermining peace and security in West and Central Africa; Whereas the over 200 school girls abducted by Boko Haram on April 14, 2014, from the Government Girls Secondary School in the northeastern state of Borno, whose kidnapping sparked domestic and international outrage spawning the Twitter campaign #BringBackOurGirls, are still missing; Whereas the militant group is an increasing menace to the countries along Nigeria's northeastern border, prompting the African Union, the Lake Chad Basin Commission, the European Union, and the United Nations Security Council to recognize that there must be a regional response; [[Page S1082]] Whereas the United States Government has stepped forward to offer assistance through intelligence sharing, bilateral and international sanctioning of Boko Haram leaders, counterterrorism assistance through the Global Security Contingency Fund program for countries in the region to counter the militant group, and humanitarian services to populations affected by and vulnerable to Boko Haram violence; Whereas Boko Haram emerged partially as a response to underdevelopment in northeastern Nigeria, and inequality, elite impunity, and alleged human rights abuses by security forces may be fueling anti-government sentiment; Whereas it is clear that a military approach alone will not eliminate the threat of Boko Haram, and gross human rights abuses and atrocities by security forces causes insecurity and mistrust among the civilian population; Whereas it is imperative that the Government of Nigeria implement a comprehensive, civilian security focused plan that prioritizes protecting civilians and also addresses legitimate political and economic grievances of citizens in northern Nigeria; Whereas Nigeria is scheduled to hold national elections in the coming weeks, and the elections appear to be the most closely contested in Nigeria since the return to civilian rule; Whereas election-related violence has occurred in Nigeria in successive elections, including in 2011, when nearly 800 people died in clashes following the presidential election; Whereas President Goodluck Ebele Azikiwe Jonathan, General Muhammadu Buhari, and other presidential candidates pledged to reverse this trend by signing the ``Abuja Accord'' on January 14, 2015, in which they committed themselves and their campaigns to refraining from public statements that incite violence, to running issue-based campaigns that do not seek to divide citizens along religious or ethnic lines, and to supporting the impartial conduct of the electoral commission and the security services; Whereas Secretary of State John Kerry visited Nigeria on January 25, 2015, to emphasize the importance of ensuring the upcoming elections are peaceful, nonviolent, and credible; Whereas, despite the Nigerian Independent National Electoral Commission's (INEC) views that preparations were ``sufficient to conduct free, fair and credible elections as scheduled,'' at the repeated urging of security officials, INEC announced on February 7, 2015, the postponement of the elections by six weeks, and elections will now take place on March 28 and April 11, 2015; Whereas tensions in the country remain high, and either electoral fraud or violence could undermine the credibility of the upcoming election; Whereas the people of Nigeria aspire for a fair, competently executed, and secure electoral process, as well as an outcome that can be accepted peacefully by all citizens; and Whereas it is in the best interest of the United States to maintain close ties with a politically stable, democratic and economically sound Nigeria: Now, therefore, be it The amendment (No. 254) was agreed to, as follows: (Purpose: To illustrate the extreme degree of religious intolerance demonstrated by Boko Haram) Insert after the seventh whereas clause of the preamble the following: Whereas Boko Haram calls for the universal implementation of what it considers ``pure'' Shari'ah law, has called on all Christians to leave northern Nigeria, and perpetrates targeted violent attacks against Christians, churches, schools, mosques, and Muslim critics; The amendment (No. 253) in the nature of a substitute, as amended, was agreed to. The preamble, as amended, was agreed to. The resolution, as amended, with its preamble, as amended, reads as follows: S. Res. 65 Whereas Nigeria is the most populous nation in Africa, with the largest economy; Whereas the Governments of the United States and Nigeria have had a strong bilateral relationship, and Nigeria has been a valued partner of the United States since its transition to civilian rule; Whereas the Government of Nigeria is currently confronted with threats to internal security by terrorists, insurgents, and communal violence that have caused considerable population displacement, and at the same time must administer transparent and peaceful elections with a credible outcome; Whereas the government and those who aspire to hold office in Nigeria must demonstrate the political will to address both of these challenges in a responsible way, including by ensuring full enfranchisement, with particular emphasis on developing a means for enfranchisement for the hundreds of thousands displaced by violence; Whereas the members of Jama'atu Ahlis Sunna Lidda'awati wal-Jihad, commonly known as Boko Haram, have terrorized the people of Nigeria with increasing violence since 2009, targeting military, government, and civilian sites in Nigeria, including schools, mosques, churches, markets, villages, and agricultural centers, and killing thousands and abducting hundreds of civilians in Nigeria and the surrounding countries; Whereas the Department of State named several individuals linked to Boko Haram, including its leader, Abubakar Shekau, as Specially Designated Global Terrorists in 2012, and designated Boko Haram as a Foreign Terrorist Organization (FTO) in November 2013; Whereas, in May 2014, the United Nations Security Council added Boko Haram to its al Qaeda sanctions list, and on January 19, 2015, the United Nations Security Council issued a presidential statement condemning the recent escalation of attacks in northeastern Nigeria and surrounding countries and expressing concern that the situation was undermining peace and security in West and Central Africa; Whereas Boko Haram calls for the universal implementation of what it considers ``pure'' Shari'ah law, has called on all Christians to leave northern Nigeria, and perpetrates targeted violent attacks against Christians, churches, schools, mosques, and Muslim critics; Whereas the over 200 school girls abducted by Boko Haram on April 14, 2014, from the Government Girls Secondary School in the northeastern state of Borno, whose kidnapping sparked domestic and international outrage spawning the Twitter campaign #BringBackOurGirls, are still missing; Whereas the militant group is an increasing menace to the countries along Nigeria's northeastern border, prompting the African Union, the Lake Chad Basin Commission, the European Union, and the United Nations Security Council to recognize that there must be a regional response; Whereas the United States Government has stepped forward to offer assistance through intelligence sharing, bilateral and international sanctioning of Boko Haram leaders, counterterrorism assistance through the Global Security Contingency Fund program for countries in the region to counter the militant group, and humanitarian services to populations affected by and vulnerable to Boko Haram violence; Whereas Boko Haram emerged partially as a response to underdevelopment in northeastern Nigeria, and inequality, elite impunity, and alleged human rights abuses by security forces may be fueling anti-government sentiment; Whereas it is clear that a military approach alone will not eliminate the threat of Boko Haram, and gross human rights abuses and atrocities by security forces causes insecurity and mistrust among the civilian population; Whereas it is imperative that the Government of Nigeria implement a comprehensive, civilian security focused plan that prioritizes protecting civilians and also addresses legitimate political and economic grievances of citizens in northern Nigeria; Whereas Nigeria is scheduled to hold national elections in the coming weeks, and the elections appear to be the most closely contested in Nigeria since the return to civilian rule; Whereas election-related violence has occurred in Nigeria in successive elections, including in 2011, when nearly 800 people died in clashes following the presidential election; Whereas President Goodluck Ebele Azikiwe Jonathan, General Muhammadu Buhari, and other presidential candidates pledged to reverse this trend by signing the ``Abuja Accord'' on January 14, 2015, in which they committed themselves and their campaigns to refraining from public statements that incite violence, to running issue-based campaigns that do not seek to divide citizens along religious or ethnic lines, and to supporting the impartial conduct of the electoral commission and the security services; Whereas Secretary of State John Kerry visited Nigeria on January 25, 2015, to emphasize the importance of ensuring the upcoming elections are peaceful, nonviolent, and credible; Whereas despite the Nigerian Independent National Electoral Commission's (INEC) views that preparations were ``sufficient to conduct free, fair and credible elections as scheduled,'' at the repeated urging of security officials, INEC announced on February 7, 2015, the postponement of the elections by six weeks, and elections will now take place on March 28 and April 11, 2015; Whereas tensions in the country remain high, and either electoral fraud or violence could undermine the credibility of the upcoming election; Whereas the people of Nigeria aspire for a fair, competently executed, and secure electoral process, as well as an outcome that can be accepted peacefully by all citizens; and Whereas it is in the best interest of the United States to maintain close ties with a politically stable, democratic and economically sound Nigeria: Now, therefore, be it Resolved, That the Senate-- (1) condemns Boko Haram for its violent attacks, particularly the indiscriminate targeting of civilians, especially women and girls, and the use of children as fighters and suicide bombers; (2) stands with-- (A) the people of Nigeria in their right to live free from fear or intimidation by state or nonstate actors, regardless of their ethnic, religious, or regional affiliation; (B) the people of Cameroon, Chad, and Niger who are increasingly at risk of becoming victims of Boko Haram's violence; and (C) the international community in its efforts to defeat Boko Haram; [[Page S1083]] (3) supports the Abuja Accord, and calls on candidates, party officials, and adherents of all political movements to comply with the code of conduct spelled out therein, by refraining from any rhetoric or action that seeks to demonize or delegitimize opponents, sow division among Nigerians, or otherwise inflame tensions; (4) condemns any and all abuses of civilians by security forces of the Government of Nigeria; (5) urges the Government of Nigeria to-- (A) adhere to the new timeline for elections announced by INEC on February 7, 2015; (B) refrain from using security concerns as a pretext for impeding the democratic process and using the security apparatus for political purposes in connection with the elections; (C) ensure elections are credible, transparent, and peaceful; (D) prioritize the safety and security of Nigerians vulnerable to Boko Haram attacks; (E) implement a comprehensive, civilian security-focused response to defeat Boko Haram that addresses political and economic grievances of citizens in the north; (F) improve the capacity and conduct of Nigeria's security forces, including respect for human rights, and take steps to hold accountable through a transparent process those members of the security forces responsible for abuses; (G) recognize that security forces are intended to protect the safety and security of all citizens equally; and (H) cooperate with regional and international partners to defeat Boko Haram; (6) urges all Nigerians to engage in the electoral process, to insist on full enfranchisement, and to reject inflammatory or divisive rhetoric or actions; and (7) reaffirms that the people of the United States will continue to stand with the people of Nigeria in support of peace and democracy. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 31 (Tuesday, February 24, 2015)] [Senate] [Pages S1081-S1083] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] SUPPORTING EFFORTS TO BRING AN END TO VIOLENCE PERPETRATED BY BOKO HARAM, AND URGING THE GOVERNMENT OF NIGERIA TO CONDUCT TRANSPARENT, PEACEFUL, AND CREDIBLE ELECTIONS Mr. McCONNELL.

(2) stands with-- (A) the people of Nigeria in their right to live free from fear or intimidation by state or nonstate actors, regardless of their ethnic, religious, or regional affiliation; (B) the people of Cameroon, Chad, and Niger who are increasingly at risk of becoming victims of Boko Haram's violence; and (C) the international community in its efforts to defeat Boko Haram; [[Page S1083]] (3) supports the Abuja Accord, and calls on candidates, party officials, and adherents of all political movements to comply with the code of conduct spelled out therein, by refraining from any rhetoric or action that seeks to demonize or delegitimize opponents, sow division among Nigerians, or otherwise inflame tensions; (4) condemns any and all abuses of civilians by security forces of the Government of Nigeria; (5) urges the Government of Nigeria to-- (A) adhere to the new timeline for elections announced by INEC on February 7, 2015;

(D) prioritize the safety and security of Nigerians vulnerable to Boko Haram attacks; (E) implement a comprehensive, civilian security-focused response to defeat Boko Haram that addresses political and economic grievances of citizens in the north; (F) improve the capacity and conduct of Nigeria's security forces, including respect for human rights, and take steps to hold accountable through a transparent process those members of the security forces responsible for abuses; (G) recognize that security forces are intended to protect the safety and security of all citizens equally; and (H) cooperate with regional and international partners to defeat Boko Haram; (6) urges all Nigerians to engage in the electoral process, to insist on full enfranchisement, and to reject inflammatory or divisive rhetoric or actions;

CREC-2015-02-24-pt1-PgS1083-4,CREC-2015-02-24,114,H-1B VISA PROGRAM,"[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 31 (Tuesday, February 24, 2015)] [Senate] [Pages S1083-S1084] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] H-1B VISA PROGRAM Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, many of my colleagues know I have been fighting for years to end the abuse of the H-1B visa program and help disadvantaged U.S. workers who are harmed by that program. Today I wish to draw the attention of my colleagues to a recent incident that highlights how some employers are potentially using legal avenues to import foreign workers, lay off qualified Americans, and then export jobs overseas. I was shocked by the heartless manner in which U.S. workers were injured in the case I am about to describe. First, I wish to remind my colleagues about how the H-1B program is supposed to work. Under the terms of the H-1B program, U.S. employers may import into the United States each year up to 65,000 so-called specialty occupation workers. The jobs being filled must be a job for which a bachelor's degree is necessary. Even though the annual cap is 65,000, the actual number of foreign workers being imported is much more because of numerous exemptions. In fiscal year 2012, for example, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services approved a total of 262,569 H-1B petitions--way above the legal limit of 65,000 or I should say the supposed limit of 65,000. About 60 percent of H-1B workers come to fill computer-related occupations. Every year the list of the top 10 H-1B employers is dominated by foreign-based companies offering information technology or IT consulting services to the clients. Under the law, H-1B employers are also required to: No. 1, pay the workers the greater of the prevailing wage for that job in that area or the wage the employer pays to similarly qualified U.S. workers doing the same job and at the same time--or the No. 2 condition--provide working conditions that will not adversely affect other similarly employed U.S. workers. Additionally, H-1B employers may not displace a U.S. worker within the period beginning 90 days before and ending 90 days after the date of filing any H-1B petition by that employer. Now I will describe what the program lacks. Most people believe employers try to recruit Americans before they petition for H-1B workers. Yet under the law, not all employers are required to prove to the Department of Labor that they tried to find an American to fill the job first. That is right. American workers do not get the first chance at these jobs in the United States, and if there is an equally or even better qualified U.S. worker, the company does not have to offer him or her that job. I have pushed for changes in the legislation in that law. In fact, I offered several pro-U.S. worker amendments during consideration of the immigration bill in 2013. Every amendment I offered was defeated. The majority at that time--meaning the Democratic majority, and it was a bipartisan majority that helped defeat it--defeated these pro-American worker amendments. They pushed through S. 744, the 2013 immigration bill, without this significant, much needed change. Let me describe to my colleagues the appalling instance referenced above. I have described what the H-1B law was and how, during the immigration debate of 2013, I tried to amend it and improve it, and I wasn't successful. I started my remarks tonight by talking about the abuse of H-1B, the law not being followed, overseas companies bringing workers in here for an American company to employ, and then in turn these jobs are going to be shipped overseas. So now I wish to describe this appalling incident I referenced earlier. Last August, Southern California Edison started laying off 400 American workers from its IT department. The company replaced them with foreign H-1B workers. According to the company, 100 additional American workers who will also be replaced by H-1B workers will leave supposedly voluntarily. According to Computerworld, the final major batch of layoffs is scheduled for March 6 or March 7. The foreign workers who are replacing the American workers at Edison are employees of two overseas-based IT consulting companies that are also two of the largest users of H-1B visas. In 2013 one of the two companies paid the largest immigration fine in U.S. history. That company paid $34 million in a civil settlement after allegations of systemic visa fraud and abuse. The jobs being filled by H-1B workers are manifestly not jobs for which Americans are unavailable. I say that because the jobs are currently filled by skilled American workers. It is disturbing that not only have these American workers been laid off, but also some of them have reportedly had to train their very own replacements. A columnist for the Los Angeles Times writes that by laying off hundreds of its American IT staff and replacing them with relatively low-wage foreign contract workers, Edison stands to save as much as 40 percent in wage costs per laid-off worker. One [[Page S1084]] laid-off Edison worker told the columnist that company supervisors told a group of workers last year: ``We can get four Indian guys far cheaper than the price of you.'' Worse yet, most of the 500 jobs that had been held by Americans will eventually just move overseas. According to the Los Angeles Times, Edison admits that eventually about 70 percent of the work will shift overseas permanently. Edison describes the 400 layoffs as a ``transition'' to the foreign IT consulting companies that ``will lead to enhancements that deliver faster and more efficient tools and applications for services that customers rely on.'' Then it adds further: ``[T]hrough outsourcing, [Edison's] information technology organization will adopt a proven business strategy commonly and successfully used by top U.S. companies that [Edison] benchmarks against.'' With respect to replacing American workers with H-1B workers, Edison says the company ``is not hiring H-1B workers to replace displaced employees.'' Edison's cynical defense is built upon a very shameless exploitation of a loophole in the H-1B laws. That loophole says that technically Edison isn't the H-1B workers' employer; the two foreign consulting companies are. The H-1B workers are just contracted out for extended, potentially multiyear periods from the foreign consulting companies to the American company, Edison. Thus, Edison argues that it is not subject to the requirements under the immigration laws that I spoke of earlier. They argue that because they are not the employer who petitioned directly for the H-1B workers, they--Edison--don't have to abide by the working condition requirements or the 90-day rule. The condemnation of this attack on American workers has been very quick and, quite frankly, bipartisan. On February 10 over 300 members of the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers rallied in Irvine, CA, in support of their fellow Edison employees. Several Members of Congress have expressed concern about the situation. On February 17 the Economic Policy Institute sent a letter to the Secretary of Labor asking him to investigate the Edison layoffs. Specifically, the institute asked the Secretary of Labor to determine whether Edison, the foreign consulting companies, or any of the parties involved in these layoffs violated the requirements that the hiring of H-1B workers not ``adversely affect the wages and working conditions of U.S. workers comparably employed.'' I echo the request of the Economic Policy Institute. The prohibition on adversely affecting U.S. workers can reasonably be applied to situations, such as in the Edison case, where the H-1B workers are contractors at a worksite rather than employees. I also draw your attention to a powerful February 16 Los Angeles Times editorial entitled ``End H-1B visa program's abuse.'' The Los Angeles Times calls Edison's action ``part of a years-long trend among companies of misusing H-1B visas to undercut wages and offshore high- paying American jobs.'' The Los Angeles Times concludes that the H-1B program, although perhaps well-intentioned, is ``broken'' and that ``Congress needs to fix it.'' And, of course, I could not agree more, as evidenced by all the amendments I offered in 2013 on the immigration bill. This situation with Southern California Edison is not new. It is happening time and time again. American workers are losing out because the law is not strong enough to protect them, so it needs to be fixed. Any proposal to reform the H-1B program must include substantially increased protections for U.S. workers such as I have proposed many times in the past. These protections must at a minimum include the requirement that companies first recruit here at home before they import more foreign workers. We also need to reform the H-1B wage requirements so that U.S. workers' wages would no longer be undercut by H-1B workers' wages. There also needs to be more oversight of the program, including random audits of those who use the program. Tightening the law to ensure that U.S. workers have the first opportunity at high-paying, high-skilled jobs in this country is a no- brainer. Yet there is so much opposition to this philosophy. I just cannot believe the opposition. As I stated earlier, the majority in the last Congress--and that happened to be a bipartisan majority--pushed for changes to the H-1B program but voted against every single amendment I offered to ensure that U.S. workers were given priority. Now there is a lot of fanfare and a lot of talk about a high-skilled bill that has been reintroduced in the Senate that would increase the annual number of H-1B visas. The sponsors of the bill claim it will ``boost our competitiveness in the global economy.'' This bill only makes the problems worse. It doesn't plug the loopholes. It doesn't make sure American workers are put before foreign workers. It doesn't ensure that employers don't use the program to pay cheaper wages, which then in turn disadvantages U.S. workers. The H-1B program could be a very worthwhile program. According to the original intent, I obviously would support it because we want workers to do the jobs that need to be done in America, but it should first be people who are already here. Our employment-based immigration programs could have served and could again serve a valuable purpose if used properly. However, they are being misused and abused. They are failing the American worker. Reforms are needed to put integrity back into the programs and to ensure that American workers and students are given every chance to fill vacant jobs in this country. So I am putting my colleagues on notice that I am committed to this effort. As chairman of the Judiciary Committee, I don't intend on allowing legislation to move through this body without reforms to the H-1B program that protect American workers. I yield the floor. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 31 (Tuesday, February 24, 2015)] [Senate] [Pages S1083-S1084] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] H-1B VISA PROGRAM Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, many of my colleagues know I have been fighting for years to end the abuse of the H-1B visa program and help disadvantaged U.S. workers who are harmed by that program. Today I wish to draw the attention of my colleagues to a recent incident that highlights how some employers are potentially using legal avenues to import foreign workers, lay off qualified Americans, and then export jobs overseas. I was shocked by the heartless manner in which U.S. workers were injured in the case I am about to describe. First, I wish to remind my colleagues about how the H-1B program is supposed to work. Under the terms of the H-1B program, U.S. employers may import into the United States each year up to 65,000 so-called specialty occupation workers. The jobs being filled must be a job for which a bachelor's degree is necessary. Even though the annual cap is 65,000, the actual number of foreign workers being imported is much more because of numerous exemptions. In fiscal year 2012, for example, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services approved a total of 262,569 H-1B petitions--way above the legal limit of 65,000 or I should say the supposed limit of 65,000.

august, southern california edison started laying off 400 american workers from its it department. the company replaced them with foreign h-1b workers. according to the company, 100 additional american workers who will also be replaced by h-1b workers will leave supposedly voluntarily. according to computerworld, the final major batch of layoffs is scheduled for march 6 or march 7. the foreign workers who are replacing the american workers at edison are employees of two overseas-based it consulting companies that are also two of the largest users of h-1b visas. in 2013 one of the two companies paid the largest immigration fine in u.s. history. that company paid $34 million in a civil settlement after allegations of systemic visa fraud and abuse. the jobs being filled by h-1b workers are manifestly not jobs for which americans are unavailable. i say that because the jobs are currently filled by skilled american workers. it is disturbing that not only have these american workers been laid off, but also some of them have reportedly had to train their very own replacements. a columnist for the los angeles times writes that by laying off hundreds of its american it staff and replacing them with relatively low-wage foreign contract workers, edison stands to save as much as 40 percent in wage costs per laid-off worker. one [[page s1084]] laid-off edison worker told the columnist that company supervisors told a group of workers last year: ``we can get four indian guys far cheaper than the price of you.'' worse yet, most of the 500 jobs that had been held by americans will eventually just move overseas. according to the los angeles times, edison admits that eventually about 70 percent of the work will shift overseas permanently. edison describes the 400 layoffs as a ``transition'' to the foreign it consulting companies that ``will lead to enhancements that deliver faster and more efficient tools and applications for services that customers rely on.'' then it adds further: ``[t]hrough outsourcing, [edison's] information technology organization will adopt a proven business strategy commonly and successfully used by top u.s. companies that [edison] benchmarks against.'' with respect to replacing american workers with h-1b workers, edison says the company ``is not hiring h-1b workers to replace displaced employees.'' edison's cynical defense is built upon a very shameless exploitation of a loophole in the h-1b laws. that loophole says that technically edison isn't the h-1b workers' employer; the two foreign consulting companies are. the h-1b workers are just contracted out for extended, potentially multiyear periods from the foreign consulting companies to the american company, edison. thus, edison argues that it is not subject to the requirements under the immigration laws that i spoke of earlier. they argue that because they are not the employer who petitioned directly for the h-1b workers, they--edison--don't have to abide by the working condition requirements or the 90-day rule. the condemnation of this attack on american workers has been very quick and, quite frankly, bipartisan. on february 10 over 300 members of the international brotherhood of electrical workers rallied in irvine, ca, in support of their fellow edison employees. several members of congress have expressed concern about the situation. on february 17 the economic policy institute sent a letter to the secretary of labor asking him to investigate the edison layoffs. specifically, the institute asked the secretary of labor to determine whether edison, the foreign consulting companies, or any of the parties involved in these layoffs violated the requirements that the hiring of h-1b workers not ``adversely affect the wages and working conditions of u.s. workers comparably employed.'' i echo the request of the economic policy institute. the prohibition on adversely affecting u.s. workers can reasonably be applied to situations, such as in the edison case, where the h-1b workers are contractors at a worksite rather than employees. i also draw your attention to a powerful february 16 los angeles times editorial entitled ``end h-1b visa program's abuse.'' the los angeles times calls edison's action ``part of a years-long trend among companies of misusing h-1b visas to undercut wages and offshore high- paying american jobs.'' the los angeles times concludes that the h-1b program, although perhaps well-intentioned, is ``broken'' and that ``congress needs to fix it.'' and, of course, i could not agree more, as evidenced by all the amendments i offered in 2013 on the immigration bill. this situation with southern california edison is not new. it is happening time and time again. american workers are losing out because the law is not strong enough to protect them, so it needs to be fixed. any proposal to reform the h-1b program must include substantially increased protections for u.s. workers such as i have proposed many times in the past. these protections must at a minimum include the requirement that companies first recruit here at home before they import more foreign workers. we also need to reform the h-1b wage requirements so that u.s. workers' wages would no longer be undercut by h-1b workers' wages. there also needs to be more oversight of the program, including random audits of those who use the program. tightening the law to ensure that u.s. workers have the first opportunity at high-paying, high-skilled jobs in this country is a no- brainer. yet there is so much opposition to this philosophy. i just cannot believe the opposition. as i stated earlier, the majority in the last congress--and that happened to be a bipartisan majority--pushed for changes to the h-1b program but voted against every single amendment i offered to ensure that u.s. workers were given priority. now there is a lot of fanfare and a lot of talk about a high-skilled bill that has been reintroduced in the senate that would increase the annual number of h-1b visas. the sponsors of the bill claim it will ``boost our competitiveness in the global economy.'' this bill only makes the problems worse. it doesn't plug the loopholes. it doesn't make sure american workers are put before foreign workers. it doesn't ensure that employers don't use the program to pay cheaper wages, which then in turn disadvantages u.s. workers. the h-1b program could be a very worthwhile program. according to the original intent, i obviously would support it because we want workers to do the jobs that need to be done in america, but it should first be people who are already here. our employment-based immigration programs could have served and could again serve a valuable purpose if used properly. however, they are being misused and abused. they are failing the american worker. reforms are needed to put integrity back into the programs and to ensure that american workers and students are given every chance to fill vacant jobs in this country. so i am putting my colleagues on notice that i am committed to this effort. as chairman of the judiciary committee, i don't intend on allowing legislation to move through this body without reforms to the h-1b program that protect american workers. i yield the floor. ____________________",10948

SCOTT JARVIS, USAF ______ HON. DOUG LAMBORN of colorado in the house of representatives Tuesday, February 24, 2015 Mr. LAMBORN. Mr. Speaker, in a few short weeks an inspirational military leader will retire after serving his country proudly for over three decades. Today I recognize and commend Colonel R. Scott Jarvis for his exceptional leadership over those 30 years, most recently as the Deputy Director for Installations and Mission Support, and Command Civil Engineer at Headquarters Air Force Space Command, Peterson Air Force Base, Colorado. The son of a career Air Force officer, Colonel Jarvis graduated from Iowa State University with a Bachelor of Science degree in Civil Engineering and was commissioned a Civil Engineer officer in the United States Air Force in 1985. Throughout his career, he earned additional Masters degrees in International Relations, Military Operational Art and Science, and National Security and Strategic Studies. An outstanding leader throughout his distinguished career, Colonel Jarvis' service has spanned the country with assignments in North Dakota, Colorado, Hawaii, Idaho, Alabama, Rhode Island, and Washington, DC, and stretched across the world with tours in the United Kingdom, Japan, and Germany. He commanded at the squadron and group levels at Mountain Home Air Force Base, Idaho, and Kadena Air Base, Japan, respectively. Additionally, he commanded a 13-person deployed Civic Action Team in the remote location of Chuuk, Micronesia, with politico- military responsibilities. Early in his career, Colonel Jarvis also deployed to Turkey and northern Iraq as commander of a 19-person well- drilling team supporting Operation PROVIDE COMFORT I. Colonel Jarvis has served at both major command and Air Force levels in the programming and housing arenas. Most notably, as Chief of the Unaccompanied Housing Program for the Air Force Civil Engineer, he was one of the original architects of the Air Force Dorm Master Plan, which served as the foundation for the Air Force initiative to replace or renovate every dorm in its inventory. The program vastly improved quality of life for over 70,000 Airmen living in 875 dorms throughout the Air Force. Prior to his current assignment, Colonel Jarvis served as the Deputy Director for Installations, Logistics, and Mission Support, and Command Civil Engineer, at Headquarters United States Air Forces in Europe, Ramstein Air Base, Germany. In that capacity, he was responsible for all civil engineering activities for over 9,000 civil engineer personnel operating and maintaining USAFE's $15.7 billion physical plant at 10 major installations and numerous smaller installations. Colonel Jarvis has been recognized for excellence at all levels in the Air Force, to include accolades at the Squadron, Group and Wing levels. In addition to numerous military decorations, his significant recognition includes the 2008 Air Force Major General Robert H. Curtin Award for Most Outstanding Large Civil Engineer Unit, the 1996 Air Force Civil Engineering Staff Action Officer of the Year, and the 1991 Third Air Force Civil Engineering Military Manager of the Year. Additionally, Colonel Jarvis was recognized for invaluable contributions to the engineering profession in 2013, when he was named to the Society of American Military Engineers Academy of Fellows. This honor is bestowed to a select few engineers each year for dedication to mentorship and outstanding service to the Society and the military engineering profession. Colonel R. Scott Jarvis epitomizes excellence, integrity and commitment to service. He has dedicated his life to serving our nation and advancing the engineering profession. I join my colleagues today in honoring his admirable service to our nation and all the Airmen, Sailors, Soldiers, Marines, and civilians who have served alongside him. We offer our heartfelt appreciation to Scott, his wife Meg, and their daughters, Maddie and Lucy, and hearty congratulations on his retirement from the United States Air Force. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 31 (Tuesday, February 24, 2015)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E231] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] TRIBUTE TO COLONEL R.

STEVE ISRAEL of new york in the house of representatives Tuesday, February 24, 2015 Mr. ISRAEL. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize February as National Marfan Awareness Month with the hope that increased awareness of Marfan syndrome and related heritable connective tissue disorders will save lives. Raising awareness of Marfan syndrome, a rare genetic condition affecting 1 in 5,000 Americans, is imperative to finding and funding effective treatment. This debilitating condition affects individuals both externally and internally. Connective tissue, as a result of the overproduction of a protein called transforming growth factor beta (TGFB), is affected and therefore symptoms manifest throughout the entire body, causing disproportionately long limbs, a protruding or indented chest bone, curved spine, and loose joints. Understanding the signs and features of Marfan syndrome are important and can save lives. This condition can affect all aspects of a person's internal structures, most notably their cardiovascular system. Often times, the aorta, the larger artery that carries blood away from the heart, is weakened and prone to enlargement and potential rupture. Because of the excess TGFB, Marfan patients are also at risk of aortic aneurysm. However, early diagnosis and treatment can help to prevent cardiac events. For this reason, I believe States should consider developing programs to include Marfan syndrome testing in their sports screening criteria for at-risk young athletes. I am proud to represent the Marfan Foundation, the leading organization working to support the Marfan community, based in Port Washington, New York. Since the group's inception, the Foundation has worked tirelessly to improve the lives of those affected by this condition through advancing research, raising awareness, and providing support over the past two decades. Through their efforts, patient care has improved and lives have been saved. I urge my colleagues to stand with me to recognize National Marfan Awareness Month and reflect on the progress that has been made as well as the work that remains in order to ensure that those suffering from rare conditions can expect to see improvements in their health and healthcare. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 31 (Tuesday, February 24, 2015)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E232] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] RECOGNIZING FEBRUARY AS NATIONAL MARFAN AWARENESS MONTH ______ HON.

PARKER, JR. ______ HON. SANFORD D. BISHOP, JR. of georgia in the house of representatives Tuesday, February 24, 2015 Mr. BISHOP of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, it is with a heavy heart and solemn remembrance that I rise today to pay tribute to a respected public servant, outstanding citizen, and hero to his community, Lt. Randall E. Parker, Jr. Sadly, Lt. Parker passed away in the line of duty on Wednesday, February 11, 2015. Funeral services will be held on Monday, February 16, 2015 at 11:00 a.m. at the Macon City Auditorium in Macon, Georgia. Lt. Parker was a native to Georgia and had served as a firefighter with the Macon Bibb County Fire Department since July 2, 1990. In addition to risking his life everyday to fight fires in the area, Lt. Parker was very active in his community and went above and beyond to show his love and compassion for those around him. He was heavily involved in his church, Christ Chapel Sportstowne in Macon, and also spent time doing work for United Way, the American Cancer Society, and the Macon Cherry Blossom Festival. He was a loving family man to his wife and sons, and his legacy will live on in the minds and hearts of all those whose lives he touched in Middle Georgia. George Washington Carver once said, ``No individual has any right to come into the world and go out of it without leaving behind him distinct and legitimate reasons for having passed through it.'' Although his passing was tragic and before his time, Lt. Parker proved to us all what it truly means to be a hero. He left this world doing what he loved most--serving the people of Macon, Georgia.

We appreciate your leadership in coordinating this special order to honor the 106th Anniversary of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP). More than a century ago, the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People was founded in New York City. The month was February and would later come to mark Black History Month. As a child of the Civil Rights Movement, I witnessed firsthand the leadership of the NAACP in fight for human rights. I vividly remember the role the NAACP played in shattering segregation in my birthplace of El Paso, Texas and in my personal life. [[Page E233]] When I was in high school, it was nearly impossible for young women of color to become cheerleaders. At the time, I was participating in a work-study program at Pacoima Memorial Lutheran Credit Union and my boss, John Mance, was a member of the local NAACP Board. Together, he and Carl McCraven, the CEO of the credit union, worked to change the rules so anyone should try out to be a cheerleader. Thanks to them, I was able to cheer for the Tigers! We all know their great contributions that the NAACP has made to our nation: From their largest legal victory in Brown vs. the Board of Education, under the leadership of Special Counsel Thurgood Marshall--to their central role in the successful battles to overturn Jim Crow. Today, the nation's oldest and largest civil rights organization continues to engage in groundbreaking and critical work to combat disparity and inequality in our society. Today, they boldly stand against repressive voter ID laws, economic inequality and mass incarceration. We know that inequality persists--the unemployment rate among African Americans is nearly twice the rate of their white counterparts and the African American poverty rate is nearly three times the poverty rate of white Americans. These statistics paint a clear picture of inequality in America. The American dream of equality, freedom, liberty, justice and opportunity should be open to all and the NAACP is working day-in and day-out to ensure that all Americans have an opportunity to achieve the American dream. I am proud that the NAACP has been a dedicated and constant partner and advocate. I am proud to join my colleagues in honoring the NAACP's 106th anniversary.

These statistics paint a clear picture of inequality in America.

[[page e233]] when i was in high school, it was nearly impossible for young women of color to become cheerleaders. at the time, i was participating in a work-study program at pacoima memorial lutheran credit union and my boss, john mance, was a member of the local naacp board. together, he and carl mccraven, the ceo of the credit union, worked to change the rules so anyone should try out to be a cheerleader. thanks to them, i was able to cheer for the tigers! we all know their great contributions that the naacp has made to our nation: from their largest legal victory in brown vs. the board of education, under the leadership of special counsel thurgood marshall--to their central role in the successful battles to overturn jim crow. today, the nation's oldest and largest civil rights organization continues to engage in groundbreaking and critical work to combat disparity and inequality in our society. today, they boldly stand against repressive voter id laws, economic inequality and mass incarceration. we know that inequality persists--the unemployment rate among african americans is nearly twice the rate of their white counterparts and the african american poverty rate is nearly three times the poverty rate of white americans. these statistics paint a clear picture of inequality in america. the american dream of equality, freedom, liberty, justice and opportunity should be open to all and the naacp is working day-in and day-out to ensure that all americans have an opportunity to achieve the american dream. i am proud that the naacp has been a dedicated and constant partner and advocate. i am proud to join my colleagues in honoring the naacp's 106th anniversary. mr. speaker, i urge my colleagues to support this resolution. ____________________",2908

Mr. Speaker, I rise to pay tribute to the legendary Antioch Missionary Baptist Church in Houston, Texas, which this year celebrates 149 years of service to the greater Houston community and the nation. For more than a half century, under the leadership of the Rev. F.N. Williams, Sr., the Antioch Missionary Baptist Church, now led by Rev. O.B. Winkley, has provided material support and spiritual sanctuary to the least of God's children and used the prophetic voice of the church to speak truth to power. Mr. Speaker, in January 1866, seven months after slaves were freed in Texas (June 19, 1865), a small group of freed slaves, assisted by the First Baptist Church and missionaries, organized the first African American Baptist Church in Houston, Texas. After holding worship services at the First Baptist Church and the German Baptist Church, church members began to hold services on Buffalo Bayou in ``Brush Arbor.'' Later, the church moved to ``Baptist Hill'' located at Rusk and Bagby until the present site was purchased. In 1868, one of Antioch Missionary Baptist Church's members, Jack Yates, was ordained at the first meeting of the Association of African American Baptist Churches. Rev. Jack Yates became the first pastor of Antioch Missionary Baptist Church and as the membership grew and additional space was needed, Rev. Yates led the church to purchase its present site and build a brick structure. Antioch Missionary Baptist Church's new home was the first brick structure built and owned by African-Americans in Houston, and was located in the center of Freedman's Town and was the center of activity for the African-American community. Antioch Missionary Baptist Church provided the former slaves with opportunities to worship the Lord, but also established ministries to help them develop educationally, economically and socially. With the help of two missionaries, Rev. Yates began the Baptist Academy, which taught such fundamental skills as reading, writing, and arithmetic, and provided vocational training to enable men and women to start their own businesses. Mr. Speaker, Baptist Academy would later become Houston College, the forerunner of Texas Southern University. Under Rev. Yates' leadership, church members were encouraged and assisted in buying property, owning homes, and developing businesses. The Old Landmark Baptist Association of Texas was organized at Antioch and Emancipation Park was purchased in a joint venture with Trinity Methodist Church to provide green space to engage in recreational activities and hold community celebrations, such as Juneteenth. Mr. Speaker, I take great pride in recognizing the Antioch Missionary Baptist Church [[Page E234]] and the Rev. O.B.

Mr. Speaker, I rise today to introduce a bill recognizing persons of African descent and to support a resolution authored by my colleague Representative Hank Johnson to commemorate the start of the International Decade for People of African Descent. As our country fights to realize justice for Eric Garner, Tamir Rice, Aiyana Jones, John Warner, Trayvon Martin, Michael Brown, and many others, we must not forget the names--Stephen Lawrence, Oury Jalloh, Mark Duggan, Zyed Benna, Bouna Traore and many others who are victims of similar injustices in Europe and elsewhere around the world. The International Decade provides an opportunity to join efforts with countries across the globe to, over the next decade, develop and implement national strategies honoring the vast contributions of people of African Descent, and to combat continuing issues of prejudice and discrimination such as those currently gripping our nation. To aid these efforts, I am proud to support Representative Johnson's resolution commemorating the International Decade. I have also introduced the African Descent Affairs Act. The Act to improve the situation of people of African descent around the world, by establishing a Global Office of African Descent Affairs within the U.S. State Department that would implement strategies for people of African descent; create a ``President Obama Fund'' to support anti- discrimination and empowerment efforts by African descent led civil society organizations; and require that the Annual State Department Human Rights Reports include a section on discrimination faced by people of African descent. U.S. foreign policy strategies such as these have improved the situation of vulnerable groups internationally. Furthermore, it would greatly assist in responding to the increasing levels of prejudice and discrimination faced by people of African descent around the globe. Mr. Speaker, the International Decade reaffirms the importance of inclusion, as well as full and equal participation of people of African descent around the world in all aspects of political, economic, social, and cultural life. I encourage my colleagues to join me in recognizing and celebrating the collective history and achievements made by people of African descent on the occasion of the launch of the International Decade by supporting this important resolution. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 31 (Tuesday, February 24, 2015)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E234] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] INTRODUCING THE AFRICAN DESCENT AFFAIRS ACT IN RECOGNITION OF THE INTERNATIONAL DECADE FOR PEOPLE OF AFRICAN DESCENT ______ HON.

The International Decade provides an opportunity to join efforts with countries across the globe to, over the next decade, develop and implement national strategies honoring the vast contributions of people of African Descent, and to combat continuing issues of prejudice and discrimination such as those currently gripping our nation. To aid these efforts, I am proud to support Representative Johnson's resolution commemorating the International Decade. I have also introduced the African Descent Affairs Act. The Act to improve the situation of people of African descent around the world, by establishing a Global Office of African Descent Affairs within the U.S. State Department that would implement strategies for people of African descent; create a ``President Obama Fund'' to support anti- discrimination and empowerment efforts by African descent led civil society organizations; and require that the Annual State Department Human Rights Reports include a section on discrimination faced by people of African descent. U.S. foreign policy strategies such as these have improved the situation of vulnerable groups internationally. Furthermore, it would greatly assist in responding to the increasing levels of prejudice and discrimination faced by people of African descent around the globe. Mr. Speaker, the International Decade reaffirms the importance of inclusion, as well as full and equal participation of people of African descent around the world in all aspects of political, economic, social, and cultural life. I encourage my colleagues to join me in recognizing and celebrating the collective history and achievements made by people of African descent on the occasion of the launch of the International Decade by supporting this important resolution. ____________________","Congressional Record, Volume 161 Issue 31 (Tuesday, February 24, 2015) [Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 31 (Tuesday, February 24, 2015)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E234] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] INTRODUCING THE AFRICAN DESCENT AFFAIRS ACT IN RECOGNITION OF THE INTERNATIONAL DECADE FOR PEOPLE OF AFRICAN DESCENT ______ HON.

Mr. Edwards served his country in the United States Army, was respected in his community, and dedicated his life to his family. Mr. Edwards was born on April 24, 1928, the youngest of John and Cora Edwards' 10 children, and he grew up in Woodland, North Carolina. He loved everything about school and thrived as a student and an athlete. He played basketball and ran track, but he found the most success on the football gridiron. Mr. Edwards continued his education at Virginia State University and Howard University. A proud soldier, Mr. Edwards served his country in the United States Army and loved the experience of traveling the world. After completing his tour, he relocated to the Washington, DC, area to be near to his older sister, Mabel. It was here that he met his wife, Mary, who was one of his sister's best customers. Their love story was one for the ages. He succeeded in his tireless pursuit to earn her hand in marriage, and their 53 years of marriage produced three children, Kenny, Robert, and Yvette. Mr. Edwards retired after many years of working as a guard at the National Gallery of Art here in Washington. He also worked for several years in security at the YWCA. He will be remembered within the community as a man of great dignity and generosity to all who had a need. In his signature hat and tie, he stood tall, walked straight, and greeted everyone with a broad smile and the love of God. He passed from this life on February 10, 2015 at age 86. I offer my sincerest condolences to Mr. Edwards' beloved wife, Mary Edwards; his son, Bobby; three grandchildren; three great- grandchildren; his nieces and nephews; and a host of friends and neighbors.

Mr. Speaker, last weekend, the State of Connecticut lost one of its great sons with the passing of Col. John G. Chiarella, Sr., a veteran from Waterbury who continued to serve his nation, state and community long after his military career ended. Col. Chiarella entered the United States Army in 1950 and was deployed to Korea in October 1952. He became a Reservist in 1953 and was called back to active duty during the Berlin Crisis. He achieved the rank of colonel in 1975 and retired from the military after 34 years of exemplary service. When he returned to his hometown of Waterbury, Col. Chiarella dedicated himself to the community he loved. Reflecting his commitment to all who have served in the Armed Forces, ``the Colonel,'' as everyone knew him, led the Waterbury Veterans Memorial Committee for over 25 years. As chairman, he helped countless veterans and their families receive the services, benefits, and recognition they deserved. In 2011, John Chiarella was inducted into the Connecticut Veterans Hall of Fame, in recognition of his extraordinary commitment to his fellow veterans, as well as his dedication to future generations, which he demonstrated by establishing patriotic programs for school children. Col. Chiarella was also a devoted family man. He loved his late wife, Ann--who he called ``the General''--with all of his heart. They were married for 59 years before her death in 2011. He and Ann raised a beautiful family with three sons, and seven grandchildren. I had the great fortune to know Col. Chiarella and call him my friend. His warm heart, wonderful sense of humor, infectious smile, and love of life touched all who knew him. He truly left the world a better place. Col. Chiarella's life embodied the spirit of civic engagement that strengthens our communities, and makes our country a better place. His contributions to the City of Waterbury, the State of Connecticut, and to the United States will not be forgotten. Colonel, we love you and miss you. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 31 (Tuesday, February 24, 2015)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E235] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] HONORING THE LIFE AND SERVICE OF COL.

JOHN G. CHIARELLA, SR. ______ HON. ELIZABETH H. ESTY of connecticut in the house of representatives Tuesday, February 24, 2015 Ms. ESTY. Mr. Speaker, last weekend, the State of Connecticut lost one of its great sons with the passing of Col. John G. Chiarella, Sr., a veteran from Waterbury who continued to serve his nation, state and community long after his military career ended. Col. Chiarella entered the United States Army in 1950 and was deployed to Korea in October 1952. He became a Reservist in 1953 and was called back to active duty during the Berlin Crisis. He achieved the rank of colonel in 1975 and retired from the military after 34 years of exemplary service. When he returned to his hometown of Waterbury, Col. Chiarella dedicated himself to the community he loved. Reflecting his commitment to all who have served in the Armed Forces, ``the Colonel,'' as everyone knew him, led the Waterbury Veterans Memorial Committee for over 25 years. As chairman, he helped countless veterans and their families receive the services, benefits, and recognition they deserved. In 2011, John Chiarella was inducted into the Connecticut Veterans Hall of Fame, in recognition of his extraordinary commitment to his fellow veterans, as well as his dedication to future generations, which he demonstrated by establishing patriotic programs for school children. Col. Chiarella was also a devoted family man. He loved his late wife, Ann--who he called ``the General''--with all of his heart. They were married for 59 years before her death in 2011. He and Ann raised a beautiful family with three sons, and seven grandchildren. I had the great fortune to know Col. Chiarella and call him my friend. His warm heart, wonderful sense of humor, infectious smile, and love of life touched all who knew him. He truly left the world a better place. Col. Chiarella's life embodied the spirit of civic engagement that strengthens our communities, and makes our country a better place. His contributions to the City of Waterbury, the State of Connecticut, and to the United States will not be forgotten. Colonel, we love you and miss you. ____________________",package_114_116.csv,2390,2390,2461,"[congressional record volume 161, number 31 (tuesday, february 24, 2015)] [extensions of remarks] [page e235] from the congressional record online through the government publishing office [ www.gpo.gov ] honoring the life and service of col. john g. chiarella, sr. ______ hon. elizabeth h. esty of connecticut in the house of representatives tuesday, february 24, 2015 ms. esty. mr. speaker, last weekend, the state of connecticut lost one of its great sons with the passing of col. john g. chiarella, sr., a veteran from waterbury who continued to serve his nation, state and community long after his military career ended. col. chiarella entered the united states army in 1950 and was deployed to korea in october 1952. he became a reservist in 1953 and was called back to active duty during the berlin crisis. he achieved the rank of colonel in 1975 and retired from the military after 34 years of exemplary service. when he returned to his hometown of waterbury, col. chiarella dedicated himself to the community he loved. reflecting his commitment to all who have served in the armed forces, ``the colonel,'' as everyone knew him, led the waterbury veterans memorial committee for over 25 years. as chairman, he helped countless veterans and their families receive the services, benefits, and recognition they deserved. in 2011, john chiarella was inducted into the connecticut veterans hall of fame, in recognition of his extraordinary commitment to his fellow veterans, as well as his dedication to future generations, which he demonstrated by establishing patriotic programs for school children. col. chiarella was also a devoted family man. he loved his late wife, ann--who he called ``the general''--with all of his heart. they were married for 59 years before her death in 2011. he and ann raised a beautiful family with three sons, and seven grandchildren. i had the great fortune to know col. chiarella and call him my friend. his warm heart, wonderful sense of humor, infectious smile, and love of life touched all who knew him. he truly left the world a better place. col. chiarella's life embodied the spirit of civic engagement that strengthens our communities, and makes our country a better place. his contributions to the city of waterbury, the state of connecticut, and to the united states will not be forgotten. colonel, we love you and miss you. ____________________",2390

ELEANOR HOLMES NORTON of the district of columbia in the house of representatives Tuesday, February 24, 2015 Ms. NORTON. Mr. Speaker, today, I introduce the District of Columbia Local Prosecutor Establishment Act of 2015, to give District of Columbia residents another element of the self-government enjoyed by all other American citizens. The bill would establish a local prosecutor's office designated under local law, to prosecute all local crimes in the District. Under the Home Rule Act, the U.S. Attorney's Office for the District of Columbia, a federal entity, is responsible for prosecuting most local crimes here, the greater part of its caseload, in addition to prosecuting federal crimes. This bill is special because it effectuates a 2002 advisory referendum, approved by 82 percent of D.C. voters, to create a local prosecutor's office. There is no law enforcement issue of greater importance to D.C. residents on which they have less say than the prosecution of local crimes here. A U.S. Attorney has no business prosecuting the local crimes of a jurisdiction, an anachronism that is out of place in any American self-governing jurisdiction. The goal of the legislation is to give the District the same jurisdiction over the criminal justice matters that state and local jurisdictions justifiably regard as mandatory. The U.S. Attorney for the District of Columbia would continue to handle federal matters, like the other U.S. Attorneys in our country. As presently constituted, the U.S. Attorney's Office for the District of Columbia is the largest in the country, only because it also serves as the local city prosecutor. The U.S. Attorney for the District of Columbia needs to be freed up to handle national security and other vital federal cases, particularly in the post-9/11 nation's capital. Amending the Home Rule Act to create a local prosecutor would be an important step toward our goal of achieving true self-government. I urge my colleagues to support this important measure. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 31 (Tuesday, February 24, 2015)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E235] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] INTRODUCTION OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA LOCAL PROSECUTOR ESTABLISHMENT ACT OF 2015 ______ HON.

TODD C. YOUNG of indiana in the house of representatives Tuesday, February 24, 2015 Mr. YOUNG of Indiana. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the great work of Bosma Enterprises as they celebrate their 100th anniversary. For the past century, Bosma Enterprises has been dedicated to creating opportunities for people who are blind or visually impaired across the great state of Indiana. Located in Indianapolis, Bosma Enterprises' commitment has made a difference in the lives of thousands of Hoosiers, showing them how to live life to its fullest. The loss of one's eyesight is a significant disability that impacts the lives of more than 140,000 Hoosiers and over 6 million individuals nationwide. Since 1915, Bosma Enterprises has continued to provide hope to those who are blind or visually impaired by showing them that vision loss does not have to mean a loss of independence. They have done this by providing blind or visually impaired individuals with job training, employment services, rehabilitation programs, and outreach programs, empowering those Hoosiers to reach their own personal goals while giving them the tools to live independently. Over the last 100 years, Bosma Enterprises has been able to change the lives of many by helping them navigate the complexities of finding meaningful employment, teaching critical daily living skills, and working to fight the 70 percent unemployment rate for people who are blind or visually impaired. I hope the entire House of Representatives will join me in congratulating Bosma Enterprises on their monumental milestone. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 31 (Tuesday, February 24, 2015)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E236] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] HONORING BOSMA ENTERPRISES OF CENTRAL INDIANA ______ HON.

The government could not come close to replacing the hundreds of billions of dollars in work done by these organizations, and one of the most respected charitable groups in the U.S. is the Shrine.

On Thanksgiving Day 1950, the Knoxville Kerbela Shriners began a paper sale to benefit the East Tennessee Crippled Children's Fund, raising $19,000 the first year. Over the next 75 years, with the help of the Blue Lodge Masons, the Kerbela Shrine Temple raised $13 million for handicapped and burned children through this one tradition.

ED PERLMUTTER of colorado in the house of representatives Tuesday, February 24, 2015 Mr. PERLMUTTER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and applaud Rachel Grace Hultin for receiving the 2014 Wheat Ridge City Council Partnership Award. The Wheat Ridge City Council Partnership Award recognizes a company or individual for their overall contributions to the City. It incorporates business achievements as well as contributions in volunteerism, leadership, and community investment and involvement. Rachel Grace Hultin is very active in the Wheat Ridge community with an emphasis on health and wellness. She was instrumental in leading the charge to have Wheat Ridge designated as a Healthy Eating Active Living (HEAL) city. In addition Rachel leads the Active Transportation Advisory Team.

SHEILA JACKSON LEE of texas in the house of representatives Tuesday, February 24, 2015 Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, our hearts and prayers are with the victims of the Metrolink train crash that took place this early morning in Oxnard, California. As of right now, there are no confirmed casualties and I pray that it stays that way and all of the injured have a speedy recovery. I also wish to commend the first responders who arrived at the scene so rapidly to treat the victims of the crash. The nation can be proud of the first responders at the local, state, and federal level who selflessly answer the call to service and risk their lives to keep us safe. Mr. Speaker, first responders ask little in return for the risks they willingly incur. All they ask is that we support them and provide them the resources needed to protect the homeland. That is why it is absolutely critical that Speaker Boehner bring to the floor immediately a clean Homeland Security funding bill. House Republicans should stop risking the security of the homeland to appease the Tea Party extremist wing of their conference. Mr. Speaker, there are only 4 days remaining until funding for the Department of Homeland Security runs out. If House Republicans were to let that happen, DHS would be required to shut down much of the homeland security infrastructure put in place in the aftermath of the 9/11 terrorist attacks. Although some DHS employees would continue to work in the event of a shutdown, they would be forced to do so without pay, creating significant disruptions and dealing a blow to morale. Among those who would be expected to protect Americans without getting paid would be: 1. More than 40,000 Border Patrol agents and Customs and Border Protection officers; 2. More than 50,000 TSA aviation security screeners; 3. More than 13,000 Immigration and Customs Enforcement law enforcement agents and officers; 4. More than 40,000 active duty Coast Guard military members; 5. More than 4,000 Secret Service law enforcement agents and officers. Mr. Speaker, it is time for House Republicans to stop politicizing the funding of this most essential function of the federal government and bring to the floor for debate and passage of a clean DHS funding bill so that we can keep our homeland safe. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 31 (Tuesday, February 24, 2015)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E237] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] CALLING UPON HOUSE LEADERSHIP TO PASS CLEAN DHS FUNDING BILL ______ HON.

KATHY CASTOR of florida in the house of representatives Tuesday, February 24, 2015 Ms. CASTOR of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I am honored to recognize the outstanding and invaluable contributions of African Americans during Black History Month and all year long. I am proud to pay tribute to African American men and women who exemplify the spirit of selfless and patriotic service. I rise today to honor the life of a true champion of education, Lew Williams. His 36-year career in public service and his tireless efforts to improve the lives of children will be remembered forever. Born in Baker County, Georgia, Mr. Williams grew up in poverty and knew education was his ticket to a better life. He earned his Bachelor's Degree from Allen University in Columbia, South Carolina and his Masters Degree from South Carolina State University. He married his beloved wife, Arthurene Sims and they had two children: Brandi, a literacy specialist at Melrose Elementary, and Brandon, a student at Stetson University College of Law. In 1970, Mr. Williams began his career in education as a social studies teacher at Dunedin Middle. He soon rose to be principal of Fairmount Park, South Ward, Dunedin Elementary, and Seminole Middle as well as Pinellas Park High. He became the Director of School Operations in 1987 and was promoted to Associate Superintendent for Pupil Assignment and Area II Superintendent of Pinellas County Schools before his retirement in 2005. Mr. Williams was elected to Pinellas County School Board in 2010. Although Mr. Williams was a soft-spoken man, when he spoke people listened. In his tireless dedication to his students, he wanted not only to educate them through books, but to equip them with life skills to succeed. He recognized the challenges that low-income and minority students faced, so he worked tirelessly to build relationships and connect with children and their families. He constantly pushed to create opportunities for those students some may have forgotten. Mr. Williams always seemed to have the pulse of the district's needs and how to address them. He faced budget crises head-on while closing the achievement gap between races and income levels. He saw the need and spearheaded an effort to implement measures that dealt with chronically disruptive students in ways that integrated rather than alienated. He strived to give parents the tools they need to help their children succeed in academics and life. After his retirement in 2005, he and his wife ran a preschool and he subsequently won the School Board seat. His slogan was ``Keep the main thing the main thing.'' And that philosophy defined his approach of always putting children first regardless of status or race. Mr. Williams passed away December 3, 2011 but his legacy will live on through the many student's lives he has changed for the better. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 31 (Tuesday, February 24, 2015)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E238] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] LEW WILLIAMS ______ HON.

Round Rock High School freshman Adam Cearley was awarded a $20,000 scholarship after ranking sixth among 11,000 students nationwide in the H&R Block Budget Challenge. This innovative two-month, in-school simulation tasked students to manage money online based on a fictional profile. Students received a virtual salary, which they used to pay bills, invest in retirement, and manage loans to get points. Adam took to the challenging project early on, impressing both his peers and his teachers with his sound money management. Not only does the simulation serve as a fun activity to ease students into business lessons, it's important for teenagers to learn financial lessons early. The skills teens like Adam learn from this will serve them well throughout their lives. Young leaders like Adam Cearley show that the future for our nation is a bright one.

Autumn Gadoua is the statewide winner in the Iowa League of Cities 5th Annual ``If I Were Mayor'' essay contest. This annual essay contest allows students to form and express ideas regarding citizenship and leadership. Autumn and the other district winners are being recognized today at a ceremony at the Iowa State Capitol Building in Des Moines. In her essay Autumn wrote that if she were mayor of her hometown she would pursue policies that preserve the town's history and the historical brick buildings for current and new businesses. She notes that this policy would connect the past to the present and promote growth for the future. Mayor Gadoua would also work for opportunities to help businesses thrive, bring new businesses and families to the town, promote green solutions, recycling, and support police officers and firefighters to keep them and the citizens of the community safe. Autumn concluded her essay by saying, ``I would visit the school in my community to teach children the responsibilities of a mayor and give examples of good citizenship. To help children grow and learn, I would establish an after school youth club. Being mayor is a big responsibility, but one that is rewarding and important to me.'' I applaud and congratulate Autumn for her award winning essay and for proving that the next generation of leaders in Iowa and this nation are already preparing for their time of service. I am proud to represent Autumn and her family, her teachers and fellow students in the United States Congress.

KATHY CASTOR of florida in the house of representatives Tuesday, February 24, 2015 Ms. CASTOR of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I am honored to recognize the outstanding and invaluable contributions of African Americans during Black History Month and all year long. I am proud to pay tribute to African American men and women who exemplify the spirit of selfless and patriotic service. I rise today to pay tribute to a truly gifted leader of the Tampa Bay community, Mr. Jetie Wilds. Mr. Wilds dedicated his life to educating people about public service, bringing communities together, and inspiring a way forward for all people in Tampa. Today it is a privilege for me to honor his incredible legacy. Mr. Wilds was born in Tampa, Florida to a family of 12 children. At a young age, Mr. Wilds volunteered on political campaigns and developed a passion for political activism and engagement. This strong commitment to bettering the community led him to Morehouse College in Atlanta where he obtained a Bachelor's degree. He was deeply involved in the civil rights movement by regularly participating in peace marches and sit-ins. During this time, Mr. Wilds married his wife of over 49 years, Ozepher. Mr. Wilds then began his career staying true to his roots as a public servant by becoming a middle school math teacher. Mr. Wilds' public advocacy was not limited to civil rights; he was an ardent environmentalist who served as a community organizer for greater environmental regulations in Portland, Oregon. While there, he obtained a Master's degree in urban planning at Portland State University. His knowledge of environmental policy later led him to Washington, D.C. where he conducted research on the impact of environmental regulations on the African American community. Mr. Wilds returned to Tampa in 1996 and spearheaded his now locally renowned radio show, Citizen's Report. During each broadcast, Mr. Wilds brought to light the significant issues facing the Tampa Bay community. He quickly developed a rapport with his audience because of his intellect and candor that kept the show on air for over 15 years. His efforts to educate and inspire action on important political issues continued through his weekly column in Tampa's trilingual newspaper, La Gaceta. This column consistently provided a profound perspective on issues that transcended cultural and racial boundaries. Mr. Wilds' leadership and tireless work earned him numerous accolades including Man of the Year from the Portland Junior Chamber of Commerce, Boss of the Year from the Professional Women's Organization and Distinguished College Alumnus from the National Association for Equal Opportunity in Higher Education. Mr. Wilds will always be remembered as a leader who united people of all races and ethnicities for the common cause of community betterment. Whether he was running for office, teaching a class or providing an insightful voice for our community on the radio--Jetie Wilds was a true public servant. On September 21, 2014, Mr. Wilds passed away at the age of 74. Mr. Speaker, I join the Tampa Bay community in thanking Mr. Jetie Wilds, Jr. for his lifelong service to the State of Florida. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 31 (Tuesday, February 24, 2015)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E239] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] JETIE WILDS ______ HON.

ELEANOR HOLMES NORTON of the district of columbia in the house of representatives Tuesday, February 24, 2015 Ms. NORTON. Mr. Speaker, today, I introduce the Transit Tax Parity Act of 2015. The bill would expand federal commuter tax benefits for transit and make them equal to those for parking. Currently, the transit benefit is half the level of the parking benefit. This bill would permanently raise the transit benefit to equal the parking benefit for commuters, in an effort to equalize the commuter options and to reduce congestion and pollution. This bill would encourage commuters to use transit by equalizing tax benefits for mass transit and parking benefits at a time when transit systems have precipitously lost riders because of the inequality in benefits. Congress did the sensible thing when it increased the commuter benefit cap to be the same as parking in previous years, but when that parity ended, transit benefits decreased to $130, just over half the benefits for driving. The decrease in transit benefits has led to a striking reduction in transit system ridership across the country. For example, the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority (WMATA), the second largest transit system in the nation, runs throughout the national capital region and has seen a 25 percent decrease in Metrorail commuters, with riders switching to alternative means of commuting once they reach the [[Page E239]] $130 limit. Congressional action is urgently needed to make federal tax benefits for transit and parking equal at $250. Millions of people commute in and out of cities every day, bolstering the American economy and improving the overall well-being of the country. Why would we want to encourage people to drive rather than use mass transit? At the very least, there is no excuse for preferential treatment of driving. There are also environmental benefits that result from encouraging commuters to use mass transit and commuter rail instead of driving. Greater use of transit is consistent with the goals of reducing pollution from auto emissions, improving public health and reducing traffic congestion, which adds huge costs to the American economy and disrupts family life. I strongly urge my colleagues to support the legislation. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 31 (Tuesday, February 24, 2015)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Pages E238-E239] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] INTRODUCTION OF THE TRANSIT TAX PARITY ACT OF 2015 ______ HON.

MILDRED PARISH MASSEY ______ HON. SANFORD D. BISHOP, JR. of georgia in the house of representatives Tuesday, February 24, 2015 Mr. BISHOP of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, it is with a heavy heart and solemn remembrance that I rise today to pay tribute to an exceptional woman and outstanding citizen, Mrs. Mildred Parish Massey. Sadly, Mrs. Massey, the mother of our dear friend and colleague, Congresswoman Barbara Lee, passed away on Monday, February 16, 2015. Funeral services will be held on Thursday, February 26, 2015 at Allen Temple Baptist Church in Oakland, California. Mildred Parish Massey was born in El Paso, Texas on June 6, 1924 to William Calhoun and Willie Pointer Parish. With her sisters, Juanita and Lois, Mrs. Massey attended Douglass Elementary and High School in El Paso, where she played the saxophone in the band and marched in the Sun Bowl Parade. She then earned a scholarship to attend Tillotson College in Austin, Texas and later transferred to Southern University in Baton Rouge, Louisiana to study business administration. After college, Mrs. Massey worked for a time as registrar and secretary to the president of what is now Norfolk State University in Portsmouth, Virginia. She then returned to El Paso and gave birth to three daughters between 1946 and 1952, Congresswoman Barbara Lee, Mrs. Mildred Whitfield and Mrs. Beverly Hardy. Mrs. Massey's daughters never had to look far for an outstanding role model. While at Southern University, Mrs. Massey had boycotted a sorority which barred a friend from pledging because of the darkness of her skin. She even organized for revered civil rights leader Mary McLeod Bethune to go to the university to help change the policy. Because of Mrs. Massey's efforts, the discriminatory practice was ended. Then, when El Paso began integrating its public schools, she was one of the first seven African-American students to integrate Texas Western College, now the University of Texas at El Paso. Mrs. Massey made history by being the first African American to be hired in not one, but multiple positions. She was the first black clerical worker at Ft. Bliss, Texas in the Postal Locator. After she moved to San Fernando, California in 1960, she was the first African American to work at the Raymond Lamp Company, at the Veterans Administration Hospital in Sylmar, California, as Assistant Manager of the Lerner Dress Store in Panorama City, California, and as Manager of the Rembrandt Sign Company in San Fernando. In short, Mrs. Massey's life in and of itself was a testament to the advancement of African Americans before, during, and after the Civil Rights Movement. Mrs. Massey was not only a trailblazer but also a devoted mother. At one point, she worked three jobs to support her daughters and aging father. Mrs. Massey was so dedicated to her children that after her retirement, she worked for another twelve years to help found and manage her daughter Congresswoman Barbara Lee's business. Throughout her life, this love and devotion continued to extend to not just her daughters, but her seven grandchildren, sixteen great grandchildren and one great, great grandchild as well. Maya Angelou once said, ``A great soul serves everyone all the time. A great soul never dies.'' Mrs. Massey is one such great soul, who served humanity in a special way. Each day she graced the people around her with an enthusiastic sincerity of presence. Her impression on this earth extends beyond herself to those whom she inspired and supported, and for it she will be remembered for time to come. Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues in the House of Representatives to join me and my wife, Vivian, in paying tribute to Mrs. Mildred Parish Massey for the inspiring life that she led. We stand united with Congresswoman Barbara Lee and we extend our deepest sympathies to her family, friends and loved ones during this difficult time. We pray that they will be consoled and comforted by an abiding faith and the Holy Spirit in the days, weeks and months ahead. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 31 (Tuesday, February 24, 2015)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E239] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] IN HONOR OF MRS.

Sadly, Mrs. Massey, the mother of our dear friend and colleague, Congresswoman Barbara Lee, passed away on Monday, February 16, 2015. Funeral services will be held on Thursday, February 26, 2015 at Allen Temple Baptist Church in Oakland, California. Mildred Parish Massey was born in El Paso, Texas on June 6, 1924 to William Calhoun and Willie Pointer Parish. With her sisters, Juanita and Lois, Mrs. Massey attended Douglass Elementary and High School in El Paso, where she played the saxophone in the band and marched in the Sun Bowl Parade. She then earned a scholarship to attend Tillotson College in Austin, Texas and later transferred to Southern University in Baton Rouge, Louisiana to study business administration. After college, Mrs. Massey worked for a time as registrar and secretary to the president of what is now Norfolk State University in Portsmouth, Virginia. She then returned to El Paso and gave birth to three daughters between 1946 and 1952, Congresswoman Barbara Lee, Mrs. Mildred Whitfield and Mrs. Beverly Hardy. Mrs. Massey's daughters never had to look far for an outstanding role model. While at Southern University, Mrs. Massey had boycotted a sorority which barred a friend from pledging because of the darkness of her skin. She even organized for revered civil rights leader Mary McLeod Bethune to go to the university to help change the policy. Because of Mrs. Massey's efforts, the discriminatory practice was ended. Then, when El Paso began integrating its public schools, she was one of the first seven African-American students to integrate Texas Western College, now the University of Texas at El Paso. Mrs. Massey made history by being the first African American to be hired in not one, but multiple positions. She was the first black clerical worker at Ft. Bliss, Texas in the Postal Locator. After she moved to San Fernando, California in 1960, she was the first African American to work at the Raymond Lamp Company, at the Veterans Administration Hospital in Sylmar, California, as Assistant Manager of the Lerner Dress Store in Panorama City, California, and as Manager of the Rembrandt Sign Company in San Fernando. In short, Mrs. Massey's life in and of itself was a testament to the advancement of African Americans before, during, and after the Civil Rights Movement. Mrs. Massey was not only a trailblazer but also a devoted mother. At one point, she worked three jobs to support her daughters and aging father. Mrs. Massey was so dedicated to her children that after her retirement, she worked for another twelve years to help found and manage her daughter Congresswoman Barbara Lee's business. Throughout her life, this love and devotion continued to extend to not just her daughters, but her seven grandchildren, sixteen great grandchildren and one great, great grandchild as well. Maya Angelou once said, ``A great soul serves everyone all the time. A great soul never dies.'' Mrs. Massey is one such great soul, who served humanity in a special way. Each day she graced the people around her with an enthusiastic sincerity of presence. Her impression on this earth extends beyond herself to those whom she inspired and supported, and for it she will be remembered for time to come. Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues in the House of Representatives to join me and my wife, Vivian, in paying tribute to Mrs. Mildred Parish Massey for the inspiring life that she led. We stand united with Congresswoman Barbara Lee and we extend our deepest sympathies to her family, friends and loved ones during this difficult time. We pray that they will be consoled and comforted by an abiding faith and the Holy Spirit in the days, weeks and months ahead. ____________________",package_114_116.csv,4255,4255,4326,"[congressional record volume 161, number 31 (tuesday, february 24, 2015)] [extensions of remarks] [page e239] from the congressional record online through the government publishing office [ www.gpo.gov ] in honor of mrs. mildred parish massey ______ hon. sanford d. bishop, jr. of georgia in the house of representatives tuesday, february 24, 2015 mr. bishop of georgia. mr. speaker, it is with a heavy heart and solemn remembrance that i rise today to pay tribute to an exceptional woman and outstanding citizen, mrs. mildred parish massey. sadly, mrs. massey, the mother of our dear friend and colleague, congresswoman barbara lee, passed away on monday, february 16, 2015. funeral services will be held on thursday, february 26, 2015 at allen temple baptist church in oakland, california. mildred parish massey was born in el paso, texas on june 6, 1924 to william calhoun and willie pointer parish. with her sisters, juanita and lois, mrs. massey attended douglass elementary and high school in el paso, where she played the saxophone in the band and marched in the sun bowl parade. she then earned a scholarship to attend tillotson college in austin, texas and later transferred to southern university in baton rouge, louisiana to study business administration. after college, mrs. massey worked for a time as registrar and secretary to the president of what is now norfolk state university in portsmouth, virginia. she then returned to el paso and gave birth to three daughters between 1946 and 1952, congresswoman barbara lee, mrs. mildred whitfield and mrs. beverly hardy. mrs. massey's daughters never had to look far for an outstanding role model. while at southern university, mrs. massey had boycotted a sorority which barred a friend from pledging because of the darkness of her skin. she even organized for revered civil rights leader mary mcleod bethune to go to the university to help change the policy. because of mrs. massey's efforts, the discriminatory practice was ended. then, when el paso began integrating its public schools, she was one of the first seven african-american students to integrate texas western college, now the university of texas at el paso. mrs. massey made history by being the first african american to be hired in not one, but multiple positions. she was the first black clerical worker at ft. bliss, texas in the postal locator. after she moved to san fernando, california in 1960, she was the first african american to work at the raymond lamp company, at the veterans administration hospital in sylmar, california, as assistant manager of the lerner dress store in panorama city, california, and as manager of the rembrandt sign company in san fernando. in short, mrs. massey's life in and of itself was a testament to the advancement of african americans before, during, and after the civil rights movement. mrs. massey was not only a trailblazer but also a devoted mother. at one point, she worked three jobs to support her daughters and aging father. mrs. massey was so dedicated to her children that after her retirement, she worked for another twelve years to help found and manage her daughter congresswoman barbara lee's business. throughout her life, this love and devotion continued to extend to not just her daughters, but her seven grandchildren, sixteen great grandchildren and one great, great grandchild as well. maya angelou once said, ``a great soul serves everyone all the time. a great soul never dies.'' mrs. massey is one such great soul, who served humanity in a special way. each day she graced the people around her with an enthusiastic sincerity of presence. her impression on this earth extends beyond herself to those whom she inspired and supported, and for it she will be remembered for time to come. mr. speaker, i ask my colleagues in the house of representatives to join me and my wife, vivian, in paying tribute to mrs. mildred parish massey for the inspiring life that she led. we stand united with congresswoman barbara lee and we extend our deepest sympathies to her family, friends and loved ones during this difficult time. we pray that they will be consoled and comforted by an abiding faith and the holy spirit in the days, weeks and months ahead. ____________________",4255

JIM McDERMOTT of washington in the house of representatives Tuesday, February 24, 2015 Mr. McDERMOTT. Mr. Speaker, due to a policy oversight, 1 million adults who are looking for work but are unsuccessful at risk to lose their eligibility for Supplement Nutrition Assistance Benefits in 2016. My Colleague Representative Suzan DelBene and I are introducing simple legislation today that would address this issue, and ensure no one falls through the cracks. Our bill is called the SNAP Work Opportunity Act. The SNAP work requirement was established on the assumption that anyone who couldn't find work would take part in a job training or workfare program in order to continue receiving SNAP benefits. Unfortunately, as former President Clinton highlighted when he signed the bill into law, there is not also a requirement for states to offer their unemployed citizens an opportunity to participate in [[Page E240]] a job training or workfare program. While many states may have qualifying programs, only five states guarantee a spot to those adults subject to the work requirement. As a result, even if someone is actively looking for work but can't find it, they can lose their eligibility for SNAP benefits. Recently, this issue hasn't been at the forefront. The economic downturn has made states eligible for waivers to the work requirement because of high and sustained in-state unemployment. Almost all states--42--are eligible for and using a waiver in 2015. However, the economy's continued growth is expected to prevent most states from qualifying for the waivers in 2016. While economic growth is a great thing, it doesn't mean that everyone has a job nor does it mean that everyone looking for a job is able to get one. As a result of the loss of waivers, the CBPP predicts more than 1 million adults who are unable to find jobs and aren't offered an opportunity to take part in a job training or workfare program could lose their eligibility for SNAP benefits in 2016. The SNAP Work Opportunity Act would make the 3 month limit for eligibility only apply if a person was offered a job training or workfare opportunity. With this fix, those who are looking for work aren't penalized because their state doesn't have the resources to offer a job training or work program. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 31 (Tuesday, February 24, 2015)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Pages E239-E240] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] INTRODUCTION OF THE SNAP WORK OPPORTUNITY ACT ______ HON.

ROY L. CLAY ______ HON. BARBARA LEE of california in the house of representatives Tuesday, February 24, 2015 Ms. LEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the extraordinary life of Mr. Roy L. Clay. Known throughout the San Francisco Bay Area and the nation as a computer engineer, investor, community leader and a dedicated husband and father, Mr. Clay has left an indelible mark on our nation. Mr. Roy L. Clay was born in Kinloch, Missouri on August 22, 1929. Even at a young age, Mr. Clay was inspired to learn. In 1947, seven years prior to the Supreme Court's 1954 decision in Brown v. Board of Education, Mr. Clay was granted an academic scholarship to attend Saint Louis University. He graduated in 1951 with a Bachelor of Science in Mathematics and, by 1956, he was among the first modern computer programmers. After serving as a computer programmer in what is now the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in California, Mr. Clay was invited to join David Packard, co-founder of Hewlett-Packard Co., to build the first reliable computer. Mr. Clay established software development, directed research and development of all computer products, and served as the General Manager of the computer division. By the time he left Hewlett-Packard, he was the highest ranking African American employee in the company. Mr. Clay's contributions to the information technology sector continued to grow. In 1971, Mr. Roy L. Clay consulted with Kleiner Perkins Caulfield and Byers, a venture capital firm, to evaluate their investments in computer related firms such as Tandem Computer Company, Compaq Computer Company, and Intel. Then, in 1977, Mr. Clay founded ROD-Electronics to develop the first electronically controlled Dielectric Withstand tester. This test ensured that a product is safe from fire or electrical shock. Hewlett-Packard Co., IBM, AT&T, and Xerox adopted his Dielectric Withstand tester and added it to their production lines. In 2003, in recognition of his many accomplishments in Silicon Valley, Mr. Clay was inducted into the Silicon Valley Engineering Council's Hall of Fame. Beyond his contributions to the information technology sector, Mr. Roy Clay has been a dedicated member of his community. He was the first African American to serve as City Councilman and Vice Mayor for the City of Palo Alto in 1973. Mr. Clay is also a Founder and Emeritus Board Member of the Olympic Club of San Francisco Foundation; founded with the purpose of generating funds to support underprivileged children in the nine counties of the San Francisco Bay Area. Today, California's 13th Congressional District salutes and honors an outstanding individual, Mr. Roy L. Clay. His dedication and efforts in the information technology sector have impacted so many lives and helped to break the barrier for many African Americans throughout California and the nation. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 31 (Tuesday, February 24, 2015)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E240] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] HONORING MR.

Mr. Speaker, I rise today to introduce a resolution designating August 6th as National Voting Rights Day. On August 6, 1965, President Lyndon B. Johnson signed the Voting Rights Act into law. The Act not only outlawed discriminatory voting practices and exponentially expanded the level of African American voter registration and participation, but also vastly increased the number of African American and other minority elected officials. For nearly five decades the Voting Rights Act has served as our nation's most important safeguard against racial discrimination in our electoral system. As we prepare to commemorate the 50th Anniversary of its passage, establishing a day recognizing its magnitude will pay homage to this transformative law, which remains one of the most effective pieces of civil rights legislation ever enacted, and will serve as a critical reminder of the importance of continued efforts to ensure that all Americans are able to fully participate in our electoral process. I am pleased be joined by 36 of my colleagues in introducing this resolution. They include: Representatives: Mark Takai (D-HI), Eleanor Holmes Norton (D-DC), John Garamendi (D-CA), Gregory Meeks (D-NY), Derek Kilmer (D-WA), Charles Rangel (D-NY), Betty McCollum (D-MN), Peter Welch (D-VT), Ted Deutch (D-FL), Terri Sewell (D-AL), Robert Brady (D-PA), Frederica Wilson (D-FL), Sanford Bishop, Jr. (D-GA), Patrick Murphy (D-FL), Maxine Waters (D-CA), Debbie Wasserman Schultz (D-FL), Cheri Bustos (D-IL), Juan Vargas (D-CA), Judy Chu (D-CA), Marcy Kaptur (D-OH), Gwen Moore (D-WI), Andre Carson (D-IN), Joyce Beatty (D- OH), Mike Honda (D-CA), Louise Slaughter (D-NY), Adam Smith (D-WA), Al Green (D-TX), Bobby Scott (D-VA), Corrine Brown (D-FL), Elijah Cummings (D-MD), Marcia Fudge (D-OH), Steve Cohen (D-TN), Earl Blumenauer (D- OR), John Yarmuth (D-KY) and Kathy Castor (D-FL).

Mr. Speaker, in honor of Black History Month, I rise to recognize a prominent leader in my district who has gone above and beyond to help better our community. That man is Mayor Oscar Cradle from South Toms River. Through his work and his life, Oscar has greatly improved our community for his neighbors, friends, and all those who are lucky enough to know him. Mayor Cradle has been a resident of Ocean County for sixty years. Growing up in South Toms River, Oscar was a member of youth choir and Sunday school at Wells Chapel AME Church. After graduating from Toms River High School, he enrolled in Hampton Institute and studied mathematics. After facing issues with addiction, Oscar overcame his struggles and decided he wanted to focus on helping others in his community battle this terrible disease. Oscar became involved with several different organizations in South Toms River. With his own journey in mind, he helped create the South Toms River Alcoholics Anonymous, the South Toms River Narcotics Anonymous, and the South Toms River Neighborhood Watch Committee. But his work didn't stop there--he recently founded the South Toms River Historical Society to help preserve the history of this great town. At Wells Chapel AME Church, Oscar has been ordained as a Reverend and helped to create the church's Community Outreach Center. Additionally, Oscar has served his community as an elected member of the South Toms River Borough Council for seven terms and was elected as the town's mayor on November 4, 2014. Oscar's dedication to improving the lives of those around him is remarkable. Mr. Speaker, we are all blessed to know Oscar, and are grateful for the impact that he has made in our community.

I am proud to pay tribute to African American men and women who exemplify the spirit of selfless and patriotic service. I rise today to honor a dedicated community leader and equal rights champion, Gwen Reese of St. Petersburg, Florida. Ms. Reese was born in St. Petersburg and is a proud graduate of Gibbs High School as well as St. Petersburg Junior College. Ms. Reese has dedicated her career to supporting initiatives that lift families. She began as a counselor for Adolescent Pregnancy and Parenting Services for the YWCA of Tampa Bay. Thanks to her passion and diligent work, she was consistently promoted, rising to become the Director of Administrative Services of the YWCA of Tampa from 1994-1999. Ms. Reese continued to be a voice for Florida families by serving as a Coordinator for both Healthy Start of Pinellas and the Midtown Health Council. In both capacities she focused on reducing infant mortality as well as other initiatives designed to improve the effectiveness of health care delivery and outcomes. Ms. Reese's unrelenting service has led her to play an important role in numerous service organizations and projects in Tampa Bay. Currently, she serves as the District Manager of Professional Opportunities Program for Students (POPS) Inc. which provides career seminars, college tours, internships, and community service projects to assist area high school students in exploring and experiencing different career goals. Furthermore, Ms. Reese organizes the annual Stand Against Racism event and the Week Without Violence activities. These events bring attention to significant issues facing our community. Ms. Reese has been an outspoken advocate for preserving the history of African Americans' contributions to the St. Petersburg community. Her passion led to her selection as the President of the African American Heritage Association. Under her leadership, the African American Heritage Association developed a walking trail through historic neighborhoods in St. Petersburg. It captured the oral histories of the great people like those who built tracks for the Orange Belt Railway, laid Augusta blocks in the Historic Old Northeast, and made the prized hex blocks seen on some city sidewalks. Ms. Reese brought the St. Petersburg community together through this project. She has witnessed great moments in the community created by the project. Her favorite instance was when 25 high school students from Gibbs High School, Pinellas County's first public high school for black students, interviewed the residents who had witnessed immense changes in the community on Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Day. [[Page E242]] We truly appreciate the outstanding work that Ms. Reese has done to preserve and venerate the history and contributions of African Americans.

CASA's mission is to provide trained volunteers to advocate in court for the safety and well-being of abused and neglected children. CASA volunteers attend 35 hours of intensive training before being appointed to a case of child abuse or neglect. Each volunteer commits to stay with the case until it has concluded to ensure they are able to advocate for the child's best interests in the areas of education, health, foster placement, and most importantly a permanent and safe home. I extend my deepest congratulations to CASA of Jefferson and Gilpin Counties for their honor as Nonprofit of the Year by the West Chamber serving Jefferson County. I have no doubt they will exhibit the same service and dedication in all future accomplishments. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 31 (Tuesday, February 24, 2015)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E242] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] CASA ______ HON.

The Uni-Capitol Washington Internship Program annually delivers some of Australia's best and brightest university students for two month internships in our offices. During their time in our nation's Capitol, these student-ambassadors continue to develop their commitment to civic engagement and public service. This year I welcomed student-ambassador Emma Lee who has been a great example of the high quality students who are involved in this program. Emma is a Masters candidate from the University of Sydney, with a Bachelor of Arts from the University of Wollongong where she was a Dean's Scholar. She has been an invaluable asset to our office these past two months. Throughout her time in this office, she has had the chance to pursue her interests on a range of issues, from foreign affairs, human rights, and diplomacy to food security and the environment. She has attended committee briefings, drafted constituent correspondence, and assisted my staff with research. Her Australian accent has garnered the attention of many of my constituents on tours and over the phone. She is often asked to share her experiences in Washington, DC.

JACKIE WALORSKI of indiana in the house of representatives Tuesday, February 24, 2015 Mrs. WALORSKI. Mr. Speaker, today I rise to congratulate and honor a young student from my district who has achieved national recognition for exemplary volunteer service in her community. Ms. Korinna Brown of Bunker Hill has just been named one of the top honorees in Indiana by the 2015 Prudential Spirit of Community Awards program, an annual honor bestowed upon the most impressive student volunteers in every state, including the District of Columbia. Ms. Brown is being recognized for her passion of volunteer service that began with her diagnosis of primary immune deficiency at age six. Since that time, she has raised $150,000 through organizing Relay for Life teams and creating the iroK Foundation in 2009 to help support children diagnosed with cancer and blood diseases. Given the challenges we face today, it is vital that we encourage and recognize the kind of selfless contributions that these young citizens have made. Young volunteers like Ms. Brown are inspiring examples to all of us, and are among our brightest hopes for a better tomorrow. The program that brought this young role model to our attention--The Prudential Spirit of Community Awards--was created by Prudential Financial in partnership with the National Association of Secondary School Principals in 1995. It is used to impress upon all youth volunteers that their contributions are critical and highly valued, and inspire other young people to follow their example. Over the past 20 years, the program has become the nation's largest youth recognition effort based solely on community service, and has honored more than 100,000 young volunteers at the local, state and national level. Ms. Brown should be extremely proud to have been singled out from the thousands of dedicated volunteers who participated in this year's program. I heartily applaud Ms. Brown for her initiative in seeking to make her community a better place to live, and for the positive impact she has had on the lives of others. She has demonstrated a level of commitment and accomplishment that is truly extraordinary in today's world, and deserves our sincere admiration and respect. Her actions show that young Americans can--and do--play important roles in our communities, and continue to hold tremendous promise for our future. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 31 (Tuesday, February 24, 2015)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E243] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] CONGRATULATING KORINNA BROWN ON BEING NAMED A TOP HONOREE BY THE 2015 PRUDENTIAL SPIRIT OF COMMUNITY AWARD PROGRAM ______ HON.

Ms. Brown is being recognized for her passion of volunteer service that began with her diagnosis of primary immune deficiency at age six. Since that time, she has raised $150,000 through organizing Relay for Life teams and creating the iroK Foundation in 2009 to help support children diagnosed with cancer and blood diseases. Given the challenges we face today, it is vital that we encourage and recognize the kind of selfless contributions that these young citizens have made. Young volunteers like Ms. Brown are inspiring examples to all of us, and are among our brightest hopes for a better tomorrow. The program that brought this young role model to our attention--The Prudential Spirit of Community Awards--was created by Prudential Financial in partnership with the National Association of Secondary School Principals in 1995. It is used to impress upon all youth volunteers that their contributions are critical and highly valued, and inspire other young people to follow their example. Over the past 20 years, the program has become the nation's largest youth recognition effort based solely on community service, and has honored more than 100,000 young volunteers at the local, state and national level. Ms. Brown should be extremely proud to have been singled out from the thousands of dedicated volunteers who participated in this year's program. I heartily applaud Ms. Brown for her initiative in seeking to make her community a better place to live, and for the positive impact she has had on the lives of others. She has demonstrated a level of commitment and accomplishment that is truly extraordinary in today's world, and deserves our sincere admiration and respect. Her actions show that young Americans can--and do--play important roles in our communities, and continue to hold tremendous promise for our future. ____________________",package_114_116.csv,2726,2726,2797,"[congressional record volume 161, number 31 (tuesday, february 24, 2015)] [extensions of remarks] [page e243] from the congressional record online through the government publishing office [ www.gpo.gov ] congratulating korinna brown on being named a top honoree by the 2015 prudential spirit of community award program ______ hon. jackie walorski of indiana in the house of representatives tuesday, february 24, 2015 mrs. walorski. mr. speaker, today i rise to congratulate and honor a young student from my district who has achieved national recognition for exemplary volunteer service in her community. ms. korinna brown of bunker hill has just been named one of the top honorees in indiana by the 2015 prudential spirit of community awards program, an annual honor bestowed upon the most impressive student volunteers in every state, including the district of columbia. ms. brown is being recognized for her passion of volunteer service that began with her diagnosis of primary immune deficiency at age six. since that time, she has raised $150,000 through organizing relay for life teams and creating the irok foundation in 2009 to help support children diagnosed with cancer and blood diseases. given the challenges we face today, it is vital that we encourage and recognize the kind of selfless contributions that these young citizens have made. young volunteers like ms. brown are inspiring examples to all of us, and are among our brightest hopes for a better tomorrow. the program that brought this young role model to our attention--the prudential spirit of community awards--was created by prudential financial in partnership with the national association of secondary school principals in 1995. it is used to impress upon all youth volunteers that their contributions are critical and highly valued, and inspire other young people to follow their example. over the past 20 years, the program has become the nation's largest youth recognition effort based solely on community service, and has honored more than 100,000 young volunteers at the local, state and national level. ms. brown should be extremely proud to have been singled out from the thousands of dedicated volunteers who participated in this year's program. i heartily applaud ms. brown for her initiative in seeking to make her community a better place to live, and for the positive impact she has had on the lives of others. she has demonstrated a level of commitment and accomplishment that is truly extraordinary in today's world, and deserves our sincere admiration and respect. her actions show that young americans can--and do--play important roles in our communities, and continue to hold tremendous promise for our future. ____________________",2726

MICHELLE LUJAN GRISHAM of new mexico in the house of representatives Tuesday, February 24, 2015 Ms. MICHELLE LUJAN GRISHAM of New Mexico. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to remember the life, legacy and love of Bryan Bill, a man who touched everyone he met throughout his life. Bryan was born and raised in San Rafael, California and loved his time in the beautiful Golden state. It was there, from a very young age, that Bryan developed an intense curiosity, explosive creativity and strong artistic inclination. His mother Cheryl vividly recalls: ``From the time he was a little boy he could draw beautifully, he became more inventive--there was never a time when he wasn't sketching.'' It was clear that Bryan was a talented, exceptional individual. Still, like any child, Bryan had his obstacles. Parents, Cheryl and Bill, were told that their 7 year old son had behavioral problems, and like any loving parents they sought to remedy the situation. Bryan began regularly seeing a child psychologist. It wasn't until an obscure car pulled up along their house and dropped off their son, that Bill and Cheryl began to really worry--Bryan was 12 years old and drunk. Bryan would go on to achieve so much during his life. As a graphic designer he was always developing innovative ways to reach an audience and craft a new project, but his specialty was cartooning--he just had a knack for it. I remember my conversations with him: he had this comedic humor; he was charming, daring and a witty conversationalist. If you talked to anyone who met Bryan they would tell you he had an incredible zest for life and his exuberant joy could light up any room. And yet, Bryan was chronically depressed, repeatedly abused hard drugs, and had dependency issues with alcohol. On February 24, 2012, three years from this very day, Bryan took his life. It tells us something that someone so talented, so inspired, and so beautiful can be taken from us so unexpectedly. Mental health is something we all deal with; it doesn't know race, it doesn't know socioeconomic status, whether you are tall or short, big or small, it affects everybody. Let's improve behavioral health services, break down the stigma surrounding suicide and encourage meaningful dialogue on mental health issues. It means saving lives like my cousin Bryan's. Mr. Speaker, I join family, friends and all those who have felt Bryan's warm embrace in celebrating the wonderful life he lived and knowing that he is at peace. We will continue fighting to give our loved ones the strength they need to carry on. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 31 (Tuesday, February 24, 2015)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E243] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] HONORING BRYAN BILL ______ HON.

EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of texas in the house of representatives Tuesday, February 24, 2015 Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Speaker, it gives me great pleasure to commemorate the 90th birthday of my friend and colleague, former Congressman Louis Stokes. Louis Stokes rose from local housing projects in Cleveland, Ohio to serve 30 years in the U.S. House, first elected in 1968. Reluctant to enter the political arena, Stokes was persuaded to run for office by his younger brother, Carl B. Stokes, the first Black mayor of a major American city, elected in 1967. Prior to serving in Congress Louis served for decades as a civil rights lawyer. Louis Stokes was the first black to represent the State of Ohio in Congress and was a founding Member of the Congressional Black Caucus. Throughout his tenure in the House, Stokes chaired several congressional committees and was the first African American to win a seat on the House Appropriations Committee. During his long tenure in Congress, Louis Stokes headed and participated in several major House investigations. In March 1977 he was appointed to lead the Select Committee on Assassinations, formed to conduct an investigation of the circumstances surrounding the deaths of President John F. Kennedy and Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Stokes also served as chairman of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, becoming the first Black Member of Congress to head this committee. Stokes was the dean of the Ohio Congressional Delegation. His work in the area of health led to his appointment as a member of the Pepper Commission on Comprehensive Health Care, and he was the founder and chairman of the Congressional Black Caucus Health Brain Trust. In 1991 Stokes chaired the House Committee on Standards of Official Conduct. When Louis Stokes retired in 1998, he became the first African American in the history of the U.S. Congress to have completed 30 years in office. Following his service in Congress, he became senior counsel at Squire, Sanders, and Dempsey L.L.P., a global law firm, and Distinguished Visiting Professor at the Mandel School of Applied Social Sciences at Case Western Reserve University. Stokes also served as vice chairman of the PEW Environmental Health Commission at the Johns Hopkins School of Public Health and was appointed by former Health and Human Services Secretary, Donna E. Shalala, as chairman of the Advisory Committee on Minority Health. Mr. Speaker, I join with his wife Jay, children, Shelley, Angela, Louis and Lori, grandchildren, family and friends in wishing Congressman Louis Stokes a very happy and blessed 90th birthday. You have been a trailblazer for so many. May you have many, many more. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 31 (Tuesday, February 24, 2015)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E243] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] CELEBRATING THE 90TH BIRTHDAY OF FORMER CONGRESSMAN LOUIS STOKES ______ HON.
