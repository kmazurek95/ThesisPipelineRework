JIM COSTA of california in the house of representatives Friday, March 6, 2015 Mr. COSTA. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to the life of Phillip Levine of Fresno, California who recently passed away at the age of 87. He leaves behind his loving family including his wife Frances J. Artley, three sons, Mark, John and Teddy, five grandchildren and one great grandchild. Mr. Levine was born on January 10, 1928 in Detroit, Michigan, but has called Fresno home since 1958. The son of Russian-Jewish immigrants, Levine was born and raised in industrial Detroit where he began working in the auto factories at the age of 14. He earned his Bachelor's degree from Wayne State University in 1950 and later earned a Master's degree in Fine Arts from the University of Iowa in 1957. After receiving his graduate degree, he came to California where he began teaching at California State University, Fresno. He went on to teach at Fresno State for 34 years. It was there that he built a nationally recognized program in Creative Writing that inspired many graduates to become illustrious poets. He retired in 1992 but remained deeply connected to the University. Although Levine held teaching positions at some of the most prestigious universities in the land, including New York University, Columbia University, Princeton and the University of California at Berkeley, he always returned to his home in Fresno. As a poetry writer, Mr. Levine celebrated working people, and his words both resonated and uplifted them. He wrote more than 21 collections of poetry and in 1995 received the Pulitzer Prize for his poem ``The Simple Truth.'' He won the National Book Award in 1991 for ``What work is'' and in 2013 he was honored with the Wallace Stevens Award which is given annually to recognize ``outstanding and proven mastery in the art of poetry.'' In 2011, Mr. Levine was named as the 18th Poet Laureate of the United States, being declared one of America's greatest narrative poets by Librarian of Congress, James H. Billington. While achieving numerous successes and accolades for his work, he consistently maintained that the success of his Fresno State students was one of his biggest rewards. Mr. Levine was truly an honorable man with a strong commitment to family, friends and his country that will live on in lives of the many people he touched. His passion for writing, education, and his community will be remembered by all who knew him. I am honored and humbled to join his family in celebrating the life of this amazing man who will never be forgotten. Mr. Speaker, it is with great respect that I ask my colleagues in the House of Representatives to join me in saying farewell to Mr. Phillip Levine, a man full of love for life. His genuine character, commitment to family and community will be greatly missed. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 38 (Friday, March 6, 2015)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E313] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] PAYING TRIBUTE TO THE LIFE OF PHILLIP LEVINE _____ HON.

Not only was Sue one of the longest serving state legislators from northwest Indiana, but she was also the second highest ranking member of the Indiana Senate upon her retirement in 2014. Sue was at the forefront of many legislative accomplishments, most specifically the ``Lemon Law'' that protected consumers against the purchase of defective vehicles, a living-will policy that gave adults medical treatment choices if they were incapacitated, and free tuition at state funded higher education institutions for recipients of the Hoosier Purple Heart award. During her spare time, Sue loved camping with her husband, visiting her children at their military posts around the globe, and spending as much time as she could with her grandchildren. She also served as a Member of the State Committee of the Indiana Republican Party. That is where we became friends. I always admired Sue's wisdom, candor, and civility.

More than 33,000 Americans die on our roadways each year, yet this is accepted as inevitability. Even more concerning, fatalities of our most vulnerable road users--pedestrians and bicyclists--make up a growing share of those deaths, with pedestrian fatalities increasing 16% from 2009 to 2014. People who die on our streets are disproportionally children, seniors, and people from low income or minority communities. Communities across the country are recognizing that there is only one number of acceptable deaths on our streets: zero. ``Vision Zero'' is the goal of eliminating all transportation-related fatalities, including pedestrians, bicyclists, transit users, motorists and passengers. Cities from New York to San Diego are implementing interagency Vision Zero plans connecting engineering, education, and enforcement, to reach the goal of ending transportation deaths. Congress should encourage this innovative approach to transportation safety, and today I'm pleased to introduce the Vision Zero Act of 2015 with my colleague, Representative Buchanan. This bill provides local communities of all sizes with funding and best practices to plan and implement a Vision Zero framework. We should no longer accept bicycle and pedestrian fatalities as harsh reality, and this bill gives us the tools to reverse this trend. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 38 (Friday, March 6, 2015)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E314] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] INTRODUCTION OF THE VISION ZERO ACT OF 2015 _____ HON.

CREC-2015-03-06-pt1-PgE315,CREC-2015-03-06,114,HONORING THE LIFE OF JERRY TARKANIAN,"[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 38 (Friday, March 6, 2015)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E315] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] HONORING THE LIFE OF JERRY TARKANIAN _____ HON. JIM COSTA of california in the house of representatives Friday, March 6, 2015 Mr. COSTA. Mr. Speaker, I rise today along with my colleague, Mr. Nunes to honor the life of Jerry Tarkanian, who passed away on February 11, 2015, at the age of 84. Jerry's family and friends as well as people throughout the nation, will miss him greatly as he dedicated much of his life to inspiring young athletes in countless communities. Although Jerry was most recognized for his achievements as the basketball coach for the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, in the Central Valley we remember Jerry as Fresno State's spirited and energetic former head basketball coach. Fresno State was Jerry's alma mater, and the community is very proud to say so. Born in Euclid, Ohio, Jerry was the son of Armenian immigrants. He moved halfway across the country, to California, to get an education and play basketball. In 1955, he graduated from Fresno State, and later earned his master's degree in Educational Management from the University of Redlands. Jerry was an enthusiastic coach for 31 years who began his basketball coaching career at San Joaquin Memorial High School in Fresno. Jerry coached his first Division I team at California State University, Long Beach from 1968-1973. As a coach during the late 60s, his courage defied social norms of the time, becoming one of the first coaches to start more than three African-American players. Jerry took an intense interest in his players and wanted them to succeed both on and off the court. He was a man of encouragement who reached out to young men who lived in inner-cities and normally would not have access to a higher education. I once had the pleasure of having a conversation about Jerry Tarkanian with Magic Johnson. He told me that Coach Jerry Tarkanian was known around inner city playgrounds in America as the coach of second chances. In the Central Valley, we are truly grateful for those second chances. In 1973, Jerry moved to Nevada to become head coach at UNLV. He is now remembered as the determined individual who turned around the basketball program at UNLV and made it into a winning program. Jerry returned to Fresno and coached at Fresno State from 1995-2002. While coaching at Fresno state, his teams had a total of six 20-win seasons for a total of 153 victories. In total, his teams had 729 victories, a National championship for UNLV in 1990, and four straight NCAA tournament appearances for Long Beach State. Additionally, Jerry coached 42 players who were drafted by the NBA, including 12 first- round selections. Due to the efforts made by Jerry and the ``Stadium Builders'' in the mid 1990s, Save mart Center was built. For years, there had been discussions regarding an on-campus arena at Fresno State, but it was not made a reality until Jerry began his successful coaching career at the university. When he finished his coaching career, Jerry worked as the Senior Development Consultant for Save mart Center. In 2013, Tarkanian was elected to the Naismith Memorial Hall of Fame, an honor his fellow coaches argued for years was long overdue. Though hospitalized in the summer for heart problems and weakened by a variety of ills, he went on stage with a walker at the induction ceremony. Jerry is appreciated by individuals throughout our nation, but he is especially treasured in Fresno, California. Central Valley residents take pride in Fresno State, and it was an honor to have Jerry lead our Fresno State Bulldogs on the basketball court. Although I come to you with a heavy heart, I am honored to have known such an admirable man. Mr. Speaker, it is with great respect that Mr. Nunes and I ask our colleagues in the House of Representatives to join us in honoring the life of Coach Jerry Tarkanian, as he is remembered for all of the contributions that he has made to individuals throughout the country as well as the people to whom he gave a second chance. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 38 (Friday, March 6, 2015)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E315] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] HONORING THE LIFE OF JERRY TARKANIAN _____ HON.

Jerry took an intense interest in his players and wanted them to succeed both on and off the court. He was a man of encouragement who reached out to young men who lived in inner-cities and normally would not have access to a higher education. I once had the pleasure of having a conversation about Jerry Tarkanian with Magic Johnson. He told me that Coach Jerry Tarkanian was known around inner city playgrounds in America as the coach of second chances. In the Central Valley, we are truly grateful for those second chances. In 1973, Jerry moved to Nevada to become head coach at UNLV. He is now remembered as the determined individual who turned around the basketball program at UNLV and made it into a winning program. Jerry returned to Fresno and coached at Fresno State from 1995-2002. While coaching at Fresno state, his teams had a total of six 20-win seasons for a total of 153 victories. In total, his teams had 729 victories, a National championship for UNLV in 1990, and four straight NCAA tournament appearances for Long Beach State. Additionally, Jerry coached 42 players who were drafted by the NBA, including 12 first- round selections. Due to the efforts made by Jerry and the ``Stadium Builders'' in the mid 1990s, Save mart Center was built. For years, there had been discussions regarding an on-campus arena at Fresno State, but it was not made a reality until Jerry began his successful coaching career at the university. When he finished his coaching career, Jerry worked as the Senior Development Consultant for Save mart Center. In 2013, Tarkanian was elected to the Naismith Memorial Hall of Fame, an honor his fellow coaches argued for years was long overdue. Though hospitalized in the summer for heart problems and weakened by a variety of ills, he went on stage with a walker at the induction ceremony. Jerry is appreciated by individuals throughout our nation, but he is especially treasured in Fresno, California. Central Valley residents take pride in Fresno State, and it was an honor to have Jerry lead our Fresno State Bulldogs on the basketball court. Although I come to you with a heavy heart, I am honored to have known such an admirable man. Mr. Speaker, it is with great respect that Mr. Nunes and I ask our colleagues in the House of Representatives to join us in honoring the life of Coach Jerry Tarkanian, as he is remembered for all of the contributions that he has made to individuals throughout the country as well as the people to whom he gave a second chance. ____________________","Congressional Record, Volume 161 Issue 38 (Friday, March 6, 2015) [Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 38 (Friday, March 6, 2015)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E315] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] HONORING THE LIFE OF JERRY TARKANIAN _____ HON. JIM COSTA of california in the house of representatives Friday, March 6, 2015 Mr. COSTA. Mr. Speaker, I rise today along with my colleague, Mr. Nunes to honor the life of Jerry Tarkanian, who passed away on February 11, 2015, at the age of 84. Jerry's family and friends as well as people throughout the nation, will miss him greatly as he dedicated much of his life to inspiring young athletes in countless communities. Although Jerry was most recognized for his achievements as the basketball coach for the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, in the Central Valley we remember Jerry as Fresno State's spirited and energetic former head basketball coach. Fresno State was Jerry's alma mater, and the community is very proud to say so. Born in Euclid, Ohio, Jerry was the son of Armenian immigrants. He moved halfway across the country, to California, to get an education and play basketball. In 1955, he graduated from Fresno State, and later earned his master's degree in Educational Management from the University of Redlands. Jerry was an enthusiastic coach for 31 years who began his basketball coaching career at San Joaquin Memorial High School in Fresno. Jerry coached his first Division I team at California State University, Long Beach from 1968-1973.

SCOTT R. TIPTON of colorado in the house of representatives Friday, March 6, 2015 Mr. TIPTON. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in honor of Mr. Jesse Reed. Mr. Reed cemented his name in Colorado high-school wrestling history on February 20th, 2015, at the Colorado State High School Wrestling Championships in Denver, Colorado, by winning his fourth consecutive state title. Jesse, a senior at Paonia Junior-Senior High School, began his dominant career as a freshman, winning the 113-pound state title. In an incredible show of dedication and pure mental toughness, Jesse overcame a MCL tear during his sophomore football season, and returned to the mat that sophomore winter and battled his way to the 120-pound state title. In a sport renowned for the extreme physical and mental conditions, in which athletes are subject to match after match, it is a testament to Jesse's resolve that he was able to prevail even without a 100 percent healthy knee. Following another dominant season during his junior year and his third state title, Jesse, now in his senior year, knew that he had the opportunity to become the 18th wrestler in Colorado State history to win four consecutive titles. In a 4-1 decision, not only did Reed join that elite group but he also capped off an impressive final two seasons in which he didn't lose a single match. Mr. Speaker, Jesse Reed's tenacity, unwillingness to succumb to adversity, and unparalleled success is truly to be admired and for that I congratulate him. Although he has wrestled his last match for the Eagles, his commitment to the sport of wrestling and to Paonia Junior- Senior High School will remain on the mat and inspire the Eagles who follow in his footsteps. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 38 (Friday, March 6, 2015)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E315] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] JESSE REED CHAMPION TRIBUTE _____ HON.

ANDER CRENSHAW of florida in the house of representatives Friday, March 6, 2015 Mr. CRENSHAW. Mr. Speaker, on Monday, March 2, due to inclement weather I was unable to vote on H.R. 280 `Authorizing Secretary of Veterans Affairs to Recoup Bonuses and Awards' and H.R. 294 the `Long- Term Care Veterans Choice Act'. If I had been present I would have voted ``yes'' on the passage of both bills as these reforms would serve to improve the care of our Veterans who have sacrificed so much for our nation. These bills respectively improve the ability of the Veterans Administration to provide for the well being of those who have given so much for this nation, and expand the power of that Department to hold its employees accountable when they fall short of upholding that sacred duty. Over the past year, the Department of Veterans Affairs has received scrutiny on issues that affect the care and benefits of our Veterans. Congress has taken action, along with the Department's Office of the Inspector General to investigate these wrongdoings. One finding of these investigations was the despicable act of manipulating the Department's appointment system to hide evidence of increased wait times for medical appointments, and the doctoring of medical records to the same effect. I believe these acts are despicable and the Department of Veterans Affairs must be held accountable. Veterans Affairs employees are placed in positions of special trust and confidence and are charged with the sacred duty of caring for those who have sacrificed for the security of this nation. This bill, H.R. 280, provides the Secretary of Veterans Affairs more authority to hold accountable those employees who break faith with this obligation. While employees would be afforded due process prior to being fined for misconduct, the Secretary's decision would be final and could not be appealed to any other agency or court. No system is perfect and no person is perfect. But the American people entrust the Secretary of Veterans Affairs with the responsibility of caring for our Veterans--which is why it is critical to empower that Department's leaders with the authority to hold their employees accountable for their actions. My District in Jacksonville, Florida is one of the most popular retirement locations for Veterans. So this bill, H.R. 294 the `Long- Term Care Veterans Choice Act', hits very close to home. As our Veterans enter the twilight of their lives, they often find themselves needing [[Page E315]] increased daily care, which the Department of Veterans Affairs is required by law to provide. This care is given by way of veterans nursing homes, which are currently the only institutions capable of fulfilling the Department's obligation to provide such services. However, this ``one size fits all'' method of caring for our Veterans is not always the most appropriate for their condition or medical situation. H.R. 294 corrects this situation by authorizing the Department of Veterans Affairs to fund Medical Foster Home care for Veterans whose situation is conducive to receiving long term care in a non- institutional setting. Medical Foster Care provides actual homes for Veterans and families willing to accept the challenge of caring for them. Many of these families are themselves retired service members, nurses, and doctors that are able to garner a little extra money and a purpose for getting out of bed every day. There is no downside to this bill. It provides a choice for our Veterans to receive the kind of care they want and deserve in a fiscally responsible manner. I can't think of a better way to honor their service and sacrifice. Therefore, Mr. Speaker, had I been present for these votes, I would have placed my full support behind their passage. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 38 (Friday, March 6, 2015)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Pages E314-E315] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] H.R. 280 AND H.R. 294, REFORMS TO IMPROVE THE CARE FOR VETERANS WHO HAVE SACRIFICED SO MUCH FOR OUR NATION _____ HON.

SHEILA JACKSON LEE of texas in the house of representatives Friday, March 6, 2015 Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, fifty years ago tomorrow, in Selma, Alabama, hundreds of heroic souls risked their lives for freedom and to secure the right to vote for all Americans by their participation in marches for voting rights on ``Bloody Sunday,'' ``Turnaround Tuesday,'' or the final, completed march from Selma to Montgomery. Those ``foot soldiers'' of Selma, brave and determined men and women, boys and girls, persons of all races and creeds, loved their country so much that they were willing to risk their lives to make it better, to bring it even closer to its founding ideals. The foot soldiers marched because they believed that all persons have dignity and the right to equal treatment under the law, and in the making of the laws, which is the fundamental essence of the right to vote. On March 15, 1965, before a joint session of the Congress and the eyes of the nation, President Lyndon Johnson explained to the nation the significance of ``Bloody Sunday'': I speak tonight for the dignity of man and the destiny of democracy. . . . At times history and fate meet at a single time in a single place to shape a turning point in man's unending search for freedom. So it was at Lexington and Concord. So it was a century ago at Appomattox. So it was last week in Selma, Alabama. The previous Sunday, March 7, 1965, more than 600 civil rights demonstrators, including our beloved colleague, Congressman John Lewis of Georgia, were brutally attacked by state and local police at the Edmund Pettus Bridge as they marched from Selma to Montgomery in support of the right to vote. ``Bloody Sunday'' was a defining moment in American history because it crystallized for the nation the necessity of enacting a strong and effective federal law to protect the right to vote of every American. [[Page E316]] No one who witnessed the violence and brutally suffered by the foot soldiers for justice who gathered at the Edmund Pettus Bridge will ever forget it; the images are deeply seared in the American memory and experience. Mr. Speaker, what is so moving, heroic, and awe-inspiring is that the foot soldiers of Selma faced their heavily armed adversaries fortified only by their love for their country and for each other and their audacious faith in a righteous cause. The example set by the foot soldiers of Selma showed everyone, here in America and around the world, that there is no force on earth as powerful as an idea whose time has come. These great but nameless persons won the Battle of Selma and helped redeem the greatest nation on earth. But we should not forget that the victory came at great cost and that many good and dear persons lost their lives to win for others the right to vote. Men like Jimmy Lee Jackson, who was shot by Alabama state trooper as he tried to protect his mother and grandmother from being beaten for participating in a peaceful voting rights march in Marion, Alabama. Women like Viola Liuzzo, a housewife and mother of five, who had journeyed to Selma from Detroit to join the protests after witnessing on television the events at Edmund Pettus Bridge on ``Bloody Sunday'' and who was shot and killed by Klansmen while driving back from a trip shuttling fellow voting rights marchers to the Montgomery airport. Persons of faith, goodwill, and non-violence like the Reverend James Reeb of Boston, a minister from Boston who heeded the call of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. to come to Selma and who succumbed to the head injuries he suffered at the hands of his white supremacists attackers on March 9, two days after Bloody Sunday. Mr. Speaker, in the face of unspeakable hostility, violence, brutality, and hatred, the foot soldiers of Selma would not be deterred--would not be moved--would not be turned around. They kept their eyes on the prize and held on. And help came the very next week when President Johnson announced to the nation that he would send to Congress for immediate action a law designed to eliminate illegal barriers to the right to vote by striking down ``restrictions to voting in all elections--Federal, State, and local--which have been used to deny Negroes the right to vote.'' On August 6, 1965, that legislation--the Voting Rights Act of 1965-- was signed into law by President Johnson and for the next 48 years did more to expand our democracy and empower racial and language minorities than any act of government since the Emancipation Proclamation and adoption of the Civil War Amendments. But our work is not done; the dreams of Dr. King and of all those who gave their lives in the struggle for justice are not behind us but still before us. Mr. Speaker, in the wake of the Supreme Court's 2013 ruling in Shelby County v. Holder, which severely crippled the Voting Rights Act, we have seen many states across our nation move to enact legislation designed to limit the ability of women, the elderly, racial and language minorities to exercise their right to vote. To honor the memory of the foot soldiers of Selma, we must rededicate ourselves to a great task remaining before us--to repair the damage done to the Voting Rights Act by working to pass H.R. 885, the Voting Rights Amendments Act of 2015, which I am proud to be one of the original co-sponsors. As I have stated many times, the 1965 Voting Rights Act is no ordinary piece of legislation. For millions of Americans, and for many in Congress, it is sacred treasure, earned by the sweat and toil and tears and blood of ordinary Americans who showed the world it was possible to accomplish extraordinary things. As we remember and honor the foot soldiers of Selma, let us resolve also to restore the Voting Rights Act of 1965, so that it remains a lasting monument to their heroism and devotion to the country they loved.","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 38 (Friday, March 6, 2015)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Pages E315-E316] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] COMMEMORATING 50TH ANNIVERSARY OF BLOODY SUNDAY, TURNAROUND TUESDAY, AND THE FINAL MARCH FROM SELMA TO MONTGOMERY _____ HON.
