The headline reads: ``CBO: Health law will cost less than expected.'' It says: ``President Obama's health-care law will cost taxpayers substantially less than previously estimated, congressional budget officials said Monday, in an upbeat note for a program that has faced withering criticism since its passage five years ago.'' I would just note here that the opposition has come from my Republican colleagues in the Senate and the House. They voted 67 times to repeal it in the House. Of course, each time it has failed. Continuing on in this article, it says: The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office attributed the savings to spending on medical care in coming years that will not be as great as previously forecast. As a result, the agency said, insurers are not expected to charge Americans as much for coverage, and the government will save on subsidies for low- and moderate-income people. What's more, the CBO has concluded that companies are not canceling health insurance policies as often as had been anticipated earlier this year. Fewer Americans consequently are planning to sign up for insurance under the Affordable Care Act, generating more taxpayer savings. In total, the health-care law will cost taxpayers . . . 11 percent less over the next decade than estimated in January. The cost of providing subsidies for people to buy insurance on the state and federal marketplaces--the centerpiece of the law--will be 20 percent lower than projected.

Mr. President, the official mission statement for the U.S. Attorney General reads: To enforce the law and defend the interests of the United States according to the law; to ensure public safety against threats foreign and domestic; to provide federal leadership in preventing and controlling crime; to seek just punishment for those guilty of unlawful behavior; and to ensure fair and impartial administration of justice for all Americans. That is a tremendous responsibility. The U.S. Attorney General is more than just a lawyer or an administrator. An Attorney General is a defender, a crime fighter, and an advocate for Americans' rights. It is not an easy job, but President Obama's nominee Loretta Lynch is up to the task. Throughout my time in the Senate, I have seen many qualified nominees, Republicans and Democrats--people such as Janet Reno, Madeline Albright, Colin Powell, and Hillary Rodham Clinton. Loretta Lynch, a graduate of Harvard Law School, is as qualified as any candidate I have ever seen in my 33 years in Congress. Ms. Lynch currently serves as the U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of New York. She has been confirmed unanimously for that office by the Senate twice, most recently in 2010. During her time in the U.S. attorney's office, Loretta Lynch has proven herself to be a tough crimefighter. She has vigorously prosecuted drug dealers and criminals, corrupt politicians, and greedy Wall Street bankers. Loretta Lynch is also a guardian of the Constitution. She takes the protections afforded to Americans in the Bill of Rights seriously. Almost two decades ago she helped bring to justice a Haitian immigrant who had been physically and sexually assaulted by police officers acting outside the law. She has also defended human rights abroad. She was part of the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, where she prosecuted suspects accused of one of the most heinous crimes in world history, the genocide carried out in Rwanda. Whatever the case, whatever the crime, Loretta Lynch has protected the innocent and fought the guilty. She has been exemplary in defending the interests of the United States and its people. She is an ideal candidate to be America's top law enforcement officer. That is why she was nominated 121 days ago by President Obama. I look forward to the Senate finishing this confirmation as soon as possible. The American people need Loretta Lynch in their corner.

During her time in the U.S. attorney's office, Loretta Lynch has proven herself to be a tough crimefighter. She has vigorously prosecuted drug dealers and criminals, corrupt politicians, and greedy Wall Street bankers. Loretta Lynch is also a guardian of the Constitution. She takes the protections afforded to Americans in the Bill of Rights seriously. Almost two decades ago she helped bring to justice a Haitian immigrant who had been physically and sexually assaulted by police officers acting outside the law. She has also defended human rights abroad. She was part of the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, where she prosecuted suspects accused of one of the most heinous crimes in world history, the genocide carried out in Rwanda. Whatever the case, whatever the crime, Loretta Lynch has protected the innocent and fought the guilty. She has been exemplary in defending the interests of the United States and its people. She is an ideal candidate to be America's top law enforcement officer. That is why she was nominated 121 days ago by President Obama. I look forward to the Senate finishing this confirmation as soon as possible. The American people need Loretta Lynch in their corner.

Mr. President, deep in shadow, there is a specter that haunts our country. In dark corners it claims thousands of victims every year--quietly, stealthily, maliciously. It is hard for many Americans to believe that human trafficking could happen where they live, but it does, right here in the United States--in all 50 of our States. And many of these victims are children. In Kentucky alone the Commonwealth has been able to identify more than 100 victims since it began keeping relevant records in 2013. While this kind of abuse often begins around the age of 13 or 14, there have been reports of victims in Kentucky as young as 2 months old. It is just about the most morally offensive thing you can imagine. These victims need a voice, they need justice, and the new Congress is determined to give them both. That is just what the bill we are considering this week, the Justice for Victims of Trafficking Act, aims to do. I particularly want to thank Senator Cornyn for his hard work on this legislation. He has been a tireless advocate for it. I also want to note that this legislation has always been a bipartisan exercise. I want to thank the 13 Democratic cosponsors of the bill. It is a bill that received a hearing in the Judiciary Committee earlier this year and was reported without a single negative vote. It has been thoroughly vetted and carefully crafted, which explains its bipartisan support in the Senate. That also explains the long list of endorsements outside the Senate, with organizations such as Shared Hope International, Rights4Girls, the Fraternal Order of Police, and the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children among its many supporters. Here is what one of the broad coalitions backing this bill had to say about it. ``The Justice for Victims of Trafficking Act provides unprecedented support to domestic victims of trafficking, who are too often invisible and underserved,'' they wrote. ``This legislation is vital.'' I hope now that it has been brought to the floor, this bill continues to enjoy its strong record of constructive bipartisan support. It is similar to a measure that was passed by the House of Representatives. The version before us also contains some additional provisions as well. For instance, Senator Portman has offered ideas to improve the way we find missing kids and to strengthen law enforcement efforts to investigate and prosecute those who commit sex trafficking crimes. It is good to see such a strong and bipartisan piece of legislation because victims of human trafficking should be treated as victims--not as criminals--because they should have the services and resources they need to rebuild their lives and because law enforcement should have the tools it needs to protect them and to combat these crimes. This bill aims to ensure these things actually happen, and I look forward to the Senate's good work to pass it. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 40 (Tuesday, March 10, 2015)] [Senate] [Page S1343] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] HUMAN TRAFFICKING LEGISLATION Mr. McCONNELL.

The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the time until 12:30 p.m. will be equally divided. The Senator from Iowa. (The remarks of Mr. Grassley pertaining to the introduction of S. 686 are printed in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced Bills and Joint Resolutions.'') Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, on this bill before the Senate, for a few days we will continue to debate legislation to fight crime and restore dignity to its survivors. I thank the majority leader for scheduling floor action on the Justice for Victims of Trafficking Act. This important bill is authored by our assistant majority leader, Senator Cornyn of Texas. Human trafficking is a serious crime that is too often overlooked in its various forms, which include both labor trafficking and sexual servitude. It causes drastic harm to its victims. A form of modern-day slavery, human trafficking includes both adults and children, as well as noncitizens and citizens of our country. Experts tell us it is not limited to big cities or our Nation's coasts but stretches across the whole Nation, even to the rural parts of our country, including my Midwest. Indeed, it happens every day, everywhere in this country. The Judiciary Committee met 2 weeks ago to hear testimony from a victim advocate, a law enforcement official, and a sex trafficking survivor about the challenges we face in fighting human trafficking. One witness, a criminal investigator from my State of Iowa who works for our Democratic attorney general Tom Miller, told us about a 20- year-old from my State who in December was abducted and forced into sexual servitude. We have made progress in curbing human trafficking since the passage in 2000 of the Federal Victims of Trafficking and Violence Protection Act--a measure I supported at that time--but there is still much work that remains to be done on this front. This bill before the Senate takes a creative and comprehensive approach to what is a pervasive and very troubling problem. The measure has been endorsed by over 200 groups, and it passed the Senate Judiciary Committee without a dissenting vote. The centerpiece of this bill is its creation of a new fund called the Domestic Trafficking Victims' Fund, which will be used to support a host of programs and services for human trafficking and child pornography survivors. The fund will be financed not by taxpayers' dollars but by fines collected from individuals convicted of human trafficking and human smuggling crimes, making it deficit neutral. If enacted, this bill will also equip law enforcement with new tools to fight trafficking. For example, it would make it easier for State law enforcement officials to wiretap human trafficking suspects without Federal approval. It also would expand the categories of persons who can be prosecuted for human trafficking. In addition, it clarifies that child pornography is a form of human trafficking. This bill takes an extremely thoughtful and comprehensive approach, tackling not only the supply of human trafficking victims but also the demand for these victims. Tackling the problem on both fronts is something the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service tells us is absolutely necessary if we are to successfully curb human trafficking. If enacted, this bill will ensure that both the trafficker and the buyer will be prosecuted for their crimes. We had an open and productive markup of this bill. I offered an amendment, which was accepted by voice vote, clarifying that Federal grant resources can be used to meet the housing needs of trafficking victims and offer training on the effects of sex trafficking to those who serve runaway, homeless, and at-risk youth. This amendment also updates the reauthorization language for the CyberTipline of the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children to ensure that child trafficking is specifically mentioned as a form of Internet-related child exploitation. Finally, this amendment would require the Interagency Task Force to monitor and combat trafficking to identify best practices to prevent human trafficking. Senator Blumenthal from the State of Connecticut also offered an amendment based on a bill he and Senator Kirk filed earlier this year, which was accepted in committee by a voice vote. Their bill, S. 575, known as the HERO Act, provides authorization for a program at the Department of Homeland Security that trains wounded warriors to assist in the effort to locate missing children. I am proud to be a cosponsor of the bill now before if Senate. I commend Senator Cornyn, the lead sponsor of this measure, for his efforts to refine the bill and build such a substantial, very bipartisan coalition supporting it. I hope we will show the same bipartisan cooperation and support on the floor as we consider amendments. I look forward to a vote on this bill as soon as possible. I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record letters in support of S. 178 from various organizations. There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows: February 23, 2015.

Senator Dianne Feinstein, Hart Senate Office Building, Washington, DC. Senator John Cornyn, Hart Senate Office Building, Washington, DC. Senator Amy Klobuchar, Hart Senate Office Building, Washington, DC. Dear Senators Grassley, Leahy, Feinstein, Cornyn, and Klobuchar: We write to you, the leaders of the U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee, and to three committee Senators who have been particularly sensitive to our (often ignored) perspective. We write to you as survivors of sex trafficking and commercial sexual exploitation. We write as survivors who know, profoundly and personally, the harm caused by this crime. And we write to you as survivor leaders of organizations trying to prevent sex trafficking before it victimizes others. We write to express our support for legislation that makes progress in three essential areas: 1. Identify new funding streams for victim services. Current public budgets are stressed. Victims of sex trafficking typically suffer multiple harms, requiring a range of services from medical and psychological assistance to treatment for the drug and alcohol addiction that so often accompanies trafficking (addictions that make people vulnerable to trafficking; addictions that develop or worsen as people try to cope with the pain of this intimate form of abuse). We've been told by law enforcement in numerous jurisdictions that when services don't exist (mainly because they are expensive) there's a disincentive to enforcing anti- trafficking laws and identifying victims. The Justice for Victims of Trafficking Act (JVTA), S. 178, is innovative for creating a new fund to finance victim-- services an essential goal. It also achieves a second principle we stand for: Making sex buyers accountable for the harm they cause. 2. Prevent sex trafficking by targeting the buyers who create demand. Logically, trafficking will never end until we shrink the demand that creates the market. People still in the life, still being exploited, sometimes avoid this conclusion because they see no other options but the cycle of violence in which they are trapped. We are strong witnesses to the necessity of making the buyers pay, to make the crime end. Two bills in particular strength accountability in the sex trafficking legal regime: S. 178 and Combat Human Trafficking Act of 2015, S. 140. By clarifying congressional intent that sex buyers be considered parties to the trafficking crime, by compelling the Department of Justice to incorporate training and technical assistance on investigating and prosecuting buyers in its anti-trafficking programming, and by making the crime more ``costly,'' we can finally begin to shrink its incidence. [[Page S1357]] 3. Treat victims as victims, not criminals, and let survivor voices inform anti-trafficking policy. Two bills in particular recognize these realities: the Stop Exploitation Through Trafficking Act, S. 166, which gives states incentives to approve ``Safe Harbor'' laws as well as job training options for victims and the Survivors of Human Trafficking Empowerment Act, which creates a survivors-led U.S. Advisory Council on Human Trafficking to review federal policy and programs. Other proposals may also make valuable contributions, but these are the three most important principles to incorporate in new legislative initiatives. Thank you for your consideration. Please let us know if you have specific questions or would like more information on our program activities.

Hon. Chuck Grassley, Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC. Hon. Patrick J. Leahy, Ranking Member, Committee on the Judiciary, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC. Dear Chairman Grassley and Ranking Member Leahy: We are a coalition of organizations from across the United States dedicated to improving the lives of vulnerable women and children and write to express our support for the Justice for Victims of Trafficking Act of 2015, S. 178 (JVTA). The JVTA would provide much needed services and support to domestic victims of trafficking and provide a tool for law enforcement, courts, and the anti-trafficking task forces throughout the country to effectively target the demand that fuels the sex trafficking market. The JVTA provides unprecedented support to domestic victims of trafficking, who are too often invisible and underserved, by creating grants for state and local governments to develop comprehensive support programs for victims. In addition, the Act will directly assist domestic victims of trafficking by finally allowing them access to the same services and support systems that have been previously available only to foreign victims of human trafficking in the U.S. The legislation prioritizes victim assistance by training federal prosecutors and judges on the importance of requesting and ordering restitution, and training law enforcement on facilitating physical and mental health services for trafficking victims they encounter. Every day in this country, thousands of women and children are bought and sold. The unfettered demand for sex, with underage girls in particular, has caused pimps and exploiters to resort to more extreme tactics in order to meet the growing demand. Women and children, especially girls, are advertised online where buyers purchase them with ease, anonymity, and impunity. This happens in every city, in every state. The elimination of sex trafficking is fundamentally linked to targeting the demand for commercial sex. Any effort to prevent sex trafficking must focus on the sex buyers and facilitators. Without buyers of commercial sex, sex trafficking would not exist. This legislation is vital. The Justice for Victims of Trafficking Act of 2015 represents an effort to provide the necessary support services to our domestic victims of trafficking in the U.S. and to target the culture of impunity for those who seek to purchase sex, especially with children. As leaders in the anti-trafficking, anti-violence, child welfare, civil rights, runaway and homeless youth, and human rights movements, we urge Congress to pass this critical piece of legislation.

Hon. Chuck Grassley, Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC. Hon. Patrick J. Leahy, Ranking Member, Committee on the Judiciary, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC. Chairman Grassley and Ranking Member Leahy: As organizations representing law enforcement leaders, officers, and state and local prosecutors from across the United States, we write to express our support for S. 178, the Justice for Victims of Trafficking Act of 2015 (JVTA). The JVTA would provide much needed services and support to domestic victims of trafficking. More importantly, this bill provides necessary tools for law enforcement, courts, and the anti-trafficking task forces throughout the country to effectively target the demand that fuels the sex trafficking market. The JVTA provides unprecedented resources to address the issue of domestic victims of trafficking, who are too often invisible and underserved, by creating grants for state and local governments to develop comprehensive systems to address these crimes and provide services for victims. In addition, the legislation allows wire-taps obtained through state courts to be used for child sex trafficking, trains federal prosecutors and judges on the importance of requesting and ordering restitution, and trains law enforcement on facilitating physical and mental health services for trafficking victims they encounter. According to the National Center for Missing & Exploited Children (NCMEC), at least 100,000 American children each year are the victims of commercial child prostitution and child trafficking. Women and children, especially girls, are also advertised online where buyers purchase them with ease, anonymity, and impunity. This happens in every city, in every state. The elimination of sex trafficking is fundamentally linked to targeting the demand for commercial sex. Without buyers of commercial sex, sex trafficking would not exist. It is for this reason and others stated above that we, as representatives of law enforcement and the courts, support this bill. The Justice for Victims of Trafficking Act of 2015 addresses a critical need by providing the necessary tools and support services for domestic victims of trafficking in the U.S. We urge Congress to pass this critical piece of legislation. Sincerely, National District Attorneys Association, Association of State Criminal Investigative Agencies, National Association of Police Organizations, Federal Law Enforcement Officers Association, National Fusion Center Association, National Black Prosecutors Association. National Troopers Coalition, Major Cities Chiefs Association, Major County Sheriffs' Association, National Sheriffs' Association, Association of Prosecuting Attorneys. Mr. GRASSLEY. I also take this opportunity to thank the organizations Rights4Girls, Shared Hope International, the Polaris Project, and the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, among many other supporters of the bill, for their effort in assisting in our refinement of this legislation so it could move forward in this manner. I yield the floor. Mr. LEAHY. If the Senator will yield for a question, there is so much of this bill I strongly support. In fact, a lot of it reflects legislation I have written and actually passed through the committee before. I have a couple of concerns, but one that comes to mind is that we don't want to hold out false promises to victims, and I know the Senator doesn't want to either. I certainly support having any money that the traffickers are fined go to supporting this, but my experience earlier as a prosecutor and my experience now in talking to prosecutors around the country is that most of these people, when they get prosecuted, are basically judgment- proof--they don't have any money or they have a very small amount of money. They will go to prison. Who pays for that? Of course taxpayers pay for the prison, whether it is Federal or State. They will pay for the prisons, but there is no money for the victims. What happens if the fine money does not materialize? We have talked about up to $30 million, I think, in fines, but let's suppose we only come up with a few thousand dollars in fines. Are we making a promise to these victims that can't be met? Is there an alternative for them in case the fines don't pay for it? Mr. GRASSLEY. I guess, based upon the experience of the supporters of the legislation and the expert advice they got in coming to the conclusion of how to fund this fund, they feel the money is going to be available to do that. You ask a legitimate question. I suppose I ought to have an answer for it, and I don't have from this standpoint. I think that I have great faith in the figures they have presented us and that we will have to deal with the issue you bring up at some future time because I think we will want everybody to be made whole if what you say happens. Mr. LEAHY. The reason I ask, Mr. President, is because I know in the House of Representatives they have been concerned that the money might not be there. I think we all want to accomplish these things for the victims. I just want to make sure we are not holding out a promise that we can't complete. Do I agree with all the fines going into this fund? Absolutely. But the experience of a lot of prosecutors I have talked with is that the court may say: I fine you $20,000 or $30,000, but this is never paid. They go to prison. They have no assets. We are spending $25,000 to $35,000 a year as taxpayers keeping them in prison, and I want them to be in prison, but there is no money for victims. Mr. GRASSLEY. I can say to the Senator that he raises a legitimate point because I know in other areas we have set up such funds and sometimes they come up short. But we have to remember that sometimes something is not paid out because a lot of times excess money is used for something else in the Federal budget and not paid out entirely the way it was intended originally. But I would urge my colleague to take the word of the people who have done the research on this legislation to bring it together and the consensus it has from 200 or more organizations and feel that it will be successful. If it isn't, then I pledge to help you deal with that at that particular time. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont. Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, the issues raised in this are serious matters, and the Senator from Iowa, Senator Klobuchar, Senator Cornyn, and others should be concerned about this. I think of a victim I have talked with, Holly Austin Smith. She was 14 years old when she ran away from home and quickly became a victim of human trafficking. She met a man in a shopping mall who told her she was pretty, and promised he would give her a glamorous life in California. Remember, she was 14 years old. Then he sold her for sex. The first man she was sold to commented that she reminded him of his own granddaughter--but then he paid $200 to rape her. Thankfully, Holly escaped and has rebuilt her life. She is now a fierce advocate of ending all forms of human trafficking because she knows what happens to those who are trafficked. But many are not so lucky. The physical and psychological scars of being bought and sold, of being raped multiple times a night by different men, are devastating. This terrible crime destroys lives. As we consider legislation to combat human trafficking, we must remember Holly and the thousands of other vulnerable and victimized children she represents, and we must do everything we can to keep it from happening in the first place. Last Congress, in 2013, I led the effort to reauthorize the Trafficking Victims Protection Act. That historic bipartisan legislation and the funds it authorized signaled our country's commitment to ending all forms of human trafficking, both here at home and around the world. So I am glad, after the attention we gave to my bill last Congress, to see the Senate return its attention to this issue. Stories such as Holly's make clear we have more work to do. I support the bill we take up today, the Justice for Victims of Trafficking Act, but I believe we must do more to prevent trafficking in the first place. We have to act to protect our young people before they become victims. It is one thing to say now that you have become a victim, we are here to help you. It does even more if we can stop them from being victims in the first place. The legislation that Senator Collins of Maine and I have introduced seeks to do just that. Homeless and runaway kids are exceptionally vulnerable to human traffickers. A recent survey [[Page S1359]] found that one in four homeless teens was a victim of sex trafficking or had been forced to provide sex for survival needs. These vulnerable children, alone and on the street, are walking prey. Human traffickers lurk around bus stops and parks where homeless children congregate. They offer promises of something to eat and a night off the streets. They exploit the very sad reality that most of these children have no place to go. The weather may be cold. Far too many of our cities have no shelter for kids, and those who do face a chronic shortage of beds. Then somebody comes up and says: I will offer you food, I will offer you a warm place to sleep for the night. As Representative Poe recently said at an event on ending human trafficking: We have more animal shelters in this country than places for young people to find a safe place to sleep. What does that say about our priorities? I have nothing against having the animal shelters, but shouldn't we have more for our children than we do for the animals? If we are serious about preventing human trafficking, we must protect these kids. We have to provide better outreach to them, more beds for them to sleep in, and more counseling to get them on the path to a stable life. This kind of prevention costs money, but it saves lives and prevents the far more costly effects of human trafficking--not just the effects of human trafficking on the victims' part, but the cost to all of us. This is smart money we ought to be proud to invest in our children. We must include the Runaway and Homeless Youth and Trafficking Prevention Act in our efforts here to prevent more of our kids from becoming victims. I look forward, at the appropriate place, to offering our bipartisan legislation as an amendment. I know other Senators have amendments they wish to see considered. Senator Corker, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, has an important piece of legislation to combat sex and labor trafficking in countries around the world. I thank him for working with me to make some improvements to its funding provisions and I hope this bipartisan legislation will be considered as an amendment by the full Senate. I mentioned earlier Senator Klobuchar has been working for years to see the safe harbor bill get passed, to make sure victims are treated as victims and not as criminals. I am proud to cosponsor her bill. After all, as I said about the Violence Against Women Act, a victim is a victim is a victim. They are not criminals. They are victims. Senator McConnell has long promised a full amendment process. I take him at his word and I expect we will have the opportunity to strengthen the underlying bill with a variety of ideas from Senators. We owe it to survivors such as Holly to pass the strongest possible bill. We have to provide the resources desperately needed by those on the front lines protecting young people every day, such as those in my home State of Vermont at Spectrum Services and the Vermont Coalition of Runaway and Homeless Youth Programs service providers. We owe it to all the survivors who bravely come forward and tell their stories, hoping to prevent just one more child from falling prey to this terrible crime. The Senate has to pass a strong, comprehensive bill that includes prevention and prosecution, but also services for victims. We haven't accomplished as much as we should if we are only able to prosecute the perpetrator after the fact and forget about helping the victim. We have to stop trafficking from happening in the first place; but if it does happen, we have to help the victims. An editorial in the New York Times last week noted that: . . . a consensus is emerging on new initiatives to confront this human-rights problem and help its victims, often runaways or homeless youngsters who have been forced or coerced into prostitution. I agree with that editorial, and I look forward to working with every Senator here to ensure we get this done for the American people. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the New York Times editorial be printed in the Record. There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows: [From the New York Times, March 5, 2015] Steps Against Juvenile Sex Trafficking (By the Editorial Board) The impression that America's sex-trafficking problem mostly involves young people smuggled from overseas has given way to broad recognition of a cruel homegrown reality: the tens of thousands of juveniles who are exploited each year by traffickers in this country. On Capitol Hill, a consensus is emerging on new initiatives to confront this human-rights problem and help its victims, often runaways or homeless youngsters who have been forced or coerced into prostitution. The Senate Judiciary Committee last week unanimously approved a pair of anti-trafficking bills with wide backing from victim advocates and other experts, and the full Senate is expected to take up the package soon. A bill championed by Senator John Cornyn, Republican of Texas, would create a new pool of financing--through additional fines on people convicted of sex and labor trafficking, child pornography and other crimes--for restitution, victim services and law enforcement. The idea of aiding victims without committing more tax dollars has drawn support from Republicans, and any new money for this badly underfinanced cause would help. The Cornyn bill would also encourage prosecution of the ``johns,'' or buyers of juvenile sex, who typically escape criminal charges even though they are paying for what amounts to the statutory rape of children and teenagers. Their demand is what's fueling the highly lucrative human slavery business. The second bill, put forward by Senator Amy Klobuchar, Democrat of Minnesota, would give a preference for Department of Justice law enforcement grants to states that adopt ``safe harbor'' laws. These laws help ensure that young people sold for sex are treated as victims and offered support services instead of being prosecuted. The House has approved similar bills, so it should not be hard to hammer out a strong final package. A preventive measure that would help ensure housing and services for homeless juveniles, who are often prey to traffickers, unfortunately stalled in the Senate Judiciary Committee. One obstacle was the resistance of some Republicans to its nondiscrimination provision guaranteeing fair treatment of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender youths. No young person should ``have to choose between selling their bodies and a safe place to sleep,'' said Senator Susan Collins, Republican of Maine, who introduced the bill with Patrick Leahy, Democrat of Vermont. Undeterred, they plan to seek consideration from the full Senate. Trafficking abroad remains a tremendous problem, so it is fitting that a promising approach comes from the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, which last week unanimously approved a measure to create an international public-private fund dedicated to the issue, similar to the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria. More resources could do a lot to help trafficking's victims at home, too. Mr. LEAHY. We talk about the Runaway and Homeless Youth Trafficking and Prevention Act. This is a partial list of the local, State, and national groups which have urged its passage. There are too many to read--this has to be in small type; otherwise, we would have a dozen posters if we put it in larger type.

Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I see the distinguished senior Senator from Texas on the floor seeking recognition. I wonder if we could suggest the absence of a quorum for just 1 minute. Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I know the Senator from West Virginia will be giving her first speech in the Senate here shortly and I look forward to listening to that, but I wanted to say a few words about the legislation we will be debating and hopefully passing this week, and that is the Justice for Victims of Trafficking Act. This is without a doubt one of the most shocking and troubling issues facing our country today. It is no exaggeration to say modern-day human slavery, at a time when we believed as a country that slavery was a part of [[Page S1361]] our past and something we only read about in our history books. Many people are under the impression that human trafficking is a problem somewhere else or at some other time in history, but the fact is human trafficking is a problem right now in all 50 States, right here in the United States of America, the most affluent country in the world. It is not just a problem in Texas, it is not just a problem in Arizona, it is not just a problem in West Virginia, it is a problem in all 50 States. Thousands of young girls, many of them middle school age, are trapped into a life of bondage where they are abused and sold for sex every day. It is not easy to say, but it is true, and we must say it and we must acknowledge it. This is of course unconscionable. As the father of two daughters myself, it is simply heartbreaking to hear the stories of young women who have been trapped in this system. Of course, we can imagine it is every parent's worst nightmare. One woman I have had the privilege of meeting and who shared her very personal story about this is Melissa Woodward from the Dallas-Fort Worth area in Texas. When she was 12 years old--12 years old--she was sold into the sex trade by a family member, somebody whom she had every right to assume cared for her, loved her, wanted her to grow up being a loved and productive person. But she was sold into the sex trade by a family member. Eventually she was pulled out of school and trafficked full time when she was in sixth grade. Her life became a prison. She was chained to a bed in a warehouse. She endured regular beatings and, of course, she was sexually assaulted with regularity. She was even set on fire by one of her captors. All the while, she was forced to serve between 5 and 30 men every day. Melissa has said that she wished she were dead. Her story of her time in captivity is gut-wrenching and heartbreaking, but just as sad is the way she was treated once she escaped from her captors. As is the case with so many victims, Melissa struggled for years to distance herself from her past. But instead of being treated as the victim she was, the criminal justice system actually treated her as the criminal. That is an all too common outcome for victims of trafficking, who are labeled as prostitutes and are left with few options but to return to the nightmare that so sadly exists in our country. That needs to change. That is why I am glad the Senate is taking up the Justice for Victims of Trafficking Act, because this begins the process of making that important change. The bill helps law enforcement crack down on criminal trafficking rings and perpetrators of these crimes. Instead of a slap on the wrist and a fine, the so-called johns--the demand side for this terrible trade--will be treated as the child rapists and the criminals they are. No longer are we just going to deal with the supply side. We are going to pay attention to the demand side too. Critically, this bill takes fines from the perpetrators of these awful crimes and redirects them into a crime victims fund which will help people such as Melissa and others get a fresh lease on life, to begin to heal and to get the help they so badly need in order to get on with their lives. This week we have a wonderful opportunity in the Senate, in a town that is too often divided by ideology and partisanship, to do something together on a bipartisan basis that can help people such as Melissa and the thousands of young girls like her waiting to be saved. All of us, Republicans and Democrats alike, are committed to working together to do everything we can to help these victims and to put an end to this abhorrent practice. This particular legislation we are taking up today passed unanimously out of the Judiciary Committee a few weeks ago. That doesn't happen very often, but it did for this legislation. More than 200 groups around the country--such as the NAACP, the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, Rights4Girls, the Fraternal Order of Police, and the National Conference of State Legislatures--have all endorsed our work on this issue. I want to particularly thank some of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle who joined me on this effort: the senior Senator from Minnesota, Ms. Klobuchar, and the senior Senator from Oregon, Mr. Wyden. They have been great partners in this fight--not just this year but for many years. And there are many others. Another great partner has been the junior Senator from Illinois, Mr. Kirk, who has worked for years to get antitrafficking legislation to the floor. He introduced a bill called the HERO Act which authorizes a program to recruit wounded, injured, and returning veterans and provides them with training in high-tech computer forensics and law enforcement skills to help fight child exploitation. I also want to acknowledge the great contribution of the junior Senator from Ohio, Mr. Portman, who has a bill called the Bringing Missing Children Home Act, which improves the way cases of missing children are handled, strengthening law enforcement reporting and response procedures. Both the HERO Act and the Bringing Missing Children Home Act have been incorporated into the underlying bill, and I want to thank both of them for their efforts and willingness to work with us to make the Justice for Victims of Trafficking Act even stronger. I know there are Members who are interested in offering amendments to this legislation. Thanks to the majority leader, we are going to have an open process where anybody with a better idea who wants to add to this base of work that is contained in this bill will have the opportunity to do so, both offering amendments and seeking votes on those. This is a fight that sadly must be fought, but it is a fight we will win. When we do, we will finally have done our part to help deliver our Nation's promise of freedom to those who are enslaved. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia. making washington work for west virginia Mrs. CAPITO. Mr. President, I rise today to deliver my maiden speech as a Senator from West Virginia. I am deeply humbled by the confidence placed in me by fellow West Virginians. To serve as West Virginia's first female Senator is a true honor and one that comes with great responsibility. I hope to serve as an example for that next generation of West Virginians, including my own grandchildren Celia and Charlie, and hopefully for many others. I find myself in a unique place in history, and I am grateful to and inspired by my own loving family, my husband Charlie and our three children, Charles, Moore, and Shelley, and their spouses. For 14 years I have proudly served the people of West Virginia's Second Congressional District in the House of Representatives. I bring that experience to the Senate combined with a strong desire to make Washington work for West Virginia. West Virginia has a time-honored history of exceptional Senators, including my predecessors, Senators Jay Rockefeller and Robert C. Byrd. I am appreciative of their efforts to better West Virginia during their more than 80 years of combined public service in this great body. I am proud of our State's rich history, culture, and natural beauty. But it is our people that I hold dearest in my heart. West Virginians are strong and resilient. We are the embodiment of our State's history. Born of the Civil War, West Virginians fought for freedom in the face of great turmoil. As a result, President Abraham Lincoln signed the proclamation making West Virginia the 35th State admitted to the Union. Today, our State's forceful motto, ``Mountaineers are always free,'' remains emblazoned in Latin on our State flag. We will never forget the principles on which our great State was founded. The Mountain State is home to unmatched scenery and natural resources that can power our Nation's economy. A State filled with small towns, Main Streets and tight knit communities, West Virginians come together to solve problems and help neighbors in need. I have often said that West Virginia is one big small town. West Virginians expect the Senate to find pragmatic solutions to the momentous problems confronting our [[Page S1362]] country. That is particularly true now during this period of divided government. There are clear differences among the American people, and these differences are certainly reflected in the Senate. West Virginia is represented by both parties in the Senate, and I look forward to continuing to work with my friend Senator Joe Manchin in the months ahead, and I thank him for being here with me as a source of support today. Together, I hope we can reinstate respect for the institution, a place where deliberation and debate are valued and all voices are heard. We owe it to the American people to do better. Throughout my time in Congress I have heard a clear and consistent message from West Virginians: Improve the economic opportunities for our State, stop the bickering, and fight for our jobs. As Leader McConnell has stated, to do this the Senate must work more, have an open amendment process--which we are going to be having here in the next several days--and take the tough votes. After all, that is why we are here. Today I will outline how I plan to produce bipartisan, commonsense solutions in the Senate to make West Virginia communities stronger. This plan will create economic opportunities by bridging the gap and tackling America's infrastructure crisis, better connecting West Virginia and rural communities through increased broadband access, caring for our Nation's veterans, and ensuring a bright future for young West Virginians, and implementing a commonsense energy policy that utilizes our vast natural resources to provide affordable and reliable energy. First, addressing our country's crumbling infrastructure is an area that can bridge the partisan divide and further economic growth. American communities need a strong Federal highway program and a full 6-year bill to meet the needs of our growing population, to ensure safety for travelers, and to offer opportunity for growth in areas that struggle economically. West Virginians, like many across the Nation, rely heavily on roads, bridges, and highway transit to fuel our economy, to access hard to reach areas in our State, to get to and from work, and to transport necessary goods and services. U.S. Route 35 will drastically improve safety for residents in Putnam and Mason Counties. Corridor H will unleash the economic potential of our State's eastern highlands. U.S. Route 340 will help address congestion in our eastern panhandle, and the Coalfields Expressway and the King Coal Highway can help isolated communities attract businesses and provide jobs. Point Pleasant's Charles Lanham, a well-respected gentleman, had a vision. With his friend Jack Fruth, they began a crusade for their community. For many years Charles has worked to build the case for a 4-lane U.S. Route 35, a project that will provide a secure route to school for our children and serve as a regional transportation artery between Interstate 64 and the Great Lakes region. Charles understands the economic and safety benefits the road provides and has fought for them. Working with Charles we have made significant progress on Route 35, but all of our States need certainty to invest in our transportation infrastructure. That certainty comes with a long-term surface transportation reauthorization bill, which brings these projects to reality across the country. Working together we can and we must achieve this goal. Now is the time to move our transportation system forward. Second, I am committed to expanding access to broadband in communities across West Virginia, and I will be a champion for connecting our State. High-speed Internet access is a pillar of our 21st century infrastructure and a gateway to growth in rural America. High-tech businesses can power our small communities. The world literally can be at your desktop. Unfortunately, for all the potential opportunities that broadband can offer to rural America, not having this important service can place an almost insurmountable barrier to economic development, and there are many areas in my State and the leader's State that still do not have adequate access. These areas are at risk of being left behind. In Capon Bridge, WV, a lack of broadband access is an obstacle to attracting jobs and economic development. Sadly, Capon Bridge is not unique in this regard. Small communities across West Virginia and elsewhere in rural America lack fundamental infrastructure and lack access to vital opportunities as a result. The answer for Capon Bridge is not a regulated Internet. Too much government control would be counterproductive, choking off private sector expansion projects and hindering new technologies. But we have to recognize that there is a role for government in helping broadband reach those hard-to-serve communities. We should leverage resources at all levels of government and encourage public-private partnerships to expand access to rural Americans. This is a necessary and achievable goal. It may sound like a small desire, but connectivity is essential to compete and thrive. Health care access is critically important to West Virginians. We must continue to provide access to our veterans and to our children. West Virginians have a strong history of service to our Nation. These brave men and women have put themselves in harm's way to defend our freedoms. It is our solemn responsibility to care for them when they return home. These American heroes deserve the best possible treatment and top- notch mental health services. Access to care can be especially challenging for our veterans who live in rural communities. Many West Virginia veterans must travel significant distances to get to a VA hospital. In many cases, allowing veterans to receive treatment closer to home is more convenient for the patient and more efficient for the VA. While we have made strides to improve access for our veterans, the current program is not working as well as it should. More must be done. Expanded access to private medical providers will help improve the quality of care we offer to our veterans. Our children in the Mountain State also deserve quality health care. If our children, the next generation of leaders, are going to realize their potential, they must have a healthy foundation. A solid education and good health are pillars for success of future generations. As a parent and grandparent, this is personal. We must work together to continue funding the State Children's Health Insurance Program. I started my legislative career in the West Virginia House of Delegates where I served on the committee that first implemented the SCHIP program in our State. Today this program provides access to health care for tens of thousands of West Virginia's children. Maintaining this program is a priority I share with my predecessor, Senator Rockefeller, who was a tireless advocate for children's health insurance during his three decades of service in this body. I am encouraged that Senators in both parties have recognized the importance of providing continued funding for the bipartisan SCHIP program. Finally, and of critical importance to the State of West Virginia and the country, we need to work together to implement a commonsense energy policy. We need an affordable and reliable energy policy that utilizes our State's vast natural resources. We need a policy that grows the economy and creates new job opportunities. We need a policy that supports a strong middle class. We need a policy that ensures we continue to improve safety and our environment even as we expand energy production. The administration's overreach has contributed to thousands of coal miners losing their jobs in West Virginia and our neighboring States, devastating--I can't overstate this enough--local communities and families. Last year I met a recently laid off coal miner from Raleigh County. After losing his job, his church came together to prepare meals for other coal miners and their families while they searched for work. Neighbors helping neighbors--the West Virginia way. This is a stark reminder of the impact misguided Federal policies can have on the lives of real people. Anti-coal policies impact more than miners and their families. In West Virginia the attack on coal mines reduces [[Page S1363]] revenues for education programs, roads, and other public services. Higher utility prices caused by overregulation means fewer jobs in energy-intensive manufacturing. And sadly, lower income families and senior citizens who live on fixed incomes are disproportionately impacted by higher energy costs. As chairman of the Subcommittee on Clean Air and Nuclear Safety, I will lead the fight against excessive government regulation that has been devastating my State. There are many areas of energy policy where we can find common ground. While the EPA's proposed greenhouse gas standards are misguided, we should continue to make the use of fossil fuel cleaner and more efficient. We must continue to support important research at Morgantown's National Energy Technology Lab and other labs that allows us to make environmental progress even as we continue to use our natural resources. Natural gas is a large and growing part of West Virginia's economy. As a child of Marshall County, which is the heart of the Marcellus Shale development in West Virginia, I am delighted to see these communities come alive with opportunity. It is proof positive that an energy economy is a jobs economy. We need improved infrastructure in order to make full use of these gas reserves. We need new natural gas and oil pipelines that safely connect producing regions with manufacturers. We need new markets that can make use of these vital resources. We need a pro-exports policy that will benefit our country in multiple ways. The Nation will see more jobs and investment, more security, and a more independent future, and at the same time we can strengthen our relationships with important allies overseas by providing them with the energy they need. These are just a few of the ideas I hope to refine and accomplish during my first term in the Senate. Notably, there are many other very important issues--such as national security, fiscal responsibility, a balanced budget, and replacement of the Affordable Care Act--on which I will be focusing. Our plate is full, and expectations are high, as they should be. We need to roll up our sleeves and deliver. I am optimistic that we can find solutions that move our country forward. There will be differences of opinion and philosophy along the way, but Americans expect us to bridge those gaps. Senator Byrd, the longest serving Senator, said it best: I love this Senate. I love it dearly. I love the Senate for its rules. I love the Senate for its precedence. I love the Senate for the difference that it can make in people's lives. Fighting for West Virginians always has been and always will be my top priority. I am honored--I can't overstate that--to represent the great people of the Mountain State as we strive to create a strong and prosperous future. Now is the time for Washington to work for West Virginia, and I stand ready to do my part. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader. Congratulating The Senator From West Virginia Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I wish to say to our new Senator from West Virginia what an outstanding speech not only for her State but the way forward for our country, and I congratulate her for an outstanding set of comments. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The senior Senator from West Virginia. Mr. MANCHIN. Mr. President, I also wish to congratulate my colleague from West Virginia. We spoke earlier about how she and I can show the way to have a better relationship-building effort here in the Senate by working together in order to better serve the people of West Virginia and also the country. I congratulate my colleague on her great speech and look forward to working with her. I think she has done a great job for the people of West Virginia, and I again thank the Senator. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia. Tackling National Security Questions Mr. KAINE. Mr. President, I rise to address a question to myself and every Member of this body, and the question is a serious one: Is the Senate capable of tackling challenging national security questions in a mature and responsible way? We have many hard national security challenges before us now. Three of those challenges are urgent: the discussions about a potential nuclear deal with Iran, the discussions in this body about military action by the United States against ISIL, and the deliberations that will take place this month about the American budget, which will determine whether we have the resources we need to meet our security challenges. We have to show the American public--and I would argue the world--that we can give these issues the careful consideration they deserve, but I am forced to admit that recent events have caused me to have some significant doubts about our institutional capacity to tackle these issues in a responsible way. We recently--at the end of February--ran up to the very brink of shutting down the Department of Homeland Security at a time when terrorist threats and other threats to our homeland security are so obvious on our borders and throughout the world. Thank goodness, after a week's extension of funding for Homeland Security, we pulled back from the brink. But that did not lead to an increase in confidence in this body, that Congress would contemplate not funding the Department of Homeland Security. Last week there was a joint address to Congress by Prime Minister Netanyahu. I spent many hours conversing with Prime Minister Netanyahu in his office about Iran and other topics, but I am sad to look at that joint address and basically say it was history-making in some unfortunate ways. Congress has heard from the Prime Minister or President of Israel seven times in the last 50 years--eight times if you count last week. Last week's address was unusual because it was designed in a partisan way. It was an invitation by the leadership of one party with an intentional decision not to let the White House know, not to let the minority party in Congress know, and to schedule the speech days before a contested foreign election, leading many to conclude that it was an effort by Congress to affect a foreign election, which we should never do. Following that speech, a carefully worked bipartisan bill that has been introduced in Congress to give Congress an appropriate review role over any potential Iranian nuclear deal was basically hijacked. Instead of allowing the bill to go through Congress, there was a decision to force the bill to the floor for an immediate vote, which was seen by all as a partisan move. It was described by one of the Republican sponsors of the bill as an effort to embarrass Democrats. Thank goodness that at the end of the day that effort to accelerate consideration of what was a bipartisan bill was pulled back, and we will not be doing that this week. We will be allowing a normal committee process. But the fact that the effort was made did damage to reasonable bipartisan consideration of this important issue. Then yesterday we all awoke to the news that there had been a partisan letter signed by 47 Senators--47 of my colleagues, many of whom I work with very closely--not to the President saying ``We have concerns about a deal, and we are going to weigh in'' but instead to the leader of a nation that we characterize as a terrorist state. This letter presumed to instruct the nation about what Congress might or might not do. The letter was widely viewed as an effort to undercut or dilute diplomatic negotiations that are in the best tradition of our country, the notion of diplomacy. I just came from hearings this morning in the Armed Services Committee where we heard what we have heard for 2\1/2\ years: advice from our military leadership to the Senate that sequester is hurting our national defense. Will you finally listen to us? Will you do something about it? All of these events over the last few weeks when taken together suggest the sad possibility of a Senate that will elevate partisan political division over careful and constructive deliberation, even on the most critical security issues that affect the security of our country and the world. I deeply believe that this body--the Senate and Congress generally--has to pull back from the brink of irresponsible and partisan action with respect to these critical security questions because the stakes are simply too high. [[Page S1364]] With respect to the Iranian nuclear negotiation, I share many of the concerns of my 47 colleagues who wrote the letter. I share many of the concerns of the Prime Minister that were shared in his speech last week. But I deeply believe we should not try to tank a deal, critique a deal, or undercut a deal before there is a deal because to the extent there are efforts to stand and say this is a bad deal before there is a deal, the message that is communicated to the American public and to the world is: We will never accept any deal. We are not interested in diplomacy. We are not interested in negotiation. That attitude plays directly into the hands of the nation of Iran, which is currently engaging in terrorist activity. They want to be able to blame the absence of any deal on an intransigent United States that is unwilling to negotiate in good faith. We should not tank a deal before there is a deal. Instead, why don't we do what we are supposed to do as the greatest deliberative body in the world? Why don't we allow negotiators who have been working in the best traditions of American diplomacy to see if they can find a deal and then put it on the table for the review of Congress, as has always been contemplated? I am a proud original cosponsor and worked on the draftsmanship of a bipartisan bill that was introduced under the key sponsorship of Foreign Relations chair Senator Corker and ranking member Senator Menendez to guarantee to Congress an appropriate review of any final deal with Iran over their nuclear program if such a deal was reached. This is a bill which is rigorously bipartisan--not partisan, not political, not rushed, not accelerated, but rigorously bipartisan. It respects the ongoing process by allowing the negotiators to do their work and see if they can find an outcome. It guarantees Congress a debate and vote if a deal includes relief under the congressional sanctions Congress has enacted over the years. It is appropriately deferential to the Executive, allowing the Executive the flexibility to do sanctions relief under Executive or international sanctions that have not been part of any congressional statute. This is a bipartisan bill which provides some assurance to allies. Our allies in the region--allies that are most affected by the Iranian nuclear ambitions are not part of the P5+1, whether you are talking about Israel or Gulf State nations or Jordan. The nations most affected by Iranian nuclear ambitions are not part of the P5+1, and the Corker- Menendez bill would give them some comfort that a deal, if announced, would receive some careful scrutiny in this body. Finally, I believe the Corker-Menendez bipartisan approach even provides some important assurances to Iran in the negotiation. We want Iran to make not small concessions, we want them to make big and bold concessions and give up any intent to develop nuclear weapons. But what is the likelihood that Iran will make those concessions if they have no knowledge about what Congress's intent is vis-a-vis the congressional statutory provisions? There is a right way and a wrong way to approach these matters. To rush it, to label a deal as a bad deal before there is a deal, to make it entirely partisan rather than bipartisan, reflecting the will of the body, is an effort to undercut negotiations that weakens our President, weakens our country, and weakens our credibility; whereas if we proceed in a bipartisan way, we can make the deal stronger. Similarly--and then I wish to cede the moment to my colleague, the Senator from Maine--we are about to start work on another critically important issue--whether Congress should finally, after 7-plus months, have a debate to authorize an ongoing war against the Islamic State in the Levant that was begun on August 8 by the President. We are now in the eighth month of a unilateral war, and aside from a Foreign Relations Committee vote in committee in December, Congress has not had a meaningful vote or debate on this fundamental responsibility. We owe it to ourselves and to this institution, we owe it to the important national security interests at stake, and especially we owe it to the people who are risking their lives in this war--and we have already had deaths of American servicemembers as part of Operation Inherent Resolve--we owe it to them to show we can have a meaningful debate that is not partisan, that is not rushed, but that is careful and deliberate. They have been waiting for 7-plus months to see whether Congress even cares. We are at war by a Presidential act. Does Congress even care enough to have the debate on the floor of the Senate and in the House of Representatives? Is it just partisanship now? Is it just delay now? Does the fact our service men and women are risking their lives even matter to us now? This is the debate we will be entering into within the next few days, starting with the hearing in the Senate Foreign Relations Committee tomorrow. We can't afford, on important issues of national security such as Iran or such as the war against ISIL, to send the impression to our troops, to our citizens, to our global citizens around the world, that on these important matters Congress is now just a partisan sort of sideshow rather than the deliberative body we were set up to be. We have to find a bipartisan path forward on these important security issues or we weaken confidence in this institution and in the leadership of this country. In conclusion, the national security interests that are at stake right now before us are fundamental, whether it is about Iran, whether it is about the battle against ISIL, or whether it is about the budgetary deliberations we will be undertaking this month--a budgetary deliberation that will determine whether we can meet our commitments in these national security challenges. We have to get these debates right for the good of our country and the world, and we have to get them right to demonstrate to all that this institution does have the maturity to tackle these issues in a reasonable way. With that, I yield the last minute or so of my time to my colleague from Maine, Senator King. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cruz). The Senator from Maine. Mr. KING. Mr. President, there is little I can add to the remarks of the Senator from Virginia on this issue. I think this institution is being tested this week, this month, and over the next several months in a way that is really somewhat new. The test, the question, is: Can we deal with the most serious of issues facing this country and the world in a responsible, reasonable, and, yes, bipartisan, nonpartisan way? I also worked with Bob Corker, Senator Kaine, and the whole group that worked on putting together--Senator Menendez--a bipartisan bill to provide Congress a role in the approval of whatever deal is struck with Iran. I believe Congress should have that role. But in those discussions, my concern was that some of our Members will not be able to resist the temptation to politicize and make a partisan issue--even this grave issue of war and peace, this grave issue that faces this country and the entire world--of the possibility of a regime such as that in Iran achieving nuclear weapons. This is not an ideological debate. This is a serious debate about the future of this country. This is one of the most serious negotiations of our adult lives. I want Congress to have a role, but I want it to play that role weighing the merits, pro or con, the actual materials that are in the treaty--in the agreement. I want us to have that role, but I want to be sure we can respond to that in a responsible way. Frankly, the actions of the last few days have shaken that confidence, because we have seen what appears to be an effort to gain political and partisan advantage from this gravest of national issues. I understand there are differences about what the deal should look like and what the terms should be. That is OK. That is what we should be discussing. But to turn this into a partisan issue I think does a grave disservice to this entire country, and to undercut the President in the last stages of the negotiation to me is unprecedented and unthinkable. I was a young man at the time of the Cuban missile crisis. I cannot imagine the Congress of the United States writing a letter to Kruschev in the midst of those discussions and saying, Don't worry about this guy Kennedy, he doesn't speak for the country. Yet that essentially is what took place yesterday. I don't understand the need or the [[Page S1365]] helpfulness of such a statement at a time when we were already moving toward a bipartisan--I believe probably veto-proof--bill to provide this institution with a check on the quality of the deal that is being struck. It is not productive or helpful to turn issues of this kind into partisan issues. I hope we can step back from this partisan posture and meet this solemn responsibility to assess what the President and the administration and the other five countries--the agreement they come to with Iran--to determine whether, indeed, it is in the best interests of the region and the world. That is our responsibility. I hope we can muster the ability to meet that responsibility in a serious way and not, for once, turn it into a partisan issue. Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland. Tribute to Federal Employees Dr. Francis Collins, Dr. Nancy Sullivan, And Dr. William Gahl Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I wish to take a few moments today to speak about Federal workers in general and some of the people at the National Institutes of Health in particular. Government workers guard our borders, protect us from terrorists, treat our wounded veterans, dispense Social Security checks to our retirees, find cures for diseases, guide the Nation's air traffic, explore the tiniest particles and the vast expanse of outer space, ensure our air is safe to breathe, our water is safe to drink, our food is safe to eat, support our service men and women in harm's way, and promote our interests and ideals abroad. For whom does the government work? Government works for America. The Washington Post recently reported that since reliable data first became available shortly before World War II, the percentage of all employed people working for the Federal Government hit an all-time low in December. Fewer than 2 percent of the total U.S. workforce is employed by the Federal Government. Over nearly the past half century, from 1966 to 2012--the most recent year for which comparable data is available--the number of Federal workers in the executive branch dropped by 83,000. During that time, the U.S. population increased from under 200 million to over 300 million people and the gross domestic product nearly quadrupled. We can argue over whether we want bigger government or smaller government, but we should all agree we want better government. We can't have better government when Federal workers are constantly under assault. We need to stop treating the Federal workforce like a rented mule. We need to treat the Federal workforce like the critical asset it is. A 2011 report by the National Academy of Public Administration and the Kettering Foundation concluded that programs operated by civil servants receive ``significantly higher'' scores for management and effectiveness than those run by ``grant- and contract-based third parties.'' I think part of the problem is that Americans have come to accept that Federal workers are nameless, faceless bureaucrats. They aren't. They are people who are patriotic Americans and dedicated to public service. They have families and support their communities. They have been asked to do more and more with less and less while being subjected to pay freezes, sequestration-related furloughs, government shutdowns, and threats to their benefits. They have contributed $150 billion to deficit reduction while still working hard on behalf of all Americans. Today, as I mentioned, I wish to focus on the Federal workers at the National Institutes of Health. I wish to introduce my colleagues and all Americans to a few of the Federal workers who are making life better for all of us. But first a description of the NIH so people can understand its mission. I can sum up its mission in two words: saving lives. The NIH is the world's premier biomedical and health-related research facility. Its job is to perform and fund the research that helps improve the Nation's health--a job it has carried out for over a century. I am proud the NIH is headquartered in Maryland, but it is important to understand that NIH support of medical research at other research institutions has created jobs and fostered economic growth in each and every State, while establishing and maintaining the United States as the global leader in the life sciences. NIH-supported research added $69 billion to our GDP and supported 7 million jobs in 2011 alone. In the weeks and months ahead, Congress and the administration will have to decide whether they have to replace sequestration with a more logical, coherent, strategic, and responsible form of budgeting. While we will have disagreements over the details, if anyone needs to be convinced about the value of replacing sequestration, look no further than the situation at NIH. Funding constraints there not only cost people their jobs, they are costing people their lives. NIH funding has multiple drivers, but comparing the fiscal year 2013 figures with the fiscal year 2012 figures, largely because of sequestration, approximately 640 fewer competitive research project grants were issued and approximately 750 fewer new patients were admitted to the NIH Clinical Center. Each these affects a person's life. Each of these has consequences when we do not move forward as we should. A recent survey determined that nearly 20 percent of the biomedical scientists have considered leaving the United States due to sequestration. We are losing our best. Nearly one-half of the scientists surveyed said they have laid off staff in their laboratories or are considering laying off staff due to losing NIH grants. More than 50 percent of the researchers say they have colleagues who have lost his or her job. What is the impact? Delays in lifesaving medical progress. Medical breakthroughs do not happen overnight. In almost all instances, breakthrough discoveries result from years of incremental research to understand how diseases start and progress. Cuts to research are delaying progress in medical breakthroughs, including developing better cancer drugs that zero in on a tumor with fewer side effects; research on a universal flu vaccine that could fight every strain of influenza without needing a yearly shot; preventing debilitating chronic conditions that are costly to society and delay development of more effective treatments for common and rare diseases affecting millions of Americans. NIH Director Dr. Francis Collins recently wrote the column ``Exceptional Opportunities in Medical Science'' in which he describes the excitement over ``personalized medicine,'' the BRAIN initiative, and development of the Ebola vaccine. He has also shared his concern about the budget challenges NIH faces. Let me quote from Dr. Collins: Although all of these ambitious scientific endeavors offer exceptional promise for advancing human health, the effect that unprecedented budget pressures are having on biomedical research cannot be ignored. Due to inflation, the NIH budget has lost almost 25 percent of its purchasing power over the last decade. The decline has had important consequences. The NIH once funded one in three research proposals, but now only has enough resources to support one in six. As a result, a great deal of excellent science is being left unfunded. Last October Dr. Collins stated that cuts in Federal funding slowed the development of vaccines and therapies for the deadly Ebola virus, saying: ``Frankly, if we had not gone through our 10-year slide in research support, we probably would have had a vaccine in time for this that would have gone through clinical trials and would have been ready.'' Think about the lives that could have been saved. To Americans who wonder what their tax dollars do--well, some go to NIH to find treatments and cures for cancer, depression, arthritis, substance abuse, addiction, diabetes, and Alzheimer's disease. To date, 145 NIH-supported researchers have received or shared 85 Nobel Prizes. Not everyone wins a Nobel Prize, so let me talk about people who aren't in the spotlight--people some of our colleagues might refer to as ``nameless, faceless bureaucrats.'' I will highlight the work of two of them today who are making a tremendous contribution as public servants. Dr. Nancy Sullivan, Chief of the Vaccine Research Center, has been working on an Ebola vaccine for nearly two decades, dating back to when she was an investigator at the University of Michigan with the then-NIH grantee [[Page S1366]] and now former Director, Dr. Gary Nabel. Most vaccines spur production of a person's immune system's antibodies that block a virus from entering the cells, but that approach doesn't work for Ebola. Gene-based vaccines can induce additional virus fighters called T- cells, so that is what Dr. Sullivan created, using pieces of Ebola genetic material. It is the most promising approach yet, and it is being tested in the parts of West Africa that have been hit the hardest with Ebola, where more than 9,000 people have died. The concept for Dr. Sullivan's vaccine has been 16 years in the making, beginning back when few people outside the global infectious disease community had even heard of the deadly disease. Over the years, Dr. Sullivan and her team continued to tweak her ideas, constantly improving on them. Eventually she followed Dr. Nabel to NIH. Many experts in the vaccine research community had begun to believe Ebola was insurmountable. They thought it was too aggressive for a vaccine to ever protect against it. But Dr. Sullivan never lost heart that her work would one day prove successful. The Ebola virus infection is a highly lethal disease for which there are no effective therapeutic or preventive treatments. Consequently, work with these viruses requires highly specialized BSL-4 containment labs--the highest biosafety labs. Dr. Sullivan is a leader in the field and has personally conducted many of the most critical experiments. Her work on immunology and vaccine development is widely considered as some of the very best in the field. In spite of the difficulties associated with access to BSL-4 labs, her work has consistently been the source of novel observations. Dr. Sullivan received her Ph.D. in cell biology from Harvard University in 1997. She received her master of science in environmental engineering in 1989, also from Harvard University. I brought a poster to the floor where we see President Obama visited NIH to personally congratulate Dr. Sullivan for her incredible work on behalf of world health. Some people may be familiar with the TV show ``House.'' The main character, Dr. Gregory House, is brilliant at diagnosing conditions and illnesses that baffle everyone else. The real-life Dr. House is Dr. William Gahl, the founding Director of the Undiagnosed Diseases Program at NIH. He is America's leading medical detective, a physician dedicated to finding answers for long-suffering patients with mysterious illnesses that long eluded diagnosis. Dr. Gahl has brought together a unique combination of elite medical specialists, researchers, and Federal resources to solve baffling illnesses and provide desperate patients and their families with information and possible solutions and treatments for their often life-threatening ailments. Results include diagnosis and treatment of diseases so rare they don't even have names, plus new genetic discoveries, improved disease management, and the advancement of medical knowledge. NIH Director Dr. Collins said the Undiagnosed Diseases Program, which Dr. Gahl conceived and started, serves as a kind of court of last resort for patients without a diagnosis. Dr. Gahl has convinced some of the best, brightest, and busiest physicians to participate, and has devoted tremendous energy to examining patient records, selecting cases for in- depth analysis, and helping people who are seriously ill. Under Dr. Gahl's stewardship, the program regularly involves a collective effort by more than 25 attending physicians of different specialties. The cooperation by a diverse group of experts has helped create a coherent view of each patient instead of the organ-by-organ orientation taken by most specialists. Patients are brought to the NIH campus in Bethesda for an intensive week. They meet with a parade of specialists who study their medical histories, perform thorough exams, and take numerous tests. The doctors then meet to discuss what they have seen, discovered, or may have missed. They also debate various theories, trying to connect the dots, and come up with a possible diagnosis and treatment. Scientists working with Dr. Gahl discovered the genetic cause of a vascular disorder not previously identified in the medical literature. The rare condition, identified in nine individuals, arises in adulthood and causes arterial calcification in the hands and feet, but does not affect arteries in the heart. The symptoms include acute pain after walking more than a short distance. The disorder previously baffled the medical field and evaded diagnosis when conventional methods were used. In another instance, physicians working with Dr. Gahl identified the reason why a woman's muscles had grown painfully large and hard underneath her skin, making it increasingly difficult for her to perform daily activities. This turned out to be an extremely rare, generally fatal complication of multiple myeloma, and the diagnosis by the NIH Undiagnosed Diseases Program resulted in a stem cell bone marrow transplant that allows her to lead a normal life. These are people who had no hope, no hope at all. They came to NIH, and they have gotten government-supported help to give them hope and to give them life. Dr. Gahl earned his B.S. in biology from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1972 and his M.D. from the University of Wisconsin in 1976. He obtained a Ph.D. degree in oncology research from Wisconsin's McArdle Laboratory for Cancer Research in 1981. He has published more than 350 peer-reviewed papers and trained 36 biochemical geneticists. Dr. Gahl has made a number of seminal discoveries regarding rare diseases during his career. He said deciding who to admit into the Undiagnosed Diseases Program is always very difficult and much like triage on the battlefield. You have to make decisions about where you think you can do some good. The Undiagnosed Diseases Program serves people who feel helpless, have suffered greatly, have waited many years for answers, and must be treated with respect and attention. According to Dr. Gahl, the NIH caregivers understand the desperation the patients and their families feel and try to balance the difficulty finding solutions with a realistic measure of hope. Dr. John Gallin, Director of the NIH Clinical Center, said Dr. Gahl takes cases after everyone else has given up. He said that in a short time the program has developed new approaches for investigating, understanding, and diagnosing rare disorders, and has added to the body of medical knowledge. As Dr. Gallin put it, as a result of the NIH Undiagnosed Diseases Program, the language of medicine is changing. The different specialists working together now are beginning to find common ways. Nancy Sullivan and Bill Gahl are just two of the dedicated people who work in the Federal Government. They are not nameless, faceless bureaucrats. They are dedicated, hard-working Americans trying to make life better for all of us under difficult circumstances. At a minimum, they deserve our gratitude and respect. They also deserve a predictable and reasonable budget to support their critical work. In the weeks ahead I will be discussing the accomplishments of other outstanding Federal workers so that Americans can understand government works for America. I yield the floor. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 40 (Tuesday, March 10, 2015)] [Senate] [Pages S1349-S1366] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] JUSTICE FOR VICTIMS OF TRAFFICKING ACT OF 2015 The PRESIDING OFFICER.

TITLE III--HERO ACT SEC. 301. SHORT TITLE. This title may be cited as the ``Human Exploitation Rescue Operations Act of 2015'' or the ``HERO Act of 2015''. SEC. 302. HERO ACT. (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following: (1) The illegal market for the production and distribution of child abuse imagery is a growing threat to children in the United States. International demand for this material creates a powerful incentive for the rape, abuse, and torture of children within the United States. (2) The targeting of United States children by international criminal networks is a threat to the homeland security of the United States. This threat must be fought with trained personnel and highly specialized counter-child- exploitation strategies and technologies. [[Page S1355]] (3) The United States Immigration and Customs Enforcement of the Department of Homeland Security serves a critical national security role in protecting the United States from the growing international threat of child exploitation and human trafficking. (4) The Cyber Crimes Center of the United States Immigration and Customs Enforcement is a vital national resource in the effort to combat international child exploitation, providing advanced expertise and assistance in investigations, computer forensics, and victim identification. (5) The returning military heroes of the United States possess unique and valuable skills that can assist law enforcement in combating global sexual and child exploitation, and the Department of Homeland Security should use this national resource to the maximum extent possible. (6) Through the Human Exploitation Rescue Operative (HERO) Child Rescue Corps program, the returning military heroes of the United States are trained and hired to investigate crimes of child exploitation in order to target predators and rescue children from sexual abuse and slavery.

The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the time until 12:30 p.m. will be equally divided. The Senator from Iowa. (The remarks of Mr. Grassley pertaining to the introduction of S. 686 are printed in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced Bills and Joint Resolutions.'') Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, on this bill before the Senate, for a few days we will continue to debate legislation to fight crime and restore dignity to its survivors. I thank the majority leader for scheduling floor action on the Justice for Victims of Trafficking Act. This important bill is authored by our assistant majority leader, Senator Cornyn of Texas. Human trafficking is a serious crime that is too often overlooked in its various forms, which include both labor trafficking and sexual servitude. It causes drastic harm to its victims. A form of modern-day slavery, human trafficking includes both adults and children, as well as noncitizens and citizens of our country. Experts tell us it is not limited to big cities or our Nation's coasts but stretches across the whole Nation, even to the rural parts of our country, including my Midwest. Indeed, it happens every day, everywhere in this country. The Judiciary Committee met 2 weeks ago to hear testimony from a victim advocate, a law enforcement official, and a sex trafficking survivor about the challenges we face in fighting human trafficking. One witness, a criminal investigator from my State of Iowa who works for our Democratic attorney general Tom Miller, told us about a 20- year-old from my State who in December was abducted and forced into sexual servitude. We have made progress in curbing human trafficking since the passage in 2000 of the Federal Victims of Trafficking and Violence Protection Act--a measure I supported at that time--but there is still much work that remains to be done on this front. This bill before the Senate takes a creative and comprehensive approach to what is a pervasive and very troubling problem. The measure has been endorsed by over 200 groups, and it passed the Senate Judiciary Committee without a dissenting vote. The centerpiece of this bill is its creation of a new fund called the Domestic Trafficking Victims' Fund, which will be used to support a host of programs and services for human trafficking and child pornography survivors. The fund will be financed not by taxpayers' dollars but by fines collected from individuals convicted of human trafficking and human smuggling crimes, making it deficit neutral. If enacted, this bill will also equip law enforcement with new tools to fight trafficking. For example, it would make it easier for State law enforcement officials to wiretap human trafficking suspects without Federal approval. It also would expand the categories of persons who can be prosecuted for human trafficking. In addition, it clarifies that child pornography is a form of human trafficking. This bill takes an extremely thoughtful and comprehensive approach, tackling not only the supply of human trafficking victims but also the demand for these victims. Tackling the problem on both fronts is something the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service tells us is absolutely necessary if we are to successfully curb human trafficking. If enacted, this bill will ensure that both the trafficker and the buyer will be prosecuted for their crimes. We had an open and productive markup of this bill. I offered an amendment, which was accepted by voice vote, clarifying that Federal grant resources can be used to meet the housing needs of trafficking victims and offer training on the effects of sex trafficking to those who serve runaway, homeless, and at-risk youth. This amendment also updates the reauthorization language for the CyberTipline of the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children to ensure that child trafficking is specifically mentioned as a form of Internet-related child exploitation. Finally, this amendment would require the Interagency Task Force to monitor and combat trafficking to identify best practices to prevent human trafficking. Senator Blumenthal from the State of Connecticut also offered an amendment based on a bill he and Senator Kirk filed earlier this year, which was accepted in committee by a voice vote. Their bill, S. 575, known as the HERO Act, provides authorization for a program at the Department of Homeland Security that trains wounded warriors to assist in the effort to locate missing children. I am proud to be a cosponsor of the bill now before if Senate. I commend Senator Cornyn, the lead sponsor of this measure, for his efforts to refine the bill and build such a substantial, very bipartisan coalition supporting it. I hope we will show the same bipartisan cooperation and support on the floor as we consider amendments. I look forward to a vote on this bill as soon as possible. I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record letters in support of S. 178 from various organizations. There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows: February 23, 2015. Senator Chuck Grassley, Chair, U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee, Dirksen Senate Office Building, Washington, DC. Senator Patrick Leahy, Ranking Member, Russell Senate Office Building, Washington, DC. Senator Dianne Feinstein, Hart Senate Office Building, Washington, DC. Senator John Cornyn, Hart Senate Office Building, Washington, DC. Senator Amy Klobuchar, Hart Senate Office Building, Washington, DC. Dear Senators Grassley, Leahy, Feinstein, Cornyn, and Klobuchar: We write to you, the leaders of the U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee, and to three committee Senators who have been particularly sensitive to our (often ignored) perspective. We write to you as survivors of sex trafficking and commercial sexual exploitation. We write as survivors who know, profoundly and personally, the harm caused by this crime. And we write to you as survivor leaders of organizations trying to prevent sex trafficking before it victimizes others. We write to express our support for legislation that makes progress in three essential areas: 1. Identify new funding streams for victim services. Current public budgets are stressed. Victims of sex trafficking typically suffer multiple harms, requiring a range of services from medical and psychological assistance to treatment for the drug and alcohol addiction that so often accompanies trafficking (addictions that make people vulnerable to trafficking; addictions that develop or worsen as people try to cope with the pain of this intimate form of abuse). We've been told by law enforcement in numerous jurisdictions that when services don't exist (mainly because they are expensive) there's a disincentive to enforcing anti- trafficking laws and identifying victims. The Justice for Victims of Trafficking Act (JVTA), S. 178, is innovative for creating a new fund to finance victim-- services an essential goal. It also achieves a second principle we stand for: Making sex buyers accountable for the harm they cause. 2. Prevent sex trafficking by targeting the buyers who create demand. Logically, trafficking will never end until we shrink the demand that creates the market. People still in the life, still being exploited, sometimes avoid this conclusion because they see no other options but the cycle of violence in which they are trapped. We are strong witnesses to the necessity of making the buyers pay, to make the crime end. Two bills in particular strength accountability in the sex trafficking legal regime: S. 178 and Combat Human Trafficking Act of 2015, S. 140. By clarifying congressional intent that sex buyers be considered parties to the trafficking crime, by compelling the Department of Justice to incorporate training and technical assistance on investigating and prosecuting buyers in its anti-trafficking programming, and by making the crime more ``costly,'' we can finally begin to shrink its incidence. [[Page S1357]] 3. Treat victims as victims, not criminals, and let survivor voices inform anti-trafficking policy. Two bills in particular recognize these realities: the Stop Exploitation Through Trafficking Act, S. 166, which gives states incentives to approve ``Safe Harbor'' laws as well as job training options for victims and the Survivors of Human Trafficking Empowerment Act, which creates a survivors-led U.S. Advisory Council on Human Trafficking to review federal policy and programs. Other proposals may also make valuable contributions, but these are the three most important principles to incorporate in new legislative initiatives. Thank you for your consideration.

Hon. Chuck Grassley, Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC. Hon. Patrick J. Leahy, Ranking Member, Committee on the Judiciary, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC. Dear Chairman Grassley and Ranking Member Leahy: We are a coalition of organizations from across the United States dedicated to improving the lives of vulnerable women and children and write to express our support for the Justice for Victims of Trafficking Act of 2015, S. 178 (JVTA). The JVTA would provide much needed services and support to domestic victims of trafficking and provide a tool for law enforcement, courts, and the anti-trafficking task forces throughout the country to effectively target the demand that fuels the sex trafficking market. The JVTA provides unprecedented support to domestic victims of trafficking, who are too often invisible and underserved, by creating grants for state and local governments to develop comprehensive support programs for victims. In addition, the Act will directly assist domestic victims of trafficking by finally allowing them access to the same services and support systems that have been previously available only to foreign victims of human trafficking in the U.S. The legislation prioritizes victim assistance by training federal prosecutors and judges on the importance of requesting and ordering restitution, and training law enforcement on facilitating physical and mental health services for trafficking victims they encounter. Every day in this country, thousands of women and children are bought and sold. The unfettered demand for sex, with underage girls in particular, has caused pimps and exploiters to resort to more extreme tactics in order to meet the growing demand. Women and children, especially girls, are advertised online where buyers purchase them with ease, anonymity, and impunity. This happens in every city, in every state. The elimination of sex trafficking is fundamentally linked to targeting the demand for commercial sex. Any effort to prevent sex trafficking must focus on the sex buyers and facilitators. Without buyers of commercial sex, sex trafficking would not exist. This legislation is vital. The Justice for Victims of Trafficking Act of 2015 represents an effort to provide the necessary support services to our domestic victims of trafficking in the U.S. and to target the culture of impunity for those who seek to purchase sex, especially with children. As leaders in the anti-trafficking, anti-violence, child welfare, civil rights, runaway and homeless youth, and human rights movements, we urge Congress to pass this critical piece of legislation.

Hon. Chuck Grassley, Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC. Hon. Patrick J. Leahy, Ranking Member, Committee on the Judiciary, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC. Chairman Grassley and Ranking Member Leahy: As organizations representing law enforcement leaders, officers, and state and local prosecutors from across the United States, we write to express our support for S. 178, the Justice for Victims of Trafficking Act of 2015 (JVTA). The JVTA would provide much needed services and support to domestic victims of trafficking. More importantly, this bill provides necessary tools for law enforcement, courts, and the anti-trafficking task forces throughout the country to effectively target the demand that fuels the sex trafficking market. The JVTA provides unprecedented resources to address the issue of domestic victims of trafficking, who are too often invisible and underserved, by creating grants for state and local governments to develop comprehensive systems to address these crimes and provide services for victims. In addition, the legislation allows wire-taps obtained through state courts to be used for child sex trafficking, trains federal prosecutors and judges on the importance of requesting and ordering restitution, and trains law enforcement on facilitating physical and mental health services for trafficking victims they encounter. According to the National Center for Missing & Exploited Children (NCMEC), at least 100,000 American children each year are the victims of commercial child prostitution and child trafficking. Women and children, especially girls, are also advertised online where buyers purchase them with ease, anonymity, and impunity. This happens in every city, in every state. The elimination of sex trafficking is fundamentally linked to targeting the demand for commercial sex. Without buyers of commercial sex, sex trafficking would not exist. It is for this reason and others stated above that we, as representatives of law enforcement and the courts, support this bill. The Justice for Victims of Trafficking Act of 2015 addresses a critical need by providing the necessary tools and support services for domestic victims of trafficking in the U.S. We urge Congress to pass this critical piece of legislation. Sincerely, National District Attorneys Association, Association of State Criminal Investigative Agencies, National Association of Police Organizations, Federal Law Enforcement Officers Association, National Fusion Center Association, National Black Prosecutors Association. National Troopers Coalition, Major Cities Chiefs Association, Major County Sheriffs' Association, National Sheriffs' Association, Association of Prosecuting Attorneys. Mr. GRASSLEY. I also take this opportunity to thank the organizations Rights4Girls, Shared Hope International, the Polaris Project, and the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, among many other supporters of the bill, for their effort in assisting in our refinement of this legislation so it could move forward in this manner. I yield the floor. Mr. LEAHY. If the Senator will yield for a question, there is so much of this bill I strongly support. In fact, a lot of it reflects legislation I have written and actually passed through the committee before. I have a couple of concerns, but one that comes to mind is that we don't want to hold out false promises to victims, and I know the Senator doesn't want to either. I certainly support having any money that the traffickers are fined go to supporting this, but my experience earlier as a prosecutor and my experience now in talking to prosecutors around the country is that most of these people, when they get prosecuted, are basically judgment- proof--they don't have any money or they have a very small amount of money. They will go to prison. Who pays for that? Of course taxpayers pay for the prison, whether it is Federal or State. They will pay for the prisons, but there is no money for the victims. What happens if the fine money does not materialize? We have talked about up to $30 million, I think, in fines, but let's suppose we only come up with a few thousand dollars in fines. Are we making a promise to these victims that can't be met? Is there an alternative for them in case the fines don't pay for it? Mr. GRASSLEY. I guess, based upon the experience of the supporters of the legislation and the expert advice they got in coming to the conclusion of how to fund this fund, they feel the money is going to be available to do that. You ask a legitimate question. I suppose I ought to have an answer for it, and I don't have from this standpoint. I think that I have great faith in the figures they have presented us and that we will have to deal with the issue you bring up at some future time because I think we will want everybody to be made whole if what you say happens. Mr. LEAHY. The reason I ask, Mr. President, is because I know in the House of Representatives they have been concerned that the money might not be there. I think we all want to accomplish these things for the victims. I just want to make sure we are not holding out a promise that we can't complete. Do I agree with all the fines going into this fund? Absolutely. But the experience of a lot of prosecutors I have talked with is that the court may say: I fine you $20,000 or $30,000, but this is never paid. They go to prison. They have no assets. We are spending $25,000 to $35,000 a year as taxpayers keeping them in prison, and I want them to be in prison, but there is no money for victims. Mr. GRASSLEY. I can say to the Senator that he raises a legitimate point because I know in other areas we have set up such funds and sometimes they come up short. But we have to remember that sometimes something is not paid out because a lot of times excess money is used for something else in the Federal budget and not paid out entirely the way it was intended originally. But I would urge my colleague to take the word of the people who have done the research on this legislation to bring it together and the consensus it has from 200 or more organizations and feel that it will be successful. If it isn't, then I pledge to help you deal with that at that particular time. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont. Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, the issues raised in this are serious matters, and the Senator from Iowa, Senator Klobuchar, Senator Cornyn, and others should be concerned about this. I think of a victim I have talked with, Holly Austin Smith. She was 14 years old when she ran away from home and quickly became a victim of human trafficking. She met a man in a shopping mall who told her she was pretty, and promised he would give her a glamorous life in California. Remember, she was 14 years old. Then he sold her for sex. The first man she was sold to commented that she reminded him of his own granddaughter--but then he paid $200 to rape her. Thankfully, Holly escaped and has rebuilt her life. She is now a fierce advocate of ending all forms of human trafficking because she knows what happens to those who are trafficked. But many are not so lucky. The physical and psychological scars of being bought and sold, of being raped multiple times a night by different men, are devastating. This terrible crime destroys lives. As we consider legislation to combat human trafficking, we must remember Holly and the thousands of other vulnerable and victimized children she represents, and we must do everything we can to keep it from happening in the first place. Last Congress, in 2013, I led the effort to reauthorize the Trafficking Victims Protection Act. That historic bipartisan legislation and the funds it authorized signaled our country's commitment to ending all forms of human trafficking, both here at home and around the world. So I am glad, after the attention we gave to my bill last Congress, to see the Senate return its attention to this issue. Stories such as Holly's make clear we have more work to do. I support the bill we take up today, the Justice for Victims of Trafficking Act, but I believe we must do more to prevent trafficking in the first place. We have to act to protect our young people before they become victims. It is one thing to say now that you have become a victim, we are here to help you. It does even more if we can stop them from being victims in the first place. The legislation that Senator Collins of Maine and I have introduced seeks to do just that. Homeless and runaway kids are exceptionally vulnerable to human traffickers. A recent survey [[Page S1359]] found that one in four homeless teens was a victim of sex trafficking or had been forced to provide sex for survival needs. These vulnerable children, alone and on the street, are walking prey. Human traffickers lurk around bus stops and parks where homeless children congregate. They offer promises of something to eat and a night off the streets. They exploit the very sad reality that most of these children have no place to go. The weather may be cold. Far too many of our cities have no shelter for kids, and those who do face a chronic shortage of beds. Then somebody comes up and says: I will offer you food, I will offer you a warm place to sleep for the night. As Representative Poe recently said at an event on ending human trafficking: We have more animal shelters in this country than places for young people to find a safe place to sleep. What does that say about our priorities? I have nothing against having the animal shelters, but shouldn't we have more for our children than we do for the animals? If we are serious about preventing human trafficking, we must protect these kids. We have to provide better outreach to them, more beds for them to sleep in, and more counseling to get them on the path to a stable life. This kind of prevention costs money, but it saves lives and prevents the far more costly effects of human trafficking--not just the effects of human trafficking on the victims' part, but the cost to all of us. This is smart money we ought to be proud to invest in our children. We must include the Runaway and Homeless Youth and Trafficking Prevention Act in our efforts here to prevent more of our kids from becoming victims. I look forward, at the appropriate place, to offering our bipartisan legislation as an amendment. I know other Senators have amendments they wish to see considered. Senator Corker, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, has an important piece of legislation to combat sex and labor trafficking in countries around the world. I thank him for working with me to make some improvements to its funding provisions and I hope this bipartisan legislation will be considered as an amendment by the full Senate. I mentioned earlier Senator Klobuchar has been working for years to see the safe harbor bill get passed, to make sure victims are treated as victims and not as criminals. I am proud to cosponsor her bill. After all, as I said about the Violence Against Women Act, a victim is a victim is a victim. They are not criminals. They are victims. Senator McConnell has long promised a full amendment process. I take him at his word and I expect we will have the opportunity to strengthen the underlying bill with a variety of ideas from Senators. We owe it to survivors such as Holly to pass the strongest possible bill. We have to provide the resources desperately needed by those on the front lines protecting young people every day, such as those in my home State of Vermont at Spectrum Services and the Vermont Coalition of Runaway and Homeless Youth Programs service providers. We owe it to all the survivors who bravely come forward and tell their stories, hoping to prevent just one more child from falling prey to this terrible crime. The Senate has to pass a strong, comprehensive bill that includes prevention and prosecution, but also services for victims. We haven't accomplished as much as we should if we are only able to prosecute the perpetrator after the fact and forget about helping the victim. We have to stop trafficking from happening in the first place; but if it does happen, we have to help the victims. An editorial in the New York Times last week noted that: . . . a consensus is emerging on new initiatives to confront this human-rights problem and help its victims, often runaways or homeless youngsters who have been forced or coerced into prostitution. I agree with that editorial, and I look forward to working with every Senator here to ensure we get this done for the American people. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the New York Times editorial be printed in the Record. There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows: [From the New York Times, March 5, 2015] Steps Against Juvenile Sex Trafficking (By the Editorial Board) The impression that America's sex-trafficking problem mostly involves young people smuggled from overseas has given way to broad recognition of a cruel homegrown reality: the tens of thousands of juveniles who are exploited each year by traffickers in this country. On Capitol Hill, a consensus is emerging on new initiatives to confront this human-rights problem and help its victims, often runaways or homeless youngsters who have been forced or coerced into prostitution. The Senate Judiciary Committee last week unanimously approved a pair of anti-trafficking bills with wide backing from victim advocates and other experts, and the full Senate is expected to take up the package soon. A bill championed by Senator John Cornyn, Republican of Texas, would create a new pool of financing--through additional fines on people convicted of sex and labor trafficking, child pornography and other crimes--for restitution, victim services and law enforcement. The idea of aiding victims without committing more tax dollars has drawn support from Republicans, and any new money for this badly underfinanced cause would help. The Cornyn bill would also encourage prosecution of the ``johns,'' or buyers of juvenile sex, who typically escape criminal charges even though they are paying for what amounts to the statutory rape of children and teenagers. Their demand is what's fueling the highly lucrative human slavery business. The second bill, put forward by Senator Amy Klobuchar, Democrat of Minnesota, would give a preference for Department of Justice law enforcement grants to states that adopt ``safe harbor'' laws. These laws help ensure that young people sold for sex are treated as victims and offered support services instead of being prosecuted. The House has approved similar bills, so it should not be hard to hammer out a strong final package. A preventive measure that would help ensure housing and services for homeless juveniles, who are often prey to traffickers, unfortunately stalled in the Senate Judiciary Committee. One obstacle was the resistance of some Republicans to its nondiscrimination provision guaranteeing fair treatment of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender youths. No young person should ``have to choose between selling their bodies and a safe place to sleep,'' said Senator Susan Collins, Republican of Maine, who introduced the bill with Patrick Leahy, Democrat of Vermont. Undeterred, they plan to seek consideration from the full Senate. Trafficking abroad remains a tremendous problem, so it is fitting that a promising approach comes from the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, which last week unanimously approved a measure to create an international public-private fund dedicated to the issue, similar to the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria. More resources could do a lot to help trafficking's victims at home, too. Mr. LEAHY. We talk about the Runaway and Homeless Youth Trafficking and Prevention Act. This is a partial list of the local, State, and national groups which have urged its passage. There are too many to read--this has to be in small type; otherwise, we would have a dozen posters if we put it in larger type.

Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I see the distinguished senior Senator from Texas on the floor seeking recognition. I wonder if we could suggest the absence of a quorum for just 1 minute. Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I know the Senator from West Virginia will be giving her first speech in the Senate here shortly and I look forward to listening to that, but I wanted to say a few words about the legislation we will be debating and hopefully passing this week, and that is the Justice for Victims of Trafficking Act. This is without a doubt one of the most shocking and troubling issues facing our country today. It is no exaggeration to say modern-day human slavery, at a time when we believed as a country that slavery was a part of [[Page S1361]] our past and something we only read about in our history books. Many people are under the impression that human trafficking is a problem somewhere else or at some other time in history, but the fact is human trafficking is a problem right now in all 50 States, right here in the United States of America, the most affluent country in the world. It is not just a problem in Texas, it is not just a problem in Arizona, it is not just a problem in West Virginia, it is a problem in all 50 States. Thousands of young girls, many of them middle school age, are trapped into a life of bondage where they are abused and sold for sex every day. It is not easy to say, but it is true, and we must say it and we must acknowledge it. This is of course unconscionable. As the father of two daughters myself, it is simply heartbreaking to hear the stories of young women who have been trapped in this system. Of course, we can imagine it is every parent's worst nightmare. One woman I have had the privilege of meeting and who shared her very personal story about this is Melissa Woodward from the Dallas-Fort Worth area in Texas. When she was 12 years old--12 years old--she was sold into the sex trade by a family member, somebody whom she had every right to assume cared for her, loved her, wanted her to grow up being a loved and productive person. But she was sold into the sex trade by a family member. Eventually she was pulled out of school and trafficked full time when she was in sixth grade. Her life became a prison. She was chained to a bed in a warehouse. She endured regular beatings and, of course, she was sexually assaulted with regularity. She was even set on fire by one of her captors. All the while, she was forced to serve between 5 and 30 men every day. Melissa has said that she wished she were dead. Her story of her time in captivity is gut-wrenching and heartbreaking, but just as sad is the way she was treated once she escaped from her captors. As is the case with so many victims, Melissa struggled for years to distance herself from her past. But instead of being treated as the victim she was, the criminal justice system actually treated her as the criminal. That is an all too common outcome for victims of trafficking, who are labeled as prostitutes and are left with few options but to return to the nightmare that so sadly exists in our country. That needs to change. That is why I am glad the Senate is taking up the Justice for Victims of Trafficking Act, because this begins the process of making that important change. The bill helps law enforcement crack down on criminal trafficking rings and perpetrators of these crimes. Instead of a slap on the wrist and a fine, the so-called johns--the demand side for this terrible trade--will be treated as the child rapists and the criminals they are. No longer are we just going to deal with the supply side. We are going to pay attention to the demand side too. Critically, this bill takes fines from the perpetrators of these awful crimes and redirects them into a crime victims fund which will help people such as Melissa and others get a fresh lease on life, to begin to heal and to get the help they so badly need in order to get on with their lives. This week we have a wonderful opportunity in the Senate, in a town that is too often divided by ideology and partisanship, to do something together on a bipartisan basis that can help people such as Melissa and the thousands of young girls like her waiting to be saved. All of us, Republicans and Democrats alike, are committed to working together to do everything we can to help these victims and to put an end to this abhorrent practice. This particular legislation we are taking up today passed unanimously out of the Judiciary Committee a few weeks ago. That doesn't happen very often, but it did for this legislation. More than 200 groups around the country--such as the NAACP, the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, Rights4Girls, the Fraternal Order of Police, and the National Conference of State Legislatures--have all endorsed our work on this issue. I want to particularly thank some of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle who joined me on this effort: the senior Senator from Minnesota, Ms. Klobuchar, and the senior Senator from Oregon, Mr. Wyden. They have been great partners in this fight--not just this year but for many years. And there are many others. Another great partner has been the junior Senator from Illinois, Mr. Kirk, who has worked for years to get antitrafficking legislation to the floor. He introduced a bill called the HERO Act which authorizes a program to recruit wounded, injured, and returning veterans and provides them with training in high-tech computer forensics and law enforcement skills to help fight child exploitation. I also want to acknowledge the great contribution of the junior Senator from Ohio, Mr. Portman, who has a bill called the Bringing Missing Children Home Act, which improves the way cases of missing children are handled, strengthening law enforcement reporting and response procedures. Both the HERO Act and the Bringing Missing Children Home Act have been incorporated into the underlying bill, and I want to thank both of them for their efforts and willingness to work with us to make the Justice for Victims of Trafficking Act even stronger. I know there are Members who are interested in offering amendments to this legislation. Thanks to the majority leader, we are going to have an open process where anybody with a better idea who wants to add to this base of work that is contained in this bill will have the opportunity to do so, both offering amendments and seeking votes on those. This is a fight that sadly must be fought, but it is a fight we will win. When we do, we will finally have done our part to help deliver our Nation's promise of freedom to those who are enslaved. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia. making washington work for west virginia Mrs. CAPITO. Mr. President, I rise today to deliver my maiden speech as a Senator from West Virginia. I am deeply humbled by the confidence placed in me by fellow West Virginians. To serve as West Virginia's first female Senator is a true honor and one that comes with great responsibility. I hope to serve as an example for that next generation of West Virginians, including my own grandchildren Celia and Charlie, and hopefully for many others. I find myself in a unique place in history, and I am grateful to and inspired by my own loving family, my husband Charlie and our three children, Charles, Moore, and Shelley, and their spouses. For 14 years I have proudly served the people of West Virginia's Second Congressional District in the House of Representatives. I bring that experience to the Senate combined with a strong desire to make Washington work for West Virginia. West Virginia has a time-honored history of exceptional Senators, including my predecessors, Senators Jay Rockefeller and Robert C. Byrd. I am appreciative of their efforts to better West Virginia during their more than 80 years of combined public service in this great body. I am proud of our State's rich history, culture, and natural beauty. But it is our people that I hold dearest in my heart. West Virginians are strong and resilient. We are the embodiment of our State's history. Born of the Civil War, West Virginians fought for freedom in the face of great turmoil. As a result, President Abraham Lincoln signed the proclamation making West Virginia the 35th State admitted to the Union. Today, our State's forceful motto, ``Mountaineers are always free,'' remains emblazoned in Latin on our State flag. We will never forget the principles on which our great State was founded. The Mountain State is home to unmatched scenery and natural resources that can power our Nation's economy. A State filled with small towns, Main Streets and tight knit communities, West Virginians come together to solve problems and help neighbors in need. I have often said that West Virginia is one big small town. West Virginians expect the Senate to find pragmatic solutions to the momentous problems confronting our [[Page S1362]] country. That is particularly true now during this period of divided government. There are clear differences among the American people, and these differences are certainly reflected in the Senate. West Virginia is represented by both parties in the Senate, and I look forward to continuing to work with my friend Senator Joe Manchin in the months ahead, and I thank him for being here with me as a source of support today. Together, I hope we can reinstate respect for the institution, a place where deliberation and debate are valued and all voices are heard. We owe it to the American people to do better. Throughout my time in Congress I have heard a clear and consistent message from West Virginians: Improve the economic opportunities for our State, stop the bickering, and fight for our jobs. As Leader McConnell has stated, to do this the Senate must work more, have an open amendment process--which we are going to be having here in the next several days--and take the tough votes. After all, that is why we are here. Today I will outline how I plan to produce bipartisan, commonsense solutions in the Senate to make West Virginia communities stronger. This plan will create economic opportunities by bridging the gap and tackling America's infrastructure crisis, better connecting West Virginia and rural communities through increased broadband access, caring for our Nation's veterans, and ensuring a bright future for young West Virginians, and implementing a commonsense energy policy that utilizes our vast natural resources to provide affordable and reliable energy. First, addressing our country's crumbling infrastructure is an area that can bridge the partisan divide and further economic growth. American communities need a strong Federal highway program and a full 6-year bill to meet the needs of our growing population, to ensure safety for travelers, and to offer opportunity for growth in areas that struggle economically. West Virginians, like many across the Nation, rely heavily on roads, bridges, and highway transit to fuel our economy, to access hard to reach areas in our State, to get to and from work, and to transport necessary goods and services. U.S. Route 35 will drastically improve safety for residents in Putnam and Mason Counties. Corridor H will unleash the economic potential of our State's eastern highlands. U.S. Route 340 will help address congestion in our eastern panhandle, and the Coalfields Expressway and the King Coal Highway can help isolated communities attract businesses and provide jobs. Point Pleasant's Charles Lanham, a well-respected gentleman, had a vision. With his friend Jack Fruth, they began a crusade for their community. For many years Charles has worked to build the case for a 4-lane U.S. Route 35, a project that will provide a secure route to school for our children and serve as a regional transportation artery between Interstate 64 and the Great Lakes region. Charles understands the economic and safety benefits the road provides and has fought for them. Working with Charles we have made significant progress on Route 35, but all of our States need certainty to invest in our transportation infrastructure. That certainty comes with a long-term surface transportation reauthorization bill, which brings these projects to reality across the country. Working together we can and we must achieve this goal. Now is the time to move our transportation system forward. Second, I am committed to expanding access to broadband in communities across West Virginia, and I will be a champion for connecting our State. High-speed Internet access is a pillar of our 21st century infrastructure and a gateway to growth in rural America. High-tech businesses can power our small communities. The world literally can be at your desktop. Unfortunately, for all the potential opportunities that broadband can offer to rural America, not having this important service can place an almost insurmountable barrier to economic development, and there are many areas in my State and the leader's State that still do not have adequate access. These areas are at risk of being left behind. In Capon Bridge, WV, a lack of broadband access is an obstacle to attracting jobs and economic development. Sadly, Capon Bridge is not unique in this regard. Small communities across West Virginia and elsewhere in rural America lack fundamental infrastructure and lack access to vital opportunities as a result. The answer for Capon Bridge is not a regulated Internet. Too much government control would be counterproductive, choking off private sector expansion projects and hindering new technologies. But we have to recognize that there is a role for government in helping broadband reach those hard-to-serve communities. We should leverage resources at all levels of government and encourage public-private partnerships to expand access to rural Americans. This is a necessary and achievable goal. It may sound like a small desire, but connectivity is essential to compete and thrive. Health care access is critically important to West Virginians. We must continue to provide access to our veterans and to our children. West Virginians have a strong history of service to our Nation. These brave men and women have put themselves in harm's way to defend our freedoms. It is our solemn responsibility to care for them when they return home. These American heroes deserve the best possible treatment and top- notch mental health services. Access to care can be especially challenging for our veterans who live in rural communities. Many West Virginia veterans must travel significant distances to get to a VA hospital. In many cases, allowing veterans to receive treatment closer to home is more convenient for the patient and more efficient for the VA. While we have made strides to improve access for our veterans, the current program is not working as well as it should. More must be done. Expanded access to private medical providers will help improve the quality of care we offer to our veterans. Our children in the Mountain State also deserve quality health care. If our children, the next generation of leaders, are going to realize their potential, they must have a healthy foundation. A solid education and good health are pillars for success of future generations. As a parent and grandparent, this is personal. We must work together to continue funding the State Children's Health Insurance Program. I started my legislative career in the West Virginia House of Delegates where I served on the committee that first implemented the SCHIP program in our State. Today this program provides access to health care for tens of thousands of West Virginia's children. Maintaining this program is a priority I share with my predecessor, Senator Rockefeller, who was a tireless advocate for children's health insurance during his three decades of service in this body. I am encouraged that Senators in both parties have recognized the importance of providing continued funding for the bipartisan SCHIP program. Finally, and of critical importance to the State of West Virginia and the country, we need to work together to implement a commonsense energy policy. We need an affordable and reliable energy policy that utilizes our State's vast natural resources. We need a policy that grows the economy and creates new job opportunities. We need a policy that supports a strong middle class. We need a policy that ensures we continue to improve safety and our environment even as we expand energy production. The administration's overreach has contributed to thousands of coal miners losing their jobs in West Virginia and our neighboring States, devastating--I can't overstate this enough--local communities and families. Last year I met a recently laid off coal miner from Raleigh County. After losing his job, his church came together to prepare meals for other coal miners and their families while they searched for work. Neighbors helping neighbors--the West Virginia way. This is a stark reminder of the impact misguided Federal policies can have on the lives of real people. Anti-coal policies impact more than miners and their families. In West Virginia the attack on coal mines reduces [[Page S1363]] revenues for education programs, roads, and other public services. Higher utility prices caused by overregulation means fewer jobs in energy-intensive manufacturing. And sadly, lower income families and senior citizens who live on fixed incomes are disproportionately impacted by higher energy costs. As chairman of the Subcommittee on Clean Air and Nuclear Safety, I will lead the fight against excessive government regulation that has been devastating my State. There are many areas of energy policy where we can find common ground. While the EPA's proposed greenhouse gas standards are misguided, we should continue to make the use of fossil fuel cleaner and more efficient. We must continue to support important research at Morgantown's National Energy Technology Lab and other labs that allows us to make environmental progress even as we continue to use our natural resources. Natural gas is a large and growing part of West Virginia's economy. As a child of Marshall County, which is the heart of the Marcellus Shale development in West Virginia, I am delighted to see these communities come alive with opportunity. It is proof positive that an energy economy is a jobs economy. We need improved infrastructure in order to make full use of these gas reserves. We need new natural gas and oil pipelines that safely connect producing regions with manufacturers. We need new markets that can make use of these vital resources. We need a pro-exports policy that will benefit our country in multiple ways. The Nation will see more jobs and investment, more security, and a more independent future, and at the same time we can strengthen our relationships with important allies overseas by providing them with the energy they need. These are just a few of the ideas I hope to refine and accomplish during my first term in the Senate. Notably, there are many other very important issues--such as national security, fiscal responsibility, a balanced budget, and replacement of the Affordable Care Act--on which I will be focusing. Our plate is full, and expectations are high, as they should be. We need to roll up our sleeves and deliver. I am optimistic that we can find solutions that move our country forward. There will be differences of opinion and philosophy along the way, but Americans expect us to bridge those gaps. Senator Byrd, the longest serving Senator, said it best: I love this Senate. I love it dearly. I love the Senate for its rules. I love the Senate for its precedence. I love the Senate for the difference that it can make in people's lives. Fighting for West Virginians always has been and always will be my top priority. I am honored--I can't overstate that--to represent the great people of the Mountain State as we strive to create a strong and prosperous future. Now is the time for Washington to work for West Virginia, and I stand ready to do my part. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader. Congratulating The Senator From West Virginia Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I wish to say to our new Senator from West Virginia what an outstanding speech not only for her State but the way forward for our country, and I congratulate her for an outstanding set of comments. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The senior Senator from West Virginia. Mr. MANCHIN. Mr. President, I also wish to congratulate my colleague from West Virginia. We spoke earlier about how she and I can show the way to have a better relationship-building effort here in the Senate by working together in order to better serve the people of West Virginia and also the country. I congratulate my colleague on her great speech and look forward to working with her. I think she has done a great job for the people of West Virginia, and I again thank the Senator. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia. Tackling National Security Questions Mr. KAINE. Mr. President, I rise to address a question to myself and every Member of this body, and the question is a serious one: Is the Senate capable of tackling challenging national security questions in a mature and responsible way? We have many hard national security challenges before us now. Three of those challenges are urgent: the discussions about a potential nuclear deal with Iran, the discussions in this body about military action by the United States against ISIL, and the deliberations that will take place this month about the American budget, which will determine whether we have the resources we need to meet our security challenges. We have to show the American public--and I would argue the world--that we can give these issues the careful consideration they deserve, but I am forced to admit that recent events have caused me to have some significant doubts about our institutional capacity to tackle these issues in a responsible way. We recently--at the end of February--ran up to the very brink of shutting down the Department of Homeland Security at a time when terrorist threats and other threats to our homeland security are so obvious on our borders and throughout the world. Thank goodness, after a week's extension of funding for Homeland Security, we pulled back from the brink. But that did not lead to an increase in confidence in this body, that Congress would contemplate not funding the Department of Homeland Security. Last week there was a joint address to Congress by Prime Minister Netanyahu. I spent many hours conversing with Prime Minister Netanyahu in his office about Iran and other topics, but I am sad to look at that joint address and basically say it was history-making in some unfortunate ways. Congress has heard from the Prime Minister or President of Israel seven times in the last 50 years--eight times if you count last week. Last week's address was unusual because it was designed in a partisan way. It was an invitation by the leadership of one party with an intentional decision not to let the White House know, not to let the minority party in Congress know, and to schedule the speech days before a contested foreign election, leading many to conclude that it was an effort by Congress to affect a foreign election, which we should never do. Following that speech, a carefully worked bipartisan bill that has been introduced in Congress to give Congress an appropriate review role over any potential Iranian nuclear deal was basically hijacked. Instead of allowing the bill to go through Congress, there was a decision to force the bill to the floor for an immediate vote, which was seen by all as a partisan move. It was described by one of the Republican sponsors of the bill as an effort to embarrass Democrats. Thank goodness that at the end of the day that effort to accelerate consideration of what was a bipartisan bill was pulled back, and we will not be doing that this week. We will be allowing a normal committee process. But the fact that the effort was made did damage to reasonable bipartisan consideration of this important issue. Then yesterday we all awoke to the news that there had been a partisan letter signed by 47 Senators--47 of my colleagues, many of whom I work with very closely--not to the President saying ``We have concerns about a deal, and we are going to weigh in'' but instead to the leader of a nation that we characterize as a terrorist state. This letter presumed to instruct the nation about what Congress might or might not do. The letter was widely viewed as an effort to undercut or dilute diplomatic negotiations that are in the best tradition of our country, the notion of diplomacy. I just came from hearings this morning in the Armed Services Committee where we heard what we have heard for 2\1/2\ years: advice from our military leadership to the Senate that sequester is hurting our national defense. Will you finally listen to us? Will you do something about it? All of these events over the last few weeks when taken together suggest the sad possibility of a Senate that will elevate partisan political division over careful and constructive deliberation, even on the most critical security issues that affect the security of our country and the world. I deeply believe that this body--the Senate and Congress generally--has to pull back from the brink of irresponsible and partisan action with respect to these critical security questions because the stakes are simply too high. [[Page S1364]] With respect to the Iranian nuclear negotiation, I share many of the concerns of my 47 colleagues who wrote the letter. I share many of the concerns of the Prime Minister that were shared in his speech last week. But I deeply believe we should not try to tank a deal, critique a deal, or undercut a deal before there is a deal because to the extent there are efforts to stand and say this is a bad deal before there is a deal, the message that is communicated to the American public and to the world is: We will never accept any deal. We are not interested in diplomacy. We are not interested in negotiation. That attitude plays directly into the hands of the nation of Iran, which is currently engaging in terrorist activity. They want to be able to blame the absence of any deal on an intransigent United States that is unwilling to negotiate in good faith. We should not tank a deal before there is a deal. Instead, why don't we do what we are supposed to do as the greatest deliberative body in the world? Why don't we allow negotiators who have been working in the best traditions of American diplomacy to see if they can find a deal and then put it on the table for the review of Congress, as has always been contemplated? I am a proud original cosponsor and worked on the draftsmanship of a bipartisan bill that was introduced under the key sponsorship of Foreign Relations chair Senator Corker and ranking member Senator Menendez to guarantee to Congress an appropriate review of any final deal with Iran over their nuclear program if such a deal was reached. This is a bill which is rigorously bipartisan--not partisan, not political, not rushed, not accelerated, but rigorously bipartisan. It respects the ongoing process by allowing the negotiators to do their work and see if they can find an outcome. It guarantees Congress a debate and vote if a deal includes relief under the congressional sanctions Congress has enacted over the years. It is appropriately deferential to the Executive, allowing the Executive the flexibility to do sanctions relief under Executive or international sanctions that have not been part of any congressional statute. This is a bipartisan bill which provides some assurance to allies. Our allies in the region--allies that are most affected by the Iranian nuclear ambitions are not part of the P5+1, whether you are talking about Israel or Gulf State nations or Jordan. The nations most affected by Iranian nuclear ambitions are not part of the P5+1, and the Corker- Menendez bill would give them some comfort that a deal, if announced, would receive some careful scrutiny in this body. Finally, I believe the Corker-Menendez bipartisan approach even provides some important assurances to Iran in the negotiation. We want Iran to make not small concessions, we want them to make big and bold concessions and give up any intent to develop nuclear weapons. But what is the likelihood that Iran will make those concessions if they have no knowledge about what Congress's intent is vis-a-vis the congressional statutory provisions? There is a right way and a wrong way to approach these matters. To rush it, to label a deal as a bad deal before there is a deal, to make it entirely partisan rather than bipartisan, reflecting the will of the body, is an effort to undercut negotiations that weakens our President, weakens our country, and weakens our credibility; whereas if we proceed in a bipartisan way, we can make the deal stronger. Similarly--and then I wish to cede the moment to my colleague, the Senator from Maine--we are about to start work on another critically important issue--whether Congress should finally, after 7-plus months, have a debate to authorize an ongoing war against the Islamic State in the Levant that was begun on August 8 by the President. We are now in the eighth month of a unilateral war, and aside from a Foreign Relations Committee vote in committee in December, Congress has not had a meaningful vote or debate on this fundamental responsibility. We owe it to ourselves and to this institution, we owe it to the important national security interests at stake, and especially we owe it to the people who are risking their lives in this war--and we have already had deaths of American servicemembers as part of Operation Inherent Resolve--we owe it to them to show we can have a meaningful debate that is not partisan, that is not rushed, but that is careful and deliberate. They have been waiting for 7-plus months to see whether Congress even cares. We are at war by a Presidential act. Does Congress even care enough to have the debate on the floor of the Senate and in the House of Representatives? Is it just partisanship now? Is it just delay now? Does the fact our service men and women are risking their lives even matter to us now? This is the debate we will be entering into within the next few days, starting with the hearing in the Senate Foreign Relations Committee tomorrow. We can't afford, on important issues of national security such as Iran or such as the war against ISIL, to send the impression to our troops, to our citizens, to our global citizens around the world, that on these important matters Congress is now just a partisan sort of sideshow rather than the deliberative body we were set up to be. We have to find a bipartisan path forward on these important security issues or we weaken confidence in this institution and in the leadership of this country. In conclusion, the national security interests that are at stake right now before us are fundamental, whether it is about Iran, whether it is about the battle against ISIL, or whether it is about the budgetary deliberations we will be undertaking this month--a budgetary deliberation that will determine whether we can meet our commitments in these national security challenges. We have to get these debates right for the good of our country and the world, and we have to get them right to demonstrate to all that this institution does have the maturity to tackle these issues in a reasonable way. With that, I yield the last minute or so of my time to my colleague from Maine, Senator King. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cruz). The Senator from Maine. Mr. KING. Mr. President, there is little I can add to the remarks of the Senator from Virginia on this issue. I think this institution is being tested this week, this month, and over the next several months in a way that is really somewhat new. The test, the question, is: Can we deal with the most serious of issues facing this country and the world in a responsible, reasonable, and, yes, bipartisan, nonpartisan way? I also worked with Bob Corker, Senator Kaine, and the whole group that worked on putting together--Senator Menendez--a bipartisan bill to provide Congress a role in the approval of whatever deal is struck with Iran. I believe Congress should have that role. But in those discussions, my concern was that some of our Members will not be able to resist the temptation to politicize and make a partisan issue--even this grave issue of war and peace, this grave issue that faces this country and the entire world--of the possibility of a regime such as that in Iran achieving nuclear weapons. This is not an ideological debate. This is a serious debate about the future of this country. This is one of the most serious negotiations of our adult lives. I want Congress to have a role, but I want it to play that role weighing the merits, pro or con, the actual materials that are in the treaty--in the agreement. I want us to have that role, but I want to be sure we can respond to that in a responsible way. Frankly, the actions of the last few days have shaken that confidence, because we have seen what appears to be an effort to gain political and partisan advantage from this gravest of national issues. I understand there are differences about what the deal should look like and what the terms should be. That is OK. That is what we should be discussing. But to turn this into a partisan issue I think does a grave disservice to this entire country, and to undercut the President in the last stages of the negotiation to me is unprecedented and unthinkable. I was a young man at the time of the Cuban missile crisis. I cannot imagine the Congress of the United States writing a letter to Kruschev in the midst of those discussions and saying, Don't worry about this guy Kennedy, he doesn't speak for the country. Yet that essentially is what took place yesterday. I don't understand the need or the [[Page S1365]] helpfulness of such a statement at a time when we were already moving toward a bipartisan--I believe probably veto-proof--bill to provide this institution with a check on the quality of the deal that is being struck. It is not productive or helpful to turn issues of this kind into partisan issues. I hope we can step back from this partisan posture and meet this solemn responsibility to assess what the President and the administration and the other five countries--the agreement they come to with Iran--to determine whether, indeed, it is in the best interests of the region and the world. That is our responsibility. I hope we can muster the ability to meet that responsibility in a serious way and not, for once, turn it into a partisan issue. Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland. Tribute to Federal Employees Dr. Francis Collins, Dr. Nancy Sullivan, And Dr. William Gahl Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I wish to take a few moments today to speak about Federal workers in general and some of the people at the National Institutes of Health in particular. Government workers guard our borders, protect us from terrorists, treat our wounded veterans, dispense Social Security checks to our retirees, find cures for diseases, guide the Nation's air traffic, explore the tiniest particles and the vast expanse of outer space, ensure our air is safe to breathe, our water is safe to drink, our food is safe to eat, support our service men and women in harm's way, and promote our interests and ideals abroad. For whom does the government work? Government works for America. The Washington Post recently reported that since reliable data first became available shortly before World War II, the percentage of all employed people working for the Federal Government hit an all-time low in December. Fewer than 2 percent of the total U.S. workforce is employed by the Federal Government. Over nearly the past half century, from 1966 to 2012--the most recent year for which comparable data is available--the number of Federal workers in the executive branch dropped by 83,000. During that time, the U.S. population increased from under 200 million to over 300 million people and the gross domestic product nearly quadrupled. We can argue over whether we want bigger government or smaller government, but we should all agree we want better government. We can't have better government when Federal workers are constantly under assault. We need to stop treating the Federal workforce like a rented mule. We need to treat the Federal workforce like the critical asset it is. A 2011 report by the National Academy of Public Administration and the Kettering Foundation concluded that programs operated by civil servants receive ``significantly higher'' scores for management and effectiveness than those run by ``grant- and contract-based third parties.'' I think part of the problem is that Americans have come to accept that Federal workers are nameless, faceless bureaucrats. They aren't. They are people who are patriotic Americans and dedicated to public service. They have families and support their communities. They have been asked to do more and more with less and less while being subjected to pay freezes, sequestration-related furloughs, government shutdowns, and threats to their benefits. They have contributed $150 billion to deficit reduction while still working hard on behalf of all Americans. Today, as I mentioned, I wish to focus on the Federal workers at the National Institutes of Health. I wish to introduce my colleagues and all Americans to a few of the Federal workers who are making life better for all of us. But first a description of the NIH so people can understand its mission. I can sum up its mission in two words: saving lives. The NIH is the world's premier biomedical and health-related research facility. Its job is to perform and fund the research that helps improve the Nation's health--a job it has carried out for over a century. I am proud the NIH is headquartered in Maryland, but it is important to understand that NIH support of medical research at other research institutions has created jobs and fostered economic growth in each and every State, while establishing and maintaining the United States as the global leader in the life sciences. NIH-supported research added $69 billion to our GDP and supported 7 million jobs in 2011 alone. In the weeks and months ahead, Congress and the administration will have to decide whether they have to replace sequestration with a more logical, coherent, strategic, and responsible form of budgeting. While we will have disagreements over the details, if anyone needs to be convinced about the value of replacing sequestration, look no further than the situation at NIH. Funding constraints there not only cost people their jobs, they are costing people their lives. NIH funding has multiple drivers, but comparing the fiscal year 2013 figures with the fiscal year 2012 figures, largely because of sequestration, approximately 640 fewer competitive research project grants were issued and approximately 750 fewer new patients were admitted to the NIH Clinical Center. Each these affects a person's life. Each of these has consequences when we do not move forward as we should. A recent survey determined that nearly 20 percent of the biomedical scientists have considered leaving the United States due to sequestration. We are losing our best. Nearly one-half of the scientists surveyed said they have laid off staff in their laboratories or are considering laying off staff due to losing NIH grants. More than 50 percent of the researchers say they have colleagues who have lost his or her job. What is the impact? Delays in lifesaving medical progress. Medical breakthroughs do not happen overnight. In almost all instances, breakthrough discoveries result from years of incremental research to understand how diseases start and progress. Cuts to research are delaying progress in medical breakthroughs, including developing better cancer drugs that zero in on a tumor with fewer side effects; research on a universal flu vaccine that could fight every strain of influenza without needing a yearly shot; preventing debilitating chronic conditions that are costly to society and delay development of more effective treatments for common and rare diseases affecting millions of Americans. NIH Director Dr. Francis Collins recently wrote the column ``Exceptional Opportunities in Medical Science'' in which he describes the excitement over ``personalized medicine,'' the BRAIN initiative, and development of the Ebola vaccine. He has also shared his concern about the budget challenges NIH faces. Let me quote from Dr. Collins: Although all of these ambitious scientific endeavors offer exceptional promise for advancing human health, the effect that unprecedented budget pressures are having on biomedical research cannot be ignored. Due to inflation, the NIH budget has lost almost 25 percent of its purchasing power over the last decade. The decline has had important consequences. The NIH once funded one in three research proposals, but now only has enough resources to support one in six. As a result, a great deal of excellent science is being left unfunded. Last October Dr. Collins stated that cuts in Federal funding slowed the development of vaccines and therapies for the deadly Ebola virus, saying: ``Frankly, if we had not gone through our 10-year slide in research support, we probably would have had a vaccine in time for this that would have gone through clinical trials and would have been ready.'' Think about the lives that could have been saved. To Americans who wonder what their tax dollars do--well, some go to NIH to find treatments and cures for cancer, depression, arthritis, substance abuse, addiction, diabetes, and Alzheimer's disease. To date, 145 NIH-supported researchers have received or shared 85 Nobel Prizes. Not everyone wins a Nobel Prize, so let me talk about people who aren't in the spotlight--people some of our colleagues might refer to as ``nameless, faceless bureaucrats.'' I will highlight the work of two of them today who are making a tremendous contribution as public servants. Dr. Nancy Sullivan, Chief of the Vaccine Research Center, has been working on an Ebola vaccine for nearly two decades, dating back to when she was an investigator at the University of Michigan with the then-NIH grantee [[Page S1366]] and now former Director, Dr. Gary Nabel. Most vaccines spur production of a person's immune system's antibodies that block a virus from entering the cells, but that approach doesn't work for Ebola. Gene-based vaccines can induce additional virus fighters called T- cells, so that is what Dr. Sullivan created, using pieces of Ebola genetic material. It is the most promising approach yet, and it is being tested in the parts of West Africa that have been hit the hardest with Ebola, where more than 9,000 people have died. The concept for Dr. Sullivan's vaccine has been 16 years in the making, beginning back when few people outside the global infectious disease community had even heard of the deadly disease. Over the years, Dr. Sullivan and her team continued to tweak her ideas, constantly improving on them. Eventually she followed Dr. Nabel to NIH. Many experts in the vaccine research community had begun to believe Ebola was insurmountable. They thought it was too aggressive for a vaccine to ever protect against it. But Dr. Sullivan never lost heart that her work would one day prove successful. The Ebola virus infection is a highly lethal disease for which there are no effective therapeutic or preventive treatments. Consequently, work with these viruses requires highly specialized BSL-4 containment labs--the highest biosafety labs. Dr. Sullivan is a leader in the field and has personally conducted many of the most critical experiments. Her work on immunology and vaccine development is widely considered as some of the very best in the field. In spite of the difficulties associated with access to BSL-4 labs, her work has consistently been the source of novel observations. Dr. Sullivan received her Ph.D. in cell biology from Harvard University in 1997. She received her master of science in environmental engineering in 1989, also from Harvard University. I brought a poster to the floor where we see President Obama visited NIH to personally congratulate Dr. Sullivan for her incredible work on behalf of world health. Some people may be familiar with the TV show ``House.'' The main character, Dr. Gregory House, is brilliant at diagnosing conditions and illnesses that baffle everyone else. The real-life Dr. House is Dr. William Gahl, the founding Director of the Undiagnosed Diseases Program at NIH. He is America's leading medical detective, a physician dedicated to finding answers for long-suffering patients with mysterious illnesses that long eluded diagnosis. Dr. Gahl has brought together a unique combination of elite medical specialists, researchers, and Federal resources to solve baffling illnesses and provide desperate patients and their families with information and possible solutions and treatments for their often life-threatening ailments. Results include diagnosis and treatment of diseases so rare they don't even have names, plus new genetic discoveries, improved disease management, and the advancement of medical knowledge. NIH Director Dr. Collins said the Undiagnosed Diseases Program, which Dr. Gahl conceived and started, serves as a kind of court of last resort for patients without a diagnosis. Dr. Gahl has convinced some of the best, brightest, and busiest physicians to participate, and has devoted tremendous energy to examining patient records, selecting cases for in- depth analysis, and helping people who are seriously ill. Under Dr. Gahl's stewardship, the program regularly involves a collective effort by more than 25 attending physicians of different specialties. The cooperation by a diverse group of experts has helped create a coherent view of each patient instead of the organ-by-organ orientation taken by most specialists. Patients are brought to the NIH campus in Bethesda for an intensive week. They meet with a parade of specialists who study their medical histories, perform thorough exams, and take numerous tests. The doctors then meet to discuss what they have seen, discovered, or may have missed. They also debate various theories, trying to connect the dots, and come up with a possible diagnosis and treatment. Scientists working with Dr. Gahl discovered the genetic cause of a vascular disorder not previously identified in the medical literature. The rare condition, identified in nine individuals, arises in adulthood and causes arterial calcification in the hands and feet, but does not affect arteries in the heart. The symptoms include acute pain after walking more than a short distance. The disorder previously baffled the medical field and evaded diagnosis when conventional methods were used. In another instance, physicians working with Dr. Gahl identified the reason why a woman's muscles had grown painfully large and hard underneath her skin, making it increasingly difficult for her to perform daily activities. This turned out to be an extremely rare, generally fatal complication of multiple myeloma, and the diagnosis by the NIH Undiagnosed Diseases Program resulted in a stem cell bone marrow transplant that allows her to lead a normal life. These are people who had no hope, no hope at all. They came to NIH, and they have gotten government-supported help to give them hope and to give them life. Dr. Gahl earned his B.S. in biology from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1972 and his M.D. from the University of Wisconsin in 1976. He obtained a Ph.D. degree in oncology research from Wisconsin's McArdle Laboratory for Cancer Research in 1981. He has published more than 350 peer-reviewed papers and trained 36 biochemical geneticists. Dr. Gahl has made a number of seminal discoveries regarding rare diseases during his career. He said deciding who to admit into the Undiagnosed Diseases Program is always very difficult and much like triage on the battlefield. You have to make decisions about where you think you can do some good. The Undiagnosed Diseases Program serves people who feel helpless, have suffered greatly, have waited many years for answers, and must be treated with respect and attention. According to Dr. Gahl, the NIH caregivers understand the desperation the patients and their families feel and try to balance the difficulty finding solutions with a realistic measure of hope. Dr. John Gallin, Director of the NIH Clinical Center, said Dr. Gahl takes cases after everyone else has given up. He said that in a short time the program has developed new approaches for investigating, understanding, and diagnosing rare disorders, and has added to the body of medical knowledge. As Dr. Gallin put it, as a result of the NIH Undiagnosed Diseases Program, the language of medicine is changing. The different specialists working together now are beginning to find common ways. Nancy Sullivan and Bill Gahl are just two of the dedicated people who work in the Federal Government. They are not nameless, faceless bureaucrats. They are dedicated, hard-working Americans trying to make life better for all of us under difficult circumstances. At a minimum, they deserve our gratitude and respect. They also deserve a predictable and reasonable budget to support their critical work. In the weeks ahead I will be discussing the accomplishments of other outstanding Federal workers so that Americans can understand government works for America. I yield the floor. ____________________","Congressional Record, Volume 161 Issue 40 (Tuesday, March 10, 2015) [Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 40 (Tuesday, March 10, 2015)] [Senate] [Pages S1349-S1366] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] JUSTICE FOR VICTIMS OF TRAFFICKING ACT OF 2015 The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the time until 12:30 p.m. will be equally divided. The Senator from Iowa. (The remarks of Mr. Grassley pertaining to the introduction of S. 686 are printed in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced Bills and Joint Resolutions.'') Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, on this bill before the Senate, for a few days we will continue to debate legislation to fight crime and restore dignity to its survivors. I thank the majority leader for scheduling floor action on the Justice for Victims of Trafficking Act. This important bill is authored by our assistant majority leader, Senator Cornyn of Texas. Human trafficking is a serious crime that is too often overlooked in its various forms, which include both labor trafficking and sexual servitude. It causes drastic harm to its victims. A form of modern-day slavery, human trafficking includes both adults and children, as well as noncitizens and citizens of our country. Experts tell us it is not limited to big cities or our Nation's coasts but stretches across the whole Nation, even to the rural parts of our country, including my Midwest. Indeed, it happens every day, everywhere in this country. The Judiciary Committee met 2 weeks ago to hear testimony from a victim advocate, a law enforcement official, and a sex trafficking survivor about the challenges we face in fighting human trafficking. One witness, a criminal investigator from my State of Iowa who works for our Democratic attorney general Tom Miller, told us about a 20- year-old from my State who in December was abducted and forced into sexual servitude. We have made progress in curbing human trafficking since the passage in 2000 of the Federal Victims of Trafficking and Violence Protection Act--a measure I supported at that time--but there is still much work that remains to be done on this front. This bill before the Senate takes a creative and comprehensive approach to what is a pervasive and very troubling problem. The measure has been endorsed by over 200 groups, and it passed the Senate Judiciary Committee without a dissenting vote. The centerpiece of this bill is its creation of a new fund called the Domestic Trafficking Victims' Fund, which will be used to support a host of programs and services for human trafficking and child pornography survivors. The fund will be financed not by taxpayers' dollars but by fines collected from individuals convicted of human trafficking and human smuggling crimes, making it deficit neutral. If enacted, this bill will also equip law enforcement with new tools to fight trafficking. For example, it would make it easier for State law enforcement officials to wiretap human trafficking suspects without Federal approval. It also would expand the categories of persons who can be prosecuted for human trafficking. In addition, it clarifies that child pornography is a form of human trafficking. This bill takes an extremely thoughtful and comprehensive approach, tackling not only the supply of human trafficking victims but also the demand for these victims. Tackling the problem on both fronts is something the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service tells us is absolutely necessary if we are to successfully curb human trafficking. If enacted, this bill will ensure that both the trafficker and the buyer will be prosecuted for their crimes. We had an open and productive markup of this bill. I offered an amendment, which was accepted by voice vote, clarifying that Federal grant resources can be used to meet the housing needs of trafficking victims and offer training on the effects of sex trafficking to those who serve runaway, homeless, and at-risk youth. This amendment also updates the reauthorization language for the CyberTipline of the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children to ensure that child trafficking is specifically mentioned as a form of Internet-related child exploitation. Finally, this amendment would require the Interagency Task Force to monitor and combat trafficking to identify best practices to prevent human trafficking. Senator Blumenthal from the State of Connecticut also offered an amendment based on a bill he and Senator Kirk filed earlier this year, which was accepted in committee by a voice vote. Their bill, S. 575, known as the HERO Act, provides authorization for a program at the Department of Homeland Security that trains wounded warriors to assist in the effort to locate missing children. I am proud to be a cosponsor of the bill now before if Senate. I commend Senator Cornyn, the lead sponsor of this measure, for his efforts to refine the bill and build such a substantial, very bipartisan coalition supporting it. I hope we will show the same bipartisan cooperation and support on the floor as we consider amendments. I look forward to a vote on this bill as soon as possible. I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record letters in support of S. 178 from various organizations. There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows: February 23, 2015.

Senator Dianne Feinstein, Hart Senate Office Building, Washington, DC. Senator John Cornyn, Hart Senate Office Building, Washington, DC. Senator Amy Klobuchar, Hart Senate Office Building, Washington, DC. Dear Senators Grassley, Leahy, Feinstein, Cornyn, and Klobuchar: We write to you, the leaders of the U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee, and to three committee Senators who have been particularly sensitive to our (often ignored) perspective. We write to you as survivors of sex trafficking and commercial sexual exploitation. We write as survivors who know, profoundly and personally, the harm caused by this crime. And we write to you as survivor leaders of organizations trying to prevent sex trafficking before it victimizes others. We write to express our support for legislation that makes progress in three essential areas: 1. Identify new funding streams for victim services. Current public budgets are stressed. Victims of sex trafficking typically suffer multiple harms, requiring a range of services from medical and psychological assistance to treatment for the drug and alcohol addiction that so often accompanies trafficking (addictions that make people vulnerable to trafficking; addictions that develop or worsen as people try to cope with the pain of this intimate form of abuse). We've been told by law enforcement in numerous jurisdictions that when services don't exist (mainly because they are expensive) there's a disincentive to enforcing anti- trafficking laws and identifying victims. The Justice for Victims of Trafficking Act (JVTA), S. 178, is innovative for creating a new fund to finance victim-- services an essential goal. It also achieves a second principle we stand for: Making sex buyers accountable for the harm they cause. 2. Prevent sex trafficking by targeting the buyers who create demand. Logically, trafficking will never end until we shrink the demand that creates the market. People still in the life, still being exploited, sometimes avoid this conclusion because they see no other options but the cycle of violence in which they are trapped. We are strong witnesses to the necessity of making the buyers pay, to make the crime end. Two bills in particular strength accountability in the sex trafficking legal regime: S. 178 and Combat Human Trafficking Act of 2015, S. 140. By clarifying congressional intent that sex buyers be considered parties to the trafficking crime, by compelling the Department of Justice to incorporate training and technical assistance on investigating and prosecuting buyers in its anti-trafficking programming, and by making the crime more ``costly,'' we can finally begin to shrink its incidence. [[Page S1357]] 3. Treat victims as victims, not criminals, and let survivor voices inform anti-trafficking policy. Two bills in particular recognize these realities: the Stop Exploitation Through Trafficking Act, S. 166, which gives states incentives to approve ``Safe Harbor'' laws as well as job training options for victims and the Survivors of Human Trafficking Empowerment Act, which creates a survivors-led U.S. Advisory Council on Human Trafficking to review federal policy and programs. Other proposals may also make valuable contributions, but these are the three most important principles to incorporate in new legislative initiatives. Thank you for your consideration. Please let us know if you have specific questions or would like more information on our program activities.

Hon. Chuck Grassley, Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC. Hon. Patrick J. Leahy, Ranking Member, Committee on the Judiciary, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC. Dear Chairman Grassley and Ranking Member Leahy: We are a coalition of organizations from across the United States dedicated to improving the lives of vulnerable women and children and write to express our support for the Justice for Victims of Trafficking Act of 2015, S. 178 (JVTA). The JVTA would provide much needed services and support to domestic victims of trafficking and provide a tool for law enforcement, courts, and the anti-trafficking task forces throughout the country to effectively target the demand that fuels the sex trafficking market. The JVTA provides unprecedented support to domestic victims of trafficking, who are too often invisible and underserved, by creating grants for state and local governments to develop comprehensive support programs for victims. In addition, the Act will directly assist domestic victims of trafficking by finally allowing them access to the same services and support systems that have been previously available only to foreign victims of human trafficking in the U.S. The legislation prioritizes victim assistance by training federal prosecutors and judges on the importance of requesting and ordering restitution, and training law enforcement on facilitating physical and mental health services for trafficking victims they encounter. Every day in this country, thousands of women and children are bought and sold. The unfettered demand for sex, with underage girls in particular, has caused pimps and exploiters to resort to more extreme tactics in order to meet the growing demand. Women and children, especially girls, are advertised online where buyers purchase them with ease, anonymity, and impunity. This happens in every city, in every state. The elimination of sex trafficking is fundamentally linked to targeting the demand for commercial sex. Any effort to prevent sex trafficking must focus on the sex buyers and facilitators. Without buyers of commercial sex, sex trafficking would not exist. This legislation is vital. The Justice for Victims of Trafficking Act of 2015 represents an effort to provide the necessary support services to our domestic victims of trafficking in the U.S. and to target the culture of impunity for those who seek to purchase sex, especially with children. As leaders in the anti-trafficking, anti-violence, child welfare, civil rights, runaway and homeless youth, and human rights movements, we urge Congress to pass this critical piece of legislation.

Hon. Chuck Grassley, Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC. Hon. Patrick J. Leahy, Ranking Member, Committee on the Judiciary, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC. Chairman Grassley and Ranking Member Leahy: As organizations representing law enforcement leaders, officers, and state and local prosecutors from across the United States, we write to express our support for S. 178, the Justice for Victims of Trafficking Act of 2015 (JVTA). The JVTA would provide much needed services and support to domestic victims of trafficking. More importantly, this bill provides necessary tools for law enforcement, courts, and the anti-trafficking task forces throughout the country to effectively target the demand that fuels the sex trafficking market. The JVTA provides unprecedented resources to address the issue of domestic victims of trafficking, who are too often invisible and underserved, by creating grants for state and local governments to develop comprehensive systems to address these crimes and provide services for victims. In addition, the legislation allows wire-taps obtained through state courts to be used for child sex trafficking, trains federal prosecutors and judges on the importance of requesting and ordering restitution, and trains law enforcement on facilitating physical and mental health services for trafficking victims they encounter. According to the National Center for Missing & Exploited Children (NCMEC), at least 100,000 American children each year are the victims of commercial child prostitution and child trafficking. Women and children, especially girls, are also advertised online where buyers purchase them with ease, anonymity, and impunity. This happens in every city, in every state. The elimination of sex trafficking is fundamentally linked to targeting the demand for commercial sex. Without buyers of commercial sex, sex trafficking would not exist. It is for this reason and others stated above that we, as representatives of law enforcement and the courts, support this bill. The Justice for Victims of Trafficking Act of 2015 addresses a critical need by providing the necessary tools and support services for domestic victims of trafficking in the U.S. We urge Congress to pass this critical piece of legislation. Sincerely, National District Attorneys Association, Association of State Criminal Investigative Agencies, National Association of Police Organizations, Federal Law Enforcement Officers Association, National Fusion Center Association, National Black Prosecutors Association. National Troopers Coalition, Major Cities Chiefs Association, Major County Sheriffs' Association, National Sheriffs' Association, Association of Prosecuting Attorneys. Mr. GRASSLEY. I also take this opportunity to thank the organizations Rights4Girls, Shared Hope International, the Polaris Project, and the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, among many other supporters of the bill, for their effort in assisting in our refinement of this legislation so it could move forward in this manner. I yield the floor. Mr. LEAHY. If the Senator will yield for a question, there is so much of this bill I strongly support. In fact, a lot of it reflects legislation I have written and actually passed through the committee before. I have a couple of concerns, but one that comes to mind is that we don't want to hold out false promises to victims, and I know the Senator doesn't want to either. I certainly support having any money that the traffickers are fined go to supporting this, but my experience earlier as a prosecutor and my experience now in talking to prosecutors around the country is that most of these people, when they get prosecuted, are basically judgment- proof--they don't have any money or they have a very small amount of money. They will go to prison. Who pays for that? Of course taxpayers pay for the prison, whether it is Federal or State. They will pay for the prisons, but there is no money for the victims. What happens if the fine money does not materialize? We have talked about up to $30 million, I think, in fines, but let's suppose we only come up with a few thousand dollars in fines. Are we making a promise to these victims that can't be met? Is there an alternative for them in case the fines don't pay for it? Mr. GRASSLEY. I guess, based upon the experience of the supporters of the legislation and the expert advice they got in coming to the conclusion of how to fund this fund, they feel the money is going to be available to do that. You ask a legitimate question. I suppose I ought to have an answer for it, and I don't have from this standpoint. I think that I have great faith in the figures they have presented us and that we will have to deal with the issue you bring up at some future time because I think we will want everybody to be made whole if what you say happens. Mr. LEAHY. The reason I ask, Mr. President, is because I know in the House of Representatives they have been concerned that the money might not be there. I think we all want to accomplish these things for the victims. I just want to make sure we are not holding out a promise that we can't complete. Do I agree with all the fines going into this fund? Absolutely. But the experience of a lot of prosecutors I have talked with is that the court may say: I fine you $20,000 or $30,000, but this is never paid. They go to prison. They have no assets. We are spending $25,000 to $35,000 a year as taxpayers keeping them in prison, and I want them to be in prison, but there is no money for victims. Mr. GRASSLEY. I can say to the Senator that he raises a legitimate point because I know in other areas we have set up such funds and sometimes they come up short. But we have to remember that sometimes something is not paid out because a lot of times excess money is used for something else in the Federal budget and not paid out entirely the way it was intended originally. But I would urge my colleague to take the word of the people who have done the research on this legislation to bring it together and the consensus it has from 200 or more organizations and feel that it will be successful. If it isn't, then I pledge to help you deal with that at that particular time. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont. Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, the issues raised in this are serious matters, and the Senator from Iowa, Senator Klobuchar, Senator Cornyn, and others should be concerned about this. I think of a victim I have talked with, Holly Austin Smith. She was 14 years old when she ran away from home and quickly became a victim of human trafficking. She met a man in a shopping mall who told her she was pretty, and promised he would give her a glamorous life in California. Remember, she was 14 years old. Then he sold her for sex. The first man she was sold to commented that she reminded him of his own granddaughter--but then he paid $200 to rape her. Thankfully, Holly escaped and has rebuilt her life. She is now a fierce advocate of ending all forms of human trafficking because she knows what happens to those who are trafficked. But many are not so lucky. The physical and psychological scars of being bought and sold, of being raped multiple times a night by different men, are devastating. This terrible crime destroys lives. As we consider legislation to combat human trafficking, we must remember Holly and the thousands of other vulnerable and victimized children she represents, and we must do everything we can to keep it from happening in the first place. Last Congress, in 2013, I led the effort to reauthorize the Trafficking Victims Protection Act. That historic bipartisan legislation and the funds it authorized signaled our country's commitment to ending all forms of human trafficking, both here at home and around the world. So I am glad, after the attention we gave to my bill last Congress, to see the Senate return its attention to this issue. Stories such as Holly's make clear we have more work to do. I support the bill we take up today, the Justice for Victims of Trafficking Act, but I believe we must do more to prevent trafficking in the first place. We have to act to protect our young people before they become victims. It is one thing to say now that you have become a victim, we are here to help you. It does even more if we can stop them from being victims in the first place. The legislation that Senator Collins of Maine and I have introduced seeks to do just that. Homeless and runaway kids are exceptionally vulnerable to human traffickers. A recent survey [[Page S1359]] found that one in four homeless teens was a victim of sex trafficking or had been forced to provide sex for survival needs. These vulnerable children, alone and on the street, are walking prey. Human traffickers lurk around bus stops and parks where homeless children congregate. They offer promises of something to eat and a night off the streets. They exploit the very sad reality that most of these children have no place to go. The weather may be cold. Far too many of our cities have no shelter for kids, and those who do face a chronic shortage of beds. Then somebody comes up and says: I will offer you food, I will offer you a warm place to sleep for the night. As Representative Poe recently said at an event on ending human trafficking: We have more animal shelters in this country than places for young people to find a safe place to sleep. What does that say about our priorities? I have nothing against having the animal shelters, but shouldn't we have more for our children than we do for the animals? If we are serious about preventing human trafficking, we must protect these kids. We have to provide better outreach to them, more beds for them to sleep in, and more counseling to get them on the path to a stable life. This kind of prevention costs money, but it saves lives and prevents the far more costly effects of human trafficking--not just the effects of human trafficking on the victims' part, but the cost to all of us. This is smart money we ought to be proud to invest in our children. We must include the Runaway and Homeless Youth and Trafficking Prevention Act in our efforts here to prevent more of our kids from becoming victims. I look forward, at the appropriate place, to offering our bipartisan legislation as an amendment. I know other Senators have amendments they wish to see considered. Senator Corker, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, has an important piece of legislation to combat sex and labor trafficking in countries around the world. I thank him for working with me to make some improvements to its funding provisions and I hope this bipartisan legislation will be considered as an amendment by the full Senate. I mentioned earlier Senator Klobuchar has been working for years to see the safe harbor bill get passed, to make sure victims are treated as victims and not as criminals. I am proud to cosponsor her bill. After all, as I said about the Violence Against Women Act, a victim is a victim is a victim. They are not criminals. They are victims. Senator McConnell has long promised a full amendment process. I take him at his word and I expect we will have the opportunity to strengthen the underlying bill with a variety of ideas from Senators. We owe it to survivors such as Holly to pass the strongest possible bill. We have to provide the resources desperately needed by those on the front lines protecting young people every day, such as those in my home State of Vermont at Spectrum Services and the Vermont Coalition of Runaway and Homeless Youth Programs service providers. We owe it to all the survivors who bravely come forward and tell their stories, hoping to prevent just one more child from falling prey to this terrible crime. The Senate has to pass a strong, comprehensive bill that includes prevention and prosecution, but also services for victims. We haven't accomplished as much as we should if we are only able to prosecute the perpetrator after the fact and forget about helping the victim. We have to stop trafficking from happening in the first place; but if it does happen, we have to help the victims. An editorial in the New York Times last week noted that: . . . a consensus is emerging on new initiatives to confront this human-rights problem and help its victims, often runaways or homeless youngsters who have been forced or coerced into prostitution. I agree with that editorial, and I look forward to working with every Senator here to ensure we get this done for the American people. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the New York Times editorial be printed in the Record. There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows: [From the New York Times, March 5, 2015] Steps Against Juvenile Sex Trafficking (By the Editorial Board) The impression that America's sex-trafficking problem mostly involves young people smuggled from overseas has given way to broad recognition of a cruel homegrown reality: the tens of thousands of juveniles who are exploited each year by traffickers in this country. On Capitol Hill, a consensus is emerging on new initiatives to confront this human-rights problem and help its victims, often runaways or homeless youngsters who have been forced or coerced into prostitution. The Senate Judiciary Committee last week unanimously approved a pair of anti-trafficking bills with wide backing from victim advocates and other experts, and the full Senate is expected to take up the package soon. A bill championed by Senator John Cornyn, Republican of Texas, would create a new pool of financing--through additional fines on people convicted of sex and labor trafficking, child pornography and other crimes--for restitution, victim services and law enforcement. The idea of aiding victims without committing more tax dollars has drawn support from Republicans, and any new money for this badly underfinanced cause would help. The Cornyn bill would also encourage prosecution of the ``johns,'' or buyers of juvenile sex, who typically escape criminal charges even though they are paying for what amounts to the statutory rape of children and teenagers. Their demand is what's fueling the highly lucrative human slavery business. The second bill, put forward by Senator Amy Klobuchar, Democrat of Minnesota, would give a preference for Department of Justice law enforcement grants to states that adopt ``safe harbor'' laws. These laws help ensure that young people sold for sex are treated as victims and offered support services instead of being prosecuted. The House has approved similar bills, so it should not be hard to hammer out a strong final package. A preventive measure that would help ensure housing and services for homeless juveniles, who are often prey to traffickers, unfortunately stalled in the Senate Judiciary Committee. One obstacle was the resistance of some Republicans to its nondiscrimination provision guaranteeing fair treatment of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender youths. No young person should ``have to choose between selling their bodies and a safe place to sleep,'' said Senator Susan Collins, Republican of Maine, who introduced the bill with Patrick Leahy, Democrat of Vermont. Undeterred, they plan to seek consideration from the full Senate. Trafficking abroad remains a tremendous problem, so it is fitting that a promising approach comes from the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, which last week unanimously approved a measure to create an international public-private fund dedicated to the issue, similar to the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria. More resources could do a lot to help trafficking's victims at home, too. Mr. LEAHY. We talk about the Runaway and Homeless Youth Trafficking and Prevention Act. This is a partial list of the local, State, and national groups which have urged its passage. There are too many to read--this has to be in small type; otherwise, we would have a dozen posters if we put it in larger type.

Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I see the distinguished senior Senator from Texas on the floor seeking recognition. I wonder if we could suggest the absence of a quorum for just 1 minute. Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I know the Senator from West Virginia will be giving her first speech in the Senate here shortly and I look forward to listening to that, but I wanted to say a few words about the legislation we will be debating and hopefully passing this week, and that is the Justice for Victims of Trafficking Act. This is without a doubt one of the most shocking and troubling issues facing our country today. It is no exaggeration to say modern-day human slavery, at a time when we believed as a country that slavery was a part of [[Page S1361]] our past and something we only read about in our history books. Many people are under the impression that human trafficking is a problem somewhere else or at some other time in history, but the fact is human trafficking is a problem right now in all 50 States, right here in the United States of America, the most affluent country in the world. It is not just a problem in Texas, it is not just a problem in Arizona, it is not just a problem in West Virginia, it is a problem in all 50 States. Thousands of young girls, many of them middle school age, are trapped into a life of bondage where they are abused and sold for sex every day. It is not easy to say, but it is true, and we must say it and we must acknowledge it. This is of course unconscionable. As the father of two daughters myself, it is simply heartbreaking to hear the stories of young women who have been trapped in this system. Of course, we can imagine it is every parent's worst nightmare. One woman I have had the privilege of meeting and who shared her very personal story about this is Melissa Woodward from the Dallas-Fort Worth area in Texas. When she was 12 years old--12 years old--she was sold into the sex trade by a family member, somebody whom she had every right to assume cared for her, loved her, wanted her to grow up being a loved and productive person. But she was sold into the sex trade by a family member. Eventually she was pulled out of school and trafficked full time when she was in sixth grade. Her life became a prison. She was chained to a bed in a warehouse. She endured regular beatings and, of course, she was sexually assaulted with regularity. She was even set on fire by one of her captors. All the while, she was forced to serve between 5 and 30 men every day. Melissa has said that she wished she were dead. Her story of her time in captivity is gut-wrenching and heartbreaking, but just as sad is the way she was treated once she escaped from her captors. As is the case with so many victims, Melissa struggled for years to distance herself from her past. But instead of being treated as the victim she was, the criminal justice system actually treated her as the criminal. That is an all too common outcome for victims of trafficking, who are labeled as prostitutes and are left with few options but to return to the nightmare that so sadly exists in our country. That needs to change. That is why I am glad the Senate is taking up the Justice for Victims of Trafficking Act, because this begins the process of making that important change. The bill helps law enforcement crack down on criminal trafficking rings and perpetrators of these crimes. Instead of a slap on the wrist and a fine, the so-called johns--the demand side for this terrible trade--will be treated as the child rapists and the criminals they are. No longer are we just going to deal with the supply side. We are going to pay attention to the demand side too. Critically, this bill takes fines from the perpetrators of these awful crimes and redirects them into a crime victims fund which will help people such as Melissa and others get a fresh lease on life, to begin to heal and to get the help they so badly need in order to get on with their lives. This week we have a wonderful opportunity in the Senate, in a town that is too often divided by ideology and partisanship, to do something together on a bipartisan basis that can help people such as Melissa and the thousands of young girls like her waiting to be saved. All of us, Republicans and Democrats alike, are committed to working together to do everything we can to help these victims and to put an end to this abhorrent practice. This particular legislation we are taking up today passed unanimously out of the Judiciary Committee a few weeks ago. That doesn't happen very often, but it did for this legislation. More than 200 groups around the country--such as the NAACP, the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, Rights4Girls, the Fraternal Order of Police, and the National Conference of State Legislatures--have all endorsed our work on this issue. I want to particularly thank some of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle who joined me on this effort: the senior Senator from Minnesota, Ms. Klobuchar, and the senior Senator from Oregon, Mr. Wyden. They have been great partners in this fight--not just this year but for many years. And there are many others. Another great partner has been the junior Senator from Illinois, Mr. Kirk, who has worked for years to get antitrafficking legislation to the floor. He introduced a bill called the HERO Act which authorizes a program to recruit wounded, injured, and returning veterans and provides them with training in high-tech computer forensics and law enforcement skills to help fight child exploitation. I also want to acknowledge the great contribution of the junior Senator from Ohio, Mr. Portman, who has a bill called the Bringing Missing Children Home Act, which improves the way cases of missing children are handled, strengthening law enforcement reporting and response procedures. Both the HERO Act and the Bringing Missing Children Home Act have been incorporated into the underlying bill, and I want to thank both of them for their efforts and willingness to work with us to make the Justice for Victims of Trafficking Act even stronger. I know there are Members who are interested in offering amendments to this legislation. Thanks to the majority leader, we are going to have an open process where anybody with a better idea who wants to add to this base of work that is contained in this bill will have the opportunity to do so, both offering amendments and seeking votes on those. This is a fight that sadly must be fought, but it is a fight we will win. When we do, we will finally have done our part to help deliver our Nation's promise of freedom to those who are enslaved. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia. making washington work for west virginia Mrs. CAPITO. Mr. President, I rise today to deliver my maiden speech as a Senator from West Virginia. I am deeply humbled by the confidence placed in me by fellow West Virginians. To serve as West Virginia's first female Senator is a true honor and one that comes with great responsibility. I hope to serve as an example for that next generation of West Virginians, including my own grandchildren Celia and Charlie, and hopefully for many others. I find myself in a unique place in history, and I am grateful to and inspired by my own loving family, my husband Charlie and our three children, Charles, Moore, and Shelley, and their spouses. For 14 years I have proudly served the people of West Virginia's Second Congressional District in the House of Representatives. I bring that experience to the Senate combined with a strong desire to make Washington work for West Virginia. West Virginia has a time-honored history of exceptional Senators, including my predecessors, Senators Jay Rockefeller and Robert C. Byrd. I am appreciative of their efforts to better West Virginia during their more than 80 years of combined public service in this great body. I am proud of our State's rich history, culture, and natural beauty. But it is our people that I hold dearest in my heart. West Virginians are strong and resilient. We are the embodiment of our State's history. Born of the Civil War, West Virginians fought for freedom in the face of great turmoil. As a result, President Abraham Lincoln signed the proclamation making West Virginia the 35th State admitted to the Union. Today, our State's forceful motto, ``Mountaineers are always free,'' remains emblazoned in Latin on our State flag. We will never forget the principles on which our great State was founded. The Mountain State is home to unmatched scenery and natural resources that can power our Nation's economy. A State filled with small towns, Main Streets and tight knit communities, West Virginians come together to solve problems and help neighbors in need. I have often said that West Virginia is one big small town. West Virginians expect the Senate to find pragmatic solutions to the momentous problems confronting our [[Page S1362]] country. That is particularly true now during this period of divided government. There are clear differences among the American people, and these differences are certainly reflected in the Senate. West Virginia is represented by both parties in the Senate, and I look forward to continuing to work with my friend Senator Joe Manchin in the months ahead, and I thank him for being here with me as a source of support today. Together, I hope we can reinstate respect for the institution, a place where deliberation and debate are valued and all voices are heard. We owe it to the American people to do better. Throughout my time in Congress I have heard a clear and consistent message from West Virginians: Improve the economic opportunities for our State, stop the bickering, and fight for our jobs. As Leader McConnell has stated, to do this the Senate must work more, have an open amendment process--which we are going to be having here in the next several days--and take the tough votes. After all, that is why we are here. Today I will outline how I plan to produce bipartisan, commonsense solutions in the Senate to make West Virginia communities stronger. This plan will create economic opportunities by bridging the gap and tackling America's infrastructure crisis, better connecting West Virginia and rural communities through increased broadband access, caring for our Nation's veterans, and ensuring a bright future for young West Virginians, and implementing a commonsense energy policy that utilizes our vast natural resources to provide affordable and reliable energy. First, addressing our country's crumbling infrastructure is an area that can bridge the partisan divide and further economic growth. American communities need a strong Federal highway program and a full 6-year bill to meet the needs of our growing population, to ensure safety for travelers, and to offer opportunity for growth in areas that struggle economically. West Virginians, like many across the Nation, rely heavily on roads, bridges, and highway transit to fuel our economy, to access hard to reach areas in our State, to get to and from work, and to transport necessary goods and services. U.S. Route 35 will drastically improve safety for residents in Putnam and Mason Counties. Corridor H will unleash the economic potential of our State's eastern highlands. U.S. Route 340 will help address congestion in our eastern panhandle, and the Coalfields Expressway and the King Coal Highway can help isolated communities attract businesses and provide jobs. Point Pleasant's Charles Lanham, a well-respected gentleman, had a vision. With his friend Jack Fruth, they began a crusade for their community. For many years Charles has worked to build the case for a 4-lane U.S. Route 35, a project that will provide a secure route to school for our children and serve as a regional transportation artery between Interstate 64 and the Great Lakes region. Charles understands the economic and safety benefits the road provides and has fought for them. Working with Charles we have made significant progress on Route 35, but all of our States need certainty to invest in our transportation infrastructure. That certainty comes with a long-term surface transportation reauthorization bill, which brings these projects to reality across the country. Working together we can and we must achieve this goal. Now is the time to move our transportation system forward. Second, I am committed to expanding access to broadband in communities across West Virginia, and I will be a champion for connecting our State. High-speed Internet access is a pillar of our 21st century infrastructure and a gateway to growth in rural America. High-tech businesses can power our small communities. The world literally can be at your desktop. Unfortunately, for all the potential opportunities that broadband can offer to rural America, not having this important service can place an almost insurmountable barrier to economic development, and there are many areas in my State and the leader's State that still do not have adequate access. These areas are at risk of being left behind. In Capon Bridge, WV, a lack of broadband access is an obstacle to attracting jobs and economic development. Sadly, Capon Bridge is not unique in this regard. Small communities across West Virginia and elsewhere in rural America lack fundamental infrastructure and lack access to vital opportunities as a result. The answer for Capon Bridge is not a regulated Internet. Too much government control would be counterproductive, choking off private sector expansion projects and hindering new technologies. But we have to recognize that there is a role for government in helping broadband reach those hard-to-serve communities. We should leverage resources at all levels of government and encourage public-private partnerships to expand access to rural Americans. This is a necessary and achievable goal. It may sound like a small desire, but connectivity is essential to compete and thrive. Health care access is critically important to West Virginians. We must continue to provide access to our veterans and to our children. West Virginians have a strong history of service to our Nation. These brave men and women have put themselves in harm's way to defend our freedoms. It is our solemn responsibility to care for them when they return home. These American heroes deserve the best possible treatment and top- notch mental health services. Access to care can be especially challenging for our veterans who live in rural communities. Many West Virginia veterans must travel significant distances to get to a VA hospital. In many cases, allowing veterans to receive treatment closer to home is more convenient for the patient and more efficient for the VA. While we have made strides to improve access for our veterans, the current program is not working as well as it should. More must be done. Expanded access to private medical providers will help improve the quality of care we offer to our veterans. Our children in the Mountain State also deserve quality health care. If our children, the next generation of leaders, are going to realize their potential, they must have a healthy foundation. A solid education and good health are pillars for success of future generations. As a parent and grandparent, this is personal. We must work together to continue funding the State Children's Health Insurance Program. I started my legislative career in the West Virginia House of Delegates where I served on the committee that first implemented the SCHIP program in our State. Today this program provides access to health care for tens of thousands of West Virginia's children. Maintaining this program is a priority I share with my predecessor, Senator Rockefeller, who was a tireless advocate for children's health insurance during his three decades of service in this body. I am encouraged that Senators in both parties have recognized the importance of providing continued funding for the bipartisan SCHIP program. Finally, and of critical importance to the State of West Virginia and the country, we need to work together to implement a commonsense energy policy. We need an affordable and reliable energy policy that utilizes our State's vast natural resources. We need a policy that grows the economy and creates new job opportunities. We need a policy that supports a strong middle class. We need a policy that ensures we continue to improve safety and our environment even as we expand energy production. The administration's overreach has contributed to thousands of coal miners losing their jobs in West Virginia and our neighboring States, devastating--I can't overstate this enough--local communities and families. Last year I met a recently laid off coal miner from Raleigh County. After losing his job, his church came together to prepare meals for other coal miners and their families while they searched for work. Neighbors helping neighbors--the West Virginia way. This is a stark reminder of the impact misguided Federal policies can have on the lives of real people. Anti-coal policies impact more than miners and their families. In West Virginia the attack on coal mines reduces [[Page S1363]] revenues for education programs, roads, and other public services. Higher utility prices caused by overregulation means fewer jobs in energy-intensive manufacturing. And sadly, lower income families and senior citizens who live on fixed incomes are disproportionately impacted by higher energy costs. As chairman of the Subcommittee on Clean Air and Nuclear Safety, I will lead the fight against excessive government regulation that has been devastating my State. There are many areas of energy policy where we can find common ground. While the EPA's proposed greenhouse gas standards are misguided, we should continue to make the use of fossil fuel cleaner and more efficient. We must continue to support important research at Morgantown's National Energy Technology Lab and other labs that allows us to make environmental progress even as we continue to use our natural resources. Natural gas is a large and growing part of West Virginia's economy. As a child of Marshall County, which is the heart of the Marcellus Shale development in West Virginia, I am delighted to see these communities come alive with opportunity. It is proof positive that an energy economy is a jobs economy. We need improved infrastructure in order to make full use of these gas reserves. We need new natural gas and oil pipelines that safely connect producing regions with manufacturers. We need new markets that can make use of these vital resources. We need a pro-exports policy that will benefit our country in multiple ways. The Nation will see more jobs and investment, more security, and a more independent future, and at the same time we can strengthen our relationships with important allies overseas by providing them with the energy they need. These are just a few of the ideas I hope to refine and accomplish during my first term in the Senate. Notably, there are many other very important issues--such as national security, fiscal responsibility, a balanced budget, and replacement of the Affordable Care Act--on which I will be focusing. Our plate is full, and expectations are high, as they should be. We need to roll up our sleeves and deliver. I am optimistic that we can find solutions that move our country forward. There will be differences of opinion and philosophy along the way, but Americans expect us to bridge those gaps. Senator Byrd, the longest serving Senator, said it best: I love this Senate. I love it dearly. I love the Senate for its rules. I love the Senate for its precedence. I love the Senate for the difference that it can make in people's lives. Fighting for West Virginians always has been and always will be my top priority. I am honored--I can't overstate that--to represent the great people of the Mountain State as we strive to create a strong and prosperous future. Now is the time for Washington to work for West Virginia, and I stand ready to do my part. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader. Congratulating The Senator From West Virginia Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I wish to say to our new Senator from West Virginia what an outstanding speech not only for her State but the way forward for our country, and I congratulate her for an outstanding set of comments. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The senior Senator from West Virginia. Mr. MANCHIN. Mr. President, I also wish to congratulate my colleague from West Virginia. We spoke earlier about how she and I can show the way to have a better relationship-building effort here in the Senate by working together in order to better serve the people of West Virginia and also the country. I congratulate my colleague on her great speech and look forward to working with her. I think she has done a great job for the people of West Virginia, and I again thank the Senator. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia. Tackling National Security Questions Mr. KAINE. Mr. President, I rise to address a question to myself and every Member of this body, and the question is a serious one: Is the Senate capable of tackling challenging national security questions in a mature and responsible way? We have many hard national security challenges before us now. Three of those challenges are urgent: the discussions about a potential nuclear deal with Iran, the discussions in this body about military action by the United States against ISIL, and the deliberations that will take place this month about the American budget, which will determine whether we have the resources we need to meet our security challenges. We have to show the American public--and I would argue the world--that we can give these issues the careful consideration they deserve, but I am forced to admit that recent events have caused me to have some significant doubts about our institutional capacity to tackle these issues in a responsible way. We recently--at the end of February--ran up to the very brink of shutting down the Department of Homeland Security at a time when terrorist threats and other threats to our homeland security are so obvious on our borders and throughout the world. Thank goodness, after a week's extension of funding for Homeland Security, we pulled back from the brink. But that did not lead to an increase in confidence in this body, that Congress would contemplate not funding the Department of Homeland Security. Last week there was a joint address to Congress by Prime Minister Netanyahu. I spent many hours conversing with Prime Minister Netanyahu in his office about Iran and other topics, but I am sad to look at that joint address and basically say it was history-making in some unfortunate ways. Congress has heard from the Prime Minister or President of Israel seven times in the last 50 years--eight times if you count last week. Last week's address was unusual because it was designed in a partisan way. It was an invitation by the leadership of one party with an intentional decision not to let the White House know, not to let the minority party in Congress know, and to schedule the speech days before a contested foreign election, leading many to conclude that it was an effort by Congress to affect a foreign election, which we should never do. Following that speech, a carefully worked bipartisan bill that has been introduced in Congress to give Congress an appropriate review role over any potential Iranian nuclear deal was basically hijacked. Instead of allowing the bill to go through Congress, there was a decision to force the bill to the floor for an immediate vote, which was seen by all as a partisan move. It was described by one of the Republican sponsors of the bill as an effort to embarrass Democrats. Thank goodness that at the end of the day that effort to accelerate consideration of what was a bipartisan bill was pulled back, and we will not be doing that this week. We will be allowing a normal committee process. But the fact that the effort was made did damage to reasonable bipartisan consideration of this important issue. Then yesterday we all awoke to the news that there had been a partisan letter signed by 47 Senators--47 of my colleagues, many of whom I work with very closely--not to the President saying ``We have concerns about a deal, and we are going to weigh in'' but instead to the leader of a nation that we characterize as a terrorist state. This letter presumed to instruct the nation about what Congress might or might not do. The letter was widely viewed as an effort to undercut or dilute diplomatic negotiations that are in the best tradition of our country, the notion of diplomacy. I just came from hearings this morning in the Armed Services Committee where we heard what we have heard for 2\1/2\ years: advice from our military leadership to the Senate that sequester is hurting our national defense. Will you finally listen to us? Will you do something about it? All of these events over the last few weeks when taken together suggest the sad possibility of a Senate that will elevate partisan political division over careful and constructive deliberation, even on the most critical security issues that affect the security of our country and the world. I deeply believe that this body--the Senate and Congress generally--has to pull back from the brink of irresponsible and partisan action with respect to these critical security questions because the stakes are simply too high. [[Page S1364]] With respect to the Iranian nuclear negotiation, I share many of the concerns of my 47 colleagues who wrote the letter. I share many of the concerns of the Prime Minister that were shared in his speech last week. But I deeply believe we should not try to tank a deal, critique a deal, or undercut a deal before there is a deal because to the extent there are efforts to stand and say this is a bad deal before there is a deal, the message that is communicated to the American public and to the world is: We will never accept any deal. We are not interested in diplomacy. We are not interested in negotiation. That attitude plays directly into the hands of the nation of Iran, which is currently engaging in terrorist activity. They want to be able to blame the absence of any deal on an intransigent United States that is unwilling to negotiate in good faith. We should not tank a deal before there is a deal. Instead, why don't we do what we are supposed to do as the greatest deliberative body in the world? Why don't we allow negotiators who have been working in the best traditions of American diplomacy to see if they can find a deal and then put it on the table for the review of Congress, as has always been contemplated? I am a proud original cosponsor and worked on the draftsmanship of a bipartisan bill that was introduced under the key sponsorship of Foreign Relations chair Senator Corker and ranking member Senator Menendez to guarantee to Congress an appropriate review of any final deal with Iran over their nuclear program if such a deal was reached. This is a bill which is rigorously bipartisan--not partisan, not political, not rushed, not accelerated, but rigorously bipartisan. It respects the ongoing process by allowing the negotiators to do their work and see if they can find an outcome. It guarantees Congress a debate and vote if a deal includes relief under the congressional sanctions Congress has enacted over the years. It is appropriately deferential to the Executive, allowing the Executive the flexibility to do sanctions relief under Executive or international sanctions that have not been part of any congressional statute. This is a bipartisan bill which provides some assurance to allies. Our allies in the region--allies that are most affected by the Iranian nuclear ambitions are not part of the P5+1, whether you are talking about Israel or Gulf State nations or Jordan. The nations most affected by Iranian nuclear ambitions are not part of the P5+1, and the Corker- Menendez bill would give them some comfort that a deal, if announced, would receive some careful scrutiny in this body. Finally, I believe the Corker-Menendez bipartisan approach even provides some important assurances to Iran in the negotiation. We want Iran to make not small concessions, we want them to make big and bold concessions and give up any intent to develop nuclear weapons. But what is the likelihood that Iran will make those concessions if they have no knowledge about what Congress's intent is vis-a-vis the congressional statutory provisions? There is a right way and a wrong way to approach these matters. To rush it, to label a deal as a bad deal before there is a deal, to make it entirely partisan rather than bipartisan, reflecting the will of the body, is an effort to undercut negotiations that weakens our President, weakens our country, and weakens our credibility; whereas if we proceed in a bipartisan way, we can make the deal stronger. Similarly--and then I wish to cede the moment to my colleague, the Senator from Maine--we are about to start work on another critically important issue--whether Congress should finally, after 7-plus months, have a debate to authorize an ongoing war against the Islamic State in the Levant that was begun on August 8 by the President. We are now in the eighth month of a unilateral war, and aside from a Foreign Relations Committee vote in committee in December, Congress has not had a meaningful vote or debate on this fundamental responsibility. We owe it to ourselves and to this institution, we owe it to the important national security interests at stake, and especially we owe it to the people who are risking their lives in this war--and we have already had deaths of American servicemembers as part of Operation Inherent Resolve--we owe it to them to show we can have a meaningful debate that is not partisan, that is not rushed, but that is careful and deliberate. They have been waiting for 7-plus months to see whether Congress even cares. We are at war by a Presidential act. Does Congress even care enough to have the debate on the floor of the Senate and in the House of Representatives? Is it just partisanship now? Is it just delay now? Does the fact our service men and women are risking their lives even matter to us now? This is the debate we will be entering into within the next few days, starting with the hearing in the Senate Foreign Relations Committee tomorrow. We can't afford, on important issues of national security such as Iran or such as the war against ISIL, to send the impression to our troops, to our citizens, to our global citizens around the world, that on these important matters Congress is now just a partisan sort of sideshow rather than the deliberative body we were set up to be. We have to find a bipartisan path forward on these important security issues or we weaken confidence in this institution and in the leadership of this country. In conclusion, the national security interests that are at stake right now before us are fundamental, whether it is about Iran, whether it is about the battle against ISIL, or whether it is about the budgetary deliberations we will be undertaking this month--a budgetary deliberation that will determine whether we can meet our commitments in these national security challenges. We have to get these debates right for the good of our country and the world, and we have to get them right to demonstrate to all that this institution does have the maturity to tackle these issues in a reasonable way. With that, I yield the last minute or so of my time to my colleague from Maine, Senator King. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cruz). The Senator from Maine. Mr. KING. Mr. President, there is little I can add to the remarks of the Senator from Virginia on this issue. I think this institution is being tested this week, this month, and over the next several months in a way that is really somewhat new. The test, the question, is: Can we deal with the most serious of issues facing this country and the world in a responsible, reasonable, and, yes, bipartisan, nonpartisan way? I also worked with Bob Corker, Senator Kaine, and the whole group that worked on putting together--Senator Menendez--a bipartisan bill to provide Congress a role in the approval of whatever deal is struck with Iran. I believe Congress should have that role. But in those discussions, my concern was that some of our Members will not be able to resist the temptation to politicize and make a partisan issue--even this grave issue of war and peace, this grave issue that faces this country and the entire world--of the possibility of a regime such as that in Iran achieving nuclear weapons. This is not an ideological debate. This is a serious debate about the future of this country. This is one of the most serious negotiations of our adult lives. I want Congress to have a role, but I want it to play that role weighing the merits, pro or con, the actual materials that are in the treaty--in the agreement. I want us to have that role, but I want to be sure we can respond to that in a responsible way. Frankly, the actions of the last few days have shaken that confidence, because we have seen what appears to be an effort to gain political and partisan advantage from this gravest of national issues. I understand there are differences about what the deal should look like and what the terms should be. That is OK. That is what we should be discussing. But to turn this into a partisan issue I think does a grave disservice to this entire country, and to undercut the President in the last stages of the negotiation to me is unprecedented and unthinkable. I was a young man at the time of the Cuban missile crisis. I cannot imagine the Congress of the United States writing a letter to Kruschev in the midst of those discussions and saying, Don't worry about this guy Kennedy, he doesn't speak for the country. Yet that essentially is what took place yesterday. I don't understand the need or the [[Page S1365]] helpfulness of such a statement at a time when we were already moving toward a bipartisan--I believe probably veto-proof--bill to provide this institution with a check on the quality of the deal that is being struck. It is not productive or helpful to turn issues of this kind into partisan issues. I hope we can step back from this partisan posture and meet this solemn responsibility to assess what the President and the administration and the other five countries--the agreement they come to with Iran--to determine whether, indeed, it is in the best interests of the region and the world. That is our responsibility. I hope we can muster the ability to meet that responsibility in a serious way and not, for once, turn it into a partisan issue. Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland. Tribute to Federal Employees Dr. Francis Collins, Dr. Nancy Sullivan, And Dr. William Gahl Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I wish to take a few moments today to speak about Federal workers in general and some of the people at the National Institutes of Health in particular. Government workers guard our borders, protect us from terrorists, treat our wounded veterans, dispense Social Security checks to our retirees, find cures for diseases, guide the Nation's air traffic, explore the tiniest particles and the vast expanse of outer space, ensure our air is safe to breathe, our water is safe to drink, our food is safe to eat, support our service men and women in harm's way, and promote our interests and ideals abroad. For whom does the government work? Government works for America. The Washington Post recently reported that since reliable data first became available shortly before World War II, the percentage of all employed people working for the Federal Government hit an all-time low in December. Fewer than 2 percent of the total U.S. workforce is employed by the Federal Government. Over nearly the past half century, from 1966 to 2012--the most recent year for which comparable data is available--the number of Federal workers in the executive branch dropped by 83,000. During that time, the U.S. population increased from under 200 million to over 300 million people and the gross domestic product nearly quadrupled. We can argue over whether we want bigger government or smaller government, but we should all agree we want better government. We can't have better government when Federal workers are constantly under assault. We need to stop treating the Federal workforce like a rented mule. We need to treat the Federal workforce like the critical asset it is. A 2011 report by the National Academy of Public Administration and the Kettering Foundation concluded that programs operated by civil servants receive ``significantly higher'' scores for management and effectiveness than those run by ``grant- and contract-based third parties.'' I think part of the problem is that Americans have come to accept that Federal workers are nameless, faceless bureaucrats. They aren't. They are people who are patriotic Americans and dedicated to public service. They have families and support their communities. They have been asked to do more and more with less and less while being subjected to pay freezes, sequestration-related furloughs, government shutdowns, and threats to their benefits. They have contributed $150 billion to deficit reduction while still working hard on behalf of all Americans. Today, as I mentioned, I wish to focus on the Federal workers at the National Institutes of Health. I wish to introduce my colleagues and all Americans to a few of the Federal workers who are making life better for all of us. But first a description of the NIH so people can understand its mission. I can sum up its mission in two words: saving lives. The NIH is the world's premier biomedical and health-related research facility. Its job is to perform and fund the research that helps improve the Nation's health--a job it has carried out for over a century. I am proud the NIH is headquartered in Maryland, but it is important to understand that NIH support of medical research at other research institutions has created jobs and fostered economic growth in each and every State, while establishing and maintaining the United States as the global leader in the life sciences. NIH-supported research added $69 billion to our GDP and supported 7 million jobs in 2011 alone. In the weeks and months ahead, Congress and the administration will have to decide whether they have to replace sequestration with a more logical, coherent, strategic, and responsible form of budgeting. While we will have disagreements over the details, if anyone needs to be convinced about the value of replacing sequestration, look no further than the situation at NIH. Funding constraints there not only cost people their jobs, they are costing people their lives. NIH funding has multiple drivers, but comparing the fiscal year 2013 figures with the fiscal year 2012 figures, largely because of sequestration, approximately 640 fewer competitive research project grants were issued and approximately 750 fewer new patients were admitted to the NIH Clinical Center. Each these affects a person's life. Each of these has consequences when we do not move forward as we should. A recent survey determined that nearly 20 percent of the biomedical scientists have considered leaving the United States due to sequestration. We are losing our best. Nearly one-half of the scientists surveyed said they have laid off staff in their laboratories or are considering laying off staff due to losing NIH grants. More than 50 percent of the researchers say they have colleagues who have lost his or her job. What is the impact? Delays in lifesaving medical progress. Medical breakthroughs do not happen overnight. In almost all instances, breakthrough discoveries result from years of incremental research to understand how diseases start and progress. Cuts to research are delaying progress in medical breakthroughs, including developing better cancer drugs that zero in on a tumor with fewer side effects; research on a universal flu vaccine that could fight every strain of influenza without needing a yearly shot; preventing debilitating chronic conditions that are costly to society and delay development of more effective treatments for common and rare diseases affecting millions of Americans. NIH Director Dr. Francis Collins recently wrote the column ``Exceptional Opportunities in Medical Science'' in which he describes the excitement over ``personalized medicine,'' the BRAIN initiative, and development of the Ebola vaccine. He has also shared his concern about the budget challenges NIH faces. Let me quote from Dr. Collins: Although all of these ambitious scientific endeavors offer exceptional promise for advancing human health, the effect that unprecedented budget pressures are having on biomedical research cannot be ignored. Due to inflation, the NIH budget has lost almost 25 percent of its purchasing power over the last decade. The decline has had important consequences. The NIH once funded one in three research proposals, but now only has enough resources to support one in six. As a result, a great deal of excellent science is being left unfunded. Last October Dr. Collins stated that cuts in Federal funding slowed the development of vaccines and therapies for the deadly Ebola virus, saying: ``Frankly, if we had not gone through our 10-year slide in research support, we probably would have had a vaccine in time for this that would have gone through clinical trials and would have been ready.'' Think about the lives that could have been saved. To Americans who wonder what their tax dollars do--well, some go to NIH to find treatments and cures for cancer, depression, arthritis, substance abuse, addiction, diabetes, and Alzheimer's disease. To date, 145 NIH-supported researchers have received or shared 85 Nobel Prizes. Not everyone wins a Nobel Prize, so let me talk about people who aren't in the spotlight--people some of our colleagues might refer to as ``nameless, faceless bureaucrats.'' I will highlight the work of two of them today who are making a tremendous contribution as public servants. Dr. Nancy Sullivan, Chief of the Vaccine Research Center, has been working on an Ebola vaccine for nearly two decades, dating back to when she was an investigator at the University of Michigan with the then-NIH grantee [[Page S1366]] and now former Director, Dr. Gary Nabel. Most vaccines spur production of a person's immune system's antibodies that block a virus from entering the cells, but that approach doesn't work for Ebola. Gene-based vaccines can induce additional virus fighters called T- cells, so that is what Dr. Sullivan created, using pieces of Ebola genetic material. It is the most promising approach yet, and it is being tested in the parts of West Africa that have been hit the hardest with Ebola, where more than 9,000 people have died. The concept for Dr. Sullivan's vaccine has been 16 years in the making, beginning back when few people outside the global infectious disease community had even heard of the deadly disease. Over the years, Dr. Sullivan and her team continued to tweak her ideas, constantly improving on them. Eventually she followed Dr. Nabel to NIH. Many experts in the vaccine research community had begun to believe Ebola was insurmountable. They thought it was too aggressive for a vaccine to ever protect against it. But Dr. Sullivan never lost heart that her work would one day prove successful. The Ebola virus infection is a highly lethal disease for which there are no effective therapeutic or preventive treatments. Consequently, work with these viruses requires highly specialized BSL-4 containment labs--the highest biosafety labs. Dr. Sullivan is a leader in the field and has personally conducted many of the most critical experiments. Her work on immunology and vaccine development is widely considered as some of the very best in the field. In spite of the difficulties associated with access to BSL-4 labs, her work has consistently been the source of novel observations. Dr. Sullivan received her Ph.D. in cell biology from Harvard University in 1997. She received her master of science in environmental engineering in 1989, also from Harvard University. I brought a poster to the floor where we see President Obama visited NIH to personally congratulate Dr. Sullivan for her incredible work on behalf of world health. Some people may be familiar with the TV show ``House.'' The main character, Dr. Gregory House, is brilliant at diagnosing conditions and illnesses that baffle everyone else. The real-life Dr. House is Dr. William Gahl, the founding Director of the Undiagnosed Diseases Program at NIH. He is America's leading medical detective, a physician dedicated to finding answers for long-suffering patients with mysterious illnesses that long eluded diagnosis. Dr. Gahl has brought together a unique combination of elite medical specialists, researchers, and Federal resources to solve baffling illnesses and provide desperate patients and their families with information and possible solutions and treatments for their often life-threatening ailments. Results include diagnosis and treatment of diseases so rare they don't even have names, plus new genetic discoveries, improved disease management, and the advancement of medical knowledge. NIH Director Dr. Collins said the Undiagnosed Diseases Program, which Dr. Gahl conceived and started, serves as a kind of court of last resort for patients without a diagnosis. Dr. Gahl has convinced some of the best, brightest, and busiest physicians to participate, and has devoted tremendous energy to examining patient records, selecting cases for in- depth analysis, and helping people who are seriously ill. Under Dr. Gahl's stewardship, the program regularly involves a collective effort by more than 25 attending physicians of different specialties. The cooperation by a diverse group of experts has helped create a coherent view of each patient instead of the organ-by-organ orientation taken by most specialists. Patients are brought to the NIH campus in Bethesda for an intensive week. They meet with a parade of specialists who study their medical histories, perform thorough exams, and take numerous tests. The doctors then meet to discuss what they have seen, discovered, or may have missed. They also debate various theories, trying to connect the dots, and come up with a possible diagnosis and treatment. Scientists working with Dr. Gahl discovered the genetic cause of a vascular disorder not previously identified in the medical literature. The rare condition, identified in nine individuals, arises in adulthood and causes arterial calcification in the hands and feet, but does not affect arteries in the heart. The symptoms include acute pain after walking more than a short distance. The disorder previously baffled the medical field and evaded diagnosis when conventional methods were used. In another instance, physicians working with Dr. Gahl identified the reason why a woman's muscles had grown painfully large and hard underneath her skin, making it increasingly difficult for her to perform daily activities. This turned out to be an extremely rare, generally fatal complication of multiple myeloma, and the diagnosis by the NIH Undiagnosed Diseases Program resulted in a stem cell bone marrow transplant that allows her to lead a normal life. These are people who had no hope, no hope at all. They came to NIH, and they have gotten government-supported help to give them hope and to give them life. Dr. Gahl earned his B.S. in biology from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1972 and his M.D. from the University of Wisconsin in 1976. He obtained a Ph.D. degree in oncology research from Wisconsin's McArdle Laboratory for Cancer Research in 1981. He has published more than 350 peer-reviewed papers and trained 36 biochemical geneticists. Dr. Gahl has made a number of seminal discoveries regarding rare diseases during his career. He said deciding who to admit into the Undiagnosed Diseases Program is always very difficult and much like triage on the battlefield. You have to make decisions about where you think you can do some good. The Undiagnosed Diseases Program serves people who feel helpless, have suffered greatly, have waited many years for answers, and must be treated with respect and attention. According to Dr. Gahl, the NIH caregivers understand the desperation the patients and their families feel and try to balance the difficulty finding solutions with a realistic measure of hope. Dr. John Gallin, Director of the NIH Clinical Center, said Dr. Gahl takes cases after everyone else has given up. He said that in a short time the program has developed new approaches for investigating, understanding, and diagnosing rare disorders, and has added to the body of medical knowledge. As Dr. Gallin put it, as a result of the NIH Undiagnosed Diseases Program, the language of medicine is changing. The different specialists working together now are beginning to find common ways. Nancy Sullivan and Bill Gahl are just two of the dedicated people who work in the Federal Government. They are not nameless, faceless bureaucrats. They are dedicated, hard-working Americans trying to make life better for all of us under difficult circumstances. At a minimum, they deserve our gratitude and respect. They also deserve a predictable and reasonable budget to support their critical work. In the weeks ahead I will be discussing the accomplishments of other outstanding Federal workers so that Americans can understand government works for America. I yield the floor. ____________________",package_114_112.csv,163738,163738,163806,"[congressional record volume 161, number 40 (tuesday, march 10, 2015)] [senate] [pages s1349-s1366] from the congressional record online through the government publishing office [ www.gpo.gov ] justice for victims of trafficking act of 2015 the presiding officer. under the previous order, the senate will proceed to the consideration of s. 178, which the clerk will report. the legislative clerk read as follows: a bill (s. 178) to provide justice for the victims of trafficking. thereupon, the senate proceeded to consider the bill, which had been reported from the committee on the judiciary, with an amendment to strike all after the enacting clause and insert in lieu thereof the following: s. 178 section 1. short title; table of contents.

[[page s1355]] (3) the united states immigration and customs enforcement of the department of homeland security serves a critical national security role in protecting the united states from the growing international threat of child exploitation and human trafficking. (4) the cyber crimes center of the united states immigration and customs enforcement is a vital national resource in the effort to combat international child exploitation, providing advanced expertise and assistance in investigations, computer forensics, and victim identification. (5) the returning military heroes of the united states possess unique and valuable skills that can assist law enforcement in combating global sexual and child exploitation, and the department of homeland security should use this national resource to the maximum extent possible. (6) through the human exploitation rescue operative (hero) child rescue corps program, the returning military heroes of the united states are trained and hired to investigate crimes of child exploitation in order to target predators and rescue children from sexual abuse and slavery.

(the remarks of mr. grassley pertaining to the introduction of s. 686 are printed in today's record under ``statements on introduced bills and joint resolutions.'') mr. grassley. mr. president, on this bill before the senate, for a few days we will continue to debate legislation to fight crime and restore dignity to its survivors. i thank the majority leader for scheduling floor action on the justice for victims of trafficking act. this important bill is authored by our assistant majority leader, senator cornyn of texas. human trafficking is a serious crime that is too often overlooked in its various forms, which include both labor trafficking and sexual servitude. it causes drastic harm to its victims. a form of modern-day slavery, human trafficking includes both adults and children, as well as noncitizens and citizens of our country. experts tell us it is not limited to big cities or our nation's coasts but stretches across the whole nation, even to the rural parts of our country, including my midwest. indeed, it happens every day, everywhere in this country. the judiciary committee met 2 weeks ago to hear testimony from a victim advocate, a law enforcement official, and a sex trafficking survivor about the challenges we face in fighting human trafficking. one witness, a criminal investigator from my state of iowa who works for our democratic attorney general tom miller, told us about a 20- year-old from my state who in december was abducted and forced into sexual servitude. we have made progress in curbing human trafficking since the passage in 2000 of the federal victims of trafficking and violence protection act--a measure i supported at that time--but there is still much work that remains to be done on this front. this bill before the senate takes a creative and comprehensive approach to what is a pervasive and very troubling problem. the measure has been endorsed by over 200 groups, and it passed the senate judiciary committee without a dissenting vote. the centerpiece of this bill is its creation of a new fund called the domestic trafficking victims' fund, which will be used to support a host of programs and services for human trafficking and child pornography survivors. the fund will be financed not by taxpayers' dollars but by fines collected from individuals convicted of human trafficking and human smuggling crimes, making it deficit neutral. if enacted, this bill will also equip law enforcement with new tools to fight trafficking. for example, it would make it easier for state law enforcement officials to wiretap human trafficking suspects without federal approval. it also would expand the categories of persons who can be prosecuted for human trafficking. in addition, it clarifies that child pornography is a form of human trafficking. this bill takes an extremely thoughtful and comprehensive approach, tackling not only the supply of human trafficking victims but also the demand for these victims. tackling the problem on both fronts is something the nonpartisan congressional research service tells us is absolutely necessary if we are to successfully curb human trafficking. if enacted, this bill will ensure that both the trafficker and the buyer will be prosecuted for their crimes. we had an open and productive markup of this bill. i offered an amendment, which was accepted by voice vote, clarifying that federal grant resources can be used to meet the housing needs of trafficking victims and offer training on the effects of sex trafficking to those who serve runaway, homeless, and at-risk youth. this amendment also updates the reauthorization language for the cybertipline of the national center for missing and exploited children to ensure that child trafficking is specifically mentioned as a form of internet-related child exploitation. finally, this amendment would require the interagency task force to monitor and combat trafficking to identify best practices to prevent human trafficking. senator blumenthal from the state of connecticut also offered an amendment based on a bill he and senator kirk filed earlier this year, which was accepted in committee by a voice vote. their bill, s. 575, known as the hero act, provides authorization for a program at the department of homeland security that trains wounded warriors to assist in the effort to locate missing children. i am proud to be a cosponsor of the bill now before if senate. i commend senator cornyn, the lead sponsor of this measure, for his efforts to refine the bill and build such a substantial, very bipartisan coalition supporting it. i hope we will show the same bipartisan cooperation and support on the floor as we consider amendments. i look forward to a vote on this bill as soon as possible. i ask unanimous consent to have printed in the record letters in support of s. 178 from various organizations. there being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the record, as follows: february 23, 2015. senator chuck grassley, chair, u.s. senate judiciary committee, dirksen senate office building, washington, dc. senator patrick leahy, ranking member, russell senate office building, washington, dc. senator dianne feinstein, hart senate office building, washington, dc. senator john cornyn, hart senate office building, washington, dc. senator amy klobuchar, hart senate office building, washington, dc. dear senators grassley, leahy, feinstein, cornyn, and klobuchar: we write to you, the leaders of the u.s. senate judiciary committee, and to three committee senators who have been particularly sensitive to our (often ignored) perspective. we write to you as survivors of sex trafficking and commercial sexual exploitation. we write as survivors who know, profoundly and personally, the harm caused by this crime. and we write to you as survivor leaders of organizations trying to prevent sex trafficking before it victimizes others. we write to express our support for legislation that makes progress in three essential areas: 1. identify new funding streams for victim services. current public budgets are stressed. victims of sex trafficking typically suffer multiple harms, requiring a range of services from medical and psychological assistance to treatment for the drug and alcohol addiction that so often accompanies trafficking (addictions that make people vulnerable to trafficking; addictions that develop or worsen as people try to cope with the pain of this intimate form of abuse). we've been told by law enforcement in numerous jurisdictions that when services don't exist (mainly because they are expensive) there's a disincentive to enforcing anti- trafficking laws and identifying victims. the justice for victims of trafficking act (jvta), s. 178, is innovative for creating a new fund to finance victim-- services an essential goal. it also achieves a second principle we stand for: making sex buyers accountable for the harm they cause. 2. prevent sex trafficking by targeting the buyers who create demand. logically, trafficking will never end until we shrink the demand that creates the market. people still in the life, still being exploited, sometimes avoid this conclusion because they see no other options but the cycle of violence in which they are trapped. we are strong witnesses to the necessity of making the buyers pay, to make the crime end. two bills in particular strength accountability in the sex trafficking legal regime: s. 178 and combat human trafficking act of 2015, s. 140. by clarifying congressional intent that sex buyers be considered parties to the trafficking crime, by compelling the department of justice to incorporate training and technical assistance on investigating and prosecuting buyers in its anti-trafficking programming, and by making the crime more ``costly,'' we can finally begin to shrink its incidence. [[page s1357]] 3. treat victims as victims, not criminals, and let survivor voices inform anti-trafficking policy. two bills in particular recognize these realities: the stop exploitation through trafficking act, s. 166, which gives states incentives to approve ``safe harbor'' laws as well as job training options for victims and the survivors of human trafficking empowerment act, which creates a survivors-led u.s. advisory council on human trafficking to review federal policy and programs. other proposals may also make valuable contributions, but these are the three most important principles to incorporate in new legislative initiatives. thank you for your consideration. please let us know if you have specific questions or would like more information on our program activities. sincerely, windie lazenko, 4her--north dakota, nd; brooke axtell, allies against slavery, tx; aliza amar, breaking the silence together/sole sisters project, san diego, ca; vednita carter, breaking free, st paul, mn; leah j. albright-byrd, executive director/founder, bridget's dream, sacramento, ca; marian hatcher, human trafficking coordinator, cook county sheriff's office, space international member, chicago, il; tina frundt, courtney's house, washington, dc; cherie jimenez, founder, eva center, boston, ma; d'lita miller, founder/executive director, families against sex trafficking, los angeles, ca; kathi hardy, founder/executive director, freedom from exploitation, san diego, ca; cheryl briggs, founder/ president, mission at serenity ranch, tx; necole daniels, misssey, inc., oakland, ca; dr. brook bello, more too life, fl. nola brantley, nola brantley speaks!

____ february 24, 2015. hon. chuck grassley, chairman, committee on the judiciary, u.s. senate, washington, dc. hon. patrick j. leahy, ranking member, committee on the judiciary, u.s. senate, washington, dc. chairman grassley and ranking member leahy: as organizations representing law enforcement leaders, officers, and state and local prosecutors from across the united states, we write to express our support for s. 178, the justice for victims of trafficking act of 2015 (jvta). the jvta would provide much needed services and support to domestic victims of trafficking. more importantly, this bill provides necessary tools for law enforcement, courts, and the anti-trafficking task forces throughout the country to effectively target the demand that fuels the sex trafficking market. the jvta provides unprecedented resources to address the issue of domestic victims of trafficking, who are too often invisible and underserved, by creating grants for state and local governments to develop comprehensive systems to address these crimes and provide services for victims. in addition, the legislation allows wire-taps obtained through state courts to be used for child sex trafficking, trains federal prosecutors and judges on the importance of requesting and ordering restitution, and trains law enforcement on facilitating physical and mental health services for trafficking victims they encounter. according to the national center for missing & exploited children (ncmec), at least 100,000 american children each year are the victims of commercial child prostitution and child trafficking. women and children, especially girls, are also advertised online where buyers purchase them with ease, anonymity, and impunity. this happens in every city, in every state. the elimination of sex trafficking is fundamentally linked to targeting the demand for commercial sex. without buyers of commercial sex, sex trafficking would not exist. it is for this reason and others stated above that we, as representatives of law enforcement and the courts, support this bill. the justice for victims of trafficking act of 2015 addresses a critical need by providing the necessary tools and support services for domestic victims of trafficking in the u.s. we urge congress to pass this critical piece of legislation. sincerely, national district attorneys association, association of state criminal investigative agencies, national association of police organizations, federal law enforcement officers association, national fusion center association, national black prosecutors association. national troopers coalition, major cities chiefs association, major county sheriffs' association, national sheriffs' association, association of prosecuting attorneys. mr. grassley. i also take this opportunity to thank the organizations rights4girls, shared hope international, the polaris project, and the national center for missing and exploited children, among many other supporters of the bill, for their effort in assisting in our refinement of this legislation so it could move forward in this manner. i yield the floor. mr. leahy. if the senator will yield for a question, there is so much of this bill i strongly support. in fact, a lot of it reflects legislation i have written and actually passed through the committee before. i have a couple of concerns, but one that comes to mind is that we don't want to hold out false promises to victims, and i know the senator doesn't want to either. i certainly support having any money that the traffickers are fined go to supporting this, but my experience earlier as a prosecutor and my experience now in talking to prosecutors around the country is that most of these people, when they get prosecuted, are basically judgment- proof--they don't have any money or they have a very small amount of money. they will go to prison. who pays for that? of course taxpayers pay for the prison, whether it is federal or state. they will pay for the prisons, but there is no money for the victims. what happens if the fine money does not materialize? we have talked about up to $30 million, i think, in fines, but let's suppose we only come up with a few thousand dollars in fines. are we making a promise to these victims that can't be met? is there an alternative for them in case the fines don't pay for it? mr. grassley. i guess, based upon the experience of the supporters of the legislation and the expert advice they got in coming to the conclusion of how to fund this fund, they feel the money is going to be available to do that. you ask a legitimate question. i suppose i ought to have an answer for it, and i don't have from this standpoint. i think that i have great faith in the figures they have presented us and that we will have to deal with the issue you bring up at some future time because i think we will want everybody to be made whole if what you say happens. mr. leahy. the reason i ask, mr. president, is because i know in the house of representatives they have been concerned that the money might not be there. i think we all want to accomplish these things for the victims. i just want to make sure we are not holding out a promise that we can't complete. do i agree with all the fines going into this fund? absolutely. but the experience of a lot of prosecutors i have talked with is that the court may say: i fine you $20,000 or $30,000, but this is never paid. they go to prison. they have no assets. we are spending $25,000 to $35,000 a year as taxpayers keeping them in prison, and i want them to be in prison, but there is no money for victims. mr. grassley. i can say to the senator that he raises a legitimate point because i know in other areas we have set up such funds and sometimes they come up short. but we have to remember that sometimes something is not paid out because a lot of times excess money is used for something else in the federal budget and not paid out entirely the way it was intended originally. but i would urge my colleague to take the word of the people who have done the research on this legislation to bring it together and the consensus it has from 200 or more organizations and feel that it will be successful. if it isn't, then i pledge to help you deal with that at that particular time. i yield the floor. the presiding officer. the senator from vermont. mr. leahy. mr. president, the issues raised in this are serious matters, and the senator from iowa, senator klobuchar, senator cornyn, and others should be concerned about this. i think of a victim i have talked with, holly austin smith. she was 14 years old when she ran away from home and quickly became a victim of human trafficking. she met a man in a shopping mall who told her she was pretty, and promised he would give her a glamorous life in california. remember, she was 14 years old. then he sold her for sex. the first man she was sold to commented that she reminded him of his own granddaughter--but then he paid $200 to rape her. thankfully, holly escaped and has rebuilt her life. she is now a fierce advocate of ending all forms of human trafficking because she knows what happens to those who are trafficked. but many are not so lucky. the physical and psychological scars of being bought and sold, of being raped multiple times a night by different men, are devastating. this terrible crime destroys lives. as we consider legislation to combat human trafficking, we must remember holly and the thousands of other vulnerable and victimized children she represents, and we must do everything we can to keep it from happening in the first place. last congress, in 2013, i led the effort to reauthorize the trafficking victims protection act. that historic bipartisan legislation and the funds it authorized signaled our country's commitment to ending all forms of human trafficking, both here at home and around the world. so i am glad, after the attention we gave to my bill last congress, to see the senate return its attention to this issue. stories such as holly's make clear we have more work to do. i support the bill we take up today, the justice for victims of trafficking act, but i believe we must do more to prevent trafficking in the first place. we have to act to protect our young people before they become victims. it is one thing to say now that you have become a victim, we are here to help you. it does even more if we can stop them from being victims in the first place. the legislation that senator collins of maine and i have introduced seeks to do just that. homeless and runaway kids are exceptionally vulnerable to human traffickers. a recent survey [[page s1359]] found that one in four homeless teens was a victim of sex trafficking or had been forced to provide sex for survival needs. these vulnerable children, alone and on the street, are walking prey. human traffickers lurk around bus stops and parks where homeless children congregate. they offer promises of something to eat and a night off the streets. they exploit the very sad reality that most of these children have no place to go. the weather may be cold. far too many of our cities have no shelter for kids, and those who do face a chronic shortage of beds. then somebody comes up and says: i will offer you food, i will offer you a warm place to sleep for the night. as representative poe recently said at an event on ending human trafficking: we have more animal shelters in this country than places for young people to find a safe place to sleep. what does that say about our priorities? i have nothing against having the animal shelters, but shouldn't we have more for our children than we do for the animals? if we are serious about preventing human trafficking, we must protect these kids. we have to provide better outreach to them, more beds for them to sleep in, and more counseling to get them on the path to a stable life. this kind of prevention costs money, but it saves lives and prevents the far more costly effects of human trafficking--not just the effects of human trafficking on the victims' part, but the cost to all of us. this is smart money we ought to be proud to invest in our children. we must include the runaway and homeless youth and trafficking prevention act in our efforts here to prevent more of our kids from becoming victims. i look forward, at the appropriate place, to offering our bipartisan legislation as an amendment. i know other senators have amendments they wish to see considered. senator corker, chairman of the senate foreign relations committee, has an important piece of legislation to combat sex and labor trafficking in countries around the world. i thank him for working with me to make some improvements to its funding provisions and i hope this bipartisan legislation will be considered as an amendment by the full senate. i mentioned earlier senator klobuchar has been working for years to see the safe harbor bill get passed, to make sure victims are treated as victims and not as criminals. i am proud to cosponsor her bill. after all, as i said about the violence against women act, a victim is a victim is a victim. they are not criminals. they are victims. senator mcconnell has long promised a full amendment process. i take him at his word and i expect we will have the opportunity to strengthen the underlying bill with a variety of ideas from senators. we owe it to survivors such as holly to pass the strongest possible bill. we have to provide the resources desperately needed by those on the front lines protecting young people every day, such as those in my home state of vermont at spectrum services and the vermont coalition of runaway and homeless youth programs service providers. we owe it to all the survivors who bravely come forward and tell their stories, hoping to prevent just one more child from falling prey to this terrible crime. the senate has to pass a strong, comprehensive bill that includes prevention and prosecution, but also services for victims. we haven't accomplished as much as we should if we are only able to prosecute the perpetrator after the fact and forget about helping the victim. we have to stop trafficking from happening in the first place; but if it does happen, we have to help the victims. an editorial in the new york times last week noted that: . . . a consensus is emerging on new initiatives to confront this human-rights problem and help its victims, often runaways or homeless youngsters who have been forced or coerced into prostitution. i agree with that editorial, and i look forward to working with every senator here to ensure we get this done for the american people. mr. president, i ask unanimous consent that the new york times editorial be printed in the record. there being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the record, as follows: [from the new york times, march 5, 2015] steps against juvenile sex trafficking (by the editorial board) the impression that america's sex-trafficking problem mostly involves young people smuggled from overseas has given way to broad recognition of a cruel homegrown reality: the tens of thousands of juveniles who are exploited each year by traffickers in this country. on capitol hill, a consensus is emerging on new initiatives to confront this human-rights problem and help its victims, often runaways or homeless youngsters who have been forced or coerced into prostitution. the senate judiciary committee last week unanimously approved a pair of anti-trafficking bills with wide backing from victim advocates and other experts, and the full senate is expected to take up the package soon. a bill championed by senator john cornyn, republican of texas, would create a new pool of financing--through additional fines on people convicted of sex and labor trafficking, child pornography and other crimes--for restitution, victim services and law enforcement. the idea of aiding victims without committing more tax dollars has drawn support from republicans, and any new money for this badly underfinanced cause would help. the cornyn bill would also encourage prosecution of the ``johns,'' or buyers of juvenile sex, who typically escape criminal charges even though they are paying for what amounts to the statutory rape of children and teenagers. their demand is what's fueling the highly lucrative human slavery business. the second bill, put forward by senator amy klobuchar, democrat of minnesota, would give a preference for department of justice law enforcement grants to states that adopt ``safe harbor'' laws. these laws help ensure that young people sold for sex are treated as victims and offered support services instead of being prosecuted. the house has approved similar bills, so it should not be hard to hammer out a strong final package. a preventive measure that would help ensure housing and services for homeless juveniles, who are often prey to traffickers, unfortunately stalled in the senate judiciary committee. one obstacle was the resistance of some republicans to its nondiscrimination provision guaranteeing fair treatment of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender youths. no young person should ``have to choose between selling their bodies and a safe place to sleep,'' said senator susan collins, republican of maine, who introduced the bill with patrick leahy, democrat of vermont. undeterred, they plan to seek consideration from the full senate. trafficking abroad remains a tremendous problem, so it is fitting that a promising approach comes from the senate foreign relations committee, which last week unanimously approved a measure to create an international public-private fund dedicated to the issue, similar to the global fund to fight aids, tuberculosis and malaria. more resources could do a lot to help trafficking's victims at home, too. mr. leahy. we talk about the runaway and homeless youth trafficking and prevention act. this is a partial list of the local, state, and national groups which have urged its passage. there are too many to read--this has to be in small type; otherwise, we would have a dozen posters if we put it in larger type. mr. president, i ask unanimous consent to have printed in the record the complete list.

quorum for just 1 minute. mr. cornyn. mr. president, i suggest the absence of a quorum. the presiding officer. the clerk will call the roll. mr. cornyn. mr. president, i ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. the presiding officer. without objection, it is so ordered. mr. cornyn. mr. president, i know the senator from west virginia will be giving her first speech in the senate here shortly and i look forward to listening to that, but i wanted to say a few words about the legislation we will be debating and hopefully passing this week, and that is the justice for victims of trafficking act. this is without a doubt one of the most shocking and troubling issues facing our country today. it is no exaggeration to say modern-day human slavery, at a time when we believed as a country that slavery was a part of [[page s1361]] our past and something we only read about in our history books. many people are under the impression that human trafficking is a problem somewhere else or at some other time in history, but the fact is human trafficking is a problem right now in all 50 states, right here in the united states of america, the most affluent country in the world. it is not just a problem in texas, it is not just a problem in arizona, it is not just a problem in west virginia, it is a problem in all 50 states. thousands of young girls, many of them middle school age, are trapped into a life of bondage where they are abused and sold for sex every day. it is not easy to say, but it is true, and we must say it and we must acknowledge it. this is of course unconscionable. as the father of two daughters myself, it is simply heartbreaking to hear the stories of young women who have been trapped in this system. of course, we can imagine it is every parent's worst nightmare. one woman i have had the privilege of meeting and who shared her very personal story about this is melissa woodward from the dallas-fort worth area in texas. when she was 12 years old--12 years old--she was sold into the sex trade by a family member, somebody whom she had every right to assume cared for her, loved her, wanted her to grow up being a loved and productive person. but she was sold into the sex trade by a family member. eventually she was pulled out of school and trafficked full time when she was in sixth grade. her life became a prison. she was chained to a bed in a warehouse. she endured regular beatings and, of course, she was sexually assaulted with regularity. she was even set on fire by one of her captors. all the while, she was forced to serve between 5 and 30 men every day. melissa has said that she wished she were dead. her story of her time in captivity is gut-wrenching and heartbreaking, but just as sad is the way she was treated once she escaped from her captors. as is the case with so many victims, melissa struggled for years to distance herself from her past. but instead of being treated as the victim she was, the criminal justice system actually treated her as the criminal. that is an all too common outcome for victims of trafficking, who are labeled as prostitutes and are left with few options but to return to the nightmare that so sadly exists in our country. that needs to change. that is why i am glad the senate is taking up the justice for victims of trafficking act, because this begins the process of making that important change. the bill helps law enforcement crack down on criminal trafficking rings and perpetrators of these crimes. instead of a slap on the wrist and a fine, the so-called johns--the demand side for this terrible trade--will be treated as the child rapists and the criminals they are. no longer are we just going to deal with the supply side. we are going to pay attention to the demand side too. critically, this bill takes fines from the perpetrators of these awful crimes and redirects them into a crime victims fund which will help people such as melissa and others get a fresh lease on life, to begin to heal and to get the help they so badly need in order to get on with their lives. this week we have a wonderful opportunity in the senate, in a town that is too often divided by ideology and partisanship, to do something together on a bipartisan basis that can help people such as melissa and the thousands of young girls like her waiting to be saved. all of us, republicans and democrats alike, are committed to working together to do everything we can to help these victims and to put an end to this abhorrent practice. this particular legislation we are taking up today passed unanimously out of the judiciary committee a few weeks ago. that doesn't happen very often, but it did for this legislation. more than 200 groups around the country--such as the naacp, the national center for missing and exploited children, rights4girls, the fraternal order of police, and the national conference of state legislatures--have all endorsed our work on this issue. i want to particularly thank some of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle who joined me on this effort: the senior senator from minnesota, ms. klobuchar, and the senior senator from oregon, mr. wyden. they have been great partners in this fight--not just this year but for many years. and there are many others. another great partner has been the junior senator from illinois, mr. kirk, who has worked for years to get antitrafficking legislation to the floor. he introduced a bill called the hero act which authorizes a program to recruit wounded, injured, and returning veterans and provides them with training in high-tech computer forensics and law enforcement skills to help fight child exploitation. i also want to acknowledge the great contribution of the junior senator from ohio, mr. portman, who has a bill called the bringing missing children home act, which improves the way cases of missing children are handled, strengthening law enforcement reporting and response procedures. both the hero act and the bringing missing children home act have been incorporated into the underlying bill, and i want to thank both of them for their efforts and willingness to work with us to make the justice for victims of trafficking act even stronger. i know there are members who are interested in offering amendments to this legislation. thanks to the majority leader, we are going to have an open process where anybody with a better idea who wants to add to this base of work that is contained in this bill will have the opportunity to do so, both offering amendments and seeking votes on those. this is a fight that sadly must be fought, but it is a fight we will win. when we do, we will finally have done our part to help deliver our nation's promise of freedom to those who are enslaved. the presiding officer. the senator from west virginia. making washington work for west virginia mrs. capito. mr. president, i rise today to deliver my maiden speech as a senator from west virginia. i am deeply humbled by the confidence placed in me by fellow west virginians. to serve as west virginia's first female senator is a true honor and one that comes with great responsibility. i hope to serve as an example for that next generation of west virginians, including my own grandchildren celia and charlie, and hopefully for many others. i find myself in a unique place in history, and i am grateful to and inspired by my own loving family, my husband charlie and our three children, charles, moore, and shelley, and their spouses. for 14 years i have proudly served the people of west virginia's second congressional district in the house of representatives. i bring that experience to the senate combined with a strong desire to make washington work for west virginia. west virginia has a time-honored history of exceptional senators, including my predecessors, senators jay rockefeller and robert c. byrd. i am appreciative of their efforts to better west virginia during their more than 80 years of combined public service in this great body. i am proud of our state's rich history, culture, and natural beauty. but it is our people that i hold dearest in my heart. west virginians are strong and resilient. we are the embodiment of our state's history. born of the civil war, west virginians fought for freedom in the face of great turmoil. as a result, president abraham lincoln signed the proclamation making west virginia the 35th state admitted to the union. today, our state's forceful motto, ``mountaineers are always free,'' remains emblazoned in latin on our state flag. we will never forget the principles on which our great state was founded. the mountain state is home to unmatched scenery and natural resources that can power our nation's economy. a state filled with small towns, main streets and tight knit communities, west virginians come together to solve problems and help neighbors in need. i have often said that west virginia is one big small town. west virginians expect the senate to find pragmatic solutions to the momentous problems confronting our [[page s1362]] country. that is particularly true now during this period of divided government. there are clear differences among the american people, and these differences are certainly reflected in the senate. west virginia is represented by both parties in the senate, and i look forward to continuing to work with my friend senator joe manchin in the months ahead, and i thank him for being here with me as a source of support today. together, i hope we can reinstate respect for the institution, a place where deliberation and debate are valued and all voices are heard. we owe it to the american people to do better. throughout my time in congress i have heard a clear and consistent message from west virginians: improve the economic opportunities for our state, stop the bickering, and fight for our jobs. as leader mcconnell has stated, to do this the senate must work more, have an open amendment process--which we are going to be having here in the next several days--and take the tough votes. after all, that is why we are here. today i will outline how i plan to produce bipartisan, commonsense solutions in the senate to make west virginia communities stronger. this plan will create economic opportunities by bridging the gap and tackling america's infrastructure crisis, better connecting west virginia and rural communities through increased broadband access, caring for our nation's veterans, and ensuring a bright future for young west virginians, and implementing a commonsense energy policy that utilizes our vast natural resources to provide affordable and reliable energy. first, addressing our country's crumbling infrastructure is an area that can bridge the partisan divide and further economic growth. american communities need a strong federal highway program and a full 6-year bill to meet the needs of our growing population, to ensure safety for travelers, and to offer opportunity for growth in areas that struggle economically. west virginians, like many across the nation, rely heavily on roads, bridges, and highway transit to fuel our economy, to access hard to reach areas in our state, to get to and from work, and to transport necessary goods and services. u.s. route 35 will drastically improve safety for residents in putnam and mason counties. corridor h will unleash the economic potential of our state's eastern highlands. u.s. route 340 will help address congestion in our eastern panhandle, and the coalfields expressway and the king coal highway can help isolated communities attract businesses and provide jobs. point pleasant's charles lanham, a well-respected gentleman, had a vision. with his friend jack fruth, they began a crusade for their community. for many years charles has worked to build the case for a 4-lane u.s. route 35, a project that will provide a secure route to school for our children and serve as a regional transportation artery between interstate 64 and the great lakes region. charles understands the economic and safety benefits the road provides and has fought for them. working with charles we have made significant progress on route 35, but all of our states need certainty to invest in our transportation infrastructure. that certainty comes with a long-term surface transportation reauthorization bill, which brings these projects to reality across the country. working together we can and we must achieve this goal. now is the time to move our transportation system forward. second, i am committed to expanding access to broadband in communities across west virginia, and i will be a champion for connecting our state. high-speed internet access is a pillar of our 21st century infrastructure and a gateway to growth in rural america. high-tech businesses can power our small communities. the world literally can be at your desktop. unfortunately, for all the potential opportunities that broadband can offer to rural america, not having this important service can place an almost insurmountable barrier to economic development, and there are many areas in my state and the leader's state that still do not have adequate access. these areas are at risk of being left behind. in capon bridge, wv, a lack of broadband access is an obstacle to attracting jobs and economic development. sadly, capon bridge is not unique in this regard. small communities across west virginia and elsewhere in rural america lack fundamental infrastructure and lack access to vital opportunities as a result. the answer for capon bridge is not a regulated internet. too much government control would be counterproductive, choking off private sector expansion projects and hindering new technologies. but we have to recognize that there is a role for government in helping broadband reach those hard-to-serve communities. we should leverage resources at all levels of government and encourage public-private partnerships to expand access to rural americans. this is a necessary and achievable goal. it may sound like a small desire, but connectivity is essential to compete and thrive. health care access is critically important to west virginians. we must continue to provide access to our veterans and to our children. west virginians have a strong history of service to our nation. these brave men and women have put themselves in harm's way to defend our freedoms. it is our solemn responsibility to care for them when they return home. these american heroes deserve the best possible treatment and top- notch mental health services. access to care can be especially challenging for our veterans who live in rural communities. many west virginia veterans must travel significant distances to get to a va hospital. in many cases, allowing veterans to receive treatment closer to home is more convenient for the patient and more efficient for the va. while we have made strides to improve access for our veterans, the current program is not working as well as it should. more must be done. expanded access to private medical providers will help improve the quality of care we offer to our veterans. our children in the mountain state also deserve quality health care. if our children, the next generation of leaders, are going to realize their potential, they must have a healthy foundation. a solid education and good health are pillars for success of future generations. as a parent and grandparent, this is personal. we must work together to continue funding the state children's health insurance program. i started my legislative career in the west virginia house of delegates where i served on the committee that first implemented the schip program in our state. today this program provides access to health care for tens of thousands of west virginia's children. maintaining this program is a priority i share with my predecessor, senator rockefeller, who was a tireless advocate for children's health insurance during his three decades of service in this body. i am encouraged that senators in both parties have recognized the importance of providing continued funding for the bipartisan schip program. finally, and of critical importance to the state of west virginia and the country, we need to work together to implement a commonsense energy policy. we need an affordable and reliable energy policy that utilizes our state's vast natural resources. we need a policy that grows the economy and creates new job opportunities. we need a policy that supports a strong middle class. we need a policy that ensures we continue to improve safety and our environment even as we expand energy production. the administration's overreach has contributed to thousands of coal miners losing their jobs in west virginia and our neighboring states, devastating--i can't overstate this enough--local communities and families. last year i met a recently laid off coal miner from raleigh county. after losing his job, his church came together to prepare meals for other coal miners and their families while they searched for work. neighbors helping neighbors--the west virginia way. this is a stark reminder of the impact misguided federal policies can have on the lives of real people. anti-coal policies impact more than miners and their families. in west virginia the attack on coal mines reduces [[page s1363]] revenues for education programs, roads, and other public services. higher utility prices caused by overregulation means fewer jobs in energy-intensive manufacturing. and sadly, lower income families and senior citizens who live on fixed incomes are disproportionately impacted by higher energy costs. as chairman of the subcommittee on clean air and nuclear safety, i will lead the fight against excessive government regulation that has been devastating my state. there are many areas of energy policy where we can find common ground. while the epa's proposed greenhouse gas standards are misguided, we should continue to make the use of fossil fuel cleaner and more efficient. we must continue to support important research at morgantown's national energy technology lab and other labs that allows us to make environmental progress even as we continue to use our natural resources. natural gas is a large and growing part of west virginia's economy. as a child of marshall county, which is the heart of the marcellus shale development in west virginia, i am delighted to see these communities come alive with opportunity. it is proof positive that an energy economy is a jobs economy. we need improved infrastructure in order to make full use of these gas reserves. we need new natural gas and oil pipelines that safely connect producing regions with manufacturers. we need new markets that can make use of these vital resources. we need a pro-exports policy that will benefit our country in multiple ways. the nation will see more jobs and investment, more security, and a more independent future, and at the same time we can strengthen our relationships with important allies overseas by providing them with the energy they need. these are just a few of the ideas i hope to refine and accomplish during my first term in the senate. notably, there are many other very important issues--such as national security, fiscal responsibility, a balanced budget, and replacement of the affordable care act--on which i will be focusing. our plate is full, and expectations are high, as they should be. we need to roll up our sleeves and deliver. i am optimistic that we can find solutions that move our country forward. there will be differences of opinion and philosophy along the way, but americans expect us to bridge those gaps. senator byrd, the longest serving senator, said it best: i love this senate. i love it dearly. i love the senate for its rules. i love the senate for its precedence. i love the senate for the difference that it can make in people's lives. fighting for west virginians always has been and always will be my top priority. i am honored--i can't overstate that--to represent the great people of the mountain state as we strive to create a strong and prosperous future. now is the time for washington to work for west virginia, and i stand ready to do my part. the presiding officer. the majority leader. congratulating the senator from west virginia mr. mcconnell. mr. president, i wish to say to our new senator from west virginia what an outstanding speech not only for her state but the way forward for our country, and i congratulate her for an outstanding set of comments. the presiding officer. the senior senator from west virginia. mr. manchin. mr. president, i also wish to congratulate my colleague from west virginia. we spoke earlier about how she and i can show the way to have a better relationship-building effort here in the senate by working together in order to better serve the people of west virginia and also the country. i congratulate my colleague on her great speech and look forward to working with her. i think she has done a great job for the people of west virginia, and i again thank the senator. the presiding officer. the senator from virginia. tackling national security questions mr. kaine. mr. president, i rise to address a question to myself and every member of this body, and the question is a serious one: is the senate capable of tackling challenging national security questions in a mature and responsible way? we have many hard national security challenges before us now. three of those challenges are urgent: the discussions about a potential nuclear deal with iran, the discussions in this body about military action by the united states against isil, and the deliberations that will take place this month about the american budget, which will determine whether we have the resources we need to meet our security challenges. we have to show the american public--and i would argue the world--that we can give these issues the careful consideration they deserve, but i am forced to admit that recent events have caused me to have some significant doubts about our institutional capacity to tackle these issues in a responsible way. we recently--at the end of february--ran up to the very brink of shutting down the department of homeland security at a time when terrorist threats and other threats to our homeland security are so obvious on our borders and throughout the world. thank goodness, after a week's extension of funding for homeland security, we pulled back from the brink. but that did not lead to an increase in confidence in this body, that congress would contemplate not funding the department of homeland security. last week there was a joint address to congress by prime minister netanyahu. i spent many hours conversing with prime minister netanyahu in his office about iran and other topics, but i am sad to look at that joint address and basically say it was history-making in some unfortunate ways. congress has heard from the prime minister or president of israel seven times in the last 50 years--eight times if you count last week. last week's address was unusual because it was designed in a partisan way. it was an invitation by the leadership of one party with an intentional decision not to let the white house know, not to let the minority party in congress know, and to schedule the speech days before a contested foreign election, leading many to conclude that it was an effort by congress to affect a foreign election, which we should never do. following that speech, a carefully worked bipartisan bill that has been introduced in congress to give congress an appropriate review role over any potential iranian nuclear deal was basically hijacked. instead of allowing the bill to go through congress, there was a decision to force the bill to the floor for an immediate vote, which was seen by all as a partisan move. it was described by one of the republican sponsors of the bill as an effort to embarrass democrats. thank goodness that at the end of the day that effort to accelerate consideration of what was a bipartisan bill was pulled back, and we will not be doing that this week. we will be allowing a normal committee process. but the fact that the effort was made did damage to reasonable bipartisan consideration of this important issue. then yesterday we all awoke to the news that there had been a partisan letter signed by 47 senators--47 of my colleagues, many of whom i work with very closely--not to the president saying ``we have concerns about a deal, and we are going to weigh in'' but instead to the leader of a nation that we characterize as a terrorist state. this letter presumed to instruct the nation about what congress might or might not do. the letter was widely viewed as an effort to undercut or dilute diplomatic negotiations that are in the best tradition of our country, the notion of diplomacy. i just came from hearings this morning in the armed services committee where we heard what we have heard for 2\1/2\ years: advice from our military leadership to the senate that sequester is hurting our national defense. will you finally listen to us? will you do something about it? all of these events over the last few weeks when taken together suggest the sad possibility of a senate that will elevate partisan political division over careful and constructive deliberation, even on the most critical security issues that affect the security of our country and the world. i deeply believe that this body--the senate and congress generally--has to pull back from the brink of irresponsible and partisan action with respect to these critical security questions because the stakes are simply too high. [[page s1364]] with respect to the iranian nuclear negotiation, i share many of the concerns of my 47 colleagues who wrote the letter. i share many of the concerns of the prime minister that were shared in his speech last week. but i deeply believe we should not try to tank a deal, critique a deal, or undercut a deal before there is a deal because to the extent there are efforts to stand and say this is a bad deal before there is a deal, the message that is communicated to the american public and to the world is: we will never accept any deal. we are not interested in diplomacy. we are not interested in negotiation. that attitude plays directly into the hands of the nation of iran, which is currently engaging in terrorist activity. they want to be able to blame the absence of any deal on an intransigent united states that is unwilling to negotiate in good faith. we should not tank a deal before there is a deal. instead, why don't we do what we are supposed to do as the greatest deliberative body in the world? why don't we allow negotiators who have been working in the best traditions of american diplomacy to see if they can find a deal and then put it on the table for the review of congress, as has always been contemplated? i am a proud original cosponsor and worked on the draftsmanship of a bipartisan bill that was introduced under the key sponsorship of foreign relations chair senator corker and ranking member senator menendez to guarantee to congress an appropriate review of any final deal with iran over their nuclear program if such a deal was reached. this is a bill which is rigorously bipartisan--not partisan, not political, not rushed, not accelerated, but rigorously bipartisan. it respects the ongoing process by allowing the negotiators to do their work and see if they can find an outcome. it guarantees congress a debate and vote if a deal includes relief under the congressional sanctions congress has enacted over the years. it is appropriately deferential to the executive, allowing the executive the flexibility to do sanctions relief under executive or international sanctions that have not been part of any congressional statute. this is a bipartisan bill which provides some assurance to allies. our allies in the region--allies that are most affected by the iranian nuclear ambitions are not part of the p5+1, whether you are talking about israel or gulf state nations or jordan. the nations most affected by iranian nuclear ambitions are not part of the p5+1, and the corker- menendez bill would give them some comfort that a deal, if announced, would receive some careful scrutiny in this body. finally, i believe the corker-menendez bipartisan approach even provides some important assurances to iran in the negotiation. we want iran to make not small concessions, we want them to make big and bold concessions and give up any intent to develop nuclear weapons. but what is the likelihood that iran will make those concessions if they have no knowledge about what congress's intent is vis-a-vis the congressional statutory provisions? there is a right way and a wrong way to approach these matters. to rush it, to label a deal as a bad deal before there is a deal, to make it entirely partisan rather than bipartisan, reflecting the will of the body, is an effort to undercut negotiations that weakens our president, weakens our country, and weakens our credibility; whereas if we proceed in a bipartisan way, we can make the deal stronger. similarly--and then i wish to cede the moment to my colleague, the senator from maine--we are about to start work on another critically important issue--whether congress should finally, after 7-plus months, have a debate to authorize an ongoing war against the islamic state in the levant that was begun on august 8 by the president. we are now in the eighth month of a unilateral war, and aside from a foreign relations committee vote in committee in december, congress has not had a meaningful vote or debate on this fundamental responsibility. we owe it to ourselves and to this institution, we owe it to the important national security interests at stake, and especially we owe it to the people who are risking their lives in this war--and we have already had deaths of american servicemembers as part of operation inherent resolve--we owe it to them to show we can have a meaningful debate that is not partisan, that is not rushed, but that is careful and deliberate. they have been waiting for 7-plus months to see whether congress even cares. we are at war by a presidential act. does congress even care enough to have the debate on the floor of the senate and in the house of representatives? is it just partisanship now? is it just delay now? does the fact our service men and women are risking their lives even matter to us now? this is the debate we will be entering into within the next few days, starting with the hearing in the senate foreign relations committee tomorrow. we can't afford, on important issues of national security such as iran or such as the war against isil, to send the impression to our troops, to our citizens, to our global citizens around the world, that on these important matters congress is now just a partisan sort of sideshow rather than the deliberative body we were set up to be. we have to find a bipartisan path forward on these important security issues or we weaken confidence in this institution and in the leadership of this country. in conclusion, the national security interests that are at stake right now before us are fundamental, whether it is about iran, whether it is about the battle against isil, or whether it is about the budgetary deliberations we will be undertaking this month--a budgetary deliberation that will determine whether we can meet our commitments in these national security challenges. we have to get these debates right for the good of our country and the world, and we have to get them right to demonstrate to all that this institution does have the maturity to tackle these issues in a reasonable way. with that, i yield the last minute or so of my time to my colleague from maine, senator king. the presiding officer (mr. cruz). the senator from maine. mr. king. mr. president, there is little i can add to the remarks of the senator from virginia on this issue. i think this institution is being tested this week, this month, and over the next several months in a way that is really somewhat new. the test, the question, is: can we deal with the most serious of issues facing this country and the world in a responsible, reasonable, and, yes, bipartisan, nonpartisan way? i also worked with bob corker, senator kaine, and the whole group that worked on putting together--senator menendez--a bipartisan bill to provide congress a role in the approval of whatever deal is struck with iran. i believe congress should have that role. but in those discussions, my concern was that some of our members will not be able to resist the temptation to politicize and make a partisan issue--even this grave issue of war and peace, this grave issue that faces this country and the entire world--of the possibility of a regime such as that in iran achieving nuclear weapons. this is not an ideological debate. this is a serious debate about the future of this country. this is one of the most serious negotiations of our adult lives. i want congress to have a role, but i want it to play that role weighing the merits, pro or con, the actual materials that are in the treaty--in the agreement. i want us to have that role, but i want to be sure we can respond to that in a responsible way. frankly, the actions of the last few days have shaken that confidence, because we have seen what appears to be an effort to gain political and partisan advantage from this gravest of national issues. i understand there are differences about what the deal should look like and what the terms should be. that is ok. that is what we should be discussing. but to turn this into a partisan issue i think does a grave disservice to this entire country, and to undercut the president in the last stages of the negotiation to me is unprecedented and unthinkable. i was a young man at the time of the cuban missile crisis. i cannot imagine the congress of the united states writing a letter to kruschev in the midst of those discussions and saying, don't worry about this guy kennedy, he doesn't speak for the country. yet that essentially is what took place yesterday. i don't understand the need or the [[page s1365]] helpfulness of such a statement at a time when we were already moving toward a bipartisan--i believe probably veto-proof--bill to provide this institution with a check on the quality of the deal that is being struck. it is not productive or helpful to turn issues of this kind into partisan issues. i hope we can step back from this partisan posture and meet this solemn responsibility to assess what the president and the administration and the other five countries--the agreement they come to with iran--to determine whether, indeed, it is in the best interests of the region and the world. that is our responsibility. i hope we can muster the ability to meet that responsibility in a serious way and not, for once, turn it into a partisan issue. thank you, mr. president. i yield the floor. the presiding officer. the senator from maryland. tribute to federal employees dr. francis collins, dr. nancy sullivan, and dr. william gahl mr. cardin. mr. president, i wish to take a few moments today to speak about federal workers in general and some of the people at the national institutes of health in particular. government workers guard our borders, protect us from terrorists, treat our wounded veterans, dispense social security checks to our retirees, find cures for diseases, guide the nation's air traffic, explore the tiniest particles and the vast expanse of outer space, ensure our air is safe to breathe, our water is safe to drink, our food is safe to eat, support our service men and women in harm's way, and promote our interests and ideals abroad. for whom does the government work? government works for america. the washington post recently reported that since reliable data first became available shortly before world war ii, the percentage of all employed people working for the federal government hit an all-time low in december. fewer than 2 percent of the total u.s. workforce is employed by the federal government. over nearly the past half century, from 1966 to 2012--the most recent year for which comparable data is available--the number of federal workers in the executive branch dropped by 83,000. during that time, the u.s. population increased from under 200 million to over 300 million people and the gross domestic product nearly quadrupled. we can argue over whether we want bigger government or smaller government, but we should all agree we want better government. we can't have better government when federal workers are constantly under assault. we need to stop treating the federal workforce like a rented mule. we need to treat the federal workforce like the critical asset it is. a 2011 report by the national academy of public administration and the kettering foundation concluded that programs operated by civil servants receive ``significantly higher'' scores for management and effectiveness than those run by ``grant- and contract-based third parties.'' i think part of the problem is that americans have come to accept that federal workers are nameless, faceless bureaucrats. they aren't. they are people who are patriotic americans and dedicated to public service. they have families and support their communities. they have been asked to do more and more with less and less while being subjected to pay freezes, sequestration-related furloughs, government shutdowns, and threats to their benefits. they have contributed $150 billion to deficit reduction while still working hard on behalf of all americans. today, as i mentioned, i wish to focus on the federal workers at the national institutes of health. i wish to introduce my colleagues and all americans to a few of the federal workers who are making life better for all of us. but first a description of the nih so people can understand its mission. i can sum up its mission in two words: saving lives. the nih is the world's premier biomedical and health-related research facility. its job is to perform and fund the research that helps improve the nation's health--a job it has carried out for over a century. i am proud the nih is headquartered in maryland, but it is important to understand that nih support of medical research at other research institutions has created jobs and fostered economic growth in each and every state, while establishing and maintaining the united states as the global leader in the life sciences. nih-supported research added $69 billion to our gdp and supported 7 million jobs in 2011 alone. in the weeks and months ahead, congress and the administration will have to decide whether they have to replace sequestration with a more logical, coherent, strategic, and responsible form of budgeting. while we will have disagreements over the details, if anyone needs to be convinced about the value of replacing sequestration, look no further than the situation at nih. funding constraints there not only cost people their jobs, they are costing people their lives. nih funding has multiple drivers, but comparing the fiscal year 2013 figures with the fiscal year 2012 figures, largely because of sequestration, approximately 640 fewer competitive research project grants were issued and approximately 750 fewer new patients were admitted to the nih clinical center. each these affects a person's life. each of these has consequences when we do not move forward as we should. a recent survey determined that nearly 20 percent of the biomedical scientists have considered leaving the united states due to sequestration. we are losing our best. nearly one-half of the scientists surveyed said they have laid off staff in their laboratories or are considering laying off staff due to losing nih grants. more than 50 percent of the researchers say they have colleagues who have lost his or her job. what is the impact? delays in lifesaving medical progress. medical breakthroughs do not happen overnight. in almost all instances, breakthrough discoveries result from years of incremental research to understand how diseases start and progress. cuts to research are delaying progress in medical breakthroughs, including developing better cancer drugs that zero in on a tumor with fewer side effects; research on a universal flu vaccine that could fight every strain of influenza without needing a yearly shot; preventing debilitating chronic conditions that are costly to society and delay development of more effective treatments for common and rare diseases affecting millions of americans. nih director dr. francis collins recently wrote the column ``exceptional opportunities in medical science'' in which he describes the excitement over ``personalized medicine,'' the brain initiative, and development of the ebola vaccine. he has also shared his concern about the budget challenges nih faces. let me quote from dr. collins: although all of these ambitious scientific endeavors offer exceptional promise for advancing human health, the effect that unprecedented budget pressures are having on biomedical research cannot be ignored. due to inflation, the nih budget has lost almost 25 percent of its purchasing power over the last decade. the decline has had important consequences. the nih once funded one in three research proposals, but now only has enough resources to support one in six. as a result, a great deal of excellent science is being left unfunded. last october dr. collins stated that cuts in federal funding slowed the development of vaccines and therapies for the deadly ebola virus, saying: ``frankly, if we had not gone through our 10-year slide in research support, we probably would have had a vaccine in time for this that would have gone through clinical trials and would have been ready.'' think about the lives that could have been saved. to americans who wonder what their tax dollars do--well, some go to nih to find treatments and cures for cancer, depression, arthritis, substance abuse, addiction, diabetes, and alzheimer's disease. to date, 145 nih-supported researchers have received or shared 85 nobel prizes. not everyone wins a nobel prize, so let me talk about people who aren't in the spotlight--people some of our colleagues might refer to as ``nameless, faceless bureaucrats.'' i will highlight the work of two of them today who are making a tremendous contribution as public servants. dr. nancy sullivan, chief of the vaccine research center, has been working on an ebola vaccine for nearly two decades, dating back to when she was an investigator at the university of michigan with the then-nih grantee [[page s1366]] and now former director, dr. gary nabel. most vaccines spur production of a person's immune system's antibodies that block a virus from entering the cells, but that approach doesn't work for ebola. gene-based vaccines can induce additional virus fighters called t- cells, so that is what dr. sullivan created, using pieces of ebola genetic material. it is the most promising approach yet, and it is being tested in the parts of west africa that have been hit the hardest with ebola, where more than 9,000 people have died. the concept for dr. sullivan's vaccine has been 16 years in the making, beginning back when few people outside the global infectious disease community had even heard of the deadly disease. over the years, dr. sullivan and her team continued to tweak her ideas, constantly improving on them. eventually she followed dr. nabel to nih. many experts in the vaccine research community had begun to believe ebola was insurmountable. they thought it was too aggressive for a vaccine to ever protect against it. but dr. sullivan never lost heart that her work would one day prove successful. the ebola virus infection is a highly lethal disease for which there are no effective therapeutic or preventive treatments. consequently, work with these viruses requires highly specialized bsl-4 containment labs--the highest biosafety labs. dr. sullivan is a leader in the field and has personally conducted many of the most critical experiments. her work on immunology and vaccine development is widely considered as some of the very best in the field. in spite of the difficulties associated with access to bsl-4 labs, her work has consistently been the source of novel observations. dr. sullivan received her ph.d. in cell biology from harvard university in 1997. she received her master of science in environmental engineering in 1989, also from harvard university. i brought a poster to the floor where we see president obama visited nih to personally congratulate dr. sullivan for her incredible work on behalf of world health. some people may be familiar with the tv show ``house.'' the main character, dr. gregory house, is brilliant at diagnosing conditions and illnesses that baffle everyone else. the real-life dr. house is dr. william gahl, the founding director of the undiagnosed diseases program at nih. he is america's leading medical detective, a physician dedicated to finding answers for long-suffering patients with mysterious illnesses that long eluded diagnosis. dr. gahl has brought together a unique combination of elite medical specialists, researchers, and federal resources to solve baffling illnesses and provide desperate patients and their families with information and possible solutions and treatments for their often life-threatening ailments. results include diagnosis and treatment of diseases so rare they don't even have names, plus new genetic discoveries, improved disease management, and the advancement of medical knowledge. nih director dr. collins said the undiagnosed diseases program, which dr. gahl conceived and started, serves as a kind of court of last resort for patients without a diagnosis. dr. gahl has convinced some of the best, brightest, and busiest physicians to participate, and has devoted tremendous energy to examining patient records, selecting cases for in- depth analysis, and helping people who are seriously ill. under dr. gahl's stewardship, the program regularly involves a collective effort by more than 25 attending physicians of different specialties. the cooperation by a diverse group of experts has helped create a coherent view of each patient instead of the organ-by-organ orientation taken by most specialists. patients are brought to the nih campus in bethesda for an intensive week. they meet with a parade of specialists who study their medical histories, perform thorough exams, and take numerous tests. the doctors then meet to discuss what they have seen, discovered, or may have missed. they also debate various theories, trying to connect the dots, and come up with a possible diagnosis and treatment. scientists working with dr. gahl discovered the genetic cause of a vascular disorder not previously identified in the medical literature. the rare condition, identified in nine individuals, arises in adulthood and causes arterial calcification in the hands and feet, but does not affect arteries in the heart. the symptoms include acute pain after walking more than a short distance. the disorder previously baffled the medical field and evaded diagnosis when conventional methods were used. in another instance, physicians working with dr. gahl identified the reason why a woman's muscles had grown painfully large and hard underneath her skin, making it increasingly difficult for her to perform daily activities. this turned out to be an extremely rare, generally fatal complication of multiple myeloma, and the diagnosis by the nih undiagnosed diseases program resulted in a stem cell bone marrow transplant that allows her to lead a normal life. these are people who had no hope, no hope at all. they came to nih, and they have gotten government-supported help to give them hope and to give them life. dr. gahl earned his b.s. in biology from the massachusetts institute of technology in 1972 and his m.d. from the university of wisconsin in 1976. he obtained a ph.d. degree in oncology research from wisconsin's mcardle laboratory for cancer research in 1981. he has published more than 350 peer-reviewed papers and trained 36 biochemical geneticists. dr. gahl has made a number of seminal discoveries regarding rare diseases during his career. he said deciding who to admit into the undiagnosed diseases program is always very difficult and much like triage on the battlefield. you have to make decisions about where you think you can do some good. the undiagnosed diseases program serves people who feel helpless, have suffered greatly, have waited many years for answers, and must be treated with respect and attention. according to dr. gahl, the nih caregivers understand the desperation the patients and their families feel and try to balance the difficulty finding solutions with a realistic measure of hope. dr. john gallin, director of the nih clinical center, said dr. gahl takes cases after everyone else has given up. he said that in a short time the program has developed new approaches for investigating, understanding, and diagnosing rare disorders, and has added to the body of medical knowledge. as dr. gallin put it, as a result of the nih undiagnosed diseases program, the language of medicine is changing. the different specialists working together now are beginning to find common ways. nancy sullivan and bill gahl are just two of the dedicated people who work in the federal government. they are not nameless, faceless bureaucrats. they are dedicated, hard-working americans trying to make life better for all of us under difficult circumstances. at a minimum, they deserve our gratitude and respect. they also deserve

CREC-2015-03-10-pt1-PgS1345,CREC-2015-03-10,114,PROTECTING STUDENTS FROM SEXUAL AND VIOLENT PREDATORS ACT,"[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 40 (Tuesday, March 10, 2015)] [Senate] [Pages S1345-S1347] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] PROTECTING STUDENTS FROM SEXUAL AND VIOLENT PREDATORS ACT Mr. TOOMEY. Mr. President, I rise to speak on S. 474, the Protecting Students from Sexual and Violent Predators Act. This is a bipartisan bill. It is a bill I introduced with Senator Joe Manchin in the last Congress, and we recently reintroduced this bill. We also intend to offer this bill as an amendment to the Justice for Victims of Trafficking Act that the Senator from South Dakota was just discussing. This is a bill which provides some crucial protections to our children, and I am proud to be a cosponsor of this underlying bill. I am confident it is going to pass, and I certainly hope it will pass with our amendment. The bipartisan amendment I will be introducing, the Protecting Students from Sexual and Violent Predators Act, amends the underlying bill to protect even more children. That is what it does. It provides specific protections against convicted child molesters infiltrating our schools. I will say up front that I fully recognize that the vast majority of school employees would never consider sexually or violently abusing the children in their care. We all understand that, but we also understand that there are pedophiles in this country and they seek out vulnerable children. That is what they do. They know the kids are concentrated in schools with no parents around, and that is what we have to protect these kids against. I have been fighting for this for over a year now--together with Senator Manchin and others--and I will not stop fighting until we get this done. I have three very personal reasons that this fight is one I have taken on and I will continue with, and the personal reasons are my own kids. They are 14, 13, and almost 5 years old. I need to know, just as every parent needs to know, that when we put our child on a schoolbus that child is going somewhere where they are going to be safe, they are going to be protected, and they are not going to be victims, they are not going to fall prey to some of the very people who are supposed to be looking after them. Unfortunately, for too many kids that is not true today, as is the story of one particular child who inspired this legislation. For a child named Jeremy Bell, the story begins in Delaware County, PA. One of the schoolteachers there molested several boys and raped one. Prosecutors decided they didn't have enough evidence to bring a case against this monster. The school knew what was going on, so they decided to dismiss the teacher for sexually abusing his students, but then, appallingly, the school decided to make sure he went off and became someone else's problem. The Pennsylvania school wrote a letter of recommendation for that teacher, who took that letter of recommendation and brought it to the school he applied to work at in West Virginia. He got hired, and over time he became the principal. Well, these kinds of pedophiles do not change their ways, and he didn't change his ways in West Virginia. He continued to prey on kids. Eventually, he raped and then murdered a 12- year-old boy named Jeremy Bell. Justice eventually caught up with the killer, and he is now serving a life sentence for that murder. But for little Jeremy Bell that justice came too late. And, sadly, Jeremy Bell is not alone. Last year we had 459 school employees across America arrested for sexual misconduct with the very children they are supposed to be protecting and teaching and caring for. That is more than one per day. And those are just the ones where there was enough evidence to actually prosecute, to make an arrest and to pursue charges. How many others were getting away with this? Frankly, 2015 is not off to a much better start. So far we are 69 days into the new year and there have already been 82 school employees arrested across the country for sexual misconduct with the schoolchildren in their care. These are not just statistics. These are not just numbers on a page. These are children's lives, every single one of them; such as the little girl whose sexual abuse began at age 10 and only ended when at age 17 she found herself pregnant with the teacher's child; a teacher's aide who raped a young mentally disabled boy in his care; a kindergarten teacher who kept a child during recess and forced her to perform sexual acts on him. It is hard to even talk about these changes, but they are happening-- one school employee after another caught with child pornography. Sometimes these images are of kids who are just 1 year old. This is unbelievable. It is outrageous. But it is happening. We in Congress have to do what we can to stop this, and we can do something. The Toomey-Manchin protecting students bill takes an important step in the direction of stopping these outrageous acts, and it does so by relying on two mechanisms to accomplish this. The first mechanism is to require schools to do appropriate criminal background checks so we are not knowingly hiring pedophiles in our schools; and the second is to ban this terrible practice by which schools knowingly send a letter of recommendation for [[Page S1346]] one of these creeps to go somewhere else. They are recommending them so they become someone else's problem. Neither of these mechanisms should be controversial. The House of Representatives unanimously passed a bill in the last Congress that has both of these mechanisms. I am proud of the fact we have three former House Members who voted for this bill last year who are now cosponsors of our legislation, including the junior Senator from West Virginia, from Colorado, and from Arkansas. I appreciate their support for this commonsense legislation. Furthermore, a few months ago, every Member of the House and Senate except one voted for even more expansive background checks when we all voted in favor of the Child Care Development Block Grant bill. The combined vote in the House and Senate was 523 to 1. This is not controversial stuff. So what would we actually do? What does the legislation accomplish? No. 1, criminal background checks. Every State has some kind of criminal background check now, that is true, but it is pretty obvious that many of them are not adequate. For instance, too often there are whole categories of school employees who are not covered by the criminal background check, and too often States don't check all of the criminal databases that are available to them, and so these pedophiles are slipping through the cracks. The protecting students act requires a school district that wants to take Federal funds to pay its teachers' salaries to perform background checks on all the workers who have unsupervised contact with the children. That would include new hires and existing hires. Another reality is that many States have only recently adopted these background checks. They have hired employees prior to the legislation requiring the criminal background checks, and some of these employees have this kind of criminal background. Take the case of William Vahey, 64 years old. He taught for decades at some of the world's most elite schools. He started in California and then started working his way across the country. Do you know what he used to do? He used to give his young students Oreo cookies laced with sleeping pills, and when the boys fell asleep he molested them and he photographed it. Scores of children were sexually abused. This teacher had been convicted for sexual abuse of children when he was in his twenties, but these school districts weren't doing a thorough background check so they weren't discovering these things. Well, the protecting students act ensures sex offenders such as William Vahey will not fall through the cracks. They will be discovered by a more thorough and rigorous background check system that our bill requires. I should also point out our bill--the protecting students act-- requires the schools to do the criminal background checks not just for teachers but for contractors as well--some schoolbus drivers, coaches, substitute teachers, anyone who comes in unsupervised contact with the kids. There are currently 12 States that have no such requirement at all. They do not check on the backgrounds of their contractors, despite the fact these folks come in regular contact with kids. Case in point: In Montana, parents got a very rude awakening recently. An audit of Montana's schoolbus drivers found they have 123 drivers with criminal histories, including one driver whose conviction landed him on the Sexual and Violent Offender Registry and one with an outstanding arrest warrant. Running these background checks on school workers is only going to be helpful if it is thorough, if it is adequate. So what the Toomey- Manchin bill does is it requires the background check include all four of the major crime databases that are available. There is the FBI fingerprint database, the National Sex Offender Registry, the State criminal registry in each State, and the State Child Abuse and Neglect Registry. This past August parents in Alaska learned that Alaska has an inadequate background check system, and it resulted in a known child rapist teaching in Alaska schools for 4 years. This is unbelievable, but this is what is happening. On August 29, Alaska State troopers arrested a middle school teacher in Kiana, AK. The teacher had fled Missouri 4 years earlier in order to escape an arrest warrant. Multiple witnesses accused the teacher over a decade of sexual and physical abuse of his own adopted children. He had raped and starved these children--his own children. This is unbelievable. The children literally had to burrow a hole in the wall and steal frozen food and warm it up, heat it on a furnace, just to survive. This monster was able to leave the State and obtain a teaching job in Alaska for 4 years. When asked how in the world this could happen, the Department of Education of Alaska explained: Well, the Alaska background checks looked at the State criminal registry but not the Federal registry. So they had no idea he was a wanton, despicable criminal and had such a record in other States. Had our bill been in force, Alaska would have been required to check the Federal registry. They would have discovered this before ever hiring this monster. This is the first part of our bill--this requirement we have these background checks. And again, there is nothing controversial here. The House of Representatives passed more expansive language unanimously in the last Congress. And a few months ago, as I mentioned, we had a combined House and Senate vote of 523 votes in favor and 1 vote in opposition to the Child Care Development Block Grant Act which imposes appropriate and rigorous background checks on those caring for our kids in daycare. That makes perfect sense. We should be screening out pedophiles from working in our daycares, but we also should be providing the same level of protection to kids who are a little bit older, who are in grade school or middle school or high school. There is a second part to our legislation, and it addresses this outrageous practice of what is known as passing the trash. This is that unbelievable act that resulted in the death of Jeremy Bell, when a letter of recommendation allowed a known pedophile to be employed in West Virginia. Our bill simply says if a State wants to receive Federal taxpayer money, it can't knowingly help a child molester get a job somewhere else. How can this even be controversial? But the fact is this is an all too prevalent practice, and it is long past time we do something about this. Two weeks ago, WUSA News 9 reported some shocking news on the public school system of Montgomery County, MD. Since 2011, 21 Montgomery County public school employees or contract workers have been investigated for child sex abuse or exploitation. The news station learned that the Montgomery County public school system ``keeps a confidential database of personnel who demonstrate inappropriate or suspicious behavior towards children.'' This school system has this watch list of suspected abusers who are working in the area's schools, and WUSA 9 learned the school system had a record, a known record, of passing the trash. For example, elementary school teacher Daniel Picca had been abusing children for 17 years. The school system knew about it. What did they do? The teacher's punishment was to move him from one elementary school to another, again and again and again. There was 17 years of passing a known child molester from 1 school to another. How many kids did he victimize? This has to stop. It is long overdue we do something about this, and there is a way we can. We can make it illegal to knowingly recommend a pedophile for employment somewhere else. That is what our bill does. Another example: Recently, in Las Vegas, NV, a kindergarten teacher was arrested for kidnapping a 16-year-old girl and infecting her with a sexually transmitted disease. This same teacher had molested six children--all fourth and fifth graders--several years before, but he did it in the Los Angeles school district. While the Los Angeles school district knew about the allegations in 2009, the school district recommended settling a lawsuit that alleged the teacher had molested these children. The Nevada school district specifically asked: Have there been any criminal concerns regarding this teacher? The Los Angeles school district didn't only hide the truth, they provided three letters of recommendation--three references--for this teacher. [[Page S1347]] Now for those people who say: Well, the States can fix this problem all on their own, I ask you: What could Nevada do to protect itself from what teachers or school districts are doing in Los Angeles? What could West Virginia have done about a Pennsylvania school district that sent a teacher across the State line with a letter of recommendation? There is nothing one State can do to bind another State. This requires a Federal solution. Let me sum this up. The Toomey-Manchin bill offers a very simple proposition. If a school district wants to use Federal tax dollars to hire school employees, it has to make sure they are not hiring pedophiles in the process. I think that is pretty reasonable. Specifically, they need to perform background checks on any worker who comes in unsupervised contact with children, and they need to stop passing the trash. I can't believe this is even controversial. There is nobody who can stand here and say protections against child sex predators are not urgently needed, not in light of the daily revelations we are discovering. Again, this legislation has overwhelming bipartisan support. It passed the House unanimously. How many bills pass the House unanimously these days? This did. And every Member of the House and Senate except one voted for even more extensive background checks to protect our youngest kids in childcare. Can't we provide the same protection to slightly older kids? The legislation has been endorsed by innumerable child advocate and law enforcement groups, including the National Children's Alliance, which accredits and represents the Nation's 777 child advocacy centers. Yet I am afraid we are probably going to have some opposition voiced about this legislation when we offer the amendment. Let me be clear. First, we are not opposing a mandate on the States. We don't have the legal authority to do that. What we are simply saying is if States want to take Federal funds, they need to protect children from violent and sexual predators. If States don't want to take those measures, then they can choose not to take Federal funds. If a State has no interest in having a rigorous system for protecting kids, well, that is their decision, but we don't have to send Federal tax dollars to pay the salaries of pedophiles. Let me conclude. This is a commonsense bill. It is long overdue. It has very broad bipartisan support. It passed the House unanimously. As I said, in this body, all but one Member voted for an even more expansive background check. Several Senators have voiced some specific concerns, and I am working with several of them. I am willing to work with Senators who want to find ways to constructively improve this bill, but I am not going to support a bill that waters down our ability to protect our kids from pedophiles in school. I hope this body will overwhelmingly adopt the legislation that passed the House unanimously, and we can begin to have a more thorough and effective process of protecting our kids. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida. Mr. NELSON. Is my understanding correct that it is the time for the minority? The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct. There is 24 minutes remaining. Mr. NELSON.

We all understand that, but we also understand that there are pedophiles in this country and they seek out vulnerable children. That is what they do. They know the kids are concentrated in schools with no parents around, and that is what we have to protect these kids against. I have been fighting for this for over a year now--together with Senator Manchin and others--and I will not stop fighting until we get this done. I have three very personal reasons that this fight is one I have taken on and I will continue with, and the personal reasons are my own kids. They are 14, 13, and almost 5 years old. I need to know, just as every parent needs to know, that when we put our child on a schoolbus that child is going somewhere where they are going to be safe, they are going to be protected, and they are not going to be victims, they are not going to fall prey to some of the very people who are supposed to be looking after them. Unfortunately, for too many kids that is not true today, as is the story of one particular child who inspired this legislation. For a child named Jeremy Bell, the story begins in Delaware County, PA. One of the schoolteachers there molested several boys and raped one. Prosecutors decided they didn't have enough evidence to bring a case against this monster. The school knew what was going on, so they decided to dismiss the teacher for sexually abusing his students, but then, appallingly, the school decided to make sure he went off and became someone else's problem. The Pennsylvania school wrote a letter of recommendation for that teacher, who took that letter of recommendation and brought it to the school he applied to work at in West Virginia. He got hired, and over time he became the principal. Well, these kinds of pedophiles do not change their ways, and he didn't change his ways in West Virginia. He continued to prey on kids. Eventually, he raped and then murdered a 12- year-old boy named Jeremy Bell. Justice eventually caught up with the killer, and he is now serving a life sentence for that murder. But for little Jeremy Bell that justice came too late. And, sadly, Jeremy Bell is not alone. Last year we had 459 school employees across America arrested for sexual misconduct with the very children they are supposed to be protecting and teaching and caring for. That is more than one per day. And those are just the ones where there was enough evidence to actually prosecute, to make an arrest and to pursue charges. How many others were getting away with this? Frankly, 2015 is not off to a much better start. So far we are 69 days into the new year and there have already been 82 school employees arrested across the country for sexual misconduct with the schoolchildren in their care. These are not just statistics. These are not just numbers on a page. These are children's lives, every single one of them; such as the little girl whose sexual abuse began at age 10 and only ended when at age 17 she found herself pregnant with the teacher's child; a teacher's aide who raped a young mentally disabled boy in his care; a kindergarten teacher who kept a child during recess and forced her to perform sexual acts on him. It is hard to even talk about these changes, but they are happening-- one school employee after another caught with child pornography. Sometimes these images are of kids who are just 1 year old. This is unbelievable. It is outrageous. But it is happening. We in Congress have to do what we can to stop this, and we can do something. The Toomey-Manchin protecting students bill takes an important step in the direction of stopping these outrageous acts, and it does so by relying on two mechanisms to accomplish this. The first mechanism is to require schools to do appropriate criminal background checks so we are not knowingly hiring pedophiles in our schools; and the second is to ban this terrible practice by which schools knowingly send a letter of recommendation for [[Page S1346]] one of these creeps to go somewhere else. They are recommending them so they become someone else's problem. Neither of these mechanisms should be controversial. The House of Representatives unanimously passed a bill in the last Congress that has both of these mechanisms. I am proud of the fact we have three former House Members who voted for this bill last year who are now cosponsors of our legislation, including the junior Senator from West Virginia, from Colorado, and from Arkansas. I appreciate their support for this commonsense legislation. Furthermore, a few months ago, every Member of the House and Senate except one voted for even more expansive background checks when we all voted in favor of the Child Care Development Block Grant bill. The combined vote in the House and Senate was 523 to 1. This is not controversial stuff. So what would we actually do? What does the legislation accomplish? No. 1, criminal background checks. Every State has some kind of criminal background check now, that is true, but it is pretty obvious that many of them are not adequate. For instance, too often there are whole categories of school employees who are not covered by the criminal background check, and too often States don't check all of the criminal databases that are available to them, and so these pedophiles are slipping through the cracks. The protecting students act requires a school district that wants to take Federal funds to pay its teachers' salaries to perform background checks on all the workers who have unsupervised contact with the children. That would include new hires and existing hires. Another reality is that many States have only recently adopted these background checks. They have hired employees prior to the legislation requiring the criminal background checks, and some of these employees have this kind of criminal background. Take the case of William Vahey, 64 years old. He taught for decades at some of the world's most elite schools. He started in California and then started working his way across the country. Do you know what he used to do? He used to give his young students Oreo cookies laced with sleeping pills, and when the boys fell asleep he molested them and he photographed it. Scores of children were sexually abused. This teacher had been convicted for sexual abuse of children when he was in his twenties, but these school districts weren't doing a thorough background check so they weren't discovering these things. Well, the protecting students act ensures sex offenders such as William Vahey will not fall through the cracks. They will be discovered by a more thorough and rigorous background check system that our bill requires. I should also point out our bill--the protecting students act-- requires the schools to do the criminal background checks not just for teachers but for contractors as well--some schoolbus drivers, coaches, substitute teachers, anyone who comes in unsupervised contact with the kids. There are currently 12 States that have no such requirement at all. They do not check on the backgrounds of their contractors, despite the fact these folks come in regular contact with kids. Case in point: In Montana, parents got a very rude awakening recently. An audit of Montana's schoolbus drivers found they have 123 drivers with criminal histories, including one driver whose conviction landed him on the Sexual and Violent Offender Registry and one with an outstanding arrest warrant. Running these background checks on school workers is only going to be helpful if it is thorough, if it is adequate. So what the Toomey- Manchin bill does is it requires the background check include all four of the major crime databases that are available. There is the FBI fingerprint database, the National Sex Offender Registry, the State criminal registry in each State, and the State Child Abuse and Neglect Registry. This past August parents in Alaska learned that Alaska has an inadequate background check system, and it resulted in a known child rapist teaching in Alaska schools for 4 years. This is unbelievable, but this is what is happening. On August 29, Alaska State troopers arrested a middle school teacher in Kiana, AK. The teacher had fled Missouri 4 years earlier in order to escape an arrest warrant. Multiple witnesses accused the teacher over a decade of sexual and physical abuse of his own adopted children. He had raped and starved these children--his own children. This is unbelievable. The children literally had to burrow a hole in the wall and steal frozen food and warm it up, heat it on a furnace, just to survive. This monster was able to leave the State and obtain a teaching job in Alaska for 4 years. When asked how in the world this could happen, the Department of Education of Alaska explained: Well, the Alaska background checks looked at the State criminal registry but not the Federal registry. So they had no idea he was a wanton, despicable criminal and had such a record in other States. Had our bill been in force, Alaska would have been required to check the Federal registry. They would have discovered this before ever hiring this monster. This is the first part of our bill--this requirement we have these background checks. And again, there is nothing controversial here. The House of Representatives passed more expansive language unanimously in the last Congress. And a few months ago, as I mentioned, we had a combined House and Senate vote of 523 votes in favor and 1 vote in opposition to the Child Care Development Block Grant Act which imposes appropriate and rigorous background checks on those caring for our kids in daycare. That makes perfect sense. We should be screening out pedophiles from working in our daycares, but we also should be providing the same level of protection to kids who are a little bit older, who are in grade school or middle school or high school. There is a second part to our legislation, and it addresses this outrageous practice of what is known as passing the trash. This is that unbelievable act that resulted in the death of Jeremy Bell, when a letter of recommendation allowed a known pedophile to be employed in West Virginia. Our bill simply says if a State wants to receive Federal taxpayer money, it can't knowingly help a child molester get a job somewhere else. How can this even be controversial? But the fact is this is an all too prevalent practice, and it is long past time we do something about this. Two weeks ago, WUSA News 9 reported some shocking news on the public school system of Montgomery County, MD. Since 2011, 21 Montgomery County public school employees or contract workers have been investigated for child sex abuse or exploitation. The news station learned that the Montgomery County public school system ``keeps a confidential database of personnel who demonstrate inappropriate or suspicious behavior towards children.'' This school system has this watch list of suspected abusers who are working in the area's schools, and WUSA 9 learned the school system had a record, a known record, of passing the trash. For example, elementary school teacher Daniel Picca had been abusing children for 17 years. The school system knew about it. What did they do? The teacher's punishment was to move him from one elementary school to another, again and again and again. There was 17 years of passing a known child molester from 1 school to another. How many kids did he victimize? This has to stop. It is long overdue we do something about this, and there is a way we can. We can make it illegal to knowingly recommend a pedophile for employment somewhere else. That is what our bill does. Another example: Recently, in Las Vegas, NV, a kindergarten teacher was arrested for kidnapping a 16-year-old girl and infecting her with a sexually transmitted disease. This same teacher had molested six children--all fourth and fifth graders--several years before, but he did it in the Los Angeles school district. While the Los Angeles school district knew about the allegations in 2009, the school district recommended settling a lawsuit that alleged the teacher had molested these children. The Nevada school district specifically asked: Have there been any criminal concerns regarding this teacher? The Los Angeles school district didn't only hide the truth, they provided three letters of recommendation--three references--for this teacher. [[Page S1347]] Now for those people who say: Well, the States can fix this problem all on their own, I ask you: What could Nevada do to protect itself from what teachers or school districts are doing in Los Angeles? What could West Virginia have done about a Pennsylvania school district that sent a teacher across the State line with a letter of recommendation? There is nothing one State can do to bind another State. This requires a Federal solution. Let me sum this up. The Toomey-Manchin bill offers a very simple proposition. If a school district wants to use Federal tax dollars to hire school employees, it has to make sure they are not hiring pedophiles in the process. I think that is pretty reasonable. Specifically, they need to perform background checks on any worker who comes in unsupervised contact with children, and they need to stop passing the trash. I can't believe this is even controversial. There is nobody who can stand here and say protections against child sex predators are not urgently needed, not in light of the daily revelations we are discovering. Again, this legislation has overwhelming bipartisan support. It passed the House unanimously. How many bills pass the House unanimously these days? This did. And every Member of the House and Senate except one voted for even more extensive background checks to protect our youngest kids in childcare. Can't we provide the same protection to slightly older kids? The legislation has been endorsed by innumerable child advocate and law enforcement groups, including the National Children's Alliance, which accredits and represents the Nation's 777 child advocacy centers. Yet I am afraid we are probably going to have some opposition voiced about this legislation when we offer the amendment. Let me be clear. First, we are not opposing a mandate on the States. We don't have the legal authority to do that. What we are simply saying is if States want to take Federal funds, they need to protect children from violent and sexual predators. If States don't want to take those measures, then they can choose not to take Federal funds. If a State has no interest in having a rigorous system for protecting kids, well, that is their decision, but we don't have to send Federal tax dollars to pay the salaries of pedophiles. Let me conclude. This is a commonsense bill. It is long overdue. It has very broad bipartisan support. It passed the House unanimously. As I said, in this body, all but one Member voted for an even more expansive background check. Several Senators have voiced some specific concerns, and I am working with several of them. I am willing to work with Senators who want to find ways to constructively improve this bill, but I am not going to support a bill that waters down our ability to protect our kids from pedophiles in school. I hope this body will overwhelmingly adopt the legislation that passed the House unanimously, and we can begin to have a more thorough and effective process of protecting our kids. I yield the floor.

CREC-2015-03-10-pt1-PgS1347,CREC-2015-03-10,114,AMERICAN FOREIGN POLICY,"[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 40 (Tuesday, March 10, 2015)] [Senate] [Pages S1347-S1349] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] AMERICAN FOREIGN POLICY Mr. NELSON. Mr. President, when 47 Republican Senators signed a letter sent to the Ayatollah Khomeini, it was a letter that although supposedly instructive of the constitutional provisions of the separation of government in the United States, in effect, it was a letter to erode the negotiating position of the President of the United States and his administration in trying to reach an agreement to not have a nuclear weapon capability of building a bomb in Iran. I think history will show the strength of American foreign policy has always been bipartisanship when it comes to the interests of America as we look out and have to defend ourselves against our enemies. Indeed, Iran with a nuclear bomb would be one of the gravest threats to our national security as well as to our allies. It saddens me that we have come to the point where we are so divided that nearly half of the Senators, on a partisan basis, in this great institution of the U.S. Senate, would in effect try to cut the legs from underneath the President and his administration in trying to reach an agreement to avert a nuclear bomb. So much has been said about this issue, but one common theme runs throughout, and it is that people seem to know what the agreement is as it is being negotiated in secret. This Senator will reserve judgment. This Senator is also an original cosponsor of the bill we filed to have Congress weigh in on any future lifting of economic sanctions that have been imposed by the Congress, and this Senator feels that is an appropriate role, under the separation of powers, of our job as Congress. But when we see a major part, on a partisan basis, of our government try to undercut and kill the negotiations while they are going on at this very moment in Geneva, then that goes a step too far. I am saddened. I think about what this Senator would have done when the President was not Barack Obama but George Bush. I cannot imagine that I would have tried to undercut the President of the United States representing this country and trying, on matters of war and peace, to keep peace. We can disagree about the specifics, but we still have to honor the institution of the Presidency, and when it becomes matters of war and peace, then we have to unify. That is why I am so saddened that we have come to the point at which we appear to be so divided. Mr. President, I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan. Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I thank my friend from Florida for his comments and I echo those this morning. To the Presiding Officer and to the Members of the Senate, it was 70 years ago this year, in this very Chamber, that the Republican Senator from Michigan, Arthur Vandenberg, gave a speech which has been called the speech heard around the world. Here is how Senator Vandenberg opened that speech: Mr. President, there are critical moments in the life of every nation which call for the straightest, the plainest, and the most courageous thinking of which we are capable. We confront such a moment now. It is not only desperately important to America, it is important to the world. It is important not only to the generation which lives in blood. It is important to future generations if they shall live in peace. This was after World War I and World War II, facing the Cold War and many challenges. Senator Vandenberg was no friend of Franklin Delano Roosevelt. He was, in fact, the biggest thorn in the President's side. He opposed every New Deal program. He was bitterly opposed to U.S. engagement in Europe before World War II. He was the Nation's most famous isolationist and only moderated his stance after the bombing of Pearl Harbor. But 70 years ago Senator Vandenberg spoke on the floor of the Senate to warn his colleagues about what would happen if the United States of America allowed partisan politics to interfere in our Nation's leadership in the world. He later became the chair of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, where he coined the phrase ``politics stops at the water's edge.'' Politics stops at the water's edge. His wisdom when it came to foreign policy--his understanding that for America to be strong, we must convey strength on the world's stage-- earned him a rare recognition, in fact, in this body. My colleagues will recognize this picture because it is a painting hanging in the room right outside this Chamber. I was honored to be there when it was unveiled--Senator Levin and myself--a few years ago. We are proud of this Republican Senator from Michigan. He has been given an honor that is shared by only a handful of Senators. In our Senate history, out of 1,963 Senators--men and women who have served-- only a small group have been honored with a painting, a portrait just outside this Chamber, and he is one of them. I can only imagine what Senator Vandenberg would say if he were alive [[Page S1348]] today. How would he react to a letter signed by 47 U.S. Senators, all of his own party, addressed to the leaders--those we have called enemies--of Iran? How would he react to Members of the U.S. Senate empowering Iranian hard-liners--those whom we have called enemies time and time and time again--just to score political points against a President they do not like? To be clear, Senator Vandenberg loathed President Roosevelt, and by all accounts the feelings were mutual. Senator Vandenberg was no model of bipartisanship himself. He was not at all what we would call a moderate in his time. He may be considered a moderate today, but at the time he was extremely partisan as a Republican, and he was very prominent. He disagreed with the President's policies relating to Japan, but he didn't send a letter to the Emperor of Japan undermining the foreign policy of the President of the United States. He disagreed with the President's policies relating to Germany, but he did not send a letter to the chancellor of the Third Reich expressing his disagreements with the President of the United States. To be clear, one of the great things about America is that we can and should and must disagree with the President when we disagree with directions and policies. But when war hangs in the balance--and specifically when nuclear war hangs in the balance--should Members of the U.S. Senate be in a position of publicly undermining the President of the United States to our enemies? I do not believe Senator Vandenberg would have become pen pals with a group of extremists whose stated goal is ``death to America.'' It is shocking, dangerous, and deeply troubling to me that 47 Members of this body decided to throw away 70 years of wisdom to stand on the side of the Ayatollahs and the most extreme voices in Iran. When President Bush decided to invade Iraq, I voted no. I voted against his policies. I spoke out publicly about my concerns about that war, but I never would have sent a letter to Saddam Hussein undermining the President before that war happened. The chairs of the Senate Armed Services Committee, the chairs of the Senate Intelligence Committee, and the chair of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee at that time all opposed President Bush's invasion of Iraq, but none of them penned a letter to Saddam Hussein. I do not have to wonder what Senator Vandenberg would have thought about all this because he told us. He told us 70 years ago in this very room when explaining how partisanship and division would undermine our efforts in Europe. Senator Vandenberg said: It must mean one for all and all for one; and it will mean this--unless somewhere in this grand alliance the stupid and sinister folly of ulterior ambitions shall invite the enemy to postpone our victory through our own rivalries and our own confusion. So I urge my colleagues to hear the words of the Republican Senator from Michigan, Arthur Vandenberg. I urge them to stop the politics at the water's edge. We are talking about the possibility of a nuclear Iran. We all agree that must not happen. We all agree that must not happen. We all agree that must not happen. We must stand together with the smartest, most effective strategy to make sure that does not happen. That is even more reason why this is not the time nor the place to score political points against the President of the opposite party. This is deadly serious for the United States, for Israel, and for the world. As the Senate saw fit to give Senator Vandenberg a place of high honor, reserved for only a few Senate leaders, just a few steps from here in the U.S. Capitol, I hope my colleagues will hear and take heed of his words now. He said: We cannot drift to victory. We must have maximum united effort on all fronts. . . . And we must deserve, we must deserve the continued united effort of our own people. . . . politics must stop at the water's edge. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Flake). The assistant minority leader. Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, how much time is remaining? The PRESIDING OFFICER. Nine minutes. Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, let me commend my colleagues Senator Nelson from Florida and Senator Stabenow from Michigan for their statements. Senator Nelson spoke from his heart and spoke for many of us on both sides of the aisle who feel this letter sent by 47 Senators undermines the efforts of the President of the United States to avoid a nuclear Iran and to avoid a military response. I particularly want to thank my colleague Senator Stabenow from Michigan for recalling that moment in history which any student of the Senate knows was something that made a difference in the foreign policy of the United States of America for 70 years. It is seldom that any of us comes to the floor and thinks that our speeches will be remembered for 70 minutes, but 70 years later Arthur Vandenberg, Republican of Michigan, set a standard for foreign policy which has guided our country since. At a time of deep political division after World War II, this self-described isolationist and extremely conservative enemy of the New Deal stood and called for unity when it comes to foreign policy. His admonition that politics should stop at the water's edge has largely guided us. When we look at all the controversies that have ensued since then-- think of the Vietnam war and what was going on in this body during that war, the deep divisions between Democrats and Republicans, those who were against the war and for the war. Yet there was never, ever anything like we have seen with this letter sent by 47 Republican Senators. I am glad it didn't occur then, even though I had deep misgivings and trouble with the Vietnam war in its execution. I would have had to have been reckless to endorse an idea that our Nation, through its Senate, would reach out to the Vietnamese during the course of that war, when so many lives were at stake and so many lives were lost. So here we are today--a letter sent by 47 Republican Senators. We have talked about the impact of that. Reflect for a moment on the impact of that letter on our allies who are sitting at the table in Geneva, our allies who joined us in imposing the strictest sanctions in history on Iran to force them into negotiation, our allies, sitting with Secretary Kerry and representatives of our government, who must look at this letter from 47 Republicans and say: Why are we wasting our time? What they are saying is no matter what we do--because no agreement has been announced--no matter what we do, the Republican Senate is going to reject it. That is what the letter says. It goes on to say--and this is a little bit of chutzpah according to the New York Times. The Senators signing the letter go on to remind the Ayatollah, who is not term-limited, that they have 6-year terms and may be around for decades--decades--and basically say to the Iranians: Don't even waste your time thinking about negotiating. It is not a waste of time because the alternatives are absolutely horrifying. The alternative of a nuclear Iran would be a threat not only to the Nation of Israel and many other Middle Eastern States and countries beyond, in Europe and other places, but it would invite a nuclear arms race in the Middle East. The ending is totally unacceptable and unpredictable. So is it worth negotiating? Is it worth trying to find a way to avoid a nuclear Iran? Of course it is. Should the negotiations fail--and they might. I hope not because of this letter, but they might--then what do we face; bringing Iran to its knees with more sanctions? Whom will we call on for these sanctions? Whom will we turn to and say: Will you join us in a more strict sanctions regime? The very same allies who sat at this table and saw this letter from 47 Republican Senators saying to them: Don't waste your time; we have the last word when it comes to Iran. I don't believe the Republican leadership was thinking clearly when they signed on to this letter. I don't think they understood the gravity of their action. They certainly were premature, at the minimum. We don't have an agreement. We are days away from understanding whether there is a possibility of an agreement. Yet these 47 Senators have basically said: Don't waste your time; we are not going to accept it no matter what it is. This is a sad outcome. Similar to the Senator from Michigan, I was 1 of 23 [[Page S1349]] who voted against the invasion of Iraq. I never dreamed for one minute of sending a letter to Saddam Hussein before that vote instructing him about the politics of America. It turns out that in the history of the Senate that has rarely, if ever, occurred. I hope now that those 47 Republican Senators will reflect on their actions and reflect on the impact it will have. I hope the American people understand the President is embarking on a very difficult and delicate mission to try to negotiate a verifiable end to the nuclear arms race in the Middle East and specifically to end nuclear capability in Iran. He may not achieve it, but I respect him for trying. He is the Commander in Chief of the United States of America. He is the elected leader of our Nation. Though many in this Chamber cannot accept it, he is the President of the United States, and he deserves our respect. I respected President George W. Bush, even when I disagreed with him on his policies on Iraq, and we should expect nothing less of the loyal minority when it comes to this President as well. I conclude by saying the Senate has an important role to play. But the President's role, speaking for the United States--trying to avoid a nuclear Iran, trying to avoid a military conflict, another war in the Middle East--is something that should not be undermined for political ambition. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont. Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I want to completely align myself with views of the distinguished Senator from Illinois. This isn't a case of who can score political points for the evening news broadcast. We are talking about potentially the lives of millions of people. We are talking about the possibility of a cataclysmic mistake that could create havoc long after any of us has left this body. I have had the honor of representing Vermont in the Senate beginning at the time when Gerald Ford was President. We have had Presidents I have agreed with--in fact, with every President there have been things I agreed with and with every President, Democratic or Republican, there have been things I have disagreed with. But one thing I have always done when there are such negotiations going on, I am willing to talk to the President privately, but I am not going to state my position, for or against, publicly. We can only have one person negotiating for the United States. Can you imagine if everybody who wanted to rush to the cable news shows to get on TV were to say, well, here is our negotiating position--and we are going to force the President to leave the negotiating table? What do you think those countries that joined us in imposing multilateral sanctions would do? Many of those countries that joined us are doing so at great economic cost to themselves, but they responded--when President Obama went to each of them and asked: Will you join us in imposing sanctions, they agreed. That made the sanctions far more effective. If they think we are not serious, they are going to be very tempted to ask: Why should we join you in supporting sanctions in the future? If the United States were alone in supporting sanctions, no matter what those sanctions are, it would not create any real pressure on Iran. Have we not made enough mistakes in the Middle East? I remember some who said we must go to war in Iraq because it would protect Israel or because they had nuclear weapons or because they had weapons of mass destruction. None of that was true. None of it. I remember people stopping me on the street, angry that I voted against the war in Iraq. They said: We heard Vice President Cheney say they have nuclear weapons. I said: There are none. The senior Senator from Michigan, in quoting Arthur Vandenberg--he was no fan of Franklin Roosevelt, quite the opposite, but he did say, as we were going into World War II, ``politics must stop at the water's edge.'' That has been the view in my own State of both Republicans and Democrats. Let's stop rushing for the cameras and potentially hurting the Senate, potentially hurting the country. Let's think about what is best for the country. I see the distinguished chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee on the floor, so I will yield the floor so he can speak. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 40 (Tuesday, March 10, 2015)] [Senate] [Pages S1347-S1349] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] AMERICAN FOREIGN POLICY Mr. NELSON. Mr. President, when 47 Republican Senators signed a letter sent to the Ayatollah Khomeini, it was a letter that although supposedly instructive of the constitutional provisions of the separation of government in the United States, in effect, it was a letter to erode the negotiating position of the President of the United States and his administration in trying to reach an agreement to not have a nuclear weapon capability of building a bomb in Iran. I think history will show the strength of American foreign policy has always been bipartisanship when it comes to the interests of America as we look out and have to defend ourselves against our enemies. Indeed, Iran with a nuclear bomb would be one of the gravest threats to our national security as well as to our allies. It saddens me that we have come to the point where we are so divided that nearly half of the Senators, on a partisan basis, in this great institution of the U.S. Senate, would in effect try to cut the legs from underneath the President and his administration in trying to reach an agreement to avert a nuclear bomb. So much has been said about this issue, but one common theme runs throughout, and it is that people seem to know what the agreement is as it is being negotiated in secret. This Senator will reserve judgment. This Senator is also an original cosponsor of the bill we filed to have Congress weigh in on any future lifting of economic sanctions that have been imposed by the Congress, and this Senator feels that is an appropriate role, under the separation of powers, of our job as Congress. But when we see a major part, on a partisan basis, of our government try to undercut and kill the negotiations while they are going on at this very moment in Geneva, then that goes a step too far. I am saddened. I think about what this Senator would have done when the President was not Barack Obama but George Bush. I cannot imagine that I would have tried to undercut the President of the United States representing this country and trying, on matters of war and peace, to keep peace.

We confront such a moment now. It is not only desperately important to America, it is important to the world. It is important not only to the generation which lives in blood. It is important to future generations if they shall live in peace. This was after World War I and World War II, facing the Cold War and many challenges. Senator Vandenberg was no friend of Franklin Delano Roosevelt. He was, in fact, the biggest thorn in the President's side. He opposed every New Deal program. He was bitterly opposed to U.S. engagement in Europe before World War II. He was the Nation's most famous isolationist and only moderated his stance after the bombing of Pearl Harbor. But 70 years ago Senator Vandenberg spoke on the floor of the Senate to warn his colleagues about what would happen if the United States of America allowed partisan politics to interfere in our Nation's leadership in the world. He later became the chair of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, where he coined the phrase ``politics stops at the water's edge.'' Politics stops at the water's edge. His wisdom when it came to foreign policy--his understanding that for America to be strong, we must convey strength on the world's stage-- earned him a rare recognition, in fact, in this body. My colleagues will recognize this picture because it is a painting hanging in the room right outside this Chamber. I was honored to be there when it was unveiled--Senator Levin and myself--a few years ago. We are proud of this Republican Senator from Michigan. He has been given an honor that is shared by only a handful of Senators. In our Senate history, out of 1,963 Senators--men and women who have served-- only a small group have been honored with a painting, a portrait just outside this Chamber, and he is one of them. I can only imagine what Senator Vandenberg would say if he were alive [[Page S1348]] today. How would he react to a letter signed by 47 U.S. Senators, all of his own party, addressed to the leaders--those we have called enemies--of Iran? How would he react to Members of the U.S. Senate empowering Iranian hard-liners--those whom we have called enemies time and time and time again--just to score political points against a President they do not like? To be clear, Senator Vandenberg loathed President Roosevelt, and by all accounts the feelings were mutual. Senator Vandenberg was no model of bipartisanship himself. He was not at all what we would call a moderate in his time. He may be considered a moderate today, but at the time he was extremely partisan as a Republican, and he was very prominent. He disagreed with the President's policies relating to Japan, but he didn't send a letter to the Emperor of Japan undermining the foreign policy of the President of the United States. He disagreed with the President's policies relating to Germany, but he did not send a letter to the chancellor of the Third Reich expressing his disagreements with the President of the United States. To be clear, one of the great things about America is that we can and should and must disagree with the President when we disagree with directions and policies. But when war hangs in the balance--and specifically when nuclear war hangs in the balance--should Members of the U.S. Senate be in a position of publicly undermining the President of the United States to our enemies? I do not believe Senator Vandenberg would have become pen pals with a group of extremists whose stated goal is ``death to America.'' It is shocking, dangerous, and deeply troubling to me that 47 Members of this body decided to throw away 70 years of wisdom to stand on the side of the Ayatollahs and the most extreme voices in Iran. When President Bush decided to invade Iraq, I voted no. I voted against his policies. I spoke out publicly about my concerns about that war, but I never would have sent a letter to Saddam Hussein undermining the President before that war happened. The chairs of the Senate Armed Services Committee, the chairs of the Senate Intelligence Committee, and the chair of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee at that time all opposed President Bush's invasion of Iraq, but none of them penned a letter to Saddam Hussein. I do not have to wonder what Senator Vandenberg would have thought about all this because he told us. He told us 70 years ago in this very room when explaining how partisanship and division would undermine our efforts in Europe. Senator Vandenberg said: It must mean one for all and all for one; and it will mean this--unless somewhere in this grand alliance the stupid and sinister folly of ulterior ambitions shall invite the enemy to postpone our victory through our own rivalries and our own confusion. So I urge my colleagues to hear the words of the Republican Senator from Michigan, Arthur Vandenberg. I urge them to stop the politics at the water's edge. We are talking about the possibility of a nuclear Iran. We all agree that must not happen. We all agree that must not happen. We all agree that must not happen. We must stand together with the smartest, most effective strategy to make sure that does not happen. That is even more reason why this is not the time nor the place to score political points against the President of the opposite party. This is deadly serious for the United States, for Israel, and for the world. As the Senate saw fit to give Senator Vandenberg a place of high honor, reserved for only a few Senate leaders, just a few steps from here in the U.S. Capitol, I hope my colleagues will hear and take heed of his words now. He said: We cannot drift to victory. We must have maximum united effort on all fronts. . . . And we must deserve, we must deserve the continued united effort of our own people. . . . politics must stop at the water's edge. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Flake). The assistant minority leader. Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, how much time is remaining? The PRESIDING OFFICER. Nine minutes. Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, let me commend my colleagues Senator Nelson from Florida and Senator Stabenow from Michigan for their statements. Senator Nelson spoke from his heart and spoke for many of us on both sides of the aisle who feel this letter sent by 47 Senators undermines the efforts of the President of the United States to avoid a nuclear Iran and to avoid a military response. I particularly want to thank my colleague Senator Stabenow from Michigan for recalling that moment in history which any student of the Senate knows was something that made a difference in the foreign policy of the United States of America for 70 years. It is seldom that any of us comes to the floor and thinks that our speeches will be remembered for 70 minutes, but 70 years later Arthur Vandenberg, Republican of Michigan, set a standard for foreign policy which has guided our country since. At a time of deep political division after World War II, this self-described isolationist and extremely conservative enemy of the New Deal stood and called for unity when it comes to foreign policy. His admonition that politics should stop at the water's edge has largely guided us. When we look at all the controversies that have ensued since then-- think of the Vietnam war and what was going on in this body during that war, the deep divisions between Democrats and Republicans, those who were against the war and for the war. Yet there was never, ever anything like we have seen with this letter sent by 47 Republican Senators. I am glad it didn't occur then, even though I had deep misgivings and trouble with the Vietnam war in its execution. I would have had to have been reckless to endorse an idea that our Nation, through its Senate, would reach out to the Vietnamese during the course of that war, when so many lives were at stake and so many lives were lost. So here we are today--a letter sent by 47 Republican Senators. We have talked about the impact of that. Reflect for a moment on the impact of that letter on our allies who are sitting at the table in Geneva, our allies who joined us in imposing the strictest sanctions in history on Iran to force them into negotiation, our allies, sitting with Secretary Kerry and representatives of our government, who must look at this letter from 47 Republicans and say: Why are we wasting our time? What they are saying is no matter what we do--because no agreement has been announced--no matter what we do, the Republican Senate is going to reject it. That is what the letter says. It goes on to say--and this is a little bit of chutzpah according to the New York Times. The Senators signing the letter go on to remind the Ayatollah, who is not term-limited, that they have 6-year terms and may be around for decades--decades--and basically say to the Iranians: Don't even waste your time thinking about negotiating. It is not a waste of time because the alternatives are absolutely horrifying. The alternative of a nuclear Iran would be a threat not only to the Nation of Israel and many other Middle Eastern States and countries beyond, in Europe and other places, but it would invite a nuclear arms race in the Middle East. The ending is totally unacceptable and unpredictable. So is it worth negotiating? Is it worth trying to find a way to avoid a nuclear Iran? Of course it is. Should the negotiations fail--and they might. I hope not because of this letter, but they might--then what do we face; bringing Iran to its knees with more sanctions? Whom will we call on for these sanctions? Whom will we turn to and say: Will you join us in a more strict sanctions regime? The very same allies who sat at this table and saw this letter from 47 Republican Senators saying to them: Don't waste your time; we have the last word when it comes to Iran. I don't believe the Republican leadership was thinking clearly when they signed on to this letter. I don't think they understood the gravity of their action. They certainly were premature, at the minimum. We don't have an agreement. We are days away from understanding whether there is a possibility of an agreement. Yet these 47 Senators have basically said: Don't waste your time; we are not going to accept it no matter what it is. This is a sad outcome. Similar to the Senator from Michigan, I was 1 of 23 [[Page S1349]] who voted against the invasion of Iraq. I never dreamed for one minute of sending a letter to Saddam Hussein before that vote instructing him about the politics of America. It turns out that in the history of the Senate that has rarely, if ever, occurred. I hope now that those 47 Republican Senators will reflect on their actions and reflect on the impact it will have. I hope the American people understand the President is embarking on a very difficult and delicate mission to try to negotiate a verifiable end to the nuclear arms race in the Middle East and specifically to end nuclear capability in Iran. He may not achieve it, but I respect him for trying. He is the Commander in Chief of the United States of America. He is the elected leader of our Nation. Though many in this Chamber cannot accept it, he is the President of the United States, and he deserves our respect. I respected President George W. Bush, even when I disagreed with him on his policies on Iraq, and we should expect nothing less of the loyal minority when it comes to this President as well. I conclude by saying the Senate has an important role to play. But the President's role, speaking for the United States--trying to avoid a nuclear Iran, trying to avoid a military conflict, another war in the Middle East--is something that should not be undermined for political ambition. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont. Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I want to completely align myself with views of the distinguished Senator from Illinois. This isn't a case of who can score political points for the evening news broadcast. We are talking about potentially the lives of millions of people. We are talking about the possibility of a cataclysmic mistake that could create havoc long after any of us has left this body. I have had the honor of representing Vermont in the Senate beginning at the time when Gerald Ford was President. We have had Presidents I have agreed with--in fact, with every President there have been things I agreed with and with every President, Democratic or Republican, there have been things I have disagreed with. But one thing I have always done when there are such negotiations going on, I am willing to talk to the President privately, but I am not going to state my position, for or against, publicly. We can only have one person negotiating for the United States. Can you imagine if everybody who wanted to rush to the cable news shows to get on TV were to say, well, here is our negotiating position--and we are going to force the President to leave the negotiating table? What do you think those countries that joined us in imposing multilateral sanctions would do? Many of those countries that joined us are doing so at great economic cost to themselves, but they responded--when President Obama went to each of them and asked: Will you join us in imposing sanctions, they agreed. That made the sanctions far more effective. If they think we are not serious, they are going to be very tempted to ask: Why should we join you in supporting sanctions in the future? If the United States were alone in supporting sanctions, no matter what those sanctions are, it would not create any real pressure on Iran. Have we not made enough mistakes in the Middle East? I remember some who said we must go to war in Iraq because it would protect Israel or because they had nuclear weapons or because they had weapons of mass destruction. None of that was true. None of it. I remember people stopping me on the street, angry that I voted against the war in Iraq. They said: We heard Vice President Cheney say they have nuclear weapons. I said: There are none. The senior Senator from Michigan, in quoting Arthur Vandenberg--he was no fan of Franklin Roosevelt, quite the opposite, but he did say, as we were going into World War II, ``politics must stop at the water's edge.'' That has been the view in my own State of both Republicans and Democrats. Let's stop rushing for the cameras and potentially hurting the Senate, potentially hurting the country. Let's think about what is best for the country. I see the distinguished chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee on the floor, so I will yield the floor so he can speak. ____________________",package_114_112.csv,17781,17781,17849,"[congressional record volume 161, number 40 (tuesday, march 10, 2015)] [senate] [pages s1347-s1349] from the congressional record online through the government publishing office [ www.gpo.gov ] american foreign policy mr. nelson. mr. president, when 47 republican senators signed a letter sent to the ayatollah khomeini, it was a letter that although supposedly instructive of the constitutional provisions of the separation of government in the united states, in effect, it was a letter to erode the negotiating position of the president of the united states and his administration in trying to reach an agreement to not have a nuclear weapon capability of building a bomb in iran. i think history will show the strength of american foreign policy has always been bipartisanship when it comes to the interests of america as we look out and have to defend ourselves against our enemies. indeed, iran with a nuclear bomb would be one of the gravest threats to our national security as well as to our allies. it saddens me that we have come to the point where we are so divided that nearly half of the senators, on a partisan basis, in this great institution of the u.s. senate, would in effect try to cut the legs from underneath the president and his administration in trying to reach an agreement to avert a nuclear bomb. so much has been said about this issue, but one common theme runs throughout, and it is that people seem to know what the agreement is as it is being negotiated in secret. this senator will reserve judgment. this senator is also an original cosponsor of the bill we filed to have congress weigh in on any future lifting of economic sanctions that have been imposed by the congress, and this senator feels that is an appropriate role, under the separation of powers, of our job as congress. but when we see a major part, on a partisan basis, of our government try to undercut and kill the negotiations while they are going on at this very moment in geneva, then that goes a step too far. i am saddened. i think about what this senator would have done when the president was not barack obama but george bush. i cannot imagine that i would have tried to undercut the president of the united states representing this country and trying, on matters of war and peace, to keep peace. we can disagree about the specifics, but we still have to honor the institution of the presidency, and when it becomes matters of war and peace, then we have to unify. that is why i am so saddened that we have come to the point at which we appear to be so divided. mr. president, i yield the floor. the presiding officer. the senator from michigan. ms. stabenow. mr. president, i thank my friend from florida for his comments and i echo those this morning. to the presiding officer and to

CREC-2015-03-10-pt1-PgS1344-7,CREC-2015-03-10,114,HUMAN TRAFFICKING,"[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 40 (Tuesday, March 10, 2015)] [Senate] [Pages S1344-S1345] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] HUMAN TRAFFICKING Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, every year millions of human beings around the world are forced into slave labor and sold for sex. This includes a large number of children. While these crimes are especially prevalent in countries where prosecution of trafficking is lax or essentially nonexistent, the truth is that human trafficking occurs in every country, including right here in the United States. Every year thousands of Americans--most frequently women and children--are trafficked within the borders of the United States. A large number of the victims are children who are bought and sold to feed the twisted desires of sexual predators. That is a key phrase, ``bought and sold,'' because to the criminals who prey on these children, that is what it is about--buying and selling. It is a business. That is right--the sexual exploitation and brutalization of children, some of them not yet teenagers, is a business to the traffickers who ensnare them, and many of them get rich off of the horror these children endure. Traffickers identify vulnerable targets--often children who are already living in difficult circumstances or come from broken homes. They then engage in calculated campaigns to win the trust of these vulnerable children and lure them into their orbit. After the child has been trapped, he or she is brought into a lifestyle whose horrors are difficult to adequately describe. These children are forced into a life of prostitution, their innocence repeatedly and brutally violated hundreds or thousands of times in a year. They are controlled by a combination of sexual, physical, and psychological abuse at the hands of their traffickers. Many of them become hooked on drugs as well thanks to their captors, who see drug dependence as a useful means of control. Some children never escape from this life. They end up dead before they have even left their childhood behind, the victim of a dangerous encounter with a sexual predator or too violent a beating at the hands of a pimp. Those children who do escape can take years or decades to recover from the trauma. Post-traumatic stress disorder, depression, and lasting physical injuries are just some of the challenges victims can face as they attempt to rebuild their lives. Some never recover. All of this is nothing more than a business to the traffickers, who enrich [[Page S1345]] themselves off the violation of the innocent. I am reminded of the verse in the Gospels ``For what does it profit a man to gain the whole world but forfeit his soul?'' If there is any crime against which the human person revolts, it is the sexual brutalization of children. It is well known that even hardened criminals despise those who have hurt children in this way. Going after those who traffic in children should be a priority for local, State, and Federal law enforcement agencies. This week we are considering the Justice for Victims of Trafficking Act, a bill put together by my colleague, the senior Senator from Texas. I cosponsored this legislation because I believe it provides a number of important tools to strengthen our efforts to eradicate trafficking in this country and to help its victims. This legislation would give law enforcement additional resources for targeting traffickers, including increased access to wiretaps for State and local task forces conducting human trafficking and child pornography investigations, authorization for programs targeting child exploitation, and offering law enforcement training for returning veterans who want to focus on combating human trafficking. A large portion of the bill is focused on providing assistance to victims as they seek to regain their lives. Among the bill's many victim-related provisions are, first, a deficit-neutral domestic trafficking victims fund to increase the Federal support available to trafficking victims, financed by increased penalties for those convicted of trafficking-related crimes; second, a new block grant program to help State and local governments expand the resources they offer to trafficking victims and strengthen their law enforcement efforts; third, a provision written by my colleague from South Dakota, Representative Kristi Noem, that would help expand the extremely limited housing available to recovering underaged trafficking victims; fourth, a notification requirement to ensure that trafficking victims are told of any plea bargains or deferred prosecution agreements in their case; fifth, a provision to give victims of child pornography access to the same services available to trafficking victims by classifying child pornography production as a type of human trafficking; and sixth, a human trafficking advisory council made up of trafficking survivors to make recommendations to the Federal Government. This legislation has been endorsed by some of the leading organizations in the fight against human trafficking, including the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, Shared Hope International, Rights4Girls, and the National Association to Protect Children. It is also supported by a bipartisan majority here in the Senate, and I am looking forward to passing it in the very near future. The sooner we get these tools in the hands of law enforcement, the better. If we succeed in anything as a society, it should be in protecting the innocent. I hope this legislation will help advance the fight against trafficking in this country and help promote the healing of human trafficking's many victims. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, every year millions of human beings around the world are forced into slave labor and sold for sex. This includes a large number of children. While these crimes are especially prevalent in countries where prosecution of trafficking is lax or essentially nonexistent, the truth is that human trafficking occurs in every country, including right here in the United States. Every year thousands of Americans--most frequently women and children--are trafficked within the borders of the United States. A large number of the victims are children who are bought and sold to feed the twisted desires of sexual predators. That is a key phrase, ``bought and sold,'' because to the criminals who prey on these children, that is what it is about--buying and selling. It is a business. That is right--the sexual exploitation and brutalization of children, some of them not yet teenagers, is a business to the traffickers who ensnare them, and many of them get rich off of the horror these children endure. Traffickers identify vulnerable targets--often children who are already living in difficult circumstances or come from broken homes. They then engage in calculated campaigns to win the trust of these vulnerable children and lure them into their orbit. After the child has been trapped, he or she is brought into a lifestyle whose horrors are difficult to adequately describe. These children are forced into a life of prostitution, their innocence repeatedly and brutally violated hundreds or thousands of times in a year. They are controlled by a combination of sexual, physical, and psychological abuse at the hands of their traffickers. Many of them become hooked on drugs as well thanks to their captors, who see drug dependence as a useful means of control. Some children never escape from this life. They end up dead before they have even left their childhood behind, the victim of a dangerous encounter with a sexual predator or too violent a beating at the hands of a pimp. Those children who do escape can take years or decades to recover from the trauma. Post-traumatic stress disorder, depression, and lasting physical injuries are just some of the challenges victims can face as they attempt to rebuild their lives. Some never recover. All of this is nothing more than a business to the traffickers, who enrich [[Page S1345]] themselves off the violation of the innocent. I am reminded of the verse in the Gospels ``For what does it profit a man to gain the whole world but forfeit his soul?'' If there is any crime against which the human person revolts, it is the sexual brutalization of children. It is well known that even hardened criminals despise those who have hurt children in this way.

CREC-2015-03-10-pt1-PgS1378,CREC-2015-03-10,114,MORNING BUSINESS,"[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 40 (Tuesday, March 10, 2015)] [Senate] [Pages S1378-S1380] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] MORNING BUSINESS ______ MANDATORY MINIMUM SENTENCES Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, on a number of occasions I have had to take to the Senate floor to note my opposition to the so-called Smarter Sentencing Act. Does that mean I am against all sentencing reform? No. But there are some issues that are particularly wrong with the suggestions that have been put in bill form so far. My speeches on this issue have been necessary because there are so many misconceptions about that legislation and Federal drug sentences and prisoners. Before addressing them, I want to let my colleagues know that I do believe there are some inequities in the criminal justice system, and the Judiciary Committee will be looking at ways to address them. I will set out that part of the committee's agenda after discussing sentencing. The Smarter Sentencing Act would arbitrarily cut in half the mandatory minimum sentences which are imposed on a host of serious-- very serious--drug offenses. Those offenses include the importation, manufacture, and distribution of serious drugs, such as heroin, PCP, LSD, and meth. As an example, the Governor of Vermont devoted an entire state of the State address to the heroin epidemic. The Governor of Maryland just launched an anti-heroin initiative following the near doubling of heroin overdose deaths in that State in the 2 years between 2011 and 2013. The Smarter Sentencing Act would cut mandatory sentences in half for importing, distributing, and manufacturing heroin. It would cut the sentences for the same activities with respect to LSD, a drug that causes psychosis and suicide. It would reduce sentences for the drug trade that two of President Obama's appointees in the Drug Enforcement Administration and in the Justice Department have warned that the world's most dangerous terrorist organizations are engaged in this trade to fund their operations. It would harm the ability of prosecutors to obtain cooperation from lower level offenders to obtain intelligence regarding terrorist-planned attacks. As President Obama's own U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York has warned, ``[T]here is a growing nexus between drug trafficking and terrorism, a threat that increasingly poses a clear and present danger to our national security.'' The threat should determine the response. It would be foolhardy to meet the threat of narcoterrorism by cutting drug sentences. Under Federal sentencing law, those who are low-level offenders avoid mandatory minimum offenses. Just under half of all drug courier offenders were subject to mandatory minimum sentences, but fewer than 10 percent received mandatory minimum sentences. One reason for the difference is that offenders who cooperate in prosecuting high-level drug conspirators avoid the mandatory minimum sentences. As a Federal Law Enforcement Officers Association wrote: [A]ny change in the mandatory minimum sentencing standard does a disservice to the brave men and women who are asked to put their lives on the line to protect us from terrorists and criminals. Currently, the system in place allows Federal law enforcement agents to infiltrate and dismantle large-scale drug trafficking organizations and to take violent armed career criminals off of the street. In turn, this allows progression up the scale of criminal organizations from low-level subjects to higher ranking members through the effect of the mandatory minimum sentencing act. A second reason mandatory minimum sentences are not imposed on many eligible drug couriers is the so-called safety valve. Defendants can qualify if they have no or a very light criminal history. That means those who are convicted but are not violent do not serve mandatory minimum sentences. The average sentence for a Federal drug courier offender is only 39 months. The offenders who qualify for the safety valve are drug couriers and drug dealers. They are not people who are in prison for the possession of drugs. That is because drug possession does not trigger Federal mandatory minimum sentences, and it is also because, according to the sentencing commission, almost no citizen is in Federal prison for mere drug possession. Eighty-eight percent of the drug possession prisoners were apprehended along the Southwest border, and the median amount of drugs in their possession was 48 pounds. I wish to emphasize ``48 pounds.'' These, then, with 48 pounds are not low-level, casual offenders. Only 270 mere Federal drug possession cases were brought anywhere else in the country in the most recent year for which the sentencing commission has statistics. And the average sentence for drug possession for citizens is [[Page S1379]] 1.3 months. That is months, not years. Most citizens convicted of Federal drug possession charges receive probation. The proponents of the bill say there are too many people in prison and that the bill would save the taxpayers money. Well, it turns out that is not true. The Congressional Budget Office estimated that the bill, even while releasing hundreds of thousands of prisoners earlier than under current law, would increase direct spending by about $1 billion and would reduce revenues by $42 million over 10 years. The supporters of the so-called Smarter Sentencing Act do not even attempt to contest my points in opposition--and I have made these points more than once before the Senate. The supporters do not say there is not a heroin epidemic. They cannot say citizens are serving Federal mandatory minimum sentences for possession. But they do say this: Their major ploy is to paint a picture that poor, innocent, mere drug possessors are crowding our prisons. They do not argue that Obama administration officials did not warn of the link of drug crimes to terrorism and national security threats. They don't challenge the statistics from the sentencing commission or the existence of the safety valve or the effect of mandatory minimum sentences in enhancing prosecution of very serious drug offenders. They won't take on the Congressional Budget Office's cost estimates. They do cite CBO's discretionary cost savings of $3 billion, but, in the long run, entitlement spending can be more costly because entitlement spending must be paid. They don't do any of these because they simply can't. They are committed to a bill as a matter of ideology. The facts simply do not matter to the supporters. They try to change the subject. All they can do is resort to rhetoric. In fact, the supporters of that legislation are even Orwellian in their rhetoric. I mean that literally. George Orwell wrote a famous essay called ``Politics and the English Language.'' He said: ``In our time, political speech and writing are largely the defense of the indefensible.'' The arguments for the Smarter Sentencing Act are merely a weak attempt to defend the indefensible. What I have called the leniency industrial complex refers then to the people who are sentenced to drug mandatory minimum sentences as ``nonviolent.'' They use that term even though any truly nonviolent offenders would qualify for the safety valve. They gloss over the fact that even if an offender was not violent in a particular case, he may have committed a prior violent offense that would make him, in fact, a violent person. And, of course, many drug-related crimes occur through force or the threat of force, or are conducted by people in a criminal enterprise that relies on violence. The bill's supporters even refer to some drug offenders as ``nonviolent,'' and these people are serving mandatory minimum sentences for carrying a firearm in the commission of a crime. Few Americans would call someone who carries a gun while committing a drug crime nonviolent. And the leniency industrial complex wants people to think that people who are sentenced to mandatory minimum sentences are somehow low-level offenders. They neglect to mention that the true low- level offenders receive the safety valve and avoid mandatory minimum sentences and that many others avoid them by providing substantial assistance to law enforcement. Many of the cases they cite involve repeat offenders. Repeat offenders are not low level. Lenient sentences did not stop them from dealing dangerous drugs, and another lenient sentence won't stop their next drug deal. When it comes to terms such as ``low level'' and ``nonviolent,'' again quoting Orwell, the bill's supporters have their own private definition, but allow the hearer to think they mean something quite different. Their political language has to consist largely of euphemisms, question-begging, and sheer cloudy vagueness. I regret to say that the elements in the media have uncritically accepted the Orwellian rhetoric surrounding this bill. A recent New York Times editorial swallowed the ``low-level'' rhetoric whole hog. It challenged my well-supported conclusion that high-level offenders would benefit from enactment of the Smarter Sentencing Act, without even mentioning the serious crimes and drugs the bill applies to. It editorialized that my opposition to the bill ``defies . . . empirical data,'' even though my sources are the sentencing commission and the Obama administration appointees. When the Times attempted to back up its support for the bill, it linked not to any authoritative evidence but to the report of an ideological advocacy group. This is the so-called empirical data that the Times finds worthy. Why should taxpayers fund the sentencing commission if the self- proclaimed paper of record shuns its statistics in favor of those offered by lobbying groups? The Times said the Federal policymakers should rely on State experience in reforming sentences, so I would like to do that. Only 270 citizens are prosecuted for drug possession in the Federal system each year, and most receive probation. The States have many drug possession offenders in prison, so the actions they take for that class of offenders do not bear on Federal prison populations, nor do the States prosecute anyone for importation of heroin or LSD or meth or cocaine. But the Federal Government does, as my colleagues know. So State drug sentencing changes are not relevant to those prisoners as well. And it is the Federal Government, much more than the States, that uses lower level offenders to take down the most serious drug offenders. Meanwhile, I have offered to consider legislation that would lower some mandatory minimum sentences if others could be imposed or raised. For instance, the sentencing commission has identified child pornography and financial crimes such as insider trading as areas where Federal judges are particularly lenient and where no mandatory minimum sentences exist. But it is the proponents of the Smarter Sentencing Act who refuse to take me up on that good-faith offer. Their ideology does not include compromise. The White House says they want to work with this Senator on these issues, but then invites other Members of Congress, but not the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, to a meeting to discuss the subject. Since then, I have had a discussion with the President inviting me to come down there and visit with him some time. But in the New York Times' Orwellian world, this Senator is a roadblock to sentencing reform. That is upside down and backward. Problems do exist in the criminal justice system. I plan to have the Judiciary Committee address some important ones. But rather than marking up ill-considered and dangerous legislation such as the so- called Smarter Sentencing Act, we will take up bills that can achieve a large measure of consensus. I would like to take this opportunity to address some of the committee's criminal justice agenda, which will show my commitment to real problem solving through consensus. The first area we will address is reform of asset forfeiture. Asset forfeiture can serve a valuable purpose for law enforcement and society by helping to deprive criminals and criminal organizations of their money--money from proceeds of their crimes and the instrumentality of that crime. It also helps to compensate victims who are injured or who suffer as a result of criminals' wrongdoing. It can also return that money to law enforcement, which can use it to continue to combat serious crime and put more bad guys behind bars. But current law provides perverse incentive that have led to abuses. Law enforcement can sometimes directly benefit from property that they seize, sometimes contrary to State law. Those whose property is taken often do not have access to fair procedures or law enforcement to help them get that property back. These processes and procedures need real structural reform. Innocent property owners must be able to challenge seizures and protect their property from government abuses. I am also looking into reversing a Supreme Court decision that denies property owners the opportunity to use their very own money to hire a lawyer to help defend them against the government. Even though the administration has made some administrative changes to these practices and policies in response to widespread criticism, I believe real legislative reform is needed. I look forward to working with my [[Page S1380]] colleagues in a bipartisan way to make those necessary changes. Second, as a way of looking at reform, I am very concerned that too many times in America equality under the law is not a reality; that the poor do not receive the same justice in many instances. For more than 50 years, the Supreme Court has ruled that indigent people accused of felonies must be afforded counsel. And for more than 40 years, starting with the decision of Argersinger v. Hamlin, the Supreme Court has found that the Sixth Amendment of the Constitution requires that Federal, State, and local governments provide counsel to indigents who are accused of misdemeanors if their convictions could potentially lead to imprisonment. I regret to say that although I am aware of instances where the Federal Government is responsible, it is particularly at the State level where the Sixth Amendment is violated numerous times on a daily basis. I cannot think of any Supreme Court decision that has ever faced such resistance in magnitude and time as that Hamlin case. Indigent misdemeanants are being pressured to waive counsel. Sometimes they are threatened with imprisonment if they seek to have counsel appointed. There are other ways the decision is violated. Then there is the question of the competence of the counsel actually appointed, given how many cases are assigned to an individual lawyer and how quickly judges resolve them. I fear some innocent people are being sentenced to prison. There are other consequences as well. We should make sure there are collateral consequences imposed on people who are guilty of domestic violence misdemeanors, for instance. We do not want collateral consequences imposed on people who did not actually commit misdemeanors. If people later get in trouble with the law, we don't want them to qualify for the safety valve because some of their previous convictions were for misdemeanors in which they did not receive the right to counsel. We don't want people to have criminal records when they seek employment when they did not have counsel who could have prevented a conviction. In some situations, a misdemeanor will automatically become a felony if the accused has committed it repeatedly. We don't want a misdemeanor conviction to render a later crime a felony if questions of innocence surround the earlier crime. Third, I want to address databases for criminal records. Those databases can serve useful purposes, such as enabling background checks, background checks on people who are being considered for a job or for volunteering to work with children. There are proposals to expand the purposes for which the databases can be used, but I am concerned about the quality and the completeness of the records in the database. If the database contains erroneous or outdated material, then the people being checked may unfairly lose out on a job or the ability to help children. There are procedures at the Federal level to challenge the information in the database if the person knows their records are inaccurate, but that is a very steep climb. The States have their own procedures for people to challenge the accuracy of criminal records, but success there may be even harder and may cost more than people can afford. Records are also sometimes not expunged, even when the law said they must be expunged. I do not want to see the arrest record turn up in a background check and deny someone the ability to work, deny the economy the benefit of that productivity, and deprive the government of tax revenue from that work because a background check turned up a record of an arrest from long ago that never resulted in a conviction. This is a widespread problem. According to press reports, when arrests are included, 32 percent of adults in this country have criminal records that are contained in databases. I am sure we can reach bipartisan agreement on legislation to address this problem in some form. There are dangerous and poorly considered proposals to change the criminal justice system that are divisive, are not based on reality, and will never become law. There are also problems in the criminal justice system that are clear, widely recognized, have serious consequences, and can be the subject of effective bipartisan legislative efforts. I will do what I can to make sure the Committee on the Judiciary devotes its energy to the second category. I yield the floor. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 40 (Tuesday, March 10, 2015)] [Senate] [Pages S1378-S1380] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] MORNING BUSINESS ______ MANDATORY MINIMUM SENTENCES Mr. GRASSLEY.

As a Federal Law Enforcement Officers Association wrote: [A]ny change in the mandatory minimum sentencing standard does a disservice to the brave men and women who are asked to put their lives on the line to protect us from terrorists and criminals. Currently, the system in place allows Federal law enforcement agents to infiltrate and dismantle large-scale drug trafficking organizations and to take violent armed career criminals off of the street. In turn, this allows progression up the scale of criminal organizations from low-level subjects to higher ranking members through the effect of the mandatory minimum sentencing act. A second reason mandatory minimum sentences are not imposed on many eligible drug couriers is the so-called safety valve. Defendants can qualify if they have no or a very light criminal history. That means those who are convicted but are not violent do not serve mandatory minimum sentences. The average sentence for a Federal drug courier offender is only 39 months. The offenders who qualify for the safety valve are drug couriers and drug dealers. They are not people who are in prison for the possession of drugs. That is because drug possession does not trigger Federal mandatory minimum sentences, and it is also because, according to the sentencing commission, almost no citizen is in Federal prison for mere drug possession. Eighty-eight percent of the drug possession prisoners were apprehended along the Southwest border, and the median amount of drugs in their possession was 48 pounds. I wish to emphasize ``48 pounds.'' These, then, with 48 pounds are not low-level, casual offenders. Only 270 mere Federal drug possession cases were brought anywhere else in the country in the most recent year for which the sentencing commission has statistics. And the average sentence for drug possession for citizens is [[Page S1379]] 1.3 months. That is months, not years. Most citizens convicted of Federal drug possession charges receive probation. The proponents of the bill say there are too many people in prison and that the bill would save the taxpayers money. Well, it turns out that is not true. The Congressional Budget Office estimated that the bill, even while releasing hundreds of thousands of prisoners earlier than under current law, would increase direct spending by about $1 billion and would reduce revenues by $42 million over 10 years. The supporters of the so-called Smarter Sentencing Act do not even attempt to contest my points in opposition--and I have made these points more than once before the Senate. The supporters do not say there is not a heroin epidemic. They cannot say citizens are serving Federal mandatory minimum sentences for possession. But they do say this: Their major ploy is to paint a picture that poor, innocent, mere drug possessors are crowding our prisons. They do not argue that Obama administration officials did not warn of the link of drug crimes to terrorism and national security threats. They don't challenge the statistics from the sentencing commission or the existence of the safety valve or the effect of mandatory minimum sentences in enhancing prosecution of very serious drug offenders. They won't take on the Congressional Budget Office's cost estimates. They do cite CBO's discretionary cost savings of $3 billion, but, in the long run, entitlement spending can be more costly because entitlement spending must be paid. They don't do any of these because they simply can't. They are committed to a bill as a matter of ideology. The facts simply do not matter to the supporters. They try to change the subject. All they can do is resort to rhetoric. In fact, the supporters of that legislation are even Orwellian in their rhetoric. I mean that literally. George Orwell wrote a famous essay called ``Politics and the English Language.'' He said: ``In our time, political speech and writing are largely the defense of the indefensible.'' The arguments for the Smarter Sentencing Act are merely a weak attempt to defend the indefensible. What I have called the leniency industrial complex refers then to the people who are sentenced to drug mandatory minimum sentences as ``nonviolent.'' They use that term even though any truly nonviolent offenders would qualify for the safety valve. They gloss over the fact that even if an offender was not violent in a particular case, he may have committed a prior violent offense that would make him, in fact, a violent person. And, of course, many drug-related crimes occur through force or the threat of force, or are conducted by people in a criminal enterprise that relies on violence. The bill's supporters even refer to some drug offenders as ``nonviolent,'' and these people are serving mandatory minimum sentences for carrying a firearm in the commission of a crime. Few Americans would call someone who carries a gun while committing a drug crime nonviolent. And the leniency industrial complex wants people to think that people who are sentenced to mandatory minimum sentences are somehow low-level offenders. They neglect to mention that the true low- level offenders receive the safety valve and avoid mandatory minimum sentences and that many others avoid them by providing substantial assistance to law enforcement. Many of the cases they cite involve repeat offenders. Repeat offenders are not low level. Lenient sentences did not stop them from dealing dangerous drugs, and another lenient sentence won't stop their next drug deal. When it comes to terms such as ``low level'' and ``nonviolent,'' again quoting Orwell, the bill's supporters have their own private definition, but allow the hearer to think they mean something quite different. Their political language has to consist largely of euphemisms, question-begging, and sheer cloudy vagueness. I regret to say that the elements in the media have uncritically accepted the Orwellian rhetoric surrounding this bill. A recent New York Times editorial swallowed the ``low-level'' rhetoric whole hog. It challenged my well-supported conclusion that high-level offenders would benefit from enactment of the Smarter Sentencing Act, without even mentioning the serious crimes and drugs the bill applies to. It editorialized that my opposition to the bill ``defies . . . empirical data,'' even though my sources are the sentencing commission and the Obama administration appointees. When the Times attempted to back up its support for the bill, it linked not to any authoritative evidence but to the report of an ideological advocacy group. This is the so-called empirical data that the Times finds worthy. Why should taxpayers fund the sentencing commission if the self- proclaimed paper of record shuns its statistics in favor of those offered by lobbying groups? The Times said the Federal policymakers should rely on State experience in reforming sentences, so I would like to do that. Only 270 citizens are prosecuted for drug possession in the Federal system each year, and most receive probation. The States have many drug possession offenders in prison, so the actions they take for that class of offenders do not bear on Federal prison populations, nor do the States prosecute anyone for importation of heroin or LSD or meth or cocaine. But the Federal Government does, as my colleagues know. So State drug sentencing changes are not relevant to those prisoners as well. And it is the Federal Government, much more than the States, that uses lower level offenders to take down the most serious drug offenders. Meanwhile, I have offered to consider legislation that would lower some mandatory minimum sentences if others could be imposed or raised. For instance, the sentencing commission has identified child pornography and financial crimes such as insider trading as areas where Federal judges are particularly lenient and where no mandatory minimum sentences exist. But it is the proponents of the Smarter Sentencing Act who refuse to take me up on that good-faith offer. Their ideology does not include compromise. The White House says they want to work with this Senator on these issues, but then invites other Members of Congress, but not the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, to a meeting to discuss the subject. Since then, I have had a discussion with the President inviting me to come down there and visit with him some time. But in the New York Times' Orwellian world, this Senator is a roadblock to sentencing reform. That is upside down and backward. Problems do exist in the criminal justice system. I plan to have the Judiciary Committee address some important ones. But rather than marking up ill-considered and dangerous legislation such as the so- called Smarter Sentencing Act, we will take up bills that can achieve a large measure of consensus. I would like to take this opportunity to address some of the committee's criminal justice agenda, which will show my commitment to real problem solving through consensus. The first area we will address is reform of asset forfeiture. Asset forfeiture can serve a valuable purpose for law enforcement and society by helping to deprive criminals and criminal organizations of their money--money from proceeds of their crimes and the instrumentality of that crime. It also helps to compensate victims who are injured or who suffer as a result of criminals' wrongdoing. It can also return that money to law enforcement, which can use it to continue to combat serious crime and put more bad guys behind bars. But current law provides perverse incentive that have led to abuses. Law enforcement can sometimes directly benefit from property that they seize, sometimes contrary to State law. Those whose property is taken often do not have access to fair procedures or law enforcement to help them get that property back. These processes and procedures need real structural reform. Innocent property owners must be able to challenge seizures and protect their property from government abuses. I am also looking into reversing a Supreme Court decision that denies property owners the opportunity to use their very own money to hire a lawyer to help defend them against the government. Even though the administration has made some administrative changes to these practices and policies in response to widespread criticism, I believe real legislative reform is needed. I look forward to working with my [[Page S1380]] colleagues in a bipartisan way to make those necessary changes. Second, as a way of looking at reform, I am very concerned that too many times in America equality under the law is not a reality; that the poor do not receive the same justice in many instances. For more than 50 years, the Supreme Court has ruled that indigent people accused of felonies must be afforded counsel. And for more than 40 years, starting with the decision of Argersinger v. Hamlin, the Supreme Court has found that the Sixth Amendment of the Constitution requires that Federal, State, and local governments provide counsel to indigents who are accused of misdemeanors if their convictions could potentially lead to imprisonment. I regret to say that although I am aware of instances where the Federal Government is responsible, it is particularly at the State level where the Sixth Amendment is violated numerous times on a daily basis. I cannot think of any Supreme Court decision that has ever faced such resistance in magnitude and time as that Hamlin case. Indigent misdemeanants are being pressured to waive counsel. Sometimes they are threatened with imprisonment if they seek to have counsel appointed. There are other ways the decision is violated. Then there is the question of the competence of the counsel actually appointed, given how many cases are assigned to an individual lawyer and how quickly judges resolve them. I fear some innocent people are being sentenced to prison. There are other consequences as well. We should make sure there are collateral consequences imposed on people who are guilty of domestic violence misdemeanors, for instance. We do not want collateral consequences imposed on people who did not actually commit misdemeanors. If people later get in trouble with the law, we don't want them to qualify for the safety valve because some of their previous convictions were for misdemeanors in which they did not receive the right to counsel. We don't want people to have criminal records when they seek employment when they did not have counsel who could have prevented a conviction. In some situations, a misdemeanor will automatically become a felony if the accused has committed it repeatedly. We don't want a misdemeanor conviction to render a later crime a felony if questions of innocence surround the earlier crime. Third, I want to address databases for criminal records. Those databases can serve useful purposes, such as enabling background checks, background checks on people who are being considered for a job or for volunteering to work with children. There are proposals to expand the purposes for which the databases can be used, but I am concerned about the quality and the completeness of the records in the database. If the database contains erroneous or outdated material, then the people being checked may unfairly lose out on a job or the ability to help children. There are procedures at the Federal level to challenge the information in the database if the person knows their records are inaccurate, but that is a very steep climb. The States have their own procedures for people to challenge the accuracy of criminal records, but success there may be even harder and may cost more than people can afford. Records are also sometimes not expunged, even when the law said they must be expunged. I do not want to see the arrest record turn up in a background check and deny someone the ability to work, deny the economy the benefit of that productivity, and deprive the government of tax revenue from that work because a background check turned up a record of an arrest from long ago that never resulted in a conviction. This is a widespread problem. According to press reports, when arrests are included, 32 percent of adults in this country have criminal records that are contained in databases. I am sure we can reach bipartisan agreement on legislation to address this problem in some form. There are dangerous and poorly considered proposals to change the criminal justice system that are divisive, are not based on reality, and will never become law. There are also problems in the criminal justice system that are clear, widely recognized, have serious consequences, and can be the subject of effective bipartisan legislative efforts. I will do what I can to make sure the Committee on the Judiciary devotes its energy to the second category. I yield the floor. ____________________","Congressional Record, Volume 161 Issue 40 (Tuesday, March 10, 2015) [Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 40 (Tuesday, March 10, 2015)] [Senate] [Pages S1378-S1380] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] MORNING BUSINESS ______ MANDATORY MINIMUM SENTENCES Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, on a number of occasions I have had to take to the Senate floor to note my opposition to the so-called Smarter Sentencing Act. Does that mean I am against all sentencing reform? No. But there are some issues that are particularly wrong with the suggestions that have been put in bill form so far. My speeches on this issue have been necessary because there are so many misconceptions about that legislation and Federal drug sentences and prisoners. Before addressing them, I want to let my colleagues know that I do believe there are some inequities in the criminal justice system, and the Judiciary Committee will be looking at ways to address them. I will set out that part of the committee's agenda after discussing sentencing. The Smarter Sentencing Act would arbitrarily cut in half the mandatory minimum sentences which are imposed on a host of serious-- very serious--drug offenses. Those offenses include the importation, manufacture, and distribution of serious drugs, such as heroin, PCP, LSD, and meth. As an example, the Governor of Vermont devoted an entire state of the State address to the heroin epidemic. The Governor of Maryland just launched an anti-heroin initiative following the near doubling of heroin overdose deaths in that State in the 2 years between 2011 and 2013. The Smarter Sentencing Act would cut mandatory sentences in half for importing, distributing, and manufacturing heroin. It would cut the sentences for the same activities with respect to LSD, a drug that causes psychosis and suicide. It would reduce sentences for the drug trade that two of President Obama's appointees in the Drug Enforcement Administration and in the Justice Department have warned that the world's most dangerous terrorist organizations are engaged in this trade to fund their operations. It would harm the ability of prosecutors to obtain cooperation from lower level offenders to obtain intelligence regarding terrorist-planned attacks. As President Obama's own U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York has warned, ``[T]here is a growing nexus between drug trafficking and terrorism, a threat that increasingly poses a clear and present danger to our national security.'' The threat should determine the response. It would be foolhardy to meet the threat of narcoterrorism by cutting drug sentences. Under Federal sentencing law, those who are low-level offenders avoid mandatory minimum offenses. Just under half of all drug courier offenders were subject to mandatory minimum sentences, but fewer than 10 percent received mandatory minimum sentences. One reason for the difference is that offenders who cooperate in prosecuting high-level drug conspirators avoid the mandatory minimum sentences. As a Federal Law Enforcement Officers Association wrote: [A]ny change in the mandatory minimum sentencing standard does a disservice to the brave men and women who are asked to put their lives on the line to protect us from terrorists and criminals.

the indefensible. what i have called the leniency industrial complex refers then to the people who are sentenced to drug mandatory minimum sentences as ``nonviolent.'' they use that term even though any truly nonviolent offenders would qualify for the safety valve. they gloss over the fact that even if an offender was not violent in a particular case, he may have committed a prior violent offense that would make him, in fact, a violent person. and, of course, many drug-related crimes occur through force or the threat of force, or are conducted by people in a criminal enterprise that relies on violence. the bill's supporters even refer to some drug offenders as ``nonviolent,'' and these people are serving mandatory minimum sentences for carrying a firearm in the commission of a crime. few americans would call someone who carries a gun while committing a drug crime nonviolent. and the leniency industrial complex wants people to think that people who are sentenced to mandatory minimum sentences are somehow low-level offenders. they neglect to mention that the true low- level offenders receive the safety valve and avoid mandatory minimum sentences and that many others avoid them by providing substantial assistance to law enforcement. many of the cases they cite involve repeat offenders. repeat offenders are not low level. lenient sentences did not stop them from dealing dangerous drugs, and another lenient sentence won't stop their next drug deal. when it comes to terms such as ``low level'' and ``nonviolent,'' again quoting orwell, the bill's supporters have their own private definition, but allow the hearer to think they mean something quite different. their political language has to consist largely of euphemisms, question-begging, and sheer cloudy vagueness. i regret to say that the elements in the media have uncritically accepted the orwellian rhetoric surrounding this bill. a recent new york times editorial swallowed the ``low-level'' rhetoric whole hog. it challenged my well-supported conclusion that high-level offenders would benefit from enactment of the smarter sentencing act, without even mentioning the serious crimes and drugs the bill applies to. it editorialized that my opposition to the bill ``defies . . . empirical data,'' even though my sources are the sentencing commission and the obama administration appointees. when the times attempted to back up its support for the bill, it linked not to any authoritative evidence but to the report of an ideological advocacy group. this is the so-called empirical data that the times finds worthy. why should taxpayers fund the sentencing commission if the self- proclaimed paper of record shuns its statistics in favor of those offered by lobbying groups? the times said the federal policymakers should rely on state experience in reforming sentences, so i would like to do that. only 270 citizens are prosecuted for drug possession in the federal system each year, and most receive probation. the states have many drug possession offenders in prison, so the actions they take for that class of offenders do not bear on federal prison populations, nor do the states prosecute anyone for importation of heroin or lsd or meth or cocaine. but the federal government does, as my colleagues know. so state drug sentencing changes are not relevant to those prisoners as well. and it is the federal government, much more than the states, that uses lower level offenders to take down the most serious drug offenders. meanwhile, i have offered to consider legislation that would lower some mandatory minimum sentences if others could be imposed or raised. for instance, the sentencing commission has identified child pornography and financial crimes such as insider trading as areas where federal judges are particularly lenient and where no mandatory minimum sentences exist. but it is the proponents of the smarter sentencing act who refuse to take me up on that good-faith offer. their ideology does not include compromise. the white house says they want to work with this senator on these issues, but then invites other members of congress, but not the chairman of the senate judiciary committee, to a meeting to discuss the subject. since then, i have had a discussion with the president inviting me to come down there and visit with him some time. but in the new york times' orwellian world, this senator is a roadblock to sentencing reform. that is upside down and backward. problems do exist in the criminal justice system. i plan to have the judiciary committee address some important ones. but rather than marking up ill-considered and dangerous legislation such as the so- called smarter sentencing act, we will take up bills that can achieve a large measure of consensus. i would like to take this opportunity to address some of the committee's criminal justice agenda, which will show my commitment to real problem solving through consensus. the first area we will address is reform of asset forfeiture. asset forfeiture can serve a valuable purpose for law enforcement and society by helping to deprive criminals and criminal organizations of their money--money from proceeds of their crimes and the instrumentality of that crime. it also helps to compensate victims who are injured or who suffer as a result of criminals' wrongdoing. it can also return that money to law enforcement, which can use it to continue to combat serious crime and put more bad guys behind bars. but current law provides perverse incentive that have led to abuses. law enforcement can sometimes directly benefit from property that they seize, sometimes contrary to state law. those whose property is taken often do not have access to fair procedures or law enforcement to help them get that property back. these processes and procedures need real structural reform. innocent property owners must be able to challenge seizures and protect their property from government abuses. i am also looking into reversing a supreme court decision that denies property owners the opportunity to use their very own money to hire a lawyer to help defend them against the government. even though the administration has made some administrative changes to these practices and policies in response to widespread criticism, i believe real legislative reform is needed. i look forward to working with my [[page s1380]] colleagues in a bipartisan way to make those necessary changes. second, as a way of looking at reform, i am very concerned that too many times in america equality under the law is not a reality; that the poor do not receive the same justice in many instances. for more than 50 years, the supreme court has ruled that indigent people accused of felonies must be afforded counsel. and for more than 40 years, starting with the decision of argersinger v. hamlin, the supreme court has found that the sixth amendment of the constitution requires that federal, state, and local governments provide counsel to indigents who are accused of misdemeanors if their convictions could potentially lead to imprisonment. i regret to say that although i am aware of instances where the federal government is responsible, it is particularly at the state level where the sixth amendment is violated numerous times on a daily basis. i cannot think of any supreme court decision that has ever faced such resistance in magnitude and time as that hamlin case. indigent misdemeanants are being pressured to waive counsel. sometimes they are threatened with imprisonment if they seek to have counsel appointed. there are other ways the decision is violated. then there is the question of the competence of the counsel actually appointed, given how many cases are assigned to an individual lawyer and how quickly judges resolve them. i fear some innocent people are being sentenced to prison. there are other consequences as well. we should make sure there are collateral consequences imposed on people who are guilty of domestic violence misdemeanors, for instance. we do not want collateral consequences imposed on people who did not actually commit misdemeanors. if people later get in trouble with the law, we don't want them to qualify for the safety valve because some of their previous convictions were for misdemeanors in which they did not receive the right to counsel. we don't want people to have criminal records when they seek employment when they did not have counsel who could have prevented a conviction. in some situations, a misdemeanor will automatically become a felony if the accused has committed it repeatedly. we don't want a misdemeanor conviction to render a later crime a felony if questions of innocence surround the earlier crime. third, i want to address databases for criminal records. those databases can serve useful purposes, such as enabling background checks, background checks on people who are being considered for a job or for volunteering to work with children. there are proposals to expand the purposes for which the databases can be used, but i am concerned about the quality and the completeness of the records in the database. if the database contains erroneous or outdated material, then the people being checked may unfairly lose out on a job or the ability to help children. there are procedures at the federal level to challenge the information in the database if the person knows their records are inaccurate, but that is a very steep climb. the states have their own procedures for people to challenge the accuracy of criminal records, but success there may be even harder and may cost more than people can afford. records are also sometimes not expunged, even when the law said they must be expunged. i do not want to see the arrest record turn up in a background check and deny someone the ability to work, deny the economy the benefit of that productivity, and deprive the government of tax revenue from that work because a background check turned up a record of an arrest from long ago that never resulted in a conviction. this is a widespread problem. according to press reports, when arrests are included, 32 percent of adults in this country have criminal records that are contained in databases. i am sure we can reach bipartisan agreement on legislation to address this problem in some form. there are dangerous and poorly considered proposals to change the criminal justice system that are divisive, are not based on reality, and will never become law. there are also problems in the criminal justice system that are clear, widely recognized, have serious consequences, and can be the subject of effective bipartisan legislative efforts. i will do what i can to make sure the committee on the judiciary devotes its energy to the second category. i yield the floor. ____________________",17815
CREC-2015-03-10-pt1-PgS1366-2,CREC-2015-03-10,114,JUSTICE FOR VICTIMS OF TRAFFICKING ACT OF 2015--Continued,"[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 40 (Tuesday, March 10, 2015)] [Senate] [Pages S1366-S1378] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] JUSTICE FOR VICTIMS OF TRAFFICKING ACT OF 2015--Continued The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana. Mr. CASSIDY. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss a serious crime and a violation of human rights that must be stopped--human trafficking. It is a form of modern-day slavery, people profiting from the control and exploitation of others. I rise as a doc, a fellow who has practiced in the public hospital system for 32 years, understanding the unique role nurses, physicians, and other health care providers play in this issue. Health care providers are frontline and one of the few to interact directly [[Page S1367]] with trafficked women and children. A recent survey published in the Annals of Health Law reports that 28 percent of trafficked women sought a health care professional while being held captive. Now, this does not mean that the nurse, the doctor or other health care provider had the training to recognize it, but because of the unique and critical involvement with these victims, it is important these health care providers do have the tested tools and training to identify and help those being trafficked. The Trafficking Awareness Training for Health Care amendment would save lives and, as importantly, would begin the rebuilding of lives destroyed by modern-day slavery. It would provide for the development of best practices to enable health care workers to recognize and assist victims of human trafficking. It is proven that many trafficking victims report receiving health care from federally funded clinics and emergency rooms while in captivity yet, as I mentioned earlier, they go undetected. This legislation would improve the awareness of health care workers, ultimately helping these victims. Senator Tim Kaine recently spoke about a missive that Pope Francis gave on Ash Wednesday, calling for us to be ``islands of mercy in a sea of indifference.'' The ethic of nurses, physicians, and other health care workers is to be that merciful creature. This would give them the training to better enable them to be that ``island'' in what for that woman or child caught in captivity must seem a ``sea of indifference.'' Having passed the House by unanimous consent, this amendment represents a bipartisan effort that will enable the medical community to bring relief to those suffering in ways that those of us who have never been there cannot imagine. Senator Peters is joining me in this bipartisan effort. I urge my colleagues to support this amendment and help transform victims of trafficking into survivors and people who blossom. I yield back. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The President pro tempore. Authorizing The Use Of Force Against The Islamic State Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss one of the most critical national security challenges facing the Senate: specifically, how we should craft an authorization for the use of military force against the terrorist organization known as the Islamic State. I have spoken before on the floor about what I believe the outline of an authorization should contain. Now that the President has released his proposal--and with Secretary Kerry, Secretary Carter, and General Dempsey slated to testify tomorrow on behalf of this proposal--I feel compelled to address this topic in greater detail. Before delving into the specifics of the administration's proposed authorization, we should consider how this institution has grappled with these vital questions throughout our Nation's history. Dating back to 1798, Congress has on several occasions enacted legislation short of a formal declaration of war authorizing the use of military force by the President. In the late 18th and early 19th centuries, Congress authorized U.S. naval action against both state and non-state actors who attacked U.S. commercial vessels. More recent authorizations formally passed by the Congress include those intended to protect the Middle East, Taiwan, and Southeast Asia from communist aggression in the 1950s and 1960s. And since the end of the Cold War, we have passed authorizations concerning Lebanon, the September 11 attacks, and Iraq-- all in 1991 and in 2002. I voted for those latter four authorizations here in this Chamber. Each case was unique, but in every case the White House did not send the Congress ``take it or leave it'' language. Rather, the Senate and the House fashioned text that represented a negotiated outcome with the White House and within Congress. For example, Presidents Eisenhower and George H.W. Bush worked closely with Congress to obtain strong authorizations for the use of military force, despite Democrats controlling both Chambers. President George W. Bush twice did the same with a Democrat-led Senate. This approach yielded concrete benefits--a more thoughtful debate and strategy around our use of force, greater unity in supporting our military, and congressional willingness to fulfill our constitutional responsibilities. Historically, the Senate has fulfilled its role as a place of intelligent, informed debate in moving authorizations for use of military force. We must do so again as we consider this authorization to combat the Islamic State. Thirteen years ago, as the Senate began to deliberate over an authorization to rid Iraq of its violent dictator, I said: We all must leave our political party affiliations at the door when it comes to our national security and supporting our troops in the field. It is time for Congress to come together, to hold a public debate, and to craft the right authorization to defeat the Islamic State. Turning to the proposed authorization before us today, I agree with the legal interpretation offered by the Obama administration that the executive branch has the power to conduct operations against the Islamic State under article II of the Constitution and the existing authorizations from 2001 and 2002. Unfortunately, the administration has undermined the credibility of its own proposal by continuously changing its position as to how the 2001 and 2002 authorizations should be employed. Therefore, in order to settle any legal questions about the power to use force against the Islamic State--and to demonstrate America's resolve in this fight against terror--I firmly believe that a new authorization should be enacted. Accordingly, the senior Senator from Oklahoma and I discussed in this Chamber last month three principles that we believe should be included in a new authorization for the use of military force against the Islamic State. First, the authorization must clearly articulate that the executive branch is authorized to use force--employed in accordance with the law of war--against the Islamic State. Second, the authorization must be flexible enough to be used against the Islamic State as it appears today but also in whatever form the Islamic State transforms into in the future. This flexibility must include the authority to use force against organizations that associate with or support the Islamic State. Finally, and most importantly, the authorization must not impose any artificial and unnecessary limitations, such as those based on time, geography, and type of force, which could interfere with our strategic objective of defeating the Islamic State. Unfortunately, the President's draft authorization does not fully adhere to these principles. First, the President's proposal ``does not authorize the use of the United States Armed Forces in enduring offensive ground operations.'' Obviously, this is an unwise artificial limitation on what type of forces we can employ. But the President's proposed operative text offers little to define what this restriction entails. Therefore, my initial reaction, one that is widely shared, is: What does this restriction mean? To be fair, the President's introductory letter that accompanied his draft does provide some insight into the administration's interpretation of this phrase. Specifically, the President argues that the authorization would provide him with the power to conduct rescue operations, to provide advice and assistance to partner forces, and to deploy the use of Special Forces in missions against the Islamic State's leadership, intelligence collection, and targeting missions. But in laying out his vision, the President's proposal also tells our enemies what he is not prepared to do. Knowing these limitations would provide the Islamic State with a critical advantage: The terrorists would exploit this information in crafting their strategies. Why would we telegraph our strategy to our enemies? The President's proposed legal limitations will also limit our ability to adjust our strategy as needed based on the military situation on the ground. For example, when our counterterrorism strategy in Iraq faltered during the mid 2000s, we changed it and we adopted a new counterinsurgency strategy commonly called the surge. As we all know, the surge was a great success. Therefore, ensuring any authorization has the flexibility to allow our [[Page S1368]] forces to change and adapt their strategies and tactics is essential. Imposing the President's proposed artificial and unnecessary, yet legally binding, restrictions on our forces would be a colossal mistake. Indeed, General Jack Keane, who devised the principles of the surge, recently testified before the Senate Armed Services Committee about his own proposal as to how to conduct operations against the Islamic State. In his testimony, the general did advocate using Special Forces in a similar manner to what the President discussed in his letter accompanying his proposal. But the general went further. He stated that the United States and our coalition partners should position combat brigades in Kuwait if our current operation ``stalls or is defeated.'' Obviously, the use of combat brigades would be prohibited under the President's proposal. Therefore, if the President's limited operations are not successful and additional ground forces are required, adopting the President's proposal would create significant uncertainty. This raises the question: Would Congress need to debate and pass yet another authorization before those units could be used in combat? On its face, this would be completely impractical and hardly in our national security interest. Another area in which the President's proposal does not provide sufficient flexibility is its 3-year time limitation. Simply put, if we advertise when the authorization expires at an arbitrary date and time, will our enemies not hunker down and wait for that date? Secretary of State John Kerry stated in his previous testimony before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee that the administration does not believe a new authorization should include a geographic limitation. To its credit, the President's proposal does not. Specifically, the Secretary argued: ``In our view, it would be a mistake to advertise to ISIL that there are safe havens for them outside of Iraq and Syria.'' Undoubtedly, the Secretary was concerned about creating artificial limitations that could negatively affect our ability to conduct necessary military operations. He is right. But his concern should extend to the other artificial restrictions that appear in this proposal. How else can we read the prohibition of ``enduring offensive ground combat operations'' and a 3-year time limitation? In conclusion, we can do better. Our forces must have the flexibility to use, or the ability to threaten to use, whatever tools and strategies are necessary to defeat the Islamic State. When America enters into a fight, we should enter to win. And we should not just do this in a halfhearted, stupid way. So I hope the White House will reconsider some of the things that they have advocated and that they have set forth and get this thing done right so that if we are going to enter into warfare, we ought to know what we are doing and ought to have the tools and the legal legalities to be able to do it well. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Hoeven). The minority leader. Mr. REID. Mr. President, what is the business before the Senate? The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate is considering S. 178. Mr. REID. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. PORTMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I object. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard. The senior assistant legislative clerk continued with the call of the roll. Mr. PORTMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, reserving the right to object. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator cannot reserve the right to object. Is there objection? Without objection, it is so ordered. The Senator from Ohio. Mr. PORTMAN. Mr. President, I know the Presiding Officer has other places to be, and I am going to be presiding in the chair in a moment. I will not offer amendments because my understanding is that even though we are on the bill, my colleagues on the other side of the aisle don't want me to offer noncontroversial amendments. So I will wait until they are ready for that just to keep the peace on the floor, but I will talk about the amendments because they are incredibly important to the underlying legislation. We are talking about the human trafficking legislation. This is something that as cochair and cofounder of the Human Trafficking Caucus, as a father, and as someone who represents the citizens of Ohio, who are directly affected by this, I have a strong interest. I am delighted the Senate is taking up this legislation. I do hope it will be not just bipartisan but nonpartisan. I do not see any reason for it not to move forward in the Senate, changing some of these laws that are in desperate need of changing to ensure that this horrific practice of human trafficking and sex trafficking can be curbed. It can be minimized by legislation that this Chamber should have taken up, in my view, some time ago. We really haven't been at this subject for a decade. We know a lot more about the problem now. We know, unfortunately, that about 300,000 of our youth are subject to human trafficking--about 1,000 in my home State of Ohio alone. The amendments I will offer--once someone on this side comes to the floor who will allow me to offer them--have to do with human trafficking in the broadest sense. The first amendment has to do with those people who are, unfortunately, trapped in sex trafficking being treated not as criminals but as victims and with ensuring that those victims get the proper care they need and the help to be able to get back on their feet. These are young people--we are told many times--who are between the ages of 11 and 13 when they are first exposed to human trafficking, in this case sex trafficking. In fact, that is the average age, we are told. Having talked to some of the victims at home, having talked to some of those who are in the trenches working, trying to help these young women, girls, young men, and boys, this legislation is badly needed to ensure we are looking at this--not again as a criminal matter but--as victims who deserve our support. Specifically, it requires that every State put together a plan to improve child protection services--containing, among other things, provisions and procedures requiring identification and assessments of all reports involving children known or to be suspected victims of sex trafficking--with better information and better data, a description of efforts to coordinate State law enforcement, child welfare agencies, and juvenile justice agencies such as runaway and homeless youth shelters to help serve these victims. Finally, this legislation calls for an annual State report on the number of children identified as known or suspected to be a victim of sex trafficking. The other amendment I am going to offer will be an amendment with regard to homeless children and youth. As has been discussed on this floor before, the HUD definition of homelessness practically excludes the most common situations for families and unaccompanied youths--and that would be staying in motels or temporarily with others because there is no place else for them to stay. Even if local communities identified these families or youth as having the most pressing unmet needs, communities can't use the HUD homeless assistance funds to serve them except in extremely limited or near-impossible conditions. This is related to human trafficking and also to sex trafficking in that, unfortunately, many of these young people involved in these situations--where they are homeless, where they are not on the street but are going from house to house or perhaps staying in a motel--are targeted by these traffickers. I believe these two amendments, which are not only bipartisan--and they are; I have support on both sides of the aisle--but are also nonpartisan and are ones that would be appropriate to include in the legislation. At the appropriate time I will offer those amendments. [[Page S1369]] The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont. Mr. LEAHY. We need to confer for a couple of minutes.

Mr. PORTMAN. Mr. President, this is the homeless and youth amendment I spoke about a moment ago. I thank everyone for their indulgence. I am pleased to have these amendments offered, and we will have an opportunity to speak on these amendments and another amendment I plan to offer later. I yield back the remainder of my time. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. (Mr. PORTMAN assumed the Chair.) Mr. PORTMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Lankford). Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. PORTMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to offer my support to the underlying legislation we are considering on the floor today. This is the most significant antitrafficking legislation to come before the Senate in over a decade. As I said earlier when I offered a couple of amendments, I am very pleased to be in this body on a nonpartisan basis, not just a bipartisan basis, to be able to address this issue, and I would like to thank the Senators who have worked hard in their committees to make that possible. I thank Senators Cornyn and Klobuchar for their work. I see Senator Wyden is here, Senator Leahy is here, Senator Grassley is here, and others who have been involved with this. They and their staffs are to be commended. It has been a good process. It is an issue a lot of us care about. Why? Because it is one that affects our States and our constituents in very significant ways. Last year I cofounded and I now cochair the Caucus on Human Trafficking with Senator Blumenthal, and we have had a number of good meetings and conferences here on the Hill bringing experts together and raising awareness of this issue. Unfortunately, this horrible crime affects every single part of our country. In Ohio this came to my attention initially because in parts of Ohio, along the I-75 corridor, particularly in Toledo, there were higher incidences of prosecutions of human trafficking. A school group actually brought this to my attention several years ago. The more we looked into it, the more we realized that this affects so many of our constituents, and it particularly affects the most vulnerable in our society--children, runaways, the missing. In the greatest country on the face of the Earth, almost 300,000 of our American children are at risk of trafficking and commercial sexual exploitation, more than 1,000 each year in Ohio alone. In 2000 I did support the last major bill that directly addressed this growing problem of human trafficking. It was called the Trafficking Victims Protection Act. And I supported the reauthorization in 2011. But since that time we have learned a lot more about the problem. We now know more about how to eradicate what is really a modern form of slavery. Our new legislation, which is called the Justice for Victims of Trafficking Act of 2015, builds on what we know works, and it strengthens protections for the victims. I would like to take a moment, if I could, to talk about two of the bills that are contained within this underlying legislation that are the product of a lot of bipartisan work that exemplifies some of the finest traditions of this body. The first is the Bringing Missing Children Home Act. The Bringing Missing Children Home Act is something I coauthored with Senator Schumer on the other side of the aisle, and we did it because we know there is unfortunately a strong correlation between victims of sex trafficking and children who have recently been in and out of the child welfare system. We also know that children who have run away or who are missing are the most vulnerable to being abused, trafficked, and exploited. In 2014 an FBI sting recovered 168 children who were victims of sex trafficking. Nearly each one of those children--nearly all of them had been involved in some kind of foster care or the child welfare system. Many of them had been reported missing--by the way, with insufficient information to find them. It is a strong correlation, and it is one that any effort to stop human trafficking must also address. That is what my legislation does. The Bringing Missing Children Home Act strengthens law enforcement reporting and response procedures, making it easier to communicate and work with child welfare agencies. It accomplishes this in a number of ways. First, it amends the current Missing Children's Assistance Act so that Federal law makes clear that children who are trafficked or sexually exploited are treated as victims and not as criminals. You will hear this in this debate, and this is one of the great underlying aspects of this legislation, we are changing the way we look at this, to understand that there is simply no such thing as a child prostitute. Second, this legislation requires law enforcement to update their records of missing children within 30 days with all the relevant information obtained during the initial investigation. This is very important because this new information will allow us to find these children more easily and more quickly, to avoid them falling into the trap of sexual trafficking and traffickers. Specifically, the bill requires new dental and medical records, as well as photograph, if available. For almost all of these children, there is a photograph available if you take the time to try to find it. I can't stress this last part enough. It is so hard to find these kids, and without having a photograph, it is made much more difficult. Yet in most instances we apparently don't. We tracked this in Ohio. Let me give an interesting statistic. Since January 1 of this year there have been 87 children reported missing in the State of Ohio--87 kids. We only have photographs for 21 of them, so for 66 of these young people we have no photographs. It is tough to find them when you don't know what they look like. This bill will help change that. Third, it requires law enforcement to work directly with State and local child welfare systems after someone is reported missing so that all the relevant information can be obtained as quickly as possible. Finally, it removes all the roadblocks that prevent State attorneys general from modifying records in the National Crime Information Center. We want these records to be updated [[Page S1371]] constantly as new information is provided. To put it simply, we think it is a commonsense bill that streamlines how missing children cases are handled. It makes it easier to share information that could lead to recovery. The second bill I wish to talk about that is part of this underlying legislation is called the Combat Human Trafficking Act which I coauthored with Senator Feinstein. The Bringing Missing Children Home Act is about helping victims. This legislation, the Combat Human Trafficking Act, is about punishing the traffickers. We start by giving prosecutors expanded tools to put traffickers behind bars. Our legislation enlarges the number of charges Federal prosecutors can level against traffickers and those who conspire with them. It also makes those engaged in trafficking strictly liable for their crimes. We also expand the training available for our Federal law enforcement tasked with investigating and prosecuting traffickers, and we require that the Bureau of Justice Statistics prepare an annual report detailing our success in this fight. Just as importantly, this bill strengthens victims' rights by providing more information to victims on ongoing prosecutions, requiring them to be informed in a timely manner of any plea agreements or prosecution agreements in cases in which they are involved. The legislation we are considering passed out of the committee unanimously for a reason. There are things that do divide us in this place. We talk about those a lot, and everybody reads and hears about them. But this is an exception. This is about bringing us together, in this case to protect our kids from human trafficking. Human traffickers and sexual trafficking are issues on which we should not have any divide. This is legislation both Republicans and Democrats can enthusiastically support. Earlier today I joined with some of my colleagues in introducing some amendments to the legislation because although I support the underlying bill--it is a good bill--it can be made even better, and I am looking forward to the debate. In the process, I hope we will raise awareness about the issue, raise consciousness about the issue not just among our colleagues and around Capitol Hill but around the country because ultimately, if we are going to solve this problem in our communities, everyone needs to be part of it, everyone needs to be vigilant, and everyone needs to understand that this happens in your community, it happens in your State, and it happens, unfortunately, in our country. If we can raise awareness about this wicked practice of human trafficking and sex trafficking, that would do a lot to try to curb it, to reduce it, and eventually to stop it. This is what we came to Washington to do--to pass legislation that actually helps back home. With this legislation, we can stand together to protect the most innocent among us from the most heinous of crimes. I thank you the Presiding Officer. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the remarks I am going to make now not be part of the remarks on the bill that is before the Senate. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. (The remarks of Mr. Grassley are printed in today's Record under ``Morning Business.'') Mr. GRASSLEY. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, yesterday the Democratic leader, Senator Reid, told us that Democrats and Republicans could finally agree on one thing; that is, we ought to focus not on the partisan politics and the ideology that so often divides us, but we ought to focus on the victims of human trafficking, largely middle school-age girls who are bought and sold like commodities. I came to the floor yesterday and said that I believe we are all created in the image of God, and it is a sin, it is the very personification of evil for people to treat those same human beings as if they were things. That is what the scourge of human trafficking is all about. I was very glad to see that finally we seemed to be chipping away at the dysfunction of the Senate that we have experienced over the last few years and, in the new majority, given an opportunity for an open amendment process on a subject that we all agree needs to be dealt with that we could work on together. So imagine my surprise when earlier today the same Democratic leader said the Democrats were going to filibuster this anti-human trafficking legislation. Why in the world would they take a 180-degree turn? Why would they do such an about-face or flip-flop? Well, they said because there was language contained in the bill they disagreed with. No, they didn't say they would use this open amendment process to file an amendment and have a vote to strip it out or to modify it or otherwise change it; they said: We are going to block the bill; it is dead unless this language comes out. Yet they do nothing to try to effect that outcome. We might wonder what this language is that they are so upset about that they would literally kick the tens of thousands of children and other victims to the curb because of their outrage that this language is contained in this legislation. Well, imagine my surprise to find out that the reason why the Democratic minority is going to filibuster this antitrafficking bill is because they object to language that has been the law of the land for 39 years--39 years. So I guess they woke up this morning and thought, well, we better do something about it. What is the provision that causes them so much discomfort, that they are so upset about that they are willing to block this legislation? Well, it is something called the Hyde amendment. Basically what that does is it prohibits the use of taxpayer funds for abortions. I realize that in America we are of different minds on the subject of abortion. I am proudly pro-life, but others in our Senate are pro- choice, and we probably have a whole spectrum of views on this very personal issue. But we have had a bipartisan consensus--unanimity almost--for the last 39 years that whatever else the law is, as handed down by the Supreme Court or by Congress, we are not going to use taxpayer funds for abortion. So imagine my surprise when that very language and very reference was included in the Justice for Victims of Trafficking Act bill that now today I find out for the first time our Democratic friends object to. Imagine my surprise when that very language was part of the bill that was filed in mid-January and a month later was marked up and voted on in the Senate Judiciary Committee and all members of the Judiciary Committee, Democrats and Republicans alike, voted for it. They voted for it unanimously. Well, I don't believe that was a mistake. Our friends across the aisle have outstanding staff. They are very talented people. I don't always agree with them, but they are good at what they do. I don't believe for a minute that they would have missed a reference in this legislation to a restriction on funding taxpayer- provided abortions, and I don't believe that those staff members, being the diligent professionals they are, didn't tell their principal, their member of the Senate Judiciary Committee. So this idea that there has been some kind of ambush is preposterous. It is just not credible. Well, imagine my surprise when not only did we have a 15-to-0 vote, I believe it was--in other words, a unanimous vote of the Judiciary Committee--for this bill, we have Democratic cosponsors of this bill. Not only do they support the bill, they have been actively working with us on the legislation. Just looking at the face of the bill, I count 10 Democratic cosponsors. Do you think they didn't read the [[Page S1372]] bill before they put their names on it? Do you think their staffs didn't tell them what is in the bill? Well, as we all know, this sort of thing is ordinarily very hotly debated. There are no shrinking violets in the U.S. Senate, no people who sit passively on the sidelines and say: Well, I better not speak up and express my views. That doesn't happen. We have strong-willed, talented people on both sides of the aisle, and there are no shrinking violets. Let's just lay that to rest. People are willing to speak up, and they do speak up every day, every hour, virtually every minute on things they feel strongly about. So this idea that we have created an ambush, that we have surprised our colleagues by including this language in a bill that is on the floor, the Justice for Victims of Trafficking Act--voted unanimously out of the Judiciary Committee, all Republicans and all Democrats, with 10 Democratic cosponsors--that we have somehow surprised them by including this restriction on taxpayer-funded abortion that has been the law of the land for 39 years is patently ridiculous. It is just not believable. Let me provide a little more information. The reference in the bill is on page 50 under limitations. It says: ``Amounts in the Fund, or otherwise transferred from the Fund''--that is, the crime victims compensation fund created by this legislation, $30 million that goes to help treat victims and help them heal and get on with their lives--this bill says that this fund ``shall be subject to the limitations on the use or expending of amounts described in sections 506 and 507 of division H of the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2014 . . . to the same extent as if amounts in the Fund were funds appropriated under division H of such Act.'' I went to see how many Democrats voted for that consolidated appropriations act in 2014 that contained the Hyde amendment language and the limitations on taxpayer-funded abortions. Imagine my surprise when I saw that 55 Democrats voted for that language in the 2014 consolidated appropriations bill that is referred to on pages 50 and 51 of the Justice for Victims of Trafficking Act. This is the same bill the Democratic leader said Democrats were going to filibuster because they were so outraged, they were surprised, they were bushwhacked, they were ambushed, they were tricked. Twenty-three Democrats voted for that same appropriation language in 2014. But it gets better--or worse, as the case may be. Democrats have supported legislation consistent with the Hyde amendment for a long time. As I have said, it has been the law of the land for 39 years. When was the last time? Well, the Department of Homeland Security funding. Remember this back-and-forth we had over the defunding of the President's Executive action on immigration that so many on our side of the aisle are upset about because it is not within the President's authority to do it--and that is not just my opinion; it is the Federal judge's in Brownsville who has issued a preliminary injunction--but how many Democrats voted for the Department of Homeland Security funding bill that contains that same limitation on taxpayer funding for abortions? Forty-five Democrats voted for it. So imagine my surprise when 45 Democrats recently voted for that appropriations bill to come to the Senate today and be told: We are outraged. We are never going to support that. And, by the way, we didn't know it was in the bill when we voted for it in the Judiciary Committee or when we cosponsored the bill. Well, they presumably knew about it when they voted for the Department of Homeland Security funding in February of 2015, when 32 of them voted for the CR omni or CRomni in December of 2014. And, oh, by the way, remember ObamaCare? Every single Democrat voted to support ObamaCare which contained the same restriction on taxpayer funding for abortions. They have also voted for the Children's Health Insurance Program, the so-called SCHIP, for Defense authorization bills. In other words, our Democratic friends have voted time and time and time again for the exact same language they now say they are going to filibuster on the Justice for Victims of Trafficking Act, language they said they weren't aware of when they voted for it--they didn't read it, their staff didn't tell them about it. Well, if that is true, I would get new staff. But I know the staff on the Democratic side, like the staff on the Republican side, are highly professional people and they wouldn't fail to identify offensive language that their Senator could not and would not and never has voted for, or they would be out of a job. So I plead with our Democratic friends, please don't make this Justice for Victims of Trafficking Act another political football. For heaven's sake, if we can't agree to protect the most vulnerable victims of this heinous crime, what can we ever agree on? If we can't agree on that, if we are going to try to find a way to flyspeck legislation and say, well, I won't allow this bill to go forward if that language is included in there--even though it has been the law of the land for 39 years, even though routinely Democrats have voted for that restriction on taxpayer-funded abortion time and time and time again--why start now, when we are talking about the most vulnerable victims of this heinous crime, and say: Well, we are going to punish you. We are not going to provide you the services you need in order to heal and get better and get on with your life, because we woke up this morning, March 10, 2015, and after 39 years we decided this is where we draw the line. We are drawing the line here. Never again will we ever vote for the Hyde amendment to be applied to any funds appropriated by or in the possession of the Federal Government. So I really would ask my colleagues: Please reconsider. Please let's not do this. Don't do this to these children and these victims of trafficking. Don't do it to this institution. We all understand that Washington can be a pretty tough place. All of us are volunteers, and we understand politics can sometimes be a tough business. But let's not take it out on these victims of human trafficking. That should be beneath us. They don't deserve that. They deserve better. If we pass this legislation and we get it to the President's desk and he signs it--which I believe he will--hundreds, if not thousands, of victims of human trafficking have a safe place to sleep, they will have people who love them and care for them try to help them heal and get better. We will take the money from the people who perpetrate these crimes and we will use that money to help provide needed services to these children and other victims of human trafficking. We will say ``no more'' to the teenaged girl who is arrested for prostitution, because she is a victim of trafficking--we will tell her, no more are you a criminal. We will recognize her for the victim she is, and we will treat her appropriately. We will deal not only with the supply side of this terrible crime, we will deal with the demand side--people who get off the hook too easily with impunity, people who purchase these illicit services, and somehow always seem to avoid responsibility and continue to participate in this crime with impunity. So the domestic trafficking victims fund in our legislation supplements existing authorized grant programs that are already subject to appropriation laws such as the Hyde amendment. They are already subject to the same provisions. Our legislation clarifies that the Hyde amendment also applies to any funds that are used to supplement those existing grant programs. Our legislation does not in any way expand or change the scope of the Hyde amendment. It just says these funds operate under the same rules that cover the existing grant programs they supplement. Everyone agrees the programs we supplement in this legislation need more funds. I know the distinguished ranking member, the Senator from Vermont, has made an impassioned plea to add more money beyond the victims compensation fund that we created. He is saying there needs to be more money. As a long-time member of the Appropriations Committee, I hope the Appropriations Committee looks at that and makes a decision whether they ought to supplement what we do. But these funds are being subjected to the same limitation on spending as [[Page S1373]] every dollar the Senate Appropriations Committee has appropriated during the last 39 years. So my hope is this, that Members of the Senate will rise above this disagreement, this posturing, this attempt to try to play ``gotcha'' at the expense of these victims of human trafficking. No Member should attempt to make this bill a debate about extraneous issues and policies that have been settled on a bipartisan basis for 39 years. Mr. President, I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Ayotte). The Senator from Vermont. Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I have listened very carefully to my good friend from Texas. We have worked together on many pieces of legislation over the years. In fact, I hoped we could have gotten this trafficking bill up during the last Congress, as he knows. Unfortunately, there were objections raised and we couldn't. I hope we are not going to get into a question where we compare apples and oranges and forget what we are supposed to be doing. The distinguished Senator says on the one hand during the debate on the Affordable Care Act, according to him--and I will take him at his word--that this language was in there and every Democrat voted for it-- which meant, of course, that every Republican voted against it. If you are going to use and follow his argument that the language in the Affordable Care Act was voted for by Democrats, it was voted against by Republicans. I am not suggesting they don't care about the Hyde amendment because they voted against it, according to the Senator from Texas. But let's talk about things that should be on appropriations bills. I am one of the few Members of either party in this body who has actually prosecuted child molesters. I am one of the few Members of this body who has actually gone to crime scenes and seen the results of child molestation. I am one of the few people in this body who has prosecuted a child molester, not with evidence from the child, but because the child was dead. The young boy had been raped by the man whom I prosecuted, and molested over a long period of time. So I don't need to have people tell me about the horrors of child molestation. I have seen it. I remember being in a room and looking at that dead child, the same age as one of my children. And I remember the man who did it who would have done anything to escape my prosecution, and I worked day and night around the clock for weeks. I was a young prosecutor in my twenties, and I prosecuted him and convicted him. He went up on appeal to the Supreme Court--our Supreme Court--and I argued that appeal myself, and his conviction was upheld. So I know the need for this. Let's not let political ``gotcha'' games stop us from legislation that might protect these people. The Senator from Texas suggests I want more money. That is not quite what I said. He said he wanted $30 million based on fines. I said I just want to guarantee that $30 million was there. I think again of that child molester, that child murderer. He was just one of the many cases I prosecuted. We could have fined him $1 million or $20 million or $1 billion--or $200--and he would not have been able to pay it and wouldn't have paid it. If the victim had lived, there would be no money. All I want to make sure of--and I would be happy to see--is that if there are fines collected, that they go to help victims as they should. But if no money is collected from fines, I want to make sure there is money. We will prosecute somebody who has been involved with child trafficking or child molestation. We will prosecute them, as we should. They will go to prison and we will spend $25,000 to $35,000 a year of taxpayer dollars to keep them in prison, and we should. But we will say to the victim: I am sorry; we fined him $100,000 to go to the victims' fund, but he is basically judgment proof. I just want you to know we had good intentions. If he had paid that $100,000 fine, we would have given it to you to help you. But, gosh, go in peace. Have a good life. All I am saying is this: If there is money from a fine, sure. The Senator from Texas and I agree that it should be put in the Fund. But if there are no funds, don't promise a $30 million pot of money that will never be filled if there are no fines, if there is no money in it. If there is money from fines, put the money from fines in, but where there is a difference between the amount that is in there and the $30 million, then shouldn't we, as a country that spends trillions of dollars, give the difference between the fines and the actual $30 million? Shouldn't we care about these victims? Shouldn't we care about the people who are victimized? Shouldn't we also do this: If we have the money in there, we could take increased steps to prevent victims from becoming victims in the first place. I would have given anything if there had been some program, some money, to have found out that this child I talked about was being victimized, and then we could have stopped it before the State's attorney got called in to look at the dead body. How much better it would have been if we could have stopped it to begin with. So all I am saying is this: I am happy to work with the senior Senator from Texas on this bill, just as I was last year. We had a bill without this provision, and I was hoping and trying to get consent to bring it up and pass it when we had a bill without this provision. It is important to note, though, that when it didn't have this provision last year, I wish we could have passed it. Now let's work on a bill that will pass. If you want to score political points, do it on something that doesn't involve vulnerable children. Let's work together to get a bill passed that helps them. And let's make sure that on the point I raised, that we address this at some point. If there is going to be $30 million worth of fines that go in there, I am all for it. My guess is that we would be lucky to get a small percentage of that. Back when this came up in the House of Representatives, they rejected this method of funding, and they called it budgetary gimmickry. Actually, what the House did in authorizing the bill--they did what they were supposed to do. They authorized actual funding so we could stand up for the victims of human trafficking, not just stand here trying to score political points. In other words, let's have the money. Let's make sure the money is there. This is like saying: If you commit a crime, we are going to fine you $100 million or $300 million or $1 billion. But if the person never had more than a net worth of $1,000, what difference does it make? Put real teeth in here. Stop the traffickers, and ensure there is money to help the victims. Have money to help the victims. The distinguished Presiding Officer was one of the senators who testified at the Judiciary Committee hearing on human trafficking last month. Other senators testified as well. Their testimony had people tearing people up. The distinguished Presiding Officer was attorney general for her State. She understands the reality of this, as I do and others do. It has been years since I was State's attorney, but, I say to my friend from Texas, I still wake up some nights from nightmares about the crime scenes I went to. I would wake up from them at night when we were debating the Violence Against Women Act, and I am glad that Republicans and Democrats joined together on that both here and in the other body so we could pass it. A victim is a victim is a victim, not a number, not a concept. Those of us who have spent time with victims and those of us who have been at crime scenes of victims understand this. Too often victims could no longer speak, could no longer testify. We would hear about them at their funeral. We can do better. So let's not talk about who scores points or who doesn't score points. There are good people who worked on this, good people in both parties. We are not going to be voting on something tonight, I imagine. Let's spend the time between now and tomorrow sitting down and trying to work out a way forward. Save the political points for something where the most vulnerable in society do not suffer. We can talk about what we will do on stock frauds or who gets taxed or what regulations we will have for corporations. There, raise your points. Make political points there. But for anyone who has seen these victims and anyone who has talked with these victims and anyone who has been with these victims, they know this is not the time for politics. [[Page S1374]] Let's get together this evening or tomorrow. Let's work it out so we can have something that will really protect victims, something that will have real funding to protect them--not something illusion, but real funding. And maybe if we can do that, I might have less nightmares about some of those victims I saw. My friend from Texas was a judge; he certainly saw those cases. The Presiding Officer was attorney general; she saw those cases. We have a number of former prosecutors on both sides here. Any one of us who has handled these cases has to remember every single aspect of them. I remember preparing for trial in these cases, having young children at home. I would work late in the office. I wouldn't bring the materials home at all because I didn't want my kids to see what I was looking at. I will admit there is another reason: I didn't want my children to see their father cry as I read these police investigations. These aren't statistics; these are real people. Let's work together. I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. VITTER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. VITTER. Thank you, Madam President. I have an amendment at the desk which has been slightly modified from its original form, and I ask unanimous consent that it be called up. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there an objection? Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I will object until I have had a chance to see the modification. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard. Mr. VITTER. Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. VITTER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. VITTER. Madam President, I have now filed my slightly modified amendment--I will explain the modification in a minute--and it is at the desk. I ask unanimous consent to set aside the pending amendment so my amendment can be called up. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I object. Some Members on my side of the aisle have concerns about certain aspects of the Senator's amendment, so on their behalf, I object to setting aside the pending amendment. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard. Mr. VITTER. Madam President, I will explain and speak on this amendment even though it is not pending as we speak. I will also file an ongoing objection to anyone setting aside the pending amendment for another or for any votes being scheduled until this matter can be worked out. Mr. VITTER. Madam President, the amendment I have at the desk is about a very important issue. Before I explain what it is, I will say that I strongly support the underlying bill. I compliment Senator Cornyn and others who have worked on a bipartisan basis on this bill. I certainly look forward to supporting this bill irrespective of how the vote goes on my amendment, but I obviously hope my amendment is adopted in the context of this bill. Clearly, this issue of human trafficking is a very serious one. It takes many forms, all of them ugly. One form is a phenomenon I am going to talk about today, which is the issue of birth tourism and trafficking in women and families who want to get into this country in order to physically have their children in this country because present policy recognizes those children immediately as U.S. citizens simply because they were born in this country. This phenomenon of birth tourism is a very real one, and it often puts these birth mothers and families in very dangerous situations, quite frankly, at the hands of human smugglers or the equivalent. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to have two news reports which illustrate this phenomenon printed in the Record. The first news report is an article entitled ``No vacancy at California birth hotels,'' which underscores some of the abuses and horrendous conditions that go on as a result of this, and the second article is from the Washington Post, which is entitled ``Inside the shadowy world of birth tourism at `maternity hotels.' '' There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows: [From WorldMag.com, March 12, 2013] No Vacancy at California Birth Hotels (By Alaina Gillogly and Les Sillars) It started last summer. Neighbors of a tan, sunbaked mansion in Chino Hills, Calif, knew something was going on in the large Spanish-style home with stucco walls and a tiled roof overlooking the community. Cars sped up and down the quiet little road:And a remarkable number of pregnant Asian women came and went throughout the day. Then in September, disgruntled neighbors became anxious citizens when 2,000 gallons of raw sewage spilled down the hillside. City authorities discovered in the subsequent investigation that the seven-bedroom house had become a 17-room ``birth hotel.'' The 7,964-square-foot residence on Woodglen Drive had been housing up to 30 pregnant Chinese women who wanted to give birth to their children on American soil. Each room had matching bedding and furniture, room keys, monogrammed towels, and a portable hot water kettle. Last month, a local court shut down the operation, owned by Los Angeles Hermas Hotel Inc., for building code violations that included exposed wires, missing smoke alarms, improper ventilation, and carpet stretched over a 3-foot-wide hole in the floor. The owners have six months to fix the problems and get the proper business permits, or they face permanent closure. This operation was just one of about 15 baby hotels in the heavily Asian Chino Hills area, with dozens more around the country. ``Birth tourism'' has made the news recently, but the Chino Hills incident touched off a crackdown in California as local authorities apply zoning and building codes in an effort to control the operations. It's also reopened the debate over the Fourteenth Amendment. Birth hotels are legal in the U.S. because the Fourteenth Amendment gives citizenship to children born on American soil. They have the right to vote, immigrate from their parents' home country, and apply for permanent visas for their parents once they turn 21. Birth tourism is a rising industry in countries like China, South Korea, and Saudi Arabia. A three-month stay, plus medical fees, can easily run more than $50,000. Although the Chino Hills operation had a variety of safety and health issues, other birth hotels offer luxurious accommodations with chefs to prepare food from the home country. Recent studies by the National Center for Health Statistics have reported the number of babies born to non-resident women topped 7,000 per year, up 50 percent since 2000, although it's not clear how many are the result of birth tourism. That is a tiny fraction of the number of children born with at least one parent in the country illegally--350,000 in 2009, according to the Pew Hispanic Research Center. But critics say ``birth tourism'' is an abuse of an American law designed to enfranchise slaves born on American soil. ``The practice is a misinterpretation of the Fourteenth Amendment,'' said John Fonte, Hudson Institute senior fellow and director of the Center for American Common Culture. ``U.S. citizens should be very concerned.'' Some Californians are concerned. Rosanna Mitchell started a group called Not in Chino Hills to protest against the facility. ``Our mission is to keep a vigilant eye and use all our efforts necessary to do so,'' wrote Mitchell on the website. She told WORLD that, aside from worries about sanitation, traffic, and under-the-table businesses, she doubts those patronizing birth hotels are genuinely pursuing the American dream. ``Something needs to be done,'' she said. ``It's outrageous that they would take advantage of the U.S.'' Rep. Steve King, an Iowa Republican, introduced a bill in January to amend the Fourteenth Amendment to ``clarify'' that citizenship applies to those born in the U.S. provided at least one parent is a U.S. citizen, a lawful immigrant, or serving in the military. The bill, with 13 co-sponsors, is currently in committee. ____ [From the Washington Post, Mar. 5] Inside the Shadowy World of Birth Tourism at ``Maternity Hotels'' (By Abby Phillip) In luxury apartment complexes in Southern California and in grand, single-family homes in New York, ``maternity hotels'' are brimming with pregnant women and cooing newborn babies. For wealthy foreign women, the facilities offer the promise of a comfortable, worry- [[Page S1375]] free vacation complete with a major perk: a U.S. passport for their newborn. One such maternity hotel in New York resembled a nursery: Newborn babies rested in a row of bassinets that lined the wall, according to an NBC News report that offered a look inside the facility. Women who book rooms at these properties can expect to live in well-stocked apartment complexes or large suburban homes with laundry and catered food as part of the package. Once their babies are born in an American hospital, they are cared for by nurses while the mothers rest for at least a month. They can pass their time with shopping trips to luxury stores, trips to amusement parks or poolside at the ``hotel'' while attentive caretakers look after the infants, feeding, bathing and putting them to sleep on a regimented schedule, NBC News found. The cost--$40,000 to $80,000 per stay--is worth it for the prospect that the visitor's child will automatically be afforded the benefits given to U.S. citizens--and perhaps will have an easier time gaining legal residency in the United States when that child turns 21. ``For my baby, it's a chance to, a step to two countries'' cultures . . . Chinese culture and American culture,'' one woman told NBC. There's nothing illegal about foreign nationals giving birth in the United States. But traveling to the hotels requires the illegal practice of lying about the real reason for visiting the United States. Pregnant women purporting to be tourists enter the country in the latter stages of pregnancy, some overstaying their visas to recover in the comfort of the ``maternity hotels.'' Birth tourism companies have flourished in recent years, according to federal officials--and many of them prefer hard- to-track cash to fuel their operations. That money, federal officials allege, is being pocketed by a group of individuals who have skirted tax law, flouted immigration laws and helped their clients defraud U.S. hospitals of tens of thousands of dollars for each baby born. On Tuesday, federal agencies, including Immigration and Customs Enforcement and the IRS, along with the Los Angeles Police Department, conducted a massive operation to raid more than 30 California locations operated by ``birth tourism businesses.'' Officials collected piles of evidence that will likely be used against some of the ``maternity hotel'' operators in future prosecutions. The companies advertise their services online--and no foreign language skills are necessary to guess the subtext. What are the benefits of a U.S. passport for a foreign national's unborn child? ``Too many,'' the Web site of StarBabyCare explains to prospective clients. ``You can enjoy the free education from junior high school to public high school. . . . You can apply loans or grants which is only for the U.S. citizen. . . . You can receive your senior supplement benefits when you are living overseas. . . . To the parent, after the baby becomes an adult, he/she can petition the parents for a green card.'' According to court documents, an undercover investigator was told: ``The baby will then have a birth certificate and `freedom.' The baby will have a bright future having United States citizenship.'' Federal officials say that Chao Chen and Jie Zhu, the couple that operated the You Win baby tourism company, engaged in ``sham marriages'' to get green cards for themselves. In documents filed in federal court this week, officials said that the two ``divorced'' in 2012, but married U.S. citizens in Las Vegas months later. Both applied for permanent residency, and an immigration officer reviewing the cases noted that the marriages were ``suspect'' based on the timing. Such companies have openly encouraged women willing to pay for the service to commit visa fraud as well. They were counseled not to tell customs and immigration officials that they were pregnant, to wear loose clothes and to avoid traveling to the United States while looking visibly pregnant. ``U.S. might refuse entry due to the belly is too big,'' StarBabyCare's Web site informed potential customers. ``Therefore the size of the belly is quite important to determine when you should arrive in Los Angeles.'' According to court documents, birth tourists were told to avoid traveling directly.to Los Angeles International Airport from overseas, to avoid raising suspicion. They might even consider studying U.S. culture and booking recreational visits in order to make their travel seem more legitimate, the company advised. Alternate arrival ports such as Hawaii or Las Vegas were preferable. You Win paid more than $60,000 a year to rent Southern California apartments that housed the women, according to court documents. Federal officials believe that StarBabyCare operated a ``maternity hotel'' from at least 10 units at one complex. As more attention has been trained on the practice in recent years, the outrage has--predictably--followed. Los Angeles County officials have cited the ``hotels'' for illegally operating business in residential homes in 2013. Angry neighbors at a Chino Hills ``hotel'' picketed as the report became public. Among its findings: The 17-bedroom, 17- bathroom operation was blamed for overloading the septic tank in the community. Usually, the women participating in the programs paid several thousand dollars up front as a deposit and thousands more upon arrival in United States, according to investigators. The balance was paid after childbirth. But ``some or all'' of that money--which for You Win likely amounted to over $1 million--went unreported to federal authorities in 2013. ``Chen failed to report hundreds of thousands of dollars in income on his 2013 federal tax return,'' according to federal officials. As women went into birth, they were taken to local hospitals and declared jobless. As many as 400 babies associated with just one of these companies were born after 2013 in Orange County, Calif., hospitals. Despite the fact that many of these women paid tens of thousands of dollars to participate in the ``maternity hotel'' scheme, they claimed to be unable to pay the hospitals, which typically charged about $25,000 per birth. Some paid nothing at all, while others paid a fee closer to $4,000. No one was arrested during Tuesday's raids. But Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents collected evidence and potential witnesses for use in future prosecutions on tax, immigration and fraud charges. Mr. VITTER. Madam President, recently the Obama administration conducted a raid on some of these shadowy operations. I compliment them for doing that. There needs to be a crackdown on these operations, but the ultimate crackdown and ultimate solution is to change the policy of the Federal Government that recognizes these children immediately as U.S. citizens simply because they are physically born in this country even though both of their parents are here illegally. No parent is here under any sort of legal status, and that is the ultimate response and ultimate solution we need, and that is what my amendment--that I will call up as soon as that is allowed and get a vote on--is about. My amendment would change the present practice, policy, and law to say that only somebody born in this country who has at least one parent who is a U.S. citizen, a legal green card holder, or a serving member of the U.S. military, immediately gets that recognition as a U.S. citizen. As I suggested, this issue and practice--including this shadowy world of birth tourism and human smuggling--is a very serious issue. In fact, it is an exploding issue, as these recent cases in the press have brought to light. According to the Center for Immigration Studies, each year about 300,000 to 400,000 children are born to illegal aliens in the United States, and under our present practice, all of them are immediately recognized as U.S. citizens. This is a huge magnet for more illegal crossings into our country, often at the hands of very dangerous people. Birthright citizenship draws women from Mexico and Central America to make that dangerous trek north, often in the hands of coyotes and drug cartels. These women put their lives into the hands of criminal gangs with a demonstrated pension for sexual assault and sex trafficking. In addition, there is a huge business of birth tourism, including those who market to women and families in China. As I mentioned, on Tuesday, March 3, Federal agents broke up an alleged birth tourism ring in southern California, raiding several homes and apartment complexes where pregnant Chinese women, who were here on fraudulent visas, paid up to $80,000 in some cases so their babies would be born here. DHS and IRS investigators were seeking evidence and statements against those alleged in the scheme. Besides visa fraud, authorities are looking into possible tax and money laundering charges. As I referred to the news reports that are now part of the Record, in some cases this involves horrendous conditions and a very shadowy world in terms of this so-called birth tourism. The ultimate solution to this enormous magnet for illegal crossings-- often at the hands of very dangerous people--is to not recognize everyone who is simply born in the United States to be a citizen of the United States because of that fact alone. Again, that is what my amendment would do. That is far more effective than any set of raids on these operations or on any enforcement provisions. If we move toward this, we would be in the company of a huge majority of countries in the world. Of advanced economies, only Canada and the United States grant automatic citizenship to children born to illegal aliens. No European country does that. No other advanced industrialized country does [[Page S1376]] that, nor should we. As I suggested, it is a huge magnet for more and more illegal crossings, and my amendment would fix that. Some people will argue this is not possible with a statutory change. This is embedded in the U.S. Constitution through the 14th Amendment and any change would have to be a constitutional amendment. I believe that is not the case and is a result of a fundamental misunderstanding of the Constitution in this regard, including the 14th Amendment. The 14th Amendment does not say that all persons born in the United States are citizens, period, end of story. If we look at the precise language, it is very instructive. It states that citizenship extends to ``all persons born or naturalized in the United States and subject to the jurisdiction thereof.'' That latter phrase--``and subject to the jurisdiction thereof''--was included because it means something, and its original meaning clearly refers to the political allegiance of an individual and the jurisdiction that a foreign government has over that person. That is exactly why American Indians and their children were not immediately recognized as U.S. citizens simply because of their birth in this country. There was actually litigation about that going directly to this language of the 14th Amendment. The courts decided, no, the fact that these American Indian children were born in the United States in and of itself did not make them U.S. citizens because ``and subject to the jurisdiction thereof'' had a meaning. It meant these children could not be subject to any other governmental or quasi- governmental authority and an American Indian tribe was such an authority. Because of that litigation and interpretation, in order for those American Indian children to be recognized as American citizens, it actually took specific congressional action, and Congress passed the Indian Citizenship Act of 1924. I believe that goes directly to this issue that this practice is not embedded in the Constitution and in the 14th Amendment, and so that allows the statutory fix my language would offer. Senator Harry Reid, the minority leader, actually introduced a bill in 1993 titled the ``Immigration Stabilization Act,'' which included nearly identical language to my amendment and stand-alone bill. This language has broad support in the country, including broad bipartisan support. In Senator Reid's bill--now that is going back a ways--it stated ``in the exercise of its powers under section 5 of the 14th article of the amendment to the Constitution of the United States, the Congress has determined and hereby declares that any person born after the date of enactment of this title to a mother who is neither a citizen of the United States nor admitted to the United States as a lawful permanent resident will not be a U.S. citizen.'' So there we have language from a leading Democratic Member that goes to the same issue. There is broad bipartisan support, not just in the Congress but in the country for this fix, particularly in the context of these huge illegal alien flows into the country. I believe Americans recognize that we cannot continue to adopt and recognize this policy. It is an enormous magnet for the continuing flows of illegal aliens into the country. It brings up industries such as this shadowy world of birth tourism which was recently raided by Federal authorities. It puts those mothers and families in the hands of very unsavory criminal elements in many cases, and we should not allow this to continue. My amendment would stop that practice, stop those abuses, and stop encouraging those flows of illegal aliens. I strongly encourage the Senate to directly consider this amendment, vote on it, and to adopt it as part of this very important underlying bill. Finally, I ask unanimous consent to have two letters that were written by leading groups on immigration reform, FAIR and the Eagle Forum, printed in the Record. They are in strong support of this measure. I will submit additional letters of support as they develop over the next day or two. There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows: Federation for American Immigration Reform, Washington, DC, March 10, 2015. Hon. David Vitter, U.S. Senate, Hart Senate Office Building, Washington, DC. Dear Senator Vitter: I am writing to thank you for your efforts as a United States Senator to end birthright citizenship--the practice of automatically granting U.S. citizenship to anyone born in the United States, regardless of the parents' immigration status. Your amendment to the Justice for Victims of Trafficking Act of 2015 (S. 178) would close this loophole that is based on a misinterpretation of the 14th Amendment. Specifically, your amendment would amend the Constitution so that children born in the U.S. only gain citizenship automatically if one parent is either a U.S. citizen, legal permanent resident, or a non-immigrant active member of the Armed Forces. Your language is consistent with the intent behind the ``subject to the jurisdiction thereof' clause of excluding from automatic citizenship American-born persons whose allegiance to the United States is incomplete. Even the Obama Administration recognizes that the current practice of birthright citizenship encourages unlawful behavior and abuse of the system. Indeed, just last week federal and local law enforcement officials raided the Southern California offices of a company that encourages foreign pregnant women to come to the U.S. to give birth, promising them benefits like citizenship and free education. Known as ``birth tourism,'' these companies arrange for pregnant women to come to the U.S. and advise them to provide false information on visa applications. This particular Irvine business made approximately $2 million in 2013, with fees ranging from $15,000 to $50,000. Your amendment would end this magnet of illegal immigration because the U.S.-born children of illegal aliens will not be eligible to sponsor family members for legal permanent resident status (green cards) once they reach the age of twenty-one. Again, we thank you for sponsoring this commonsense legislation. Sincerely, Dan Stein, President. ____ Eagle Forum, Washington, DC, March 10, 2015. Dear Senator Vitter, On behalf of Eagle Forum and the families we represent, we express our support for your amendment to S. 178 ending the practice of birthright citizenship. Automatically granting citizenship to any child born on U.S. soil, even if the child's parents are temporary visitors or illegal aliens, cheapens the value of American citizenship. Action by Congress to clarify the long- misinterpreted intent of section 1 of the Fourteenth Amendment is both necessary and appropriate. Birthright citizenship is an invitation to exploit the benefits of American citizenship. Simply being born in our country, whatever the citizenship of the parents, entitles a child to government aid. It circumvents the lengthy process of naturalization, including the pledge of new citizens to ``support and defend the Constitution and laws of the United States.'' This loophole encourages illegal immigration and even ``birth tourism,'' which brings pregnant women to this country just in time to give birth. Both illegal immigration and birth tourism fuel human trafficking, which stems from a desire to claim the protections of our laws and the support of the welfare state. Permitting birthright citizenship is a misreading of the Fourteenth Amendment. The amendment states that U.S. citizens are ``all persons born or naturalized in the United States and subject to the jurisdiction thereof'' Those final five words are critical and clearly limit the application of the amendment. Visitors who are not U.S. citizens are ``subject to the jurisdiction'' of their country of origin, not the United States. Furthermore, the Constitution vests control over immigration law to Congress. It is past time for the legislative branch to exercise its power to end birthright citizenship. Eagle Forum thanks you for your leadership on this critical issue and stands ready to assist you. Faithfully, Phyllis Schlafly, Chairman. Mr. VITTER. I thank the Presiding Officer and yield the floor. Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. KIRK. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. KIRK. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to set aside the pending amendment to consider my amendment No. 273. Mr. LEAHY. Reserving the right to object, and I have to object. The Senator has the right, of course, to file his amendment, but there is an amendment presently pending and it would have to be set aside. There is [[Page S1377]] someone on this side who does not want it set aside, so I will object. Of course, the Senator can file his amendment, but the request, as I understand it, is to set aside the pending amendment. On behalf of several Senators on this side, I object. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard. Mr. KIRK. Madam President, I ask the Senator from Vermont if he opposes the amendment that was also cosponsored by Senator Feinstein. Mr. LEAHY. I don't know who is cosponsoring the amendment. Madam President, addressing the Senator through the Chair, as we are required to do by the Senate rules, I would say that my objection is to setting aside the pending amendment. I would further address the Senator from Illinois--but through the Chair--that when the amendment is up, I will be glad to look at it and take a position on it. Of course, he and I have known each other for a long time. I will be happy to tell him whether I will vote for it or not. Mr. KIRK. Madam President, I would say that this amendment is directed at backpage.com, probably the largest provider of online slavery services in the United States. I would hope the Senator is not defending Lacey and Larkin, who make $30 million a year off of slavery. Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, to respond to the Senator, I may very well support his amendment. The technical question is, Should the amendment of the Senator from Ohio be set aside so that this one may be the one pending? On that issue, there is objection. When the Senator's amendment is pending before the Senate, it may very well be one I will vote for, and I will be happy to discuss it at that time. Mr. KIRK. I thank the Senator. Madam President, this is an amendment that is directed at attacking backpage.com, which stands on the principle that was well established in the Civil War--that we Americans have freedom and we should not be free to enslave other Americans. I think, as the largest provider of online slavery services, Lacey and Larkin should be put out of business. I think it is incumbent on us, in the underlying legislation--I would remind the Senator from Vermont that we would live up to the full spirit of this legislation to make sure that just because the Internet was invented, slavery should not be empowered by the Internet. Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, will the Senator yield for a question? Mr. KIRK. Yes, I will yield. Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, through the Chair, I ask my friend from Illinois, who has been a warrior on these issues, particularly with this backpage.com and this advertisement of children and other people trafficked as part of this modern day slavery, if the Senator's amendment, the HERO Act, is actually included, if I am not mistaken. Mr. KIRK. Amendment No. 273 would include the SAVE Act, which has already substantially passed with huge bipartisan support of the party of the Senator from Vermont in the House of Representatives. If we look, we will find that backpage.com is active in every State, providing online services to the public. Mr. CORNYN. My question and point was that the SAVE Act, I understand, is the subject of the amendment that the Senator is seeking to offer and for which I hope our friends on the other side will relent and allow us to go forward, debating and amending this important piece of legislation. As distinguished from the SAVE Act, which is the subject of the Senator's your amendment, the HERO Act, I believe is already a part of the underlying legislation. I just wanted to congratulate the Senator from Illinois and thank him for his longstanding dedication to this issue and the contribution he has made to the underlying piece of legislation. Mr. KIRK. As a Senator from Illinois, our true gift to the people of this country has been individual freedom and dignity, epitomized by the Lincoln candidacy for the Senate, and by the victory in the Civil War. We should not allow the freedom of the Internet to allow freedom to enslave others. These two men have made tens of millions of dollars. I yield back to the distinguished majority whip. Mr. CORNYN. I would just ask the Senator to yield for one final question. Would the Senator please outline his bill, his amendment, the SAVE Act? Mr. KIRK. The critical issue is how to restrict the ability of Americans to enslave each other. I don't think we should have that freedom. We want to make sure we thread the needle very carefully here, to make sure the freedom and commerce available on the Internet is not going to help people such as Lacey and Larkin to enslave others. We want to make sure that there is an ever-widening sphere of freedom inside the United States that is not inhibited by the Internet. Mr. CORNYN. I would ask, is the Senator's amendment targeted in a way that respects the freedom of the Internet and the right of the people? Mr. KIRK. Very much so. The way we thread the needle here is to make online providers of slavery services liable for the costs that local governments incur in cleaning up the mess they create. In the case of Cook County, IL, we have had our crusading sheriff, who I would note is also a Democratic sheriff, establish a great effort to recover the young, underage girls involved and to make sure the costs incurred in helping out these young women--these citizens of the United States--to make sure they can charge it against the online provider, which makes eminent sense. I would say that our freedoms are protected because Tom Dart was elected by the people of Cook County. As an elected official, he is trying to simply carry out his goal there. This makes eminent sense to do this. Mr. CORNYN. I thank the Senator. Mr. KIRK. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire. Mrs. SHAHEEN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in morning business. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Remembering Jonathan Myrick Daniels Mrs. SHAHEEN. Madam President, this past weekend we saw a huge commemoration of the 50th anniversary of the Selma to Montgomery voting rights march. I rise to honor the work and sacrifice of Jonathan Myrick Daniels. He was a young Episcopalian seminary student from Keene. The Presiding Officer certainly knows his name and Keene, as well. He was from Keene, NH, and he answered the call of Rev. Martin Luther King, Jr., for clergy to travel to Alabama to join him on that march. Jonathan lost his life 5 months later, in an act that Reverend King called ``one of the most heroic Christian deeds of which I have heard in my entire ministry.'' Although Jonathan had originally intended to spend a short time in the South and then return to his studies at the Episcopal theological school in Boston, he felt compelled by events to remain in Alabama through the spring and summer to register voters with the Episcopalian Society for Cultural and Racial Unity. On August 14, 1965, Jonathan was arrested along with a number of other civil rights activists at a demonstration in Fort Deposit, AL, a small town outside of Montgomery. They had gone there to protest segregation in the town's stores. But their demonstration was over within minutes. Armed white men from the town descended on them and took them to jail. Jonathan and his fellow activists spent 6 days in the Hayneville jail. Many in the group were still teenagers. Despite the conditions, Jonathan somehow maintained an unflaggingly upbeat attitude and good humor. He wrote his mother in New Hampshire a brief letter from the jail, apologetically describing it as a peculiar birthday card for her. He wrote: The food is vile and we aren't allowed to bathe (whew!) . . . As you can imagine, I'll have a tale or two to swap over our next martini. He declined an offer of bail money from an Episcopal organization because the amount would not have covered the release of the rest of his group. On Friday, August 20, the whole group was suddenly released. Strangely, their bail had been waived, but no one was there to meet them or take them home. The town seemed completely deserted. Jonathan and a few others walked a block away to a store to buy something to eat and drink. As he climbed the steps of the porch to the store, he suddenly heard someone shout from inside [[Page S1378]] and threaten to shoot if they didn't leave. Jonathan barely had time to react before the man opened fire, but somehow he managed to jump in front of his friend Ruby Sales, a 17-year-old African-American girl. He saved Ruby's life, but Jonathan was killed by the close-range shot that was intended for her. He was just 26 years old. The shooter called the murder in to the sheriff's office himself. He said: I just shot two preachers. You better get on down here. An all- white jury later acquitted the man, taking just 2 hours to find him not guilty. While Jonathan was sacrificing his life for civil rights in Alabama, here in the Senate debate raged over the Federal Government's role in protecting the voting rights of disfranchised American citizens. Since 1870 the 15th Amendment to the Constitution had prohibited State governments from denying a citizen's right to vote based on race. However, in precincts throughout the South, Black Americans were subjected to discriminatory poll taxes, literacy tests, and other forms of voter intimidation. In many places, town clerks outright refused to register Black voters. Just 2 weeks before Jonathan was killed, Congress finally passed the Voting Rights Act, which outlawed electoral practices that discriminated against minority groups. Well, 2015 marks the 50th anniversary not just of that march in Selma but of this landmark law. While this anniversary presents an obvious time for reflection, it is also a time to look forward and address the challenges still facing our country. The impact of the Supreme Court's 2013 ruling in Shelby County v. Holder, which struck down a critical section of the law requiring Federal approval for electoral law changes in districts with the history of discrimination, is particularly troubling. This ruling now allows States to implement restrictive voting requirements that will make it more difficult for voters to cast their ballots. In fact, since this ruling, almost all of the affected States have already begun attempts to restrict voting, targeting seniors, students, minorities, and threatening their access to the polls. The right to make your voice heard as a citizen of this Nation is a fundamental principle of our democracy, and it should never be infringed upon. We have a responsibility to protect this right and address these injustices. While our Nation has made a lot of progress since the 1960s and 1970s, the struggle is far from over. Inequality and racism remain in our society. As long as discrimination and racial disparities exist, the full protections of the Voting Rights Act are necessary to guarantee the rights of citizenship for every American. Jonathan Daniels should be turning 76 years old in March. He is widely recognized as a martyr of the 20th century. In Keene, his hometown, an elementary school bears his name. As we mark the 50th anniversary of his passing, as well as the passage of the Voting Rights Act, we must strive to honor his legacy by ensuring that all current and future American citizens can exercise the rights he died to protect. I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Gardner). Without objection, it is so ordered. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 40 (Tuesday, March 10, 2015)] [Senate] [Pages S1366-S1378] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] JUSTICE FOR VICTIMS OF TRAFFICKING ACT OF 2015--Continued The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana. Mr. CASSIDY. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss a serious crime and a violation of human rights that must be stopped--human trafficking. It is a form of modern-day slavery, people profiting from the control and exploitation of others. I rise as a doc, a fellow who has practiced in the public hospital system for 32 years, understanding the unique role nurses, physicians, and other health care providers play in this issue. Health care providers are frontline and one of the few to interact directly [[Page S1367]] with trafficked women and children. A recent survey published in the Annals of Health Law reports that 28 percent of trafficked women sought a health care professional while being held captive. Now, this does not mean that the nurse, the doctor or other health care provider had the training to recognize it, but because of the unique and critical involvement with these victims, it is important these health care providers do have the tested tools and training to identify and help those being trafficked. The Trafficking Awareness Training for Health Care amendment would save lives and, as importantly, would begin the rebuilding of lives destroyed by modern-day slavery. It would provide for the development of best practices to enable health care workers to recognize and assist victims of human trafficking. It is proven that many trafficking victims report receiving health care from federally funded clinics and emergency rooms while in captivity yet, as I mentioned earlier, they go undetected. This legislation would improve the awareness of health care workers, ultimately helping these victims. Senator Tim Kaine recently spoke about a missive that Pope Francis gave on Ash Wednesday, calling for us to be ``islands of mercy in a sea of indifference.'' The ethic of nurses, physicians, and other health care workers is to be that merciful creature. This would give them the training to better enable them to be that ``island'' in what for that woman or child caught in captivity must seem a ``sea of indifference.'' Having passed the House by unanimous consent, this amendment represents a bipartisan effort that will enable the medical community to bring relief to those suffering in ways that those of us who have never been there cannot imagine. Senator Peters is joining me in this bipartisan effort. I urge my colleagues to support this amendment and help transform victims of trafficking into survivors and people who blossom. I yield back. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The President pro tempore. Authorizing The Use Of Force Against The Islamic State Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss one of the most critical national security challenges facing the Senate: specifically, how we should craft an authorization for the use of military force against the terrorist organization known as the Islamic State. I have spoken before on the floor about what I believe the outline of an authorization should contain. Now that the President has released his proposal--and with Secretary Kerry, Secretary Carter, and General Dempsey slated to testify tomorrow on behalf of this proposal--I feel compelled to address this topic in greater detail. Before delving into the specifics of the administration's proposed authorization, we should consider how this institution has grappled with these vital questions throughout our Nation's history. Dating back to 1798, Congress has on several occasions enacted legislation short of a formal declaration of war authorizing the use of military force by the President. In the late 18th and early 19th centuries, Congress authorized U.S. naval action against both state and non-state actors who attacked U.S. commercial vessels. More recent authorizations formally passed by the Congress include those intended to protect the Middle East, Taiwan, and Southeast Asia from communist aggression in the 1950s and 1960s. And since the end of the Cold War, we have passed authorizations concerning Lebanon, the September 11 attacks, and Iraq-- all in 1991 and in 2002. I voted for those latter four authorizations here in this Chamber. Each case was unique, but in every case the White House did not send the Congress ``take it or leave it'' language. Rather, the Senate and the House fashioned text that represented a negotiated outcome with the White House and within Congress. For example, Presidents Eisenhower and George H.W. Bush worked closely with Congress to obtain strong authorizations for the use of military force, despite Democrats controlling both Chambers. President George W. Bush twice did the same with a Democrat-led Senate. This approach yielded concrete benefits--a more thoughtful debate and strategy around our use of force, greater unity in supporting our military, and congressional willingness to fulfill our constitutional responsibilities. Historically, the Senate has fulfilled its role as a place of intelligent, informed debate in moving authorizations for use of military force. We must do so again as we consider this authorization to combat the Islamic State. Thirteen years ago, as the Senate began to deliberate over an authorization to rid Iraq of its violent dictator, I said: We all must leave our political party affiliations at the door when it comes to our national security and supporting our troops in the field. It is time for Congress to come together, to hold a public debate, and to craft the right authorization to defeat the Islamic State. Turning to the proposed authorization before us today, I agree with the legal interpretation offered by the Obama administration that the executive branch has the power to conduct operations against the Islamic State under article II of the Constitution and the existing authorizations from 2001 and 2002. Unfortunately, the administration has undermined the credibility of its own proposal by continuously changing its position as to how the 2001 and 2002 authorizations should be employed. Therefore, in order to settle any legal questions about the power to use force against the Islamic State--and to demonstrate America's resolve in this fight against terror--I firmly believe that a new authorization should be enacted. Accordingly, the senior Senator from Oklahoma and I discussed in this Chamber last month three principles that we believe should be included in a new authorization for the use of military force against the Islamic State. First, the authorization must clearly articulate that the executive branch is authorized to use force--employed in accordance with the law of war--against the Islamic State. Second, the authorization must be flexible enough to be used against the Islamic State as it appears today but also in whatever form the Islamic State transforms into in the future. This flexibility must include the authority to use force against organizations that associate with or support the Islamic State. Finally, and most importantly, the authorization must not impose any artificial and unnecessary limitations, such as those based on time, geography, and type of force, which could interfere with our strategic objective of defeating the Islamic State. Unfortunately, the President's draft authorization does not fully adhere to these principles. First, the President's proposal ``does not authorize the use of the United States Armed Forces in enduring offensive ground operations.'' Obviously, this is an unwise artificial limitation on what type of forces we can employ. But the President's proposed operative text offers little to define what this restriction entails. Therefore, my initial reaction, one that is widely shared, is: What does this restriction mean? To be fair, the President's introductory letter that accompanied his draft does provide some insight into the administration's interpretation of this phrase. Specifically, the President argues that the authorization would provide him with the power to conduct rescue operations, to provide advice and assistance to partner forces, and to deploy the use of Special Forces in missions against the Islamic State's leadership, intelligence collection, and targeting missions. But in laying out his vision, the President's proposal also tells our enemies what he is not prepared to do. Knowing these limitations would provide the Islamic State with a critical advantage: The terrorists would exploit this information in crafting their strategies. Why would we telegraph our strategy to our enemies? The President's proposed legal limitations will also limit our ability to adjust our strategy as needed based on the military situation on the ground. For example, when our counterterrorism strategy in Iraq faltered during the mid 2000s, we changed it and we adopted a new counterinsurgency strategy commonly called the surge. As we all know, the surge was a great success. Therefore, ensuring any authorization has the flexibility to allow our [[Page S1368]] forces to change and adapt their strategies and tactics is essential. Imposing the President's proposed artificial and unnecessary, yet legally binding, restrictions on our forces would be a colossal mistake. Indeed, General Jack Keane, who devised the principles of the surge, recently testified before the Senate Armed Services Committee about his own proposal as to how to conduct operations against the Islamic State. In his testimony, the general did advocate using Special Forces in a similar manner to what the President discussed in his letter accompanying his proposal. But the general went further. He stated that the United States and our coalition partners should position combat brigades in Kuwait if our current operation ``stalls or is defeated.'' Obviously, the use of combat brigades would be prohibited under the President's proposal. Therefore, if the President's limited operations are not successful and additional ground forces are required, adopting the President's proposal would create significant uncertainty. This raises the question: Would Congress need to debate and pass yet another authorization before those units could be used in combat? On its face, this would be completely impractical and hardly in our national security interest. Another area in which the President's proposal does not provide sufficient flexibility is its 3-year time limitation. Simply put, if we advertise when the authorization expires at an arbitrary date and time, will our enemies not hunker down and wait for that date? Secretary of State John Kerry stated in his previous testimony before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee that the administration does not believe a new authorization should include a geographic limitation. To its credit, the President's proposal does not. Specifically, the Secretary argued: ``In our view, it would be a mistake to advertise to ISIL that there are safe havens for them outside of Iraq and Syria.'' Undoubtedly, the Secretary was concerned about creating artificial limitations that could negatively affect our ability to conduct necessary military operations. He is right. But his concern should extend to the other artificial restrictions that appear in this proposal. How else can we read the prohibition of ``enduring offensive ground combat operations'' and a 3-year time limitation? In conclusion, we can do better. Our forces must have the flexibility to use, or the ability to threaten to use, whatever tools and strategies are necessary to defeat the Islamic State. When America enters into a fight, we should enter to win. And we should not just do this in a halfhearted, stupid way. So I hope the White House will reconsider some of the things that they have advocated and that they have set forth and get this thing done right so that if we are going to enter into warfare, we ought to know what we are doing and ought to have the tools and the legal legalities to be able to do it well. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Hoeven). The minority leader. Mr. REID. Mr. President, what is the business before the Senate? The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate is considering S. 178. Mr. REID.

The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, reserving the right to object. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator cannot reserve the right to object. Is there objection? Without objection, it is so ordered. The Senator from Ohio. Mr. PORTMAN. Mr. President, I know the Presiding Officer has other places to be, and I am going to be presiding in the chair in a moment. I will not offer amendments because my understanding is that even though we are on the bill, my colleagues on the other side of the aisle don't want me to offer noncontroversial amendments. So I will wait until they are ready for that just to keep the peace on the floor, but I will talk about the amendments because they are incredibly important to the underlying legislation. We are talking about the human trafficking legislation. This is something that as cochair and cofounder of the Human Trafficking Caucus, as a father, and as someone who represents the citizens of Ohio, who are directly affected by this, I have a strong interest. I am delighted the Senate is taking up this legislation. I do hope it will be not just bipartisan but nonpartisan. I do not see any reason for it not to move forward in the Senate, changing some of these laws that are in desperate need of changing to ensure that this horrific practice of human trafficking and sex trafficking can be curbed. It can be minimized by legislation that this Chamber should have taken up, in my view, some time ago. We really haven't been at this subject for a decade. We know a lot more about the problem now. We know, unfortunately, that about 300,000 of our youth are subject to human trafficking--about 1,000 in my home State of Ohio alone. The amendments I will offer--once someone on this side comes to the floor who will allow me to offer them--have to do with human trafficking in the broadest sense. The first amendment has to do with those people who are, unfortunately, trapped in sex trafficking being treated not as criminals but as victims and with ensuring that those victims get the proper care they need and the help to be able to get back on their feet. These are young people--we are told many times--who are between the ages of 11 and 13 when they are first exposed to human trafficking, in this case sex trafficking. In fact, that is the average age, we are told. Having talked to some of the victims at home, having talked to some of those who are in the trenches working, trying to help these young women, girls, young men, and boys, this legislation is badly needed to ensure we are looking at this--not again as a criminal matter but--as victims who deserve our support. Specifically, it requires that every State put together a plan to improve child protection services--containing, among other things, provisions and procedures requiring identification and assessments of all reports involving children known or to be suspected victims of sex trafficking--with better information and better data, a description of efforts to coordinate State law enforcement, child welfare agencies, and juvenile justice agencies such as runaway and homeless youth shelters to help serve these victims. Finally, this legislation calls for an annual State report on the number of children identified as known or suspected to be a victim of sex trafficking. The other amendment I am going to offer will be an amendment with regard to homeless children and youth. As has been discussed on this floor before, the HUD definition of homelessness practically excludes the most common situations for families and unaccompanied youths--and that would be staying in motels or temporarily with others because there is no place else for them to stay. Even if local communities identified these families or youth as having the most pressing unmet needs, communities can't use the HUD homeless assistance funds to serve them except in extremely limited or near-impossible conditions. This is related to human trafficking and also to sex trafficking in that, unfortunately, many of these young people involved in these situations--where they are homeless, where they are not on the street but are going from house to house or perhaps staying in a motel--are targeted by these traffickers. I believe these two amendments, which are not only bipartisan--and they are; I have support on both sides of the aisle--but are also nonpartisan and are ones that would be appropriate to include in the legislation. At the appropriate time I will offer those amendments. [[Page S1369]] The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont. Mr. LEAHY. We need to confer for a couple of minutes.

Mr. PORTMAN. Mr. President, this is the homeless and youth amendment I spoke about a moment ago. I thank everyone for their indulgence. I am pleased to have these amendments offered, and we will have an opportunity to speak on these amendments and another amendment I plan to offer later. I yield back the remainder of my time. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. (Mr. PORTMAN assumed the Chair.) Mr. PORTMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Lankford). Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. PORTMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to offer my support to the underlying legislation we are considering on the floor today. This is the most significant antitrafficking legislation to come before the Senate in over a decade. As I said earlier when I offered a couple of amendments, I am very pleased to be in this body on a nonpartisan basis, not just a bipartisan basis, to be able to address this issue, and I would like to thank the Senators who have worked hard in their committees to make that possible. I thank Senators Cornyn and Klobuchar for their work. I see Senator Wyden is here, Senator Leahy is here, Senator Grassley is here, and others who have been involved with this. They and their staffs are to be commended. It has been a good process. It is an issue a lot of us care about. Why? Because it is one that affects our States and our constituents in very significant ways. Last year I cofounded and I now cochair the Caucus on Human Trafficking with Senator Blumenthal, and we have had a number of good meetings and conferences here on the Hill bringing experts together and raising awareness of this issue. Unfortunately, this horrible crime affects every single part of our country. In Ohio this came to my attention initially because in parts of Ohio, along the I-75 corridor, particularly in Toledo, there were higher incidences of prosecutions of human trafficking. A school group actually brought this to my attention several years ago. The more we looked into it, the more we realized that this affects so many of our constituents, and it particularly affects the most vulnerable in our society--children, runaways, the missing. In the greatest country on the face of the Earth, almost 300,000 of our American children are at risk of trafficking and commercial sexual exploitation, more than 1,000 each year in Ohio alone. In 2000 I did support the last major bill that directly addressed this growing problem of human trafficking. It was called the Trafficking Victims Protection Act. And I supported the reauthorization in 2011. But since that time we have learned a lot more about the problem. We now know more about how to eradicate what is really a modern form of slavery. Our new legislation, which is called the Justice for Victims of Trafficking Act of 2015, builds on what we know works, and it strengthens protections for the victims. I would like to take a moment, if I could, to talk about two of the bills that are contained within this underlying legislation that are the product of a lot of bipartisan work that exemplifies some of the finest traditions of this body. The first is the Bringing Missing Children Home Act. The Bringing Missing Children Home Act is something I coauthored with Senator Schumer on the other side of the aisle, and we did it because we know there is unfortunately a strong correlation between victims of sex trafficking and children who have recently been in and out of the child welfare system. We also know that children who have run away or who are missing are the most vulnerable to being abused, trafficked, and exploited. In 2014 an FBI sting recovered 168 children who were victims of sex trafficking. Nearly each one of those children--nearly all of them had been involved in some kind of foster care or the child welfare system. Many of them had been reported missing--by the way, with insufficient information to find them. It is a strong correlation, and it is one that any effort to stop human trafficking must also address. That is what my legislation does. The Bringing Missing Children Home Act strengthens law enforcement reporting and response procedures, making it easier to communicate and work with child welfare agencies. It accomplishes this in a number of ways. First, it amends the current Missing Children's Assistance Act so that Federal law makes clear that children who are trafficked or sexually exploited are treated as victims and not as criminals. You will hear this in this debate, and this is one of the great underlying aspects of this legislation, we are changing the way we look at this, to understand that there is simply no such thing as a child prostitute. Second, this legislation requires law enforcement to update their records of missing children within 30 days with all the relevant information obtained during the initial investigation. This is very important because this new information will allow us to find these children more easily and more quickly, to avoid them falling into the trap of sexual trafficking and traffickers. Specifically, the bill requires new dental and medical records, as well as photograph, if available. For almost all of these children, there is a photograph available if you take the time to try to find it. I can't stress this last part enough. It is so hard to find these kids, and without having a photograph, it is made much more difficult. Yet in most instances we apparently don't. We tracked this in Ohio. Let me give an interesting statistic. Since January 1 of this year there have been 87 children reported missing in the State of Ohio--87 kids. We only have photographs for 21 of them, so for 66 of these young people we have no photographs. It is tough to find them when you don't know what they look like. This bill will help change that. Third, it requires law enforcement to work directly with State and local child welfare systems after someone is reported missing so that all the relevant information can be obtained as quickly as possible. Finally, it removes all the roadblocks that prevent State attorneys general from modifying records in the National Crime Information Center. We want these records to be updated [[Page S1371]] constantly as new information is provided. To put it simply, we think it is a commonsense bill that streamlines how missing children cases are handled. It makes it easier to share information that could lead to recovery. The second bill I wish to talk about that is part of this underlying legislation is called the Combat Human Trafficking Act which I coauthored with Senator Feinstein. The Bringing Missing Children Home Act is about helping victims. This legislation, the Combat Human Trafficking Act, is about punishing the traffickers. We start by giving prosecutors expanded tools to put traffickers behind bars. Our legislation enlarges the number of charges Federal prosecutors can level against traffickers and those who conspire with them. It also makes those engaged in trafficking strictly liable for their crimes. We also expand the training available for our Federal law enforcement tasked with investigating and prosecuting traffickers, and we require that the Bureau of Justice Statistics prepare an annual report detailing our success in this fight. Just as importantly, this bill strengthens victims' rights by providing more information to victims on ongoing prosecutions, requiring them to be informed in a timely manner of any plea agreements or prosecution agreements in cases in which they are involved. The legislation we are considering passed out of the committee unanimously for a reason. There are things that do divide us in this place. We talk about those a lot, and everybody reads and hears about them. But this is an exception. This is about bringing us together, in this case to protect our kids from human trafficking. Human traffickers and sexual trafficking are issues on which we should not have any divide. This is legislation both Republicans and Democrats can enthusiastically support. Earlier today I joined with some of my colleagues in introducing some amendments to the legislation because although I support the underlying bill--it is a good bill--it can be made even better, and I am looking forward to the debate. In the process, I hope we will raise awareness about the issue, raise consciousness about the issue not just among our colleagues and around Capitol Hill but around the country because ultimately, if we are going to solve this problem in our communities, everyone needs to be part of it, everyone needs to be vigilant, and everyone needs to understand that this happens in your community, it happens in your State, and it happens, unfortunately, in our country. If we can raise awareness about this wicked practice of human trafficking and sex trafficking, that would do a lot to try to curb it, to reduce it, and eventually to stop it. This is what we came to Washington to do--to pass legislation that actually helps back home. With this legislation, we can stand together to protect the most innocent among us from the most heinous of crimes. I thank you the Presiding Officer. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the remarks I am going to make now not be part of the remarks on the bill that is before the Senate. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. (The remarks of Mr. Grassley are printed in today's Record under ``Morning Business.'') Mr. GRASSLEY. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, yesterday the Democratic leader, Senator Reid, told us that Democrats and Republicans could finally agree on one thing; that is, we ought to focus not on the partisan politics and the ideology that so often divides us, but we ought to focus on the victims of human trafficking, largely middle school-age girls who are bought and sold like commodities. I came to the floor yesterday and said that I believe we are all created in the image of God, and it is a sin, it is the very personification of evil for people to treat those same human beings as if they were things. That is what the scourge of human trafficking is all about. I was very glad to see that finally we seemed to be chipping away at the dysfunction of the Senate that we have experienced over the last few years and, in the new majority, given an opportunity for an open amendment process on a subject that we all agree needs to be dealt with that we could work on together. So imagine my surprise when earlier today the same Democratic leader said the Democrats were going to filibuster this anti-human trafficking legislation. Why in the world would they take a 180-degree turn? Why would they do such an about-face or flip-flop? Well, they said because there was language contained in the bill they disagreed with. No, they didn't say they would use this open amendment process to file an amendment and have a vote to strip it out or to modify it or otherwise change it; they said: We are going to block the bill; it is dead unless this language comes out. Yet they do nothing to try to effect that outcome. We might wonder what this language is that they are so upset about that they would literally kick the tens of thousands of children and other victims to the curb because of their outrage that this language is contained in this legislation. Well, imagine my surprise to find out that the reason why the Democratic minority is going to filibuster this antitrafficking bill is because they object to language that has been the law of the land for 39 years--39 years. So I guess they woke up this morning and thought, well, we better do something about it. What is the provision that causes them so much discomfort, that they are so upset about that they are willing to block this legislation? Well, it is something called the Hyde amendment. Basically what that does is it prohibits the use of taxpayer funds for abortions. I realize that in America we are of different minds on the subject of abortion. I am proudly pro-life, but others in our Senate are pro- choice, and we probably have a whole spectrum of views on this very personal issue. But we have had a bipartisan consensus--unanimity almost--for the last 39 years that whatever else the law is, as handed down by the Supreme Court or by Congress, we are not going to use taxpayer funds for abortion. So imagine my surprise when that very language and very reference was included in the Justice for Victims of Trafficking Act bill that now today I find out for the first time our Democratic friends object to. Imagine my surprise when that very language was part of the bill that was filed in mid-January and a month later was marked up and voted on in the Senate Judiciary Committee and all members of the Judiciary Committee, Democrats and Republicans alike, voted for it. They voted for it unanimously. Well, I don't believe that was a mistake. Our friends across the aisle have outstanding staff. They are very talented people. I don't always agree with them, but they are good at what they do. I don't believe for a minute that they would have missed a reference in this legislation to a restriction on funding taxpayer- provided abortions, and I don't believe that those staff members, being the diligent professionals they are, didn't tell their principal, their member of the Senate Judiciary Committee. So this idea that there has been some kind of ambush is preposterous. It is just not credible. Well, imagine my surprise when not only did we have a 15-to-0 vote, I believe it was--in other words, a unanimous vote of the Judiciary Committee--for this bill, we have Democratic cosponsors of this bill. Not only do they support the bill, they have been actively working with us on the legislation. Just looking at the face of the bill, I count 10 Democratic cosponsors. Do you think they didn't read the [[Page S1372]] bill before they put their names on it? Do you think their staffs didn't tell them what is in the bill? Well, as we all know, this sort of thing is ordinarily very hotly debated. There are no shrinking violets in the U.S. Senate, no people who sit passively on the sidelines and say: Well, I better not speak up and express my views. That doesn't happen. We have strong-willed, talented people on both sides of the aisle, and there are no shrinking violets. Let's just lay that to rest. People are willing to speak up, and they do speak up every day, every hour, virtually every minute on things they feel strongly about. So this idea that we have created an ambush, that we have surprised our colleagues by including this language in a bill that is on the floor, the Justice for Victims of Trafficking Act--voted unanimously out of the Judiciary Committee, all Republicans and all Democrats, with 10 Democratic cosponsors--that we have somehow surprised them by including this restriction on taxpayer-funded abortion that has been the law of the land for 39 years is patently ridiculous. It is just not believable. Let me provide a little more information. The reference in the bill is on page 50 under limitations. It says: ``Amounts in the Fund, or otherwise transferred from the Fund''--that is, the crime victims compensation fund created by this legislation, $30 million that goes to help treat victims and help them heal and get on with their lives--this bill says that this fund ``shall be subject to the limitations on the use or expending of amounts described in sections 506 and 507 of division H of the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2014 . . . to the same extent as if amounts in the Fund were funds appropriated under division H of such Act.'' I went to see how many Democrats voted for that consolidated appropriations act in 2014 that contained the Hyde amendment language and the limitations on taxpayer-funded abortions. Imagine my surprise when I saw that 55 Democrats voted for that language in the 2014 consolidated appropriations bill that is referred to on pages 50 and 51 of the Justice for Victims of Trafficking Act. This is the same bill the Democratic leader said Democrats were going to filibuster because they were so outraged, they were surprised, they were bushwhacked, they were ambushed, they were tricked. Twenty-three Democrats voted for that same appropriation language in 2014. But it gets better--or worse, as the case may be. Democrats have supported legislation consistent with the Hyde amendment for a long time. As I have said, it has been the law of the land for 39 years. When was the last time? Well, the Department of Homeland Security funding. Remember this back-and-forth we had over the defunding of the President's Executive action on immigration that so many on our side of the aisle are upset about because it is not within the President's authority to do it--and that is not just my opinion; it is the Federal judge's in Brownsville who has issued a preliminary injunction--but how many Democrats voted for the Department of Homeland Security funding bill that contains that same limitation on taxpayer funding for abortions? Forty-five Democrats voted for it. So imagine my surprise when 45 Democrats recently voted for that appropriations bill to come to the Senate today and be told: We are outraged. We are never going to support that. And, by the way, we didn't know it was in the bill when we voted for it in the Judiciary Committee or when we cosponsored the bill. Well, they presumably knew about it when they voted for the Department of Homeland Security funding in February of 2015, when 32 of them voted for the CR omni or CRomni in December of 2014. And, oh, by the way, remember ObamaCare? Every single Democrat voted to support ObamaCare which contained the same restriction on taxpayer funding for abortions. They have also voted for the Children's Health Insurance Program, the so-called SCHIP, for Defense authorization bills. In other words, our Democratic friends have voted time and time and time again for the exact same language they now say they are going to filibuster on the Justice for Victims of Trafficking Act, language they said they weren't aware of when they voted for it--they didn't read it, their staff didn't tell them about it. Well, if that is true, I would get new staff. But I know the staff on the Democratic side, like the staff on the Republican side, are highly professional people and they wouldn't fail to identify offensive language that their Senator could not and would not and never has voted for, or they would be out of a job. So I plead with our Democratic friends, please don't make this Justice for Victims of Trafficking Act another political football. For heaven's sake, if we can't agree to protect the most vulnerable victims of this heinous crime, what can we ever agree on? If we can't agree on that, if we are going to try to find a way to flyspeck legislation and say, well, I won't allow this bill to go forward if that language is included in there--even though it has been the law of the land for 39 years, even though routinely Democrats have voted for that restriction on taxpayer-funded abortion time and time and time again--why start now, when we are talking about the most vulnerable victims of this heinous crime, and say: Well, we are going to punish you. We are not going to provide you the services you need in order to heal and get better and get on with your life, because we woke up this morning, March 10, 2015, and after 39 years we decided this is where we draw the line. We are drawing the line here. Never again will we ever vote for the Hyde amendment to be applied to any funds appropriated by or in the possession of the Federal Government. So I really would ask my colleagues: Please reconsider. Please let's not do this. Don't do this to these children and these victims of trafficking. Don't do it to this institution. We all understand that Washington can be a pretty tough place. All of us are volunteers, and we understand politics can sometimes be a tough business. But let's not take it out on these victims of human trafficking. That should be beneath us. They don't deserve that. They deserve better. If we pass this legislation and we get it to the President's desk and he signs it--which I believe he will--hundreds, if not thousands, of victims of human trafficking have a safe place to sleep, they will have people who love them and care for them try to help them heal and get better. We will take the money from the people who perpetrate these crimes and we will use that money to help provide needed services to these children and other victims of human trafficking. We will say ``no more'' to the teenaged girl who is arrested for prostitution, because she is a victim of trafficking--we will tell her, no more are you a criminal. We will recognize her for the victim she is, and we will treat her appropriately. We will deal not only with the supply side of this terrible crime, we will deal with the demand side--people who get off the hook too easily with impunity, people who purchase these illicit services, and somehow always seem to avoid responsibility and continue to participate in this crime with impunity. So the domestic trafficking victims fund in our legislation supplements existing authorized grant programs that are already subject to appropriation laws such as the Hyde amendment. They are already subject to the same provisions. Our legislation clarifies that the Hyde amendment also applies to any funds that are used to supplement those existing grant programs. Our legislation does not in any way expand or change the scope of the Hyde amendment. It just says these funds operate under the same rules that cover the existing grant programs they supplement. Everyone agrees the programs we supplement in this legislation need more funds. I know the distinguished ranking member, the Senator from Vermont, has made an impassioned plea to add more money beyond the victims compensation fund that we created. He is saying there needs to be more money. As a long-time member of the Appropriations Committee, I hope the Appropriations Committee looks at that and makes a decision whether they ought to supplement what we do. But these funds are being subjected to the same limitation on spending as [[Page S1373]] every dollar the Senate Appropriations Committee has appropriated during the last 39 years. So my hope is this, that Members of the Senate will rise above this disagreement, this posturing, this attempt to try to play ``gotcha'' at the expense of these victims of human trafficking. No Member should attempt to make this bill a debate about extraneous issues and policies that have been settled on a bipartisan basis for 39 years. Mr. President, I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Ayotte). The Senator from Vermont. Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I have listened very carefully to my good friend from Texas. We have worked together on many pieces of legislation over the years. In fact, I hoped we could have gotten this trafficking bill up during the last Congress, as he knows. Unfortunately, there were objections raised and we couldn't. I hope we are not going to get into a question where we compare apples and oranges and forget what we are supposed to be doing. The distinguished Senator says on the one hand during the debate on the Affordable Care Act, according to him--and I will take him at his word--that this language was in there and every Democrat voted for it-- which meant, of course, that every Republican voted against it. If you are going to use and follow his argument that the language in the Affordable Care Act was voted for by Democrats, it was voted against by Republicans. I am not suggesting they don't care about the Hyde amendment because they voted against it, according to the Senator from Texas. But let's talk about things that should be on appropriations bills. I am one of the few Members of either party in this body who has actually prosecuted child molesters. I am one of the few Members of this body who has actually gone to crime scenes and seen the results of child molestation. I am one of the few people in this body who has prosecuted a child molester, not with evidence from the child, but because the child was dead. The young boy had been raped by the man whom I prosecuted, and molested over a long period of time. So I don't need to have people tell me about the horrors of child molestation. I have seen it. I remember being in a room and looking at that dead child, the same age as one of my children. And I remember the man who did it who would have done anything to escape my prosecution, and I worked day and night around the clock for weeks. I was a young prosecutor in my twenties, and I prosecuted him and convicted him. He went up on appeal to the Supreme Court--our Supreme Court--and I argued that appeal myself, and his conviction was upheld. So I know the need for this. Let's not let political ``gotcha'' games stop us from legislation that might protect these people. The Senator from Texas suggests I want more money. That is not quite what I said. He said he wanted $30 million based on fines. I said I just want to guarantee that $30 million was there. I think again of that child molester, that child murderer. He was just one of the many cases I prosecuted. We could have fined him $1 million or $20 million or $1 billion--or $200--and he would not have been able to pay it and wouldn't have paid it. If the victim had lived, there would be no money. All I want to make sure of--and I would be happy to see--is that if there are fines collected, that they go to help victims as they should. But if no money is collected from fines, I want to make sure there is money. We will prosecute somebody who has been involved with child trafficking or child molestation. We will prosecute them, as we should. They will go to prison and we will spend $25,000 to $35,000 a year of taxpayer dollars to keep them in prison, and we should. But we will say to the victim: I am sorry; we fined him $100,000 to go to the victims' fund, but he is basically judgment proof. I just want you to know we had good intentions. If he had paid that $100,000 fine, we would have given it to you to help you. But, gosh, go in peace. Have a good life. All I am saying is this: If there is money from a fine, sure. The Senator from Texas and I agree that it should be put in the Fund. But if there are no funds, don't promise a $30 million pot of money that will never be filled if there are no fines, if there is no money in it. If there is money from fines, put the money from fines in, but where there is a difference between the amount that is in there and the $30 million, then shouldn't we, as a country that spends trillions of dollars, give the difference between the fines and the actual $30 million? Shouldn't we care about these victims? Shouldn't we care about the people who are victimized? Shouldn't we also do this: If we have the money in there, we could take increased steps to prevent victims from becoming victims in the first place. I would have given anything if there had been some program, some money, to have found out that this child I talked about was being victimized, and then we could have stopped it before the State's attorney got called in to look at the dead body. How much better it would have been if we could have stopped it to begin with. So all I am saying is this: I am happy to work with the senior Senator from Texas on this bill, just as I was last year. We had a bill without this provision, and I was hoping and trying to get consent to bring it up and pass it when we had a bill without this provision. It is important to note, though, that when it didn't have this provision last year, I wish we could have passed it. Now let's work on a bill that will pass. If you want to score political points, do it on something that doesn't involve vulnerable children. Let's work together to get a bill passed that helps them. And let's make sure that on the point I raised, that we address this at some point. If there is going to be $30 million worth of fines that go in there, I am all for it. My guess is that we would be lucky to get a small percentage of that. Back when this came up in the House of Representatives, they rejected this method of funding, and they called it budgetary gimmickry. Actually, what the House did in authorizing the bill--they did what they were supposed to do. They authorized actual funding so we could stand up for the victims of human trafficking, not just stand here trying to score political points. In other words, let's have the money. Let's make sure the money is there. This is like saying: If you commit a crime, we are going to fine you $100 million or $300 million or $1 billion. But if the person never had more than a net worth of $1,000, what difference does it make? Put real teeth in here. Stop the traffickers, and ensure there is money to help the victims. Have money to help the victims. The distinguished Presiding Officer was one of the senators who testified at the Judiciary Committee hearing on human trafficking last month. Other senators testified as well. Their testimony had people tearing people up. The distinguished Presiding Officer was attorney general for her State. She understands the reality of this, as I do and others do. It has been years since I was State's attorney, but, I say to my friend from Texas, I still wake up some nights from nightmares about the crime scenes I went to. I would wake up from them at night when we were debating the Violence Against Women Act, and I am glad that Republicans and Democrats joined together on that both here and in the other body so we could pass it. A victim is a victim is a victim, not a number, not a concept. Those of us who have spent time with victims and those of us who have been at crime scenes of victims understand this. Too often victims could no longer speak, could no longer testify. We would hear about them at their funeral. We can do better. So let's not talk about who scores points or who doesn't score points. There are good people who worked on this, good people in both parties. We are not going to be voting on something tonight, I imagine. Let's spend the time between now and tomorrow sitting down and trying to work out a way forward. Save the political points for something where the most vulnerable in society do not suffer. We can talk about what we will do on stock frauds or who gets taxed or what regulations we will have for corporations. There, raise your points. Make political points there. But for anyone who has seen these victims and anyone who has talked with these victims and anyone who has been with these victims, they know this is not the time for politics. [[Page S1374]] Let's get together this evening or tomorrow. Let's work it out so we can have something that will really protect victims, something that will have real funding to protect them--not something illusion, but real funding. And maybe if we can do that, I might have less nightmares about some of those victims I saw. My friend from Texas was a judge; he certainly saw those cases. The Presiding Officer was attorney general; she saw those cases. We have a number of former prosecutors on both sides here. Any one of us who has handled these cases has to remember every single aspect of them. I remember preparing for trial in these cases, having young children at home. I would work late in the office. I wouldn't bring the materials home at all because I didn't want my kids to see what I was looking at. I will admit there is another reason: I didn't want my children to see their father cry as I read these police investigations. These aren't statistics; these are real people. Let's work together. I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. VITTER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. VITTER. Thank you, Madam President. I have an amendment at the desk which has been slightly modified from its original form, and I ask unanimous consent that it be called up. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there an objection? Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I will object until I have had a chance to see the modification. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard. Mr. VITTER. Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. VITTER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. VITTER. Madam President, I have now filed my slightly modified amendment--I will explain the modification in a minute--and it is at the desk. I ask unanimous consent to set aside the pending amendment so my amendment can be called up. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I object. Some Members on my side of the aisle have concerns about certain aspects of the Senator's amendment, so on their behalf, I object to setting aside the pending amendment. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard. Mr. VITTER. Madam President, I will explain and speak on this amendment even though it is not pending as we speak. I will also file an ongoing objection to anyone setting aside the pending amendment for another or for any votes being scheduled until this matter can be worked out. Mr. VITTER. Madam President, the amendment I have at the desk is about a very important issue. Before I explain what it is, I will say that I strongly support the underlying bill. I compliment Senator Cornyn and others who have worked on a bipartisan basis on this bill. I certainly look forward to supporting this bill irrespective of how the vote goes on my amendment, but I obviously hope my amendment is adopted in the context of this bill. Clearly, this issue of human trafficking is a very serious one. It takes many forms, all of them ugly. One form is a phenomenon I am going to talk about today, which is the issue of birth tourism and trafficking in women and families who want to get into this country in order to physically have their children in this country because present policy recognizes those children immediately as U.S. citizens simply because they were born in this country. This phenomenon of birth tourism is a very real one, and it often puts these birth mothers and families in very dangerous situations, quite frankly, at the hands of human smugglers or the equivalent. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to have two news reports which illustrate this phenomenon printed in the Record. The first news report is an article entitled ``No vacancy at California birth hotels,'' which underscores some of the abuses and horrendous conditions that go on as a result of this, and the second article is from the Washington Post, which is entitled ``Inside the shadowy world of birth tourism at `maternity hotels.' '' There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows: [From WorldMag.com, March 12, 2013] No Vacancy at California Birth Hotels (By Alaina Gillogly and Les Sillars) It started last summer. Neighbors of a tan, sunbaked mansion in Chino Hills, Calif, knew something was going on in the large Spanish-style home with stucco walls and a tiled roof overlooking the community. Cars sped up and down the quiet little road:And a remarkable number of pregnant Asian women came and went throughout the day. Then in September, disgruntled neighbors became anxious citizens when 2,000 gallons of raw sewage spilled down the hillside. City authorities discovered in the subsequent investigation that the seven-bedroom house had become a 17-room ``birth hotel.'' The 7,964-square-foot residence on Woodglen Drive had been housing up to 30 pregnant Chinese women who wanted to give birth to their children on American soil. Each room had matching bedding and furniture, room keys, monogrammed towels, and a portable hot water kettle. Last month, a local court shut down the operation, owned by Los Angeles Hermas Hotel Inc., for building code violations that included exposed wires, missing smoke alarms, improper ventilation, and carpet stretched over a 3-foot-wide hole in the floor. The owners have six months to fix the problems and get the proper business permits, or they face permanent closure. This operation was just one of about 15 baby hotels in the heavily Asian Chino Hills area, with dozens more around the country. ``Birth tourism'' has made the news recently, but the Chino Hills incident touched off a crackdown in California as local authorities apply zoning and building codes in an effort to control the operations. It's also reopened the debate over the Fourteenth Amendment. Birth hotels are legal in the U.S. because the Fourteenth Amendment gives citizenship to children born on American soil. They have the right to vote, immigrate from their parents' home country, and apply for permanent visas for their parents once they turn 21. Birth tourism is a rising industry in countries like China, South Korea, and Saudi Arabia. A three-month stay, plus medical fees, can easily run more than $50,000. Although the Chino Hills operation had a variety of safety and health issues, other birth hotels offer luxurious accommodations with chefs to prepare food from the home country. Recent studies by the National Center for Health Statistics have reported the number of babies born to non-resident women topped 7,000 per year, up 50 percent since 2000, although it's not clear how many are the result of birth tourism. That is a tiny fraction of the number of children born with at least one parent in the country illegally--350,000 in 2009, according to the Pew Hispanic Research Center. But critics say ``birth tourism'' is an abuse of an American law designed to enfranchise slaves born on American soil. ``The practice is a misinterpretation of the Fourteenth Amendment,'' said John Fonte, Hudson Institute senior fellow and director of the Center for American Common Culture. ``U.S. citizens should be very concerned.'' Some Californians are concerned. Rosanna Mitchell started a group called Not in Chino Hills to protest against the facility. ``Our mission is to keep a vigilant eye and use all our efforts necessary to do so,'' wrote Mitchell on the website. She told WORLD that, aside from worries about sanitation, traffic, and under-the-table businesses, she doubts those patronizing birth hotels are genuinely pursuing the American dream. ``Something needs to be done,'' she said. ``It's outrageous that they would take advantage of the U.S.'' Rep. Steve King, an Iowa Republican, introduced a bill in January to amend the Fourteenth Amendment to ``clarify'' that citizenship applies to those born in the U.S. provided at least one parent is a U.S. citizen, a lawful immigrant, or serving in the military. The bill, with 13 co-sponsors, is currently in committee. ____ [From the Washington Post, Mar. 5] Inside the Shadowy World of Birth Tourism at ``Maternity Hotels'' (By Abby Phillip) In luxury apartment complexes in Southern California and in grand, single-family homes in New York, ``maternity hotels'' are brimming with pregnant women and cooing newborn babies. For wealthy foreign women, the facilities offer the promise of a comfortable, worry- [[Page S1375]] free vacation complete with a major perk: a U.S. passport for their newborn. One such maternity hotel in New York resembled a nursery: Newborn babies rested in a row of bassinets that lined the wall, according to an NBC News report that offered a look inside the facility. Women who book rooms at these properties can expect to live in well-stocked apartment complexes or large suburban homes with laundry and catered food as part of the package. Once their babies are born in an American hospital, they are cared for by nurses while the mothers rest for at least a month. They can pass their time with shopping trips to luxury stores, trips to amusement parks or poolside at the ``hotel'' while attentive caretakers look after the infants, feeding, bathing and putting them to sleep on a regimented schedule, NBC News found. The cost--$40,000 to $80,000 per stay--is worth it for the prospect that the visitor's child will automatically be afforded the benefits given to U.S. citizens--and perhaps will have an easier time gaining legal residency in the United States when that child turns 21. ``For my baby, it's a chance to, a step to two countries'' cultures . . . Chinese culture and American culture,'' one woman told NBC. There's nothing illegal about foreign nationals giving birth in the United States. But traveling to the hotels requires the illegal practice of lying about the real reason for visiting the United States. Pregnant women purporting to be tourists enter the country in the latter stages of pregnancy, some overstaying their visas to recover in the comfort of the ``maternity hotels.'' Birth tourism companies have flourished in recent years, according to federal officials--and many of them prefer hard- to-track cash to fuel their operations. That money, federal officials allege, is being pocketed by a group of individuals who have skirted tax law, flouted immigration laws and helped their clients defraud U.S. hospitals of tens of thousands of dollars for each baby born. On Tuesday, federal agencies, including Immigration and Customs Enforcement and the IRS, along with the Los Angeles Police Department, conducted a massive operation to raid more than 30 California locations operated by ``birth tourism businesses.'' Officials collected piles of evidence that will likely be used against some of the ``maternity hotel'' operators in future prosecutions. The companies advertise their services online--and no foreign language skills are necessary to guess the subtext. What are the benefits of a U.S. passport for a foreign national's unborn child? ``Too many,'' the Web site of StarBabyCare explains to prospective clients. ``You can enjoy the free education from junior high school to public high school. . . . You can apply loans or grants which is only for the U.S. citizen. . . . You can receive your senior supplement benefits when you are living overseas. . . . To the parent, after the baby becomes an adult, he/she can petition the parents for a green card.'' According to court documents, an undercover investigator was told: ``The baby will then have a birth certificate and `freedom.' The baby will have a bright future having United States citizenship.'' Federal officials say that Chao Chen and Jie Zhu, the couple that operated the You Win baby tourism company, engaged in ``sham marriages'' to get green cards for themselves. In documents filed in federal court this week, officials said that the two ``divorced'' in 2012, but married U.S. citizens in Las Vegas months later. Both applied for permanent residency, and an immigration officer reviewing the cases noted that the marriages were ``suspect'' based on the timing. Such companies have openly encouraged women willing to pay for the service to commit visa fraud as well. They were counseled not to tell customs and immigration officials that they were pregnant, to wear loose clothes and to avoid traveling to the United States while looking visibly pregnant. ``U.S. might refuse entry due to the belly is too big,'' StarBabyCare's Web site informed potential customers. ``Therefore the size of the belly is quite important to determine when you should arrive in Los Angeles.'' According to court documents, birth tourists were told to avoid traveling directly.to Los Angeles International Airport from overseas, to avoid raising suspicion. They might even consider studying U.S. culture and booking recreational visits in order to make their travel seem more legitimate, the company advised. Alternate arrival ports such as Hawaii or Las Vegas were preferable. You Win paid more than $60,000 a year to rent Southern California apartments that housed the women, according to court documents. Federal officials believe that StarBabyCare operated a ``maternity hotel'' from at least 10 units at one complex. As more attention has been trained on the practice in recent years, the outrage has--predictably--followed. Los Angeles County officials have cited the ``hotels'' for illegally operating business in residential homes in 2013. Angry neighbors at a Chino Hills ``hotel'' picketed as the report became public. Among its findings: The 17-bedroom, 17- bathroom operation was blamed for overloading the septic tank in the community. Usually, the women participating in the programs paid several thousand dollars up front as a deposit and thousands more upon arrival in United States, according to investigators. The balance was paid after childbirth. But ``some or all'' of that money--which for You Win likely amounted to over $1 million--went unreported to federal authorities in 2013. ``Chen failed to report hundreds of thousands of dollars in income on his 2013 federal tax return,'' according to federal officials. As women went into birth, they were taken to local hospitals and declared jobless. As many as 400 babies associated with just one of these companies were born after 2013 in Orange County, Calif., hospitals. Despite the fact that many of these women paid tens of thousands of dollars to participate in the ``maternity hotel'' scheme, they claimed to be unable to pay the hospitals, which typically charged about $25,000 per birth. Some paid nothing at all, while others paid a fee closer to $4,000. No one was arrested during Tuesday's raids. But Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents collected evidence and potential witnesses for use in future prosecutions on tax, immigration and fraud charges. Mr. VITTER. Madam President, recently the Obama administration conducted a raid on some of these shadowy operations. I compliment them for doing that. There needs to be a crackdown on these operations, but the ultimate crackdown and ultimate solution is to change the policy of the Federal Government that recognizes these children immediately as U.S. citizens simply because they are physically born in this country even though both of their parents are here illegally. No parent is here under any sort of legal status, and that is the ultimate response and ultimate solution we need, and that is what my amendment--that I will call up as soon as that is allowed and get a vote on--is about. My amendment would change the present practice, policy, and law to say that only somebody born in this country who has at least one parent who is a U.S. citizen, a legal green card holder, or a serving member of the U.S. military, immediately gets that recognition as a U.S. citizen. As I suggested, this issue and practice--including this shadowy world of birth tourism and human smuggling--is a very serious issue. In fact, it is an exploding issue, as these recent cases in the press have brought to light. According to the Center for Immigration Studies, each year about 300,000 to 400,000 children are born to illegal aliens in the United States, and under our present practice, all of them are immediately recognized as U.S. citizens. This is a huge magnet for more illegal crossings into our country, often at the hands of very dangerous people. Birthright citizenship draws women from Mexico and Central America to make that dangerous trek north, often in the hands of coyotes and drug cartels. These women put their lives into the hands of criminal gangs with a demonstrated pension for sexual assault and sex trafficking. In addition, there is a huge business of birth tourism, including those who market to women and families in China. As I mentioned, on Tuesday, March 3, Federal agents broke up an alleged birth tourism ring in southern California, raiding several homes and apartment complexes where pregnant Chinese women, who were here on fraudulent visas, paid up to $80,000 in some cases so their babies would be born here. DHS and IRS investigators were seeking evidence and statements against those alleged in the scheme. Besides visa fraud, authorities are looking into possible tax and money laundering charges. As I referred to the news reports that are now part of the Record, in some cases this involves horrendous conditions and a very shadowy world in terms of this so-called birth tourism. The ultimate solution to this enormous magnet for illegal crossings-- often at the hands of very dangerous people--is to not recognize everyone who is simply born in the United States to be a citizen of the United States because of that fact alone. Again, that is what my amendment would do. That is far more effective than any set of raids on these operations or on any enforcement provisions. If we move toward this, we would be in the company of a huge majority of countries in the world. Of advanced economies, only Canada and the United States grant automatic citizenship to children born to illegal aliens. No European country does that. No other advanced industrialized country does [[Page S1376]] that, nor should we. As I suggested, it is a huge magnet for more and more illegal crossings, and my amendment would fix that. Some people will argue this is not possible with a statutory change. This is embedded in the U.S. Constitution through the 14th Amendment and any change would have to be a constitutional amendment. I believe that is not the case and is a result of a fundamental misunderstanding of the Constitution in this regard, including the 14th Amendment. The 14th Amendment does not say that all persons born in the United States are citizens, period, end of story. If we look at the precise language, it is very instructive. It states that citizenship extends to ``all persons born or naturalized in the United States and subject to the jurisdiction thereof.'' That latter phrase--``and subject to the jurisdiction thereof''--was included because it means something, and its original meaning clearly refers to the political allegiance of an individual and the jurisdiction that a foreign government has over that person. That is exactly why American Indians and their children were not immediately recognized as U.S. citizens simply because of their birth in this country. There was actually litigation about that going directly to this language of the 14th Amendment. The courts decided, no, the fact that these American Indian children were born in the United States in and of itself did not make them U.S. citizens because ``and subject to the jurisdiction thereof'' had a meaning. It meant these children could not be subject to any other governmental or quasi- governmental authority and an American Indian tribe was such an authority. Because of that litigation and interpretation, in order for those American Indian children to be recognized as American citizens, it actually took specific congressional action, and Congress passed the Indian Citizenship Act of 1924. I believe that goes directly to this issue that this practice is not embedded in the Constitution and in the 14th Amendment, and so that allows the statutory fix my language would offer. Senator Harry Reid, the minority leader, actually introduced a bill in 1993 titled the ``Immigration Stabilization Act,'' which included nearly identical language to my amendment and stand-alone bill. This language has broad support in the country, including broad bipartisan support. In Senator Reid's bill--now that is going back a ways--it stated ``in the exercise of its powers under section 5 of the 14th article of the amendment to the Constitution of the United States, the Congress has determined and hereby declares that any person born after the date of enactment of this title to a mother who is neither a citizen of the United States nor admitted to the United States as a lawful permanent resident will not be a U.S. citizen.'' So there we have language from a leading Democratic Member that goes to the same issue. There is broad bipartisan support, not just in the Congress but in the country for this fix, particularly in the context of these huge illegal alien flows into the country. I believe Americans recognize that we cannot continue to adopt and recognize this policy. It is an enormous magnet for the continuing flows of illegal aliens into the country. It brings up industries such as this shadowy world of birth tourism which was recently raided by Federal authorities. It puts those mothers and families in the hands of very unsavory criminal elements in many cases, and we should not allow this to continue. My amendment would stop that practice, stop those abuses, and stop encouraging those flows of illegal aliens. I strongly encourage the Senate to directly consider this amendment, vote on it, and to adopt it as part of this very important underlying bill. Finally, I ask unanimous consent to have two letters that were written by leading groups on immigration reform, FAIR and the Eagle Forum, printed in the Record. They are in strong support of this measure. I will submit additional letters of support as they develop over the next day or two. There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows: Federation for American Immigration Reform, Washington, DC, March 10, 2015. Hon. David Vitter, U.S. Senate, Hart Senate Office Building, Washington, DC. Dear Senator Vitter: I am writing to thank you for your efforts as a United States Senator to end birthright citizenship--the practice of automatically granting U.S. citizenship to anyone born in the United States, regardless of the parents' immigration status. Your amendment to the Justice for Victims of Trafficking Act of 2015 (S. 178) would close this loophole that is based on a misinterpretation of the 14th Amendment. Specifically, your amendment would amend the Constitution so that children born in the U.S. only gain citizenship automatically if one parent is either a U.S. citizen, legal permanent resident, or a non-immigrant active member of the Armed Forces. Your language is consistent with the intent behind the ``subject to the jurisdiction thereof' clause of excluding from automatic citizenship American-born persons whose allegiance to the United States is incomplete. Even the Obama Administration recognizes that the current practice of birthright citizenship encourages unlawful behavior and abuse of the system. Indeed, just last week federal and local law enforcement officials raided the Southern California offices of a company that encourages foreign pregnant women to come to the U.S. to give birth, promising them benefits like citizenship and free education. Known as ``birth tourism,'' these companies arrange for pregnant women to come to the U.S. and advise them to provide false information on visa applications. This particular Irvine business made approximately $2 million in 2013, with fees ranging from $15,000 to $50,000. Your amendment would end this magnet of illegal immigration because the U.S.-born children of illegal aliens will not be eligible to sponsor family members for legal permanent resident status (green cards) once they reach the age of twenty-one. Again, we thank you for sponsoring this commonsense legislation. Sincerely, Dan Stein, President. ____ Eagle Forum, Washington, DC, March 10, 2015. Dear Senator Vitter, On behalf of Eagle Forum and the families we represent, we express our support for your amendment to S. 178 ending the practice of birthright citizenship. Automatically granting citizenship to any child born on U.S. soil, even if the child's parents are temporary visitors or illegal aliens, cheapens the value of American citizenship. Action by Congress to clarify the long- misinterpreted intent of section 1 of the Fourteenth Amendment is both necessary and appropriate. Birthright citizenship is an invitation to exploit the benefits of American citizenship. Simply being born in our country, whatever the citizenship of the parents, entitles a child to government aid. It circumvents the lengthy process of naturalization, including the pledge of new citizens to ``support and defend the Constitution and laws of the United States.'' This loophole encourages illegal immigration and even ``birth tourism,'' which brings pregnant women to this country just in time to give birth. Both illegal immigration and birth tourism fuel human trafficking, which stems from a desire to claim the protections of our laws and the support of the welfare state. Permitting birthright citizenship is a misreading of the Fourteenth Amendment. The amendment states that U.S. citizens are ``all persons born or naturalized in the United States and subject to the jurisdiction thereof'' Those final five words are critical and clearly limit the application of the amendment. Visitors who are not U.S. citizens are ``subject to the jurisdiction'' of their country of origin, not the United States. Furthermore, the Constitution vests control over immigration law to Congress. It is past time for the legislative branch to exercise its power to end birthright citizenship. Eagle Forum thanks you for your leadership on this critical issue and stands ready to assist you. Faithfully, Phyllis Schlafly, Chairman. Mr. VITTER. I thank the Presiding Officer and yield the floor. Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. KIRK. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. KIRK. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to set aside the pending amendment to consider my amendment No. 273. Mr. LEAHY. Reserving the right to object, and I have to object. The Senator has the right, of course, to file his amendment, but there is an amendment presently pending and it would have to be set aside. There is [[Page S1377]] someone on this side who does not want it set aside, so I will object. Of course, the Senator can file his amendment, but the request, as I understand it, is to set aside the pending amendment. On behalf of several Senators on this side, I object. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard. Mr. KIRK. Madam President, I ask the Senator from Vermont if he opposes the amendment that was also cosponsored by Senator Feinstein. Mr. LEAHY. I don't know who is cosponsoring the amendment. Madam President, addressing the Senator through the Chair, as we are required to do by the Senate rules, I would say that my objection is to setting aside the pending amendment. I would further address the Senator from Illinois--but through the Chair--that when the amendment is up, I will be glad to look at it and take a position on it. Of course, he and I have known each other for a long time. I will be happy to tell him whether I will vote for it or not. Mr. KIRK. Madam President, I would say that this amendment is directed at backpage.com, probably the largest provider of online slavery services in the United States. I would hope the Senator is not defending Lacey and Larkin, who make $30 million a year off of slavery. Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, to respond to the Senator, I may very well support his amendment. The technical question is, Should the amendment of the Senator from Ohio be set aside so that this one may be the one pending? On that issue, there is objection. When the Senator's amendment is pending before the Senate, it may very well be one I will vote for, and I will be happy to discuss it at that time. Mr. KIRK. I thank the Senator. Madam President, this is an amendment that is directed at attacking backpage.com, which stands on the principle that was well established in the Civil War--that we Americans have freedom and we should not be free to enslave other Americans. I think, as the largest provider of online slavery services, Lacey and Larkin should be put out of business. I think it is incumbent on us, in the underlying legislation--I would remind the Senator from Vermont that we would live up to the full spirit of this legislation to make sure that just because the Internet was invented, slavery should not be empowered by the Internet. Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, will the Senator yield for a question? Mr. KIRK. Yes, I will yield. Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, through the Chair, I ask my friend from Illinois, who has been a warrior on these issues, particularly with this backpage.com and this advertisement of children and other people trafficked as part of this modern day slavery, if the Senator's amendment, the HERO Act, is actually included, if I am not mistaken. Mr. KIRK. Amendment No. 273 would include the SAVE Act, which has already substantially passed with huge bipartisan support of the party of the Senator from Vermont in the House of Representatives. If we look, we will find that backpage.com is active in every State, providing online services to the public. Mr. CORNYN. My question and point was that the SAVE Act, I understand, is the subject of the amendment that the Senator is seeking to offer and for which I hope our friends on the other side will relent and allow us to go forward, debating and amending this important piece of legislation. As distinguished from the SAVE Act, which is the subject of the Senator's your amendment, the HERO Act, I believe is already a part of the underlying legislation. I just wanted to congratulate the Senator from Illinois and thank him for his longstanding dedication to this issue and the contribution he has made to the underlying piece of legislation. Mr. KIRK. As a Senator from Illinois, our true gift to the people of this country has been individual freedom and dignity, epitomized by the Lincoln candidacy for the Senate, and by the victory in the Civil War. We should not allow the freedom of the Internet to allow freedom to enslave others. These two men have made tens of millions of dollars. I yield back to the distinguished majority whip. Mr. CORNYN. I would just ask the Senator to yield for one final question. Would the Senator please outline his bill, his amendment, the SAVE Act? Mr. KIRK. The critical issue is how to restrict the ability of Americans to enslave each other. I don't think we should have that freedom. We want to make sure we thread the needle very carefully here, to make sure the freedom and commerce available on the Internet is not going to help people such as Lacey and Larkin to enslave others. We want to make sure that there is an ever-widening sphere of freedom inside the United States that is not inhibited by the Internet. Mr. CORNYN. I would ask, is the Senator's amendment targeted in a way that respects the freedom of the Internet and the right of the people? Mr. KIRK. Very much so. The way we thread the needle here is to make online providers of slavery services liable for the costs that local governments incur in cleaning up the mess they create. In the case of Cook County, IL, we have had our crusading sheriff, who I would note is also a Democratic sheriff, establish a great effort to recover the young, underage girls involved and to make sure the costs incurred in helping out these young women--these citizens of the United States--to make sure they can charge it against the online provider, which makes eminent sense. I would say that our freedoms are protected because Tom Dart was elected by the people of Cook County. As an elected official, he is trying to simply carry out his goal there. This makes eminent sense to do this. Mr. CORNYN. I thank the Senator. Mr. KIRK. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire. Mrs. SHAHEEN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in morning business. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Remembering Jonathan Myrick Daniels Mrs. SHAHEEN. Madam President, this past weekend we saw a huge commemoration of the 50th anniversary of the Selma to Montgomery voting rights march. I rise to honor the work and sacrifice of Jonathan Myrick Daniels. He was a young Episcopalian seminary student from Keene. The Presiding Officer certainly knows his name and Keene, as well. He was from Keene, NH, and he answered the call of Rev. Martin Luther King, Jr., for clergy to travel to Alabama to join him on that march. Jonathan lost his life 5 months later, in an act that Reverend King called ``one of the most heroic Christian deeds of which I have heard in my entire ministry.'' Although Jonathan had originally intended to spend a short time in the South and then return to his studies at the Episcopal theological school in Boston, he felt compelled by events to remain in Alabama through the spring and summer to register voters with the Episcopalian Society for Cultural and Racial Unity. On August 14, 1965, Jonathan was arrested along with a number of other civil rights activists at a demonstration in Fort Deposit, AL, a small town outside of Montgomery. They had gone there to protest segregation in the town's stores. But their demonstration was over within minutes. Armed white men from the town descended on them and took them to jail. Jonathan and his fellow activists spent 6 days in the Hayneville jail. Many in the group were still teenagers. Despite the conditions, Jonathan somehow maintained an unflaggingly upbeat attitude and good humor. He wrote his mother in New Hampshire a brief letter from the jail, apologetically describing it as a peculiar birthday card for her. He wrote: The food is vile and we aren't allowed to bathe (whew!) . . . As you can imagine, I'll have a tale or two to swap over our next martini. He declined an offer of bail money from an Episcopal organization because the amount would not have covered the release of the rest of his group. On Friday, August 20, the whole group was suddenly released. Strangely, their bail had been waived, but no one was there to meet them or take them home. The town seemed completely deserted. Jonathan and a few others walked a block away to a store to buy something to eat and drink. As he climbed the steps of the porch to the store, he suddenly heard someone shout from inside [[Page S1378]] and threaten to shoot if they didn't leave. Jonathan barely had time to react before the man opened fire, but somehow he managed to jump in front of his friend Ruby Sales, a 17-year-old African-American girl. He saved Ruby's life, but Jonathan was killed by the close-range shot that was intended for her. He was just 26 years old. The shooter called the murder in to the sheriff's office himself. He said: I just shot two preachers. You better get on down here. An all- white jury later acquitted the man, taking just 2 hours to find him not guilty. While Jonathan was sacrificing his life for civil rights in Alabama, here in the Senate debate raged over the Federal Government's role in protecting the voting rights of disfranchised American citizens. Since 1870 the 15th Amendment to the Constitution had prohibited State governments from denying a citizen's right to vote based on race. However, in precincts throughout the South, Black Americans were subjected to discriminatory poll taxes, literacy tests, and other forms of voter intimidation. In many places, town clerks outright refused to register Black voters. Just 2 weeks before Jonathan was killed, Congress finally passed the Voting Rights Act, which outlawed electoral practices that discriminated against minority groups. Well, 2015 marks the 50th anniversary not just of that march in Selma but of this landmark law. While this anniversary presents an obvious time for reflection, it is also a time to look forward and address the challenges still facing our country. The impact of the Supreme Court's 2013 ruling in Shelby County v. Holder, which struck down a critical section of the law requiring Federal approval for electoral law changes in districts with the history of discrimination, is particularly troubling. This ruling now allows States to implement restrictive voting requirements that will make it more difficult for voters to cast their ballots. In fact, since this ruling, almost all of the affected States have already begun attempts to restrict voting, targeting seniors, students, minorities, and threatening their access to the polls. The right to make your voice heard as a citizen of this Nation is a fundamental principle of our democracy, and it should never be infringed upon. We have a responsibility to protect this right and address these injustices. While our Nation has made a lot of progress since the 1960s and 1970s, the struggle is far from over. Inequality and racism remain in our society. As long as discrimination and racial disparities exist, the full protections of the Voting Rights Act are necessary to guarantee the rights of citizenship for every American. Jonathan Daniels should be turning 76 years old in March. He is widely recognized as a martyr of the 20th century. In Keene, his hometown, an elementary school bears his name. As we mark the 50th anniversary of his passing, as well as the passage of the Voting Rights Act, we must strive to honor his legacy by ensuring that all current and future American citizens can exercise the rights he died to protect. I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Gardner). Without objection, it is so ordered. ____________________","Congressional Record, Volume 161 Issue 40 (Tuesday, March 10, 2015) [Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 40 (Tuesday, March 10, 2015)] [Senate] [Pages S1366-S1378] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] JUSTICE FOR VICTIMS OF TRAFFICKING ACT OF 2015--Continued The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana. Mr. CASSIDY. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss a serious crime and a violation of human rights that must be stopped--human trafficking. It is a form of modern-day slavery, people profiting from the control and exploitation of others. I rise as a doc, a fellow who has practiced in the public hospital system for 32 years, understanding the unique role nurses, physicians, and other health care providers play in this issue. Health care providers are frontline and one of the few to interact directly [[Page S1367]] with trafficked women and children. A recent survey published in the Annals of Health Law reports that 28 percent of trafficked women sought a health care professional while being held captive. Now, this does not mean that the nurse, the doctor or other health care provider had the training to recognize it, but because of the unique and critical involvement with these victims, it is important these health care providers do have the tested tools and training to identify and help those being trafficked. The Trafficking Awareness Training for Health Care amendment would save lives and, as importantly, would begin the rebuilding of lives destroyed by modern-day slavery. It would provide for the development of best practices to enable health care workers to recognize and assist victims of human trafficking. It is proven that many trafficking victims report receiving health care from federally funded clinics and emergency rooms while in captivity yet, as I mentioned earlier, they go undetected. This legislation would improve the awareness of health care workers, ultimately helping these victims. Senator Tim Kaine recently spoke about a missive that Pope Francis gave on Ash Wednesday, calling for us to be ``islands of mercy in a sea of indifference.'' The ethic of nurses, physicians, and other health care workers is to be that merciful creature. This would give them the training to better enable them to be that ``island'' in what for that woman or child caught in captivity must seem a ``sea of indifference.'' Having passed the House by unanimous consent, this amendment represents a bipartisan effort that will enable the medical community to bring relief to those suffering in ways that those of us who have never been there cannot imagine. Senator Peters is joining me in this bipartisan effort. I urge my colleagues to support this amendment and help transform victims of trafficking into survivors and people who blossom. I yield back. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The President pro tempore. Authorizing The Use Of Force Against The Islamic State Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss one of the most critical national security challenges facing the Senate: specifically, how we should craft an authorization for the use of military force against the terrorist organization known as the Islamic State. I have spoken before on the floor about what I believe the outline of an authorization should contain. Now that the President has released his proposal--and with Secretary Kerry, Secretary Carter, and General Dempsey slated to testify tomorrow on behalf of this proposal--I feel compelled to address this topic in greater detail. Before delving into the specifics of the administration's proposed authorization, we should consider how this institution has grappled with these vital questions throughout our Nation's history. Dating back to 1798, Congress has on several occasions enacted legislation short of a formal declaration of war authorizing the use of military force by the President. In the late 18th and early 19th centuries, Congress authorized U.S. naval action against both state and non-state actors who attacked U.S. commercial vessels. More recent authorizations formally passed by the Congress include those intended to protect the Middle East, Taiwan, and Southeast Asia from communist aggression in the 1950s and 1960s. And since the end of the Cold War, we have passed authorizations concerning Lebanon, the September 11 attacks, and Iraq-- all in 1991 and in 2002. I voted for those latter four authorizations here in this Chamber. Each case was unique, but in every case the White House did not send the Congress ``take it or leave it'' language. Rather, the Senate and the House fashioned text that represented a negotiated outcome with the White House and within Congress. For example, Presidents Eisenhower and George H.W. Bush worked closely with Congress to obtain strong authorizations for the use of military force, despite Democrats controlling both Chambers. President George W. Bush twice did the same with a Democrat-led Senate. This approach yielded concrete benefits--a more thoughtful debate and strategy around our use of force, greater unity in supporting our military, and congressional willingness to fulfill our constitutional responsibilities. Historically, the Senate has fulfilled its role as a place of intelligent, informed debate in moving authorizations for use of military force. We must do so again as we consider this authorization to combat the Islamic State. Thirteen years ago, as the Senate began to deliberate over an authorization to rid Iraq of its violent dictator, I said: We all must leave our political party affiliations at the door when it comes to our national security and supporting our troops in the field. It is time for Congress to come together, to hold a public debate, and to craft the right authorization to defeat the Islamic State. Turning to the proposed authorization before us today, I agree with the legal interpretation offered by the Obama administration that the executive branch has the power to conduct operations against the Islamic State under article II of the Constitution and the existing authorizations from 2001 and 2002. Unfortunately, the administration has undermined the credibility of its own proposal by continuously changing its position as to how the 2001 and 2002 authorizations should be employed. Therefore, in order to settle any legal questions about the power to use force against the Islamic State--and to demonstrate America's resolve in this fight against terror--I firmly believe that a new authorization should be enacted. Accordingly, the senior Senator from Oklahoma and I discussed in this Chamber last month three principles that we believe should be included in a new authorization for the use of military force against the Islamic State. First, the authorization must clearly articulate that the executive branch is authorized to use force--employed in accordance with the law of war--against the Islamic State. Second, the authorization must be flexible enough to be used against the Islamic State as it appears today but also in whatever form the Islamic State transforms into in the future. This flexibility must include the authority to use force against organizations that associate with or support the Islamic State. Finally, and most importantly, the authorization must not impose any artificial and unnecessary limitations, such as those based on time, geography, and type of force, which could interfere with our strategic objective of defeating the Islamic State. Unfortunately, the President's draft authorization does not fully adhere to these principles. First, the President's proposal ``does not authorize the use of the United States Armed Forces in enduring offensive ground operations.'' Obviously, this is an unwise artificial limitation on what type of forces we can employ. But the President's proposed operative text offers little to define what this restriction entails. Therefore, my initial reaction, one that is widely shared, is: What does this restriction mean? To be fair, the President's introductory letter that accompanied his draft does provide some insight into the administration's interpretation of this phrase. Specifically, the President argues that the authorization would provide him with the power to conduct rescue operations, to provide advice and assistance to partner forces, and to deploy the use of Special Forces in missions against the Islamic State's leadership, intelligence collection, and targeting missions. But in laying out his vision, the President's proposal also tells our enemies what he is not prepared to do. Knowing these limitations would provide the Islamic State with a critical advantage: The terrorists would exploit this information in crafting their strategies. Why would we telegraph our strategy to our enemies? The President's proposed legal limitations will also limit our ability to adjust our strategy as needed based on the military situation on the ground. For example, when our counterterrorism strategy in Iraq faltered during the mid 2000s, we changed it and we adopted a new counterinsurgency strategy commonly called the surge. As we all know, the surge was a great success. Therefore, ensuring any authorization has the flexibility to allow our [[Page S1368]] forces to change and adapt their strategies and tactics is essential. Imposing the President's proposed artificial and unnecessary, yet legally binding, restrictions on our forces would be a colossal mistake. Indeed, General Jack Keane, who devised the principles of the surge, recently testified before the Senate Armed Services Committee about his own proposal as to how to conduct operations against the Islamic State. In his testimony, the general did advocate using Special Forces in a similar manner to what the President discussed in his letter accompanying his proposal. But the general went further. He stated that the United States and our coalition partners should position combat brigades in Kuwait if our current operation ``stalls or is defeated.'' Obviously, the use of combat brigades would be prohibited under the President's proposal. Therefore, if the President's limited operations are not successful and additional ground forces are required, adopting the President's proposal would create significant uncertainty. This raises the question: Would Congress need to debate and pass yet another authorization before those units could be used in combat? On its face, this would be completely impractical and hardly in our national security interest. Another area in which the President's proposal does not provide sufficient flexibility is its 3-year time limitation. Simply put, if we advertise when the authorization expires at an arbitrary date and time, will our enemies not hunker down and wait for that date? Secretary of State John Kerry stated in his previous testimony before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee that the administration does not believe a new authorization should include a geographic limitation. To its credit, the President's proposal does not. Specifically, the Secretary argued: ``In our view, it would be a mistake to advertise to ISIL that there are safe havens for them outside of Iraq and Syria.'' Undoubtedly, the Secretary was concerned about creating artificial limitations that could negatively affect our ability to conduct necessary military operations. He is right. But his concern should extend to the other artificial restrictions that appear in this proposal. How else can we read the prohibition of ``enduring offensive ground combat operations'' and a 3-year time limitation? In conclusion, we can do better. Our forces must have the flexibility to use, or the ability to threaten to use, whatever tools and strategies are necessary to defeat the Islamic State. When America enters into a fight, we should enter to win. And we should not just do this in a halfhearted, stupid way. So I hope the White House will reconsider some of the things that they have advocated and that they have set forth and get this thing done right so that if we are going to enter into warfare, we ought to know what we are doing and ought to have the tools and the legal legalities to be able to do it well. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Hoeven). The minority leader. Mr. REID. Mr. President, what is the business before the Senate? The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate is considering S. 178. Mr. REID. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. PORTMAN.

The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, reserving the right to object. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator cannot reserve the right to object. Is there objection? Without objection, it is so ordered. The Senator from Ohio. Mr. PORTMAN. Mr. President, I know the Presiding Officer has other places to be, and I am going to be presiding in the chair in a moment. I will not offer amendments because my understanding is that even though we are on the bill, my colleagues on the other side of the aisle don't want me to offer noncontroversial amendments. So I will wait until they are ready for that just to keep the peace on the floor, but I will talk about the amendments because they are incredibly important to the underlying legislation. We are talking about the human trafficking legislation. This is something that as cochair and cofounder of the Human Trafficking Caucus, as a father, and as someone who represents the citizens of Ohio, who are directly affected by this, I have a strong interest. I am delighted the Senate is taking up this legislation. I do hope it will be not just bipartisan but nonpartisan. I do not see any reason for it not to move forward in the Senate, changing some of these laws that are in desperate need of changing to ensure that this horrific practice of human trafficking and sex trafficking can be curbed. It can be minimized by legislation that this Chamber should have taken up, in my view, some time ago. We really haven't been at this subject for a decade. We know a lot more about the problem now. We know, unfortunately, that about 300,000 of our youth are subject to human trafficking--about 1,000 in my home State of Ohio alone. The amendments I will offer--once someone on this side comes to the floor who will allow me to offer them--have to do with human trafficking in the broadest sense. The first amendment has to do with those people who are, unfortunately, trapped in sex trafficking being treated not as criminals but as victims and with ensuring that those victims get the proper care they need and the help to be able to get back on their feet. These are young people--we are told many times--who are between the ages of 11 and 13 when they are first exposed to human trafficking, in this case sex trafficking. In fact, that is the average age, we are told. Having talked to some of the victims at home, having talked to some of those who are in the trenches working, trying to help these young women, girls, young men, and boys, this legislation is badly needed to ensure we are looking at this--not again as a criminal matter but--as victims who deserve our support. Specifically, it requires that every State put together a plan to improve child protection services--containing, among other things, provisions and procedures requiring identification and assessments of all reports involving children known or to be suspected victims of sex trafficking--with better information and better data, a description of efforts to coordinate State law enforcement, child welfare agencies, and juvenile justice agencies such as runaway and homeless youth shelters to help serve these victims. Finally, this legislation calls for an annual State report on the number of children identified as known or suspected to be a victim of sex trafficking. The other amendment I am going to offer will be an amendment with regard to homeless children and youth. As has been discussed on this floor before, the HUD definition of homelessness practically excludes the most common situations for families and unaccompanied youths--and that would be staying in motels or temporarily with others because there is no place else for them to stay. Even if local communities identified these families or youth as having the most pressing unmet needs, communities can't use the HUD homeless assistance funds to serve them except in extremely limited or near-impossible conditions. This is related to human trafficking and also to sex trafficking in that, unfortunately, many of these young people involved in these situations--where they are homeless, where they are not on the street but are going from house to house or perhaps staying in a motel--are targeted by these traffickers. I believe these two amendments, which are not only bipartisan--and they are; I have support on both sides of the aisle--but are also nonpartisan and are ones that would be appropriate to include in the legislation. At the appropriate time I will offer those amendments. [[Page S1369]] The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont. Mr. LEAHY. We need to confer for a couple of minutes.

Mr. PORTMAN. Mr. President, this is the homeless and youth amendment I spoke about a moment ago. I thank everyone for their indulgence. I am pleased to have these amendments offered, and we will have an opportunity to speak on these amendments and another amendment I plan to offer later. I yield back the remainder of my time. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. (Mr. PORTMAN assumed the Chair.) Mr. PORTMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Lankford). Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. PORTMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to offer my support to the underlying legislation we are considering on the floor today. This is the most significant antitrafficking legislation to come before the Senate in over a decade. As I said earlier when I offered a couple of amendments, I am very pleased to be in this body on a nonpartisan basis, not just a bipartisan basis, to be able to address this issue, and I would like to thank the Senators who have worked hard in their committees to make that possible. I thank Senators Cornyn and Klobuchar for their work. I see Senator Wyden is here, Senator Leahy is here, Senator Grassley is here, and others who have been involved with this. They and their staffs are to be commended. It has been a good process. It is an issue a lot of us care about. Why? Because it is one that affects our States and our constituents in very significant ways. Last year I cofounded and I now cochair the Caucus on Human Trafficking with Senator Blumenthal, and we have had a number of good meetings and conferences here on the Hill bringing experts together and raising awareness of this issue. Unfortunately, this horrible crime affects every single part of our country. In Ohio this came to my attention initially because in parts of Ohio, along the I-75 corridor, particularly in Toledo, there were higher incidences of prosecutions of human trafficking. A school group actually brought this to my attention several years ago. The more we looked into it, the more we realized that this affects so many of our constituents, and it particularly affects the most vulnerable in our society--children, runaways, the missing. In the greatest country on the face of the Earth, almost 300,000 of our American children are at risk of trafficking and commercial sexual exploitation, more than 1,000 each year in Ohio alone. In 2000 I did support the last major bill that directly addressed this growing problem of human trafficking. It was called the Trafficking Victims Protection Act. And I supported the reauthorization in 2011. But since that time we have learned a lot more about the problem. We now know more about how to eradicate what is really a modern form of slavery. Our new legislation, which is called the Justice for Victims of Trafficking Act of 2015, builds on what we know works, and it strengthens protections for the victims. I would like to take a moment, if I could, to talk about two of the bills that are contained within this underlying legislation that are the product of a lot of bipartisan work that exemplifies some of the finest traditions of this body. The first is the Bringing Missing Children Home Act. The Bringing Missing Children Home Act is something I coauthored with Senator Schumer on the other side of the aisle, and we did it because we know there is unfortunately a strong correlation between victims of sex trafficking and children who have recently been in and out of the child welfare system. We also know that children who have run away or who are missing are the most vulnerable to being abused, trafficked, and exploited. In 2014 an FBI sting recovered 168 children who were victims of sex trafficking. Nearly each one of those children--nearly all of them had been involved in some kind of foster care or the child welfare system. Many of them had been reported missing--by the way, with insufficient information to find them. It is a strong correlation, and it is one that any effort to stop human trafficking must also address. That is what my legislation does. The Bringing Missing Children Home Act strengthens law enforcement reporting and response procedures, making it easier to communicate and work with child welfare agencies. It accomplishes this in a number of ways. First, it amends the current Missing Children's Assistance Act so that Federal law makes clear that children who are trafficked or sexually exploited are treated as victims and not as criminals. You will hear this in this debate, and this is one of the great underlying aspects of this legislation, we are changing the way we look at this, to understand that there is simply no such thing as a child prostitute. Second, this legislation requires law enforcement to update their records of missing children within 30 days with all the relevant information obtained during the initial investigation. This is very important because this new information will allow us to find these children more easily and more quickly, to avoid them falling into the trap of sexual trafficking and traffickers. Specifically, the bill requires new dental and medical records, as well as photograph, if available. For almost all of these children, there is a photograph available if you take the time to try to find it. I can't stress this last part enough. It is so hard to find these kids, and without having a photograph, it is made much more difficult. Yet in most instances we apparently don't. We tracked this in Ohio. Let me give an interesting statistic. Since January 1 of this year there have been 87 children reported missing in the State of Ohio--87 kids. We only have photographs for 21 of them, so for 66 of these young people we have no photographs. It is tough to find them when you don't know what they look like. This bill will help change that. Third, it requires law enforcement to work directly with State and local child welfare systems after someone is reported missing so that all the relevant information can be obtained as quickly as possible. Finally, it removes all the roadblocks that prevent State attorneys general from modifying records in the National Crime Information Center. We want these records to be updated [[Page S1371]] constantly as new information is provided. To put it simply, we think it is a commonsense bill that streamlines how missing children cases are handled. It makes it easier to share information that could lead to recovery. The second bill I wish to talk about that is part of this underlying legislation is called the Combat Human Trafficking Act which I coauthored with Senator Feinstein. The Bringing Missing Children Home Act is about helping victims. This legislation, the Combat Human Trafficking Act, is about punishing the traffickers. We start by giving prosecutors expanded tools to put traffickers behind bars. Our legislation enlarges the number of charges Federal prosecutors can level against traffickers and those who conspire with them. It also makes those engaged in trafficking strictly liable for their crimes. We also expand the training available for our Federal law enforcement tasked with investigating and prosecuting traffickers, and we require that the Bureau of Justice Statistics prepare an annual report detailing our success in this fight. Just as importantly, this bill strengthens victims' rights by providing more information to victims on ongoing prosecutions, requiring them to be informed in a timely manner of any plea agreements or prosecution agreements in cases in which they are involved. The legislation we are considering passed out of the committee unanimously for a reason. There are things that do divide us in this place. We talk about those a lot, and everybody reads and hears about them. But this is an exception. This is about bringing us together, in this case to protect our kids from human trafficking. Human traffickers and sexual trafficking are issues on which we should not have any divide. This is legislation both Republicans and Democrats can enthusiastically support. Earlier today I joined with some of my colleagues in introducing some amendments to the legislation because although I support the underlying bill--it is a good bill--it can be made even better, and I am looking forward to the debate. In the process, I hope we will raise awareness about the issue, raise consciousness about the issue not just among our colleagues and around Capitol Hill but around the country because ultimately, if we are going to solve this problem in our communities, everyone needs to be part of it, everyone needs to be vigilant, and everyone needs to understand that this happens in your community, it happens in your State, and it happens, unfortunately, in our country. If we can raise awareness about this wicked practice of human trafficking and sex trafficking, that would do a lot to try to curb it, to reduce it, and eventually to stop it. This is what we came to Washington to do--to pass legislation that actually helps back home. With this legislation, we can stand together to protect the most innocent among us from the most heinous of crimes. I thank you the Presiding Officer. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the remarks I am going to make now not be part of the remarks on the bill that is before the Senate. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. (The remarks of Mr. Grassley are printed in today's Record under ``Morning Business.'') Mr. GRASSLEY. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, yesterday the Democratic leader, Senator Reid, told us that Democrats and Republicans could finally agree on one thing; that is, we ought to focus not on the partisan politics and the ideology that so often divides us, but we ought to focus on the victims of human trafficking, largely middle school-age girls who are bought and sold like commodities. I came to the floor yesterday and said that I believe we are all created in the image of God, and it is a sin, it is the very personification of evil for people to treat those same human beings as if they were things. That is what the scourge of human trafficking is all about. I was very glad to see that finally we seemed to be chipping away at the dysfunction of the Senate that we have experienced over the last few years and, in the new majority, given an opportunity for an open amendment process on a subject that we all agree needs to be dealt with that we could work on together. So imagine my surprise when earlier today the same Democratic leader said the Democrats were going to filibuster this anti-human trafficking legislation. Why in the world would they take a 180-degree turn? Why would they do such an about-face or flip-flop? Well, they said because there was language contained in the bill they disagreed with. No, they didn't say they would use this open amendment process to file an amendment and have a vote to strip it out or to modify it or otherwise change it; they said: We are going to block the bill; it is dead unless this language comes out. Yet they do nothing to try to effect that outcome. We might wonder what this language is that they are so upset about that they would literally kick the tens of thousands of children and other victims to the curb because of their outrage that this language is contained in this legislation. Well, imagine my surprise to find out that the reason why the Democratic minority is going to filibuster this antitrafficking bill is because they object to language that has been the law of the land for 39 years--39 years. So I guess they woke up this morning and thought, well, we better do something about it. What is the provision that causes them so much discomfort, that they are so upset about that they are willing to block this legislation? Well, it is something called the Hyde amendment. Basically what that does is it prohibits the use of taxpayer funds for abortions. I realize that in America we are of different minds on the subject of abortion. I am proudly pro-life, but others in our Senate are pro- choice, and we probably have a whole spectrum of views on this very personal issue. But we have had a bipartisan consensus--unanimity almost--for the last 39 years that whatever else the law is, as handed down by the Supreme Court or by Congress, we are not going to use taxpayer funds for abortion. So imagine my surprise when that very language and very reference was included in the Justice for Victims of Trafficking Act bill that now today I find out for the first time our Democratic friends object to. Imagine my surprise when that very language was part of the bill that was filed in mid-January and a month later was marked up and voted on in the Senate Judiciary Committee and all members of the Judiciary Committee, Democrats and Republicans alike, voted for it. They voted for it unanimously. Well, I don't believe that was a mistake. Our friends across the aisle have outstanding staff. They are very talented people. I don't always agree with them, but they are good at what they do. I don't believe for a minute that they would have missed a reference in this legislation to a restriction on funding taxpayer- provided abortions, and I don't believe that those staff members, being the diligent professionals they are, didn't tell their principal, their member of the Senate Judiciary Committee. So this idea that there has been some kind of ambush is preposterous. It is just not credible. Well, imagine my surprise when not only did we have a 15-to-0 vote, I believe it was--in other words, a unanimous vote of the Judiciary Committee--for this bill, we have Democratic cosponsors of this bill. Not only do they support the bill, they have been actively working with us on the legislation. Just looking at the face of the bill, I count 10 Democratic cosponsors. Do you think they didn't read the [[Page S1372]] bill before they put their names on it? Do you think their staffs didn't tell them what is in the bill? Well, as we all know, this sort of thing is ordinarily very hotly debated. There are no shrinking violets in the U.S. Senate, no people who sit passively on the sidelines and say: Well, I better not speak up and express my views. That doesn't happen. We have strong-willed, talented people on both sides of the aisle, and there are no shrinking violets. Let's just lay that to rest. People are willing to speak up, and they do speak up every day, every hour, virtually every minute on things they feel strongly about. So this idea that we have created an ambush, that we have surprised our colleagues by including this language in a bill that is on the floor, the Justice for Victims of Trafficking Act--voted unanimously out of the Judiciary Committee, all Republicans and all Democrats, with 10 Democratic cosponsors--that we have somehow surprised them by including this restriction on taxpayer-funded abortion that has been the law of the land for 39 years is patently ridiculous. It is just not believable. Let me provide a little more information. The reference in the bill is on page 50 under limitations. It says: ``Amounts in the Fund, or otherwise transferred from the Fund''--that is, the crime victims compensation fund created by this legislation, $30 million that goes to help treat victims and help them heal and get on with their lives--this bill says that this fund ``shall be subject to the limitations on the use or expending of amounts described in sections 506 and 507 of division H of the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2014 . . . to the same extent as if amounts in the Fund were funds appropriated under division H of such Act.'' I went to see how many Democrats voted for that consolidated appropriations act in 2014 that contained the Hyde amendment language and the limitations on taxpayer-funded abortions. Imagine my surprise when I saw that 55 Democrats voted for that language in the 2014 consolidated appropriations bill that is referred to on pages 50 and 51 of the Justice for Victims of Trafficking Act. This is the same bill the Democratic leader said Democrats were going to filibuster because they were so outraged, they were surprised, they were bushwhacked, they were ambushed, they were tricked. Twenty-three Democrats voted for that same appropriation language in 2014. But it gets better--or worse, as the case may be. Democrats have supported legislation consistent with the Hyde amendment for a long time. As I have said, it has been the law of the land for 39 years. When was the last time? Well, the Department of Homeland Security funding. Remember this back-and-forth we had over the defunding of the President's Executive action on immigration that so many on our side of the aisle are upset about because it is not within the President's authority to do it--and that is not just my opinion; it is the Federal judge's in Brownsville who has issued a preliminary injunction--but how many Democrats voted for the Department of Homeland Security funding bill that contains that same limitation on taxpayer funding for abortions? Forty-five Democrats voted for it. So imagine my surprise when 45 Democrats recently voted for that appropriations bill to come to the Senate today and be told: We are outraged. We are never going to support that. And, by the way, we didn't know it was in the bill when we voted for it in the Judiciary Committee or when we cosponsored the bill. Well, they presumably knew about it when they voted for the Department of Homeland Security funding in February of 2015, when 32 of them voted for the CR omni or CRomni in December of 2014. And, oh, by the way, remember ObamaCare? Every single Democrat voted to support ObamaCare which contained the same restriction on taxpayer funding for abortions. They have also voted for the Children's Health Insurance Program, the so-called SCHIP, for Defense authorization bills. In other words, our Democratic friends have voted time and time and time again for the exact same language they now say they are going to filibuster on the Justice for Victims of Trafficking Act, language they said they weren't aware of when they voted for it--they didn't read it, their staff didn't tell them about it. Well, if that is true, I would get new staff. But I know the staff on the Democratic side, like the staff on the Republican side, are highly professional people and they wouldn't fail to identify offensive language that their Senator could not and would not and never has voted for, or they would be out of a job. So I plead with our Democratic friends, please don't make this Justice for Victims of Trafficking Act another political football. For heaven's sake, if we can't agree to protect the most vulnerable victims of this heinous crime, what can we ever agree on? If we can't agree on that, if we are going to try to find a way to flyspeck legislation and say, well, I won't allow this bill to go forward if that language is included in there--even though it has been the law of the land for 39 years, even though routinely Democrats have voted for that restriction on taxpayer-funded abortion time and time and time again--why start now, when we are talking about the most vulnerable victims of this heinous crime, and say: Well, we are going to punish you. We are not going to provide you the services you need in order to heal and get better and get on with your life, because we woke up this morning, March 10, 2015, and after 39 years we decided this is where we draw the line. We are drawing the line here. Never again will we ever vote for the Hyde amendment to be applied to any funds appropriated by or in the possession of the Federal Government. So I really would ask my colleagues: Please reconsider. Please let's not do this. Don't do this to these children and these victims of trafficking. Don't do it to this institution. We all understand that Washington can be a pretty tough place. All of us are volunteers, and we understand politics can sometimes be a tough business. But let's not take it out on these victims of human trafficking. That should be beneath us. They don't deserve that. They deserve better. If we pass this legislation and we get it to the President's desk and he signs it--which I believe he will--hundreds, if not thousands, of victims of human trafficking have a safe place to sleep, they will have people who love them and care for them try to help them heal and get better. We will take the money from the people who perpetrate these crimes and we will use that money to help provide needed services to these children and other victims of human trafficking. We will say ``no more'' to the teenaged girl who is arrested for prostitution, because she is a victim of trafficking--we will tell her, no more are you a criminal. We will recognize her for the victim she is, and we will treat her appropriately. We will deal not only with the supply side of this terrible crime, we will deal with the demand side--people who get off the hook too easily with impunity, people who purchase these illicit services, and somehow always seem to avoid responsibility and continue to participate in this crime with impunity. So the domestic trafficking victims fund in our legislation supplements existing authorized grant programs that are already subject to appropriation laws such as the Hyde amendment. They are already subject to the same provisions. Our legislation clarifies that the Hyde amendment also applies to any funds that are used to supplement those existing grant programs. Our legislation does not in any way expand or change the scope of the Hyde amendment. It just says these funds operate under the same rules that cover the existing grant programs they supplement. Everyone agrees the programs we supplement in this legislation need more funds. I know the distinguished ranking member, the Senator from Vermont, has made an impassioned plea to add more money beyond the victims compensation fund that we created. He is saying there needs to be more money. As a long-time member of the Appropriations Committee, I hope the Appropriations Committee looks at that and makes a decision whether they ought to supplement what we do. But these funds are being subjected to the same limitation on spending as [[Page S1373]] every dollar the Senate Appropriations Committee has appropriated during the last 39 years. So my hope is this, that Members of the Senate will rise above this disagreement, this posturing, this attempt to try to play ``gotcha'' at the expense of these victims of human trafficking. No Member should attempt to make this bill a debate about extraneous issues and policies that have been settled on a bipartisan basis for 39 years. Mr. President, I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Ayotte). The Senator from Vermont. Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I have listened very carefully to my good friend from Texas. We have worked together on many pieces of legislation over the years. In fact, I hoped we could have gotten this trafficking bill up during the last Congress, as he knows. Unfortunately, there were objections raised and we couldn't. I hope we are not going to get into a question where we compare apples and oranges and forget what we are supposed to be doing. The distinguished Senator says on the one hand during the debate on the Affordable Care Act, according to him--and I will take him at his word--that this language was in there and every Democrat voted for it-- which meant, of course, that every Republican voted against it. If you are going to use and follow his argument that the language in the Affordable Care Act was voted for by Democrats, it was voted against by Republicans. I am not suggesting they don't care about the Hyde amendment because they voted against it, according to the Senator from Texas. But let's talk about things that should be on appropriations bills. I am one of the few Members of either party in this body who has actually prosecuted child molesters. I am one of the few Members of this body who has actually gone to crime scenes and seen the results of child molestation. I am one of the few people in this body who has prosecuted a child molester, not with evidence from the child, but because the child was dead. The young boy had been raped by the man whom I prosecuted, and molested over a long period of time. So I don't need to have people tell me about the horrors of child molestation. I have seen it. I remember being in a room and looking at that dead child, the same age as one of my children. And I remember the man who did it who would have done anything to escape my prosecution, and I worked day and night around the clock for weeks. I was a young prosecutor in my twenties, and I prosecuted him and convicted him. He went up on appeal to the Supreme Court--our Supreme Court--and I argued that appeal myself, and his conviction was upheld. So I know the need for this. Let's not let political ``gotcha'' games stop us from legislation that might protect these people. The Senator from Texas suggests I want more money. That is not quite what I said. He said he wanted $30 million based on fines. I said I just want to guarantee that $30 million was there. I think again of that child molester, that child murderer. He was just one of the many cases I prosecuted. We could have fined him $1 million or $20 million or $1 billion--or $200--and he would not have been able to pay it and wouldn't have paid it. If the victim had lived, there would be no money. All I want to make sure of--and I would be happy to see--is that if there are fines collected, that they go to help victims as they should. But if no money is collected from fines, I want to make sure there is money. We will prosecute somebody who has been involved with child trafficking or child molestation. We will prosecute them, as we should. They will go to prison and we will spend $25,000 to $35,000 a year of taxpayer dollars to keep them in prison, and we should. But we will say to the victim: I am sorry; we fined him $100,000 to go to the victims' fund, but he is basically judgment proof. I just want you to know we had good intentions. If he had paid that $100,000 fine, we would have given it to you to help you. But, gosh, go in peace. Have a good life. All I am saying is this: If there is money from a fine, sure. The Senator from Texas and I agree that it should be put in the Fund. But if there are no funds, don't promise a $30 million pot of money that will never be filled if there are no fines, if there is no money in it. If there is money from fines, put the money from fines in, but where there is a difference between the amount that is in there and the $30 million, then shouldn't we, as a country that spends trillions of dollars, give the difference between the fines and the actual $30 million? Shouldn't we care about these victims? Shouldn't we care about the people who are victimized? Shouldn't we also do this: If we have the money in there, we could take increased steps to prevent victims from becoming victims in the first place. I would have given anything if there had been some program, some money, to have found out that this child I talked about was being victimized, and then we could have stopped it before the State's attorney got called in to look at the dead body. How much better it would have been if we could have stopped it to begin with. So all I am saying is this: I am happy to work with the senior Senator from Texas on this bill, just as I was last year. We had a bill without this provision, and I was hoping and trying to get consent to bring it up and pass it when we had a bill without this provision. It is important to note, though, that when it didn't have this provision last year, I wish we could have passed it. Now let's work on a bill that will pass. If you want to score political points, do it on something that doesn't involve vulnerable children. Let's work together to get a bill passed that helps them. And let's make sure that on the point I raised, that we address this at some point. If there is going to be $30 million worth of fines that go in there, I am all for it. My guess is that we would be lucky to get a small percentage of that. Back when this came up in the House of Representatives, they rejected this method of funding, and they called it budgetary gimmickry. Actually, what the House did in authorizing the bill--they did what they were supposed to do. They authorized actual funding so we could stand up for the victims of human trafficking, not just stand here trying to score political points. In other words, let's have the money. Let's make sure the money is there. This is like saying: If you commit a crime, we are going to fine you $100 million or $300 million or $1 billion. But if the person never had more than a net worth of $1,000, what difference does it make? Put real teeth in here. Stop the traffickers, and ensure there is money to help the victims. Have money to help the victims. The distinguished Presiding Officer was one of the senators who testified at the Judiciary Committee hearing on human trafficking last month. Other senators testified as well. Their testimony had people tearing people up. The distinguished Presiding Officer was attorney general for her State. She understands the reality of this, as I do and others do. It has been years since I was State's attorney, but, I say to my friend from Texas, I still wake up some nights from nightmares about the crime scenes I went to. I would wake up from them at night when we were debating the Violence Against Women Act, and I am glad that Republicans and Democrats joined together on that both here and in the other body so we could pass it. A victim is a victim is a victim, not a number, not a concept. Those of us who have spent time with victims and those of us who have been at crime scenes of victims understand this. Too often victims could no longer speak, could no longer testify. We would hear about them at their funeral. We can do better. So let's not talk about who scores points or who doesn't score points. There are good people who worked on this, good people in both parties. We are not going to be voting on something tonight, I imagine. Let's spend the time between now and tomorrow sitting down and trying to work out a way forward. Save the political points for something where the most vulnerable in society do not suffer. We can talk about what we will do on stock frauds or who gets taxed or what regulations we will have for corporations. There, raise your points. Make political points there. But for anyone who has seen these victims and anyone who has talked with these victims and anyone who has been with these victims, they know this is not the time for politics. [[Page S1374]] Let's get together this evening or tomorrow. Let's work it out so we can have something that will really protect victims, something that will have real funding to protect them--not something illusion, but real funding. And maybe if we can do that, I might have less nightmares about some of those victims I saw. My friend from Texas was a judge; he certainly saw those cases. The Presiding Officer was attorney general; she saw those cases. We have a number of former prosecutors on both sides here. Any one of us who has handled these cases has to remember every single aspect of them. I remember preparing for trial in these cases, having young children at home. I would work late in the office. I wouldn't bring the materials home at all because I didn't want my kids to see what I was looking at. I will admit there is another reason: I didn't want my children to see their father cry as I read these police investigations. These aren't statistics; these are real people. Let's work together. I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. VITTER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. VITTER. Thank you, Madam President. I have an amendment at the desk which has been slightly modified from its original form, and I ask unanimous consent that it be called up. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there an objection? Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I will object until I have had a chance to see the modification. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard. Mr. VITTER. Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. VITTER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. VITTER. Madam President, I have now filed my slightly modified amendment--I will explain the modification in a minute--and it is at the desk. I ask unanimous consent to set aside the pending amendment so my amendment can be called up. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I object. Some Members on my side of the aisle have concerns about certain aspects of the Senator's amendment, so on their behalf, I object to setting aside the pending amendment. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard. Mr. VITTER. Madam President, I will explain and speak on this amendment even though it is not pending as we speak. I will also file an ongoing objection to anyone setting aside the pending amendment for another or for any votes being scheduled until this matter can be worked out. Mr. VITTER. Madam President, the amendment I have at the desk is about a very important issue. Before I explain what it is, I will say that I strongly support the underlying bill. I compliment Senator Cornyn and others who have worked on a bipartisan basis on this bill. I certainly look forward to supporting this bill irrespective of how the vote goes on my amendment, but I obviously hope my amendment is adopted in the context of this bill. Clearly, this issue of human trafficking is a very serious one. It takes many forms, all of them ugly. One form is a phenomenon I am going to talk about today, which is the issue of birth tourism and trafficking in women and families who want to get into this country in order to physically have their children in this country because present policy recognizes those children immediately as U.S. citizens simply because they were born in this country. This phenomenon of birth tourism is a very real one, and it often puts these birth mothers and families in very dangerous situations, quite frankly, at the hands of human smugglers or the equivalent. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to have two news reports which illustrate this phenomenon printed in the Record. The first news report is an article entitled ``No vacancy at California birth hotels,'' which underscores some of the abuses and horrendous conditions that go on as a result of this, and the second article is from the Washington Post, which is entitled ``Inside the shadowy world of birth tourism at `maternity hotels.' '' There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows: [From WorldMag.com, March 12, 2013] No Vacancy at California Birth Hotels (By Alaina Gillogly and Les Sillars) It started last summer. Neighbors of a tan, sunbaked mansion in Chino Hills, Calif, knew something was going on in the large Spanish-style home with stucco walls and a tiled roof overlooking the community. Cars sped up and down the quiet little road:And a remarkable number of pregnant Asian women came and went throughout the day. Then in September, disgruntled neighbors became anxious citizens when 2,000 gallons of raw sewage spilled down the hillside. City authorities discovered in the subsequent investigation that the seven-bedroom house had become a 17-room ``birth hotel.'' The 7,964-square-foot residence on Woodglen Drive had been housing up to 30 pregnant Chinese women who wanted to give birth to their children on American soil. Each room had matching bedding and furniture, room keys, monogrammed towels, and a portable hot water kettle. Last month, a local court shut down the operation, owned by Los Angeles Hermas Hotel Inc., for building code violations that included exposed wires, missing smoke alarms, improper ventilation, and carpet stretched over a 3-foot-wide hole in the floor. The owners have six months to fix the problems and get the proper business permits, or they face permanent closure. This operation was just one of about 15 baby hotels in the heavily Asian Chino Hills area, with dozens more around the country. ``Birth tourism'' has made the news recently, but the Chino Hills incident touched off a crackdown in California as local authorities apply zoning and building codes in an effort to control the operations. It's also reopened the debate over the Fourteenth Amendment. Birth hotels are legal in the U.S. because the Fourteenth Amendment gives citizenship to children born on American soil. They have the right to vote, immigrate from their parents' home country, and apply for permanent visas for their parents once they turn 21. Birth tourism is a rising industry in countries like China, South Korea, and Saudi Arabia. A three-month stay, plus medical fees, can easily run more than $50,000. Although the Chino Hills operation had a variety of safety and health issues, other birth hotels offer luxurious accommodations with chefs to prepare food from the home country. Recent studies by the National Center for Health Statistics have reported the number of babies born to non-resident women topped 7,000 per year, up 50 percent since 2000, although it's not clear how many are the result of birth tourism. That is a tiny fraction of the number of children born with at least one parent in the country illegally--350,000 in 2009, according to the Pew Hispanic Research Center. But critics say ``birth tourism'' is an abuse of an American law designed to enfranchise slaves born on American soil. ``The practice is a misinterpretation of the Fourteenth Amendment,'' said John Fonte, Hudson Institute senior fellow and director of the Center for American Common Culture. ``U.S. citizens should be very concerned.'' Some Californians are concerned. Rosanna Mitchell started a group called Not in Chino Hills to protest against the facility. ``Our mission is to keep a vigilant eye and use all our efforts necessary to do so,'' wrote Mitchell on the website. She told WORLD that, aside from worries about sanitation, traffic, and under-the-table businesses, she doubts those patronizing birth hotels are genuinely pursuing the American dream. ``Something needs to be done,'' she said. ``It's outrageous that they would take advantage of the U.S.'' Rep. Steve King, an Iowa Republican, introduced a bill in January to amend the Fourteenth Amendment to ``clarify'' that citizenship applies to those born in the U.S. provided at least one parent is a U.S. citizen, a lawful immigrant, or serving in the military. The bill, with 13 co-sponsors, is currently in committee. ____ [From the Washington Post, Mar. 5] Inside the Shadowy World of Birth Tourism at ``Maternity Hotels'' (By Abby Phillip) In luxury apartment complexes in Southern California and in grand, single-family homes in New York, ``maternity hotels'' are brimming with pregnant women and cooing newborn babies. For wealthy foreign women, the facilities offer the promise of a comfortable, worry- [[Page S1375]] free vacation complete with a major perk: a U.S. passport for their newborn. One such maternity hotel in New York resembled a nursery: Newborn babies rested in a row of bassinets that lined the wall, according to an NBC News report that offered a look inside the facility. Women who book rooms at these properties can expect to live in well-stocked apartment complexes or large suburban homes with laundry and catered food as part of the package. Once their babies are born in an American hospital, they are cared for by nurses while the mothers rest for at least a month. They can pass their time with shopping trips to luxury stores, trips to amusement parks or poolside at the ``hotel'' while attentive caretakers look after the infants, feeding, bathing and putting them to sleep on a regimented schedule, NBC News found. The cost--$40,000 to $80,000 per stay--is worth it for the prospect that the visitor's child will automatically be afforded the benefits given to U.S. citizens--and perhaps will have an easier time gaining legal residency in the United States when that child turns 21. ``For my baby, it's a chance to, a step to two countries'' cultures . . . Chinese culture and American culture,'' one woman told NBC. There's nothing illegal about foreign nationals giving birth in the United States. But traveling to the hotels requires the illegal practice of lying about the real reason for visiting the United States. Pregnant women purporting to be tourists enter the country in the latter stages of pregnancy, some overstaying their visas to recover in the comfort of the ``maternity hotels.'' Birth tourism companies have flourished in recent years, according to federal officials--and many of them prefer hard- to-track cash to fuel their operations. That money, federal officials allege, is being pocketed by a group of individuals who have skirted tax law, flouted immigration laws and helped their clients defraud U.S. hospitals of tens of thousands of dollars for each baby born. On Tuesday, federal agencies, including Immigration and Customs Enforcement and the IRS, along with the Los Angeles Police Department, conducted a massive operation to raid more than 30 California locations operated by ``birth tourism businesses.'' Officials collected piles of evidence that will likely be used against some of the ``maternity hotel'' operators in future prosecutions. The companies advertise their services online--and no foreign language skills are necessary to guess the subtext. What are the benefits of a U.S. passport for a foreign national's unborn child? ``Too many,'' the Web site of StarBabyCare explains to prospective clients. ``You can enjoy the free education from junior high school to public high school. . . . You can apply loans or grants which is only for the U.S. citizen. . . . You can receive your senior supplement benefits when you are living overseas. . . . To the parent, after the baby becomes an adult, he/she can petition the parents for a green card.'' According to court documents, an undercover investigator was told: ``The baby will then have a birth certificate and `freedom.' The baby will have a bright future having United States citizenship.'' Federal officials say that Chao Chen and Jie Zhu, the couple that operated the You Win baby tourism company, engaged in ``sham marriages'' to get green cards for themselves. In documents filed in federal court this week, officials said that the two ``divorced'' in 2012, but married U.S. citizens in Las Vegas months later. Both applied for permanent residency, and an immigration officer reviewing the cases noted that the marriages were ``suspect'' based on the timing. Such companies have openly encouraged women willing to pay for the service to commit visa fraud as well. They were counseled not to tell customs and immigration officials that they were pregnant, to wear loose clothes and to avoid traveling to the United States while looking visibly pregnant. ``U.S. might refuse entry due to the belly is too big,'' StarBabyCare's Web site informed potential customers. ``Therefore the size of the belly is quite important to determine when you should arrive in Los Angeles.'' According to court documents, birth tourists were told to avoid traveling directly.to Los Angeles International Airport from overseas, to avoid raising suspicion. They might even consider studying U.S. culture and booking recreational visits in order to make their travel seem more legitimate, the company advised. Alternate arrival ports such as Hawaii or Las Vegas were preferable. You Win paid more than $60,000 a year to rent Southern California apartments that housed the women, according to court documents. Federal officials believe that StarBabyCare operated a ``maternity hotel'' from at least 10 units at one complex. As more attention has been trained on the practice in recent years, the outrage has--predictably--followed. Los Angeles County officials have cited the ``hotels'' for illegally operating business in residential homes in 2013. Angry neighbors at a Chino Hills ``hotel'' picketed as the report became public. Among its findings: The 17-bedroom, 17- bathroom operation was blamed for overloading the septic tank in the community. Usually, the women participating in the programs paid several thousand dollars up front as a deposit and thousands more upon arrival in United States, according to investigators. The balance was paid after childbirth. But ``some or all'' of that money--which for You Win likely amounted to over $1 million--went unreported to federal authorities in 2013. ``Chen failed to report hundreds of thousands of dollars in income on his 2013 federal tax return,'' according to federal officials. As women went into birth, they were taken to local hospitals and declared jobless. As many as 400 babies associated with just one of these companies were born after 2013 in Orange County, Calif., hospitals. Despite the fact that many of these women paid tens of thousands of dollars to participate in the ``maternity hotel'' scheme, they claimed to be unable to pay the hospitals, which typically charged about $25,000 per birth. Some paid nothing at all, while others paid a fee closer to $4,000. No one was arrested during Tuesday's raids. But Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents collected evidence and potential witnesses for use in future prosecutions on tax, immigration and fraud charges. Mr. VITTER. Madam President, recently the Obama administration conducted a raid on some of these shadowy operations. I compliment them for doing that. There needs to be a crackdown on these operations, but the ultimate crackdown and ultimate solution is to change the policy of the Federal Government that recognizes these children immediately as U.S. citizens simply because they are physically born in this country even though both of their parents are here illegally. No parent is here under any sort of legal status, and that is the ultimate response and ultimate solution we need, and that is what my amendment--that I will call up as soon as that is allowed and get a vote on--is about. My amendment would change the present practice, policy, and law to say that only somebody born in this country who has at least one parent who is a U.S. citizen, a legal green card holder, or a serving member of the U.S. military, immediately gets that recognition as a U.S. citizen. As I suggested, this issue and practice--including this shadowy world of birth tourism and human smuggling--is a very serious issue. In fact, it is an exploding issue, as these recent cases in the press have brought to light. According to the Center for Immigration Studies, each year about 300,000 to 400,000 children are born to illegal aliens in the United States, and under our present practice, all of them are immediately recognized as U.S. citizens. This is a huge magnet for more illegal crossings into our country, often at the hands of very dangerous people. Birthright citizenship draws women from Mexico and Central America to make that dangerous trek north, often in the hands of coyotes and drug cartels. These women put their lives into the hands of criminal gangs with a demonstrated pension for sexual assault and sex trafficking. In addition, there is a huge business of birth tourism, including those who market to women and families in China. As I mentioned, on Tuesday, March 3, Federal agents broke up an alleged birth tourism ring in southern California, raiding several homes and apartment complexes where pregnant Chinese women, who were here on fraudulent visas, paid up to $80,000 in some cases so their babies would be born here. DHS and IRS investigators were seeking evidence and statements against those alleged in the scheme. Besides visa fraud, authorities are looking into possible tax and money laundering charges. As I referred to the news reports that are now part of the Record, in some cases this involves horrendous conditions and a very shadowy world in terms of this so-called birth tourism. The ultimate solution to this enormous magnet for illegal crossings-- often at the hands of very dangerous people--is to not recognize everyone who is simply born in the United States to be a citizen of the United States because of that fact alone. Again, that is what my amendment would do. That is far more effective than any set of raids on these operations or on any enforcement provisions. If we move toward this, we would be in the company of a huge majority of countries in the world. Of advanced economies, only Canada and the United States grant automatic citizenship to children born to illegal aliens. No European country does that. No other advanced industrialized country does [[Page S1376]] that, nor should we. As I suggested, it is a huge magnet for more and more illegal crossings, and my amendment would fix that. Some people will argue this is not possible with a statutory change. This is embedded in the U.S. Constitution through the 14th Amendment and any change would have to be a constitutional amendment. I believe that is not the case and is a result of a fundamental misunderstanding of the Constitution in this regard, including the 14th Amendment. The 14th Amendment does not say that all persons born in the United States are citizens, period, end of story. If we look at the precise language, it is very instructive. It states that citizenship extends to ``all persons born or naturalized in the United States and subject to the jurisdiction thereof.'' That latter phrase--``and subject to the jurisdiction thereof''--was included because it means something, and its original meaning clearly refers to the political allegiance of an individual and the jurisdiction that a foreign government has over that person. That is exactly why American Indians and their children were not immediately recognized as U.S. citizens simply because of their birth in this country. There was actually litigation about that going directly to this language of the 14th Amendment. The courts decided, no, the fact that these American Indian children were born in the United States in and of itself did not make them U.S. citizens because ``and subject to the jurisdiction thereof'' had a meaning. It meant these children could not be subject to any other governmental or quasi- governmental authority and an American Indian tribe was such an authority. Because of that litigation and interpretation, in order for those American Indian children to be recognized as American citizens, it actually took specific congressional action, and Congress passed the Indian Citizenship Act of 1924. I believe that goes directly to this issue that this practice is not embedded in the Constitution and in the 14th Amendment, and so that allows the statutory fix my language would offer. Senator Harry Reid, the minority leader, actually introduced a bill in 1993 titled the ``Immigration Stabilization Act,'' which included nearly identical language to my amendment and stand-alone bill. This language has broad support in the country, including broad bipartisan support. In Senator Reid's bill--now that is going back a ways--it stated ``in the exercise of its powers under section 5 of the 14th article of the amendment to the Constitution of the United States, the Congress has determined and hereby declares that any person born after the date of enactment of this title to a mother who is neither a citizen of the United States nor admitted to the United States as a lawful permanent resident will not be a U.S. citizen.'' So there we have language from a leading Democratic Member that goes to the same issue. There is broad bipartisan support, not just in the Congress but in the country for this fix, particularly in the context of these huge illegal alien flows into the country. I believe Americans recognize that we cannot continue to adopt and recognize this policy. It is an enormous magnet for the continuing flows of illegal aliens into the country. It brings up industries such as this shadowy world of birth tourism which was recently raided by Federal authorities. It puts those mothers and families in the hands of very unsavory criminal elements in many cases, and we should not allow this to continue. My amendment would stop that practice, stop those abuses, and stop encouraging those flows of illegal aliens. I strongly encourage the Senate to directly consider this amendment, vote on it, and to adopt it as part of this very important underlying bill. Finally, I ask unanimous consent to have two letters that were written by leading groups on immigration reform, FAIR and the Eagle Forum, printed in the Record. They are in strong support of this measure. I will submit additional letters of support as they develop over the next day or two. There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows: Federation for American Immigration Reform, Washington, DC, March 10, 2015. Hon. David Vitter, U.S. Senate, Hart Senate Office Building, Washington, DC. Dear Senator Vitter: I am writing to thank you for your efforts as a United States Senator to end birthright citizenship--the practice of automatically granting U.S. citizenship to anyone born in the United States, regardless of the parents' immigration status. Your amendment to the Justice for Victims of Trafficking Act of 2015 (S. 178) would close this loophole that is based on a misinterpretation of the 14th Amendment. Specifically, your amendment would amend the Constitution so that children born in the U.S. only gain citizenship automatically if one parent is either a U.S. citizen, legal permanent resident, or a non-immigrant active member of the Armed Forces. Your language is consistent with the intent behind the ``subject to the jurisdiction thereof' clause of excluding from automatic citizenship American-born persons whose allegiance to the United States is incomplete. Even the Obama Administration recognizes that the current practice of birthright citizenship encourages unlawful behavior and abuse of the system. Indeed, just last week federal and local law enforcement officials raided the Southern California offices of a company that encourages foreign pregnant women to come to the U.S. to give birth, promising them benefits like citizenship and free education. Known as ``birth tourism,'' these companies arrange for pregnant women to come to the U.S. and advise them to provide false information on visa applications. This particular Irvine business made approximately $2 million in 2013, with fees ranging from $15,000 to $50,000. Your amendment would end this magnet of illegal immigration because the U.S.-born children of illegal aliens will not be eligible to sponsor family members for legal permanent resident status (green cards) once they reach the age of twenty-one. Again, we thank you for sponsoring this commonsense legislation. Sincerely, Dan Stein, President. ____ Eagle Forum, Washington, DC, March 10, 2015. Dear Senator Vitter, On behalf of Eagle Forum and the families we represent, we express our support for your amendment to S. 178 ending the practice of birthright citizenship. Automatically granting citizenship to any child born on U.S. soil, even if the child's parents are temporary visitors or illegal aliens, cheapens the value of American citizenship. Action by Congress to clarify the long- misinterpreted intent of section 1 of the Fourteenth Amendment is both necessary and appropriate. Birthright citizenship is an invitation to exploit the benefits of American citizenship. Simply being born in our country, whatever the citizenship of the parents, entitles a child to government aid. It circumvents the lengthy process of naturalization, including the pledge of new citizens to ``support and defend the Constitution and laws of the United States.'' This loophole encourages illegal immigration and even ``birth tourism,'' which brings pregnant women to this country just in time to give birth. Both illegal immigration and birth tourism fuel human trafficking, which stems from a desire to claim the protections of our laws and the support of the welfare state. Permitting birthright citizenship is a misreading of the Fourteenth Amendment. The amendment states that U.S. citizens are ``all persons born or naturalized in the United States and subject to the jurisdiction thereof'' Those final five words are critical and clearly limit the application of the amendment. Visitors who are not U.S. citizens are ``subject to the jurisdiction'' of their country of origin, not the United States. Furthermore, the Constitution vests control over immigration law to Congress. It is past time for the legislative branch to exercise its power to end birthright citizenship. Eagle Forum thanks you for your leadership on this critical issue and stands ready to assist you. Faithfully, Phyllis Schlafly, Chairman. Mr. VITTER. I thank the Presiding Officer and yield the floor. Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. KIRK. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. KIRK. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to set aside the pending amendment to consider my amendment No. 273. Mr. LEAHY. Reserving the right to object, and I have to object. The Senator has the right, of course, to file his amendment, but there is an amendment presently pending and it would have to be set aside. There is [[Page S1377]] someone on this side who does not want it set aside, so I will object. Of course, the Senator can file his amendment, but the request, as I understand it, is to set aside the pending amendment. On behalf of several Senators on this side, I object. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard. Mr. KIRK. Madam President, I ask the Senator from Vermont if he opposes the amendment that was also cosponsored by Senator Feinstein. Mr. LEAHY. I don't know who is cosponsoring the amendment. Madam President, addressing the Senator through the Chair, as we are required to do by the Senate rules, I would say that my objection is to setting aside the pending amendment. I would further address the Senator from Illinois--but through the Chair--that when the amendment is up, I will be glad to look at it and take a position on it. Of course, he and I have known each other for a long time. I will be happy to tell him whether I will vote for it or not. Mr. KIRK. Madam President, I would say that this amendment is directed at backpage.com, probably the largest provider of online slavery services in the United States. I would hope the Senator is not defending Lacey and Larkin, who make $30 million a year off of slavery. Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, to respond to the Senator, I may very well support his amendment. The technical question is, Should the amendment of the Senator from Ohio be set aside so that this one may be the one pending? On that issue, there is objection. When the Senator's amendment is pending before the Senate, it may very well be one I will vote for, and I will be happy to discuss it at that time. Mr. KIRK. I thank the Senator. Madam President, this is an amendment that is directed at attacking backpage.com, which stands on the principle that was well established in the Civil War--that we Americans have freedom and we should not be free to enslave other Americans. I think, as the largest provider of online slavery services, Lacey and Larkin should be put out of business. I think it is incumbent on us, in the underlying legislation--I would remind the Senator from Vermont that we would live up to the full spirit of this legislation to make sure that just because the Internet was invented, slavery should not be empowered by the Internet. Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, will the Senator yield for a question? Mr. KIRK. Yes, I will yield. Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, through the Chair, I ask my friend from Illinois, who has been a warrior on these issues, particularly with this backpage.com and this advertisement of children and other people trafficked as part of this modern day slavery, if the Senator's amendment, the HERO Act, is actually included, if I am not mistaken. Mr. KIRK. Amendment No. 273 would include the SAVE Act, which has already substantially passed with huge bipartisan support of the party of the Senator from Vermont in the House of Representatives. If we look, we will find that backpage.com is active in every State, providing online services to the public. Mr. CORNYN. My question and point was that the SAVE Act, I understand, is the subject of the amendment that the Senator is seeking to offer and for which I hope our friends on the other side will relent and allow us to go forward, debating and amending this important piece of legislation. As distinguished from the SAVE Act, which is the subject of the Senator's your amendment, the HERO Act, I believe is already a part of the underlying legislation. I just wanted to congratulate the Senator from Illinois and thank him for his longstanding dedication to this issue and the contribution he has made to the underlying piece of legislation. Mr. KIRK. As a Senator from Illinois, our true gift to the people of this country has been individual freedom and dignity, epitomized by the Lincoln candidacy for the Senate, and by the victory in the Civil War. We should not allow the freedom of the Internet to allow freedom to enslave others. These two men have made tens of millions of dollars. I yield back to the distinguished majority whip. Mr. CORNYN. I would just ask the Senator to yield for one final question. Would the Senator please outline his bill, his amendment, the SAVE Act? Mr. KIRK. The critical issue is how to restrict the ability of Americans to enslave each other. I don't think we should have that freedom. We want to make sure we thread the needle very carefully here, to make sure the freedom and commerce available on the Internet is not going to help people such as Lacey and Larkin to enslave others. We want to make sure that there is an ever-widening sphere of freedom inside the United States that is not inhibited by the Internet. Mr. CORNYN. I would ask, is the Senator's amendment targeted in a way that respects the freedom of the Internet and the right of the people? Mr. KIRK. Very much so. The way we thread the needle here is to make online providers of slavery services liable for the costs that local governments incur in cleaning up the mess they create. In the case of Cook County, IL, we have had our crusading sheriff, who I would note is also a Democratic sheriff, establish a great effort to recover the young, underage girls involved and to make sure the costs incurred in helping out these young women--these citizens of the United States--to make sure they can charge it against the online provider, which makes eminent sense. I would say that our freedoms are protected because Tom Dart was elected by the people of Cook County. As an elected official, he is trying to simply carry out his goal there. This makes eminent sense to do this. Mr. CORNYN. I thank the Senator. Mr. KIRK. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire. Mrs. SHAHEEN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in morning business. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Remembering Jonathan Myrick Daniels Mrs. SHAHEEN. Madam President, this past weekend we saw a huge commemoration of the 50th anniversary of the Selma to Montgomery voting rights march. I rise to honor the work and sacrifice of Jonathan Myrick Daniels. He was a young Episcopalian seminary student from Keene. The Presiding Officer certainly knows his name and Keene, as well. He was from Keene, NH, and he answered the call of Rev. Martin Luther King, Jr., for clergy to travel to Alabama to join him on that march. Jonathan lost his life 5 months later, in an act that Reverend King called ``one of the most heroic Christian deeds of which I have heard in my entire ministry.'' Although Jonathan had originally intended to spend a short time in the South and then return to his studies at the Episcopal theological school in Boston, he felt compelled by events to remain in Alabama through the spring and summer to register voters with the Episcopalian Society for Cultural and Racial Unity. On August 14, 1965, Jonathan was arrested along with a number of other civil rights activists at a demonstration in Fort Deposit, AL, a small town outside of Montgomery. They had gone there to protest segregation in the town's stores. But their demonstration was over within minutes. Armed white men from the town descended on them and took them to jail. Jonathan and his fellow activists spent 6 days in the Hayneville jail. Many in the group were still teenagers. Despite the conditions, Jonathan somehow maintained an unflaggingly upbeat attitude and good humor. He wrote his mother in New Hampshire a brief letter from the jail, apologetically describing it as a peculiar birthday card for her. He wrote: The food is vile and we aren't allowed to bathe (whew!) . . . As you can imagine, I'll have a tale or two to swap over our next martini. He declined an offer of bail money from an Episcopal organization because the amount would not have covered the release of the rest of his group. On Friday, August 20, the whole group was suddenly released. Strangely, their bail had been waived, but no one was there to meet them or take them home. The town seemed completely deserted. Jonathan and a few others walked a block away to a store to buy something to eat and drink. As he climbed the steps of the porch to the store, he suddenly heard someone shout from inside [[Page S1378]] and threaten to shoot if they didn't leave. Jonathan barely had time to react before the man opened fire, but somehow he managed to jump in front of his friend Ruby Sales, a 17-year-old African-American girl. He saved Ruby's life, but Jonathan was killed by the close-range shot that was intended for her. He was just 26 years old. The shooter called the murder in to the sheriff's office himself. He said: I just shot two preachers. You better get on down here. An all- white jury later acquitted the man, taking just 2 hours to find him not guilty. While Jonathan was sacrificing his life for civil rights in Alabama, here in the Senate debate raged over the Federal Government's role in protecting the voting rights of disfranchised American citizens. Since 1870 the 15th Amendment to the Constitution had prohibited State governments from denying a citizen's right to vote based on race. However, in precincts throughout the South, Black Americans were subjected to discriminatory poll taxes, literacy tests, and other forms of voter intimidation. In many places, town clerks outright refused to register Black voters. Just 2 weeks before Jonathan was killed, Congress finally passed the Voting Rights Act, which outlawed electoral practices that discriminated against minority groups. Well, 2015 marks the 50th anniversary not just of that march in Selma but of this landmark law. While this anniversary presents an obvious time for reflection, it is also a time to look forward and address the challenges still facing our country. The impact of the Supreme Court's 2013 ruling in Shelby County v. Holder, which struck down a critical section of the law requiring Federal approval for electoral law changes in districts with the history of discrimination, is particularly troubling. This ruling now allows States to implement restrictive voting requirements that will make it more difficult for voters to cast their ballots. In fact, since this ruling, almost all of the affected States have already begun attempts to restrict voting, targeting seniors, students, minorities, and threatening their access to the polls. The right to make your voice heard as a citizen of this Nation is a fundamental principle of our democracy, and it should never be infringed upon. We have a responsibility to protect this right and address these injustices. While our Nation has made a lot of progress since the 1960s and 1970s, the struggle is far from over. Inequality and racism remain in our society. As long as discrimination and racial disparities exist, the full protections of the Voting Rights Act are necessary to guarantee the rights of citizenship for every American. Jonathan Daniels should be turning 76 years old in March. He is widely recognized as a martyr of the 20th century. In Keene, his hometown, an elementary school bears his name. As we mark the 50th anniversary of his passing, as well as the passage of the Voting Rights Act, we must strive to honor his legacy by ensuring that all current and future American citizens can exercise the rights he died to protect. I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Gardner). Without objection, it is so ordered. ____________________",package_114_112.csv,98839,98839,98907,"[congressional record volume 161, number 40 (tuesday, march 10, 2015)] [senate] [pages s1366-s1378] from the congressional record online through the government publishing office [ www.gpo.gov ] justice for victims of trafficking act of 2015--continued the presiding officer. the senator from louisiana. mr. cassidy. mr. president, i rise today to discuss a serious crime and a violation of human rights that must be stopped--human trafficking. it is a form of modern-day slavery, people profiting from the control and exploitation of others. i rise as a doc, a fellow who has practiced in the public hospital system for 32 years, understanding the unique role nurses, physicians, and other health care providers play in this issue. health care providers are frontline and one of the few to interact directly [[page s1367]] with trafficked women and children. a recent survey published in the annals of health law reports that 28 percent of trafficked women sought a health care professional while being held captive. now, this does not mean that the nurse, the doctor or other health care provider had the training to recognize it, but because of the unique and critical involvement with these victims, it is important these health care providers do have the tested tools and training to identify and help those being trafficked. the trafficking awareness training for health care amendment would save lives and, as importantly, would begin the rebuilding of lives destroyed by modern-day slavery. it would provide for the development of best practices to enable health care workers to recognize and assist victims of human trafficking. it is proven that many trafficking victims report receiving health care from federally funded clinics and emergency rooms while in captivity yet, as i mentioned earlier, they go undetected. this legislation would improve the awareness of health care workers, ultimately helping these victims. senator tim kaine recently spoke about a missive that pope francis gave on ash wednesday, calling for us to be ``islands of mercy in a sea of indifference.'' the ethic of nurses, physicians, and other health care workers is to be that merciful creature. this would give them the training to better enable them to be that ``island'' in what for that woman or child caught in captivity must seem a ``sea of indifference.'' having passed the house by unanimous consent, this amendment represents a bipartisan effort that will enable the medical community to bring relief to those suffering in ways that those of us who have never been there cannot imagine. senator peters is joining me in this bipartisan effort. i urge my colleagues to support this amendment and help transform victims of trafficking into survivors and people who blossom. i yield back. the presiding officer. the president pro tempore. authorizing the use of force against the islamic state mr. hatch. mr. president, i rise today to discuss one of the most critical national security challenges facing the senate: specifically, how we should craft an authorization for the use of military force against the terrorist organization known as the islamic state. i have spoken before on the floor about what i believe the outline of an authorization should contain. now that the president has released his proposal--and with secretary kerry, secretary carter, and general dempsey slated to testify tomorrow on behalf of this proposal--i feel compelled to address this topic in greater detail. before delving into the specifics of the administration's proposed authorization, we should consider how this institution has grappled with these vital questions throughout our nation's history. dating back to 1798, congress has on several occasions enacted legislation short of a formal declaration of war authorizing the use of military force by the president. in the late 18th and early 19th centuries, congress authorized u.s. naval action against both state and non-state actors who attacked u.s. commercial vessels. more recent authorizations formally passed by the congress include those intended to protect the middle east, taiwan, and southeast asia from communist aggression in the 1950s and 1960s. and since the end of the cold war, we have passed authorizations concerning lebanon, the september 11 attacks, and iraq-- all in 1991 and in 2002. i voted for those latter four authorizations here in this chamber. each case was unique, but in every case the white house did not send the congress ``take it or leave it'' language. rather, the senate and the house fashioned text that represented a negotiated outcome with the white house and within congress. for example, presidents eisenhower and george h.w. bush worked closely with congress to obtain strong authorizations for the use of military force, despite democrats controlling both chambers. president george w. bush twice did the same with a democrat-led senate. this approach yielded concrete benefits--a more thoughtful debate and strategy around our use of force, greater unity in supporting our military, and congressional willingness to fulfill our constitutional responsibilities. historically, the senate has fulfilled its role as a place of intelligent, informed debate in moving authorizations for use of military force. we must do so again as we consider this authorization to combat the islamic state. thirteen years ago, as the senate began to deliberate over an authorization to rid iraq of its violent dictator, i said: we all must leave our political party affiliations at the door when it comes to our national security and supporting our troops in the field. it is time for congress to come together, to hold a public debate, and to craft the right authorization to defeat the islamic state. turning to the proposed authorization before us today, i agree with the legal interpretation offered by the obama administration that the executive branch has the power to conduct operations against the islamic state under article ii of the constitution and the existing authorizations from 2001 and 2002. unfortunately, the administration has undermined the credibility of its own proposal by continuously changing its position as to how the 2001 and 2002 authorizations should be employed. therefore, in order to settle any legal questions about the power to use force against the islamic state--and to demonstrate america's resolve in this fight against terror--i firmly believe that a new authorization should be enacted. accordingly, the senior senator from oklahoma and i discussed in this chamber last month three principles that we believe should be included in a new authorization for the use of military force against the islamic state. first, the authorization must clearly articulate that the executive branch is authorized to use force--employed in accordance with the law of war--against the islamic state. second, the authorization must be flexible enough to be used against the islamic state as it appears today but also in whatever form the islamic state transforms into in the future. this flexibility must include the authority to use force against organizations that associate with or support the islamic state. finally, and most importantly, the authorization must not impose any artificial and unnecessary limitations, such as those based on time, geography, and type of force, which could interfere with our strategic objective of defeating the islamic state. unfortunately, the president's draft authorization does not fully adhere to these principles. first, the president's proposal ``does not authorize the use of the united states armed forces in enduring offensive ground operations.'' obviously, this is an unwise artificial limitation on what type of forces we can employ. but the president's proposed operative text offers little to define what this restriction entails. therefore, my initial reaction, one that is widely shared, is: what does this restriction mean? to be fair, the president's introductory letter that accompanied his draft does provide some insight into the administration's interpretation of this phrase. specifically, the president argues that the authorization would provide him with the power to conduct rescue operations, to provide advice and assistance to partner forces, and to deploy the use of special forces in missions against the islamic state's leadership, intelligence collection, and targeting missions. but in laying out his vision, the president's proposal also tells our enemies what he is not prepared to do. knowing these limitations would provide the islamic state with a critical advantage: the terrorists would exploit this information in crafting their strategies. why would we telegraph our strategy to our enemies? the president's proposed legal limitations will also limit our ability to adjust our strategy as needed based on the military situation on the ground. for example, when our counterterrorism strategy in iraq faltered during the mid 2000s, we changed it and we adopted a new counterinsurgency strategy commonly called the surge. as we all know, the surge was a great success. therefore, ensuring any authorization has the flexibility to allow our [[page s1368]] forces to change and adapt their strategies and tactics is essential. imposing the president's proposed artificial and unnecessary, yet legally binding, restrictions on our forces would be a colossal mistake. indeed, general jack keane, who devised the principles of the surge, recently testified before the senate armed services committee about his own proposal as to how to conduct operations against the islamic state. in his testimony, the general did advocate using special forces in a similar manner to what the president discussed in his letter accompanying his proposal. but the general went further. he stated that the united states and our coalition partners should position combat brigades in kuwait if our current operation ``stalls or is defeated.'' obviously, the use of combat brigades would be prohibited under the president's proposal. therefore, if the president's limited operations are not successful and additional ground forces are required, adopting the president's proposal would create significant uncertainty. this raises the question: would congress need to debate and pass yet another authorization before those units could be used in combat? on its face, this would be completely impractical and hardly in our national security interest. another area in which the president's proposal does not provide sufficient flexibility is its 3-year time limitation. simply put, if we advertise when the authorization expires at an arbitrary date and time, will our enemies not hunker down and wait for that date? secretary of state john kerry stated in his previous testimony before the senate foreign relations committee that the administration does not believe a new authorization should include a geographic limitation. to its credit, the president's proposal does not. specifically, the secretary argued: ``in our view, it would be a mistake to advertise to isil that there are safe havens for them outside of iraq and syria.'' undoubtedly, the secretary was concerned about creating artificial limitations that could negatively affect our ability to conduct necessary military operations. he is right. but his concern should extend to the other artificial restrictions that appear in this proposal. how else can we read the prohibition of ``enduring offensive ground combat operations'' and a 3-year time limitation? in conclusion, we can do better. our forces must have the flexibility to use, or the ability to threaten to use, whatever tools and strategies are necessary to defeat the islamic state. when america enters into a fight, we should enter to win. and we should not just do this in a halfhearted, stupid way. so i hope the white house will reconsider some of the things that they have advocated and that they have set forth and get this thing done right so that if we are going to enter into warfare, we ought to know what we are doing and ought to have the tools and the legal legalities to be able to do it well. the presiding officer (mr. hoeven). the minority leader. mr. reid. mr. president, what is the business before the senate? the presiding officer. the senate is considering s. 178. mr. reid. i suggest the absence of a quorum. the presiding officer. the clerk will call the roll. the senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. mr. portman. mr. president, i ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. the presiding officer. is there objection? mr. durbin. mr. president, i object. the presiding officer. objection is heard. the senior assistant legislative clerk continued with the call of the roll. mr. portman. mr. president, i ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. the presiding officer. is there objection? mr. durbin. mr. president, reserving the right to object. the presiding officer. the senator cannot reserve the right to object. is there objection? without objection, it is so ordered. the senator from ohio. mr. portman. mr. president, i know the presiding officer has other places to be, and i am going to be presiding in the chair in a moment. i will not offer amendments because my understanding is that even though we are on the bill, my colleagues on the other side of the aisle don't want me to offer noncontroversial amendments. so i will wait until they are ready for that just to keep the peace on the floor, but i will talk about the amendments because they are incredibly important to the underlying legislation. we are talking about the human trafficking legislation. this is something that as cochair and cofounder of the human trafficking caucus, as a father, and as someone who represents the citizens of ohio, who are directly affected by this, i have a strong interest. i am delighted the senate is taking up this legislation. i do hope it will be not just bipartisan but nonpartisan. i do not see any reason for it not to move forward in the senate, changing some of these laws that are in desperate need of changing to ensure that this horrific practice of human trafficking and sex trafficking can be curbed. it can be minimized by legislation that this chamber should have taken up, in my view, some time ago. we really haven't been at this subject for a decade. we know a lot more about the problem now. we know, unfortunately, that about 300,000 of our youth are subject to human trafficking--about 1,000 in my home state of ohio alone. the amendments i will offer--once someone on this side comes to the floor who will allow me to offer them--have to do with human trafficking in the broadest sense. the first amendment has to do with those people who are, unfortunately, trapped in sex trafficking being treated not as criminals but as victims and with ensuring that those victims get the proper care they need and the help to be able to get back on their feet. these are young people--we are told many times--who are between the ages of 11 and 13 when they are first exposed to human trafficking, in this case sex trafficking. in fact, that is the average age, we are told. having talked to some of the victims at home, having talked to some of those who are in the trenches working, trying to help these young women, girls, young men, and boys, this legislation is badly needed to ensure we are looking at this--not again as a criminal matter but--as victims who deserve our support. specifically, it requires that every state put together a plan to improve child protection services--containing, among other things, provisions and procedures requiring identification and assessments of all reports involving children known or to be suspected victims of sex trafficking--with better information and better data, a description of efforts to coordinate state law enforcement, child welfare agencies, and juvenile justice agencies such as runaway and homeless youth shelters to help serve these victims. finally, this legislation calls for an annual state report on the number of children identified as known or suspected to be a victim of sex trafficking. the other amendment i am going to offer will be an amendment with regard to homeless children and youth. as has been discussed on this floor before, the hud definition of homelessness practically excludes the most common situations for families and unaccompanied youths--and that would be staying in motels or temporarily with others because there is no place else for them to stay. even if local communities identified these families or youth as having the most pressing unmet needs, communities can't use the hud homeless assistance funds to serve them except in extremely limited or near-impossible conditions. this is related to human trafficking and also to sex trafficking in that, unfortunately, many of these young people involved in these situations--where they are homeless, where they are not on the street but are going from house to house or perhaps staying in a motel--are targeted by these traffickers. i believe these two amendments, which are not only bipartisan--and they are; i have support on both sides of the aisle--but are also nonpartisan and are ones that would be appropriate to include in the legislation. at the appropriate time i will offer those amendments.

(mr. portman assumed the chair.) mr. portman. mr. president, i ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. the presiding officer (mr. lankford). without objection, it is so ordered. mr. portman. mr. president, i rise today to offer my support to the underlying legislation we are considering on the floor today. this is the most significant antitrafficking legislation to come before the senate in over a decade. as i said earlier when i offered a couple of amendments, i am very pleased to be in this body on a nonpartisan basis, not just a bipartisan basis, to be able to address this issue, and i would like to thank the senators who have worked hard in their committees to make that possible. i thank senators cornyn and klobuchar for their work. i see senator wyden is here, senator leahy is here, senator grassley is here, and others who have been involved with this. they and their staffs are to be commended. it has been a good process. it is an issue a lot of us care about. why? because it is one that affects our states and our constituents in very significant ways. last year i cofounded and i now cochair the caucus on human trafficking with senator blumenthal, and we have had a number of good meetings and conferences here on the hill bringing experts together and raising awareness of this issue. unfortunately, this horrible crime affects every single part of our country. in ohio this came to my attention initially because in parts of ohio, along the i-75 corridor, particularly in toledo, there were higher incidences of prosecutions of human trafficking. a school group actually brought this to my attention several years ago. the more we looked into it, the more we realized that this affects so many of our constituents, and it particularly affects the most vulnerable in our society--children, runaways, the missing. in the greatest country on the face of the earth, almost 300,000 of our american children are at risk of trafficking and commercial sexual exploitation, more than 1,000 each year in ohio alone. in 2000 i did support the last major bill that directly addressed this growing problem of human trafficking. it was called the trafficking victims protection act. and i supported the reauthorization in 2011. but since that time we have learned a lot more about the problem. we now know more about how to eradicate what is really a modern form of slavery. our new legislation, which is called the justice for victims of trafficking act of 2015, builds on what we know works, and it strengthens protections for the victims. i would like to take a moment, if i could, to talk about two of the bills that are contained within this underlying legislation that are the product of a lot of bipartisan work that exemplifies some of the finest traditions of this body. the first is the bringing missing children home act. the bringing missing children home act is something i coauthored with senator schumer on the other side of the aisle, and we did it because we know there is unfortunately a strong correlation between victims of sex trafficking and children who have recently been in and out of the child welfare system. we also know that children who have run away or who are missing are the most vulnerable to being abused, trafficked, and exploited. in 2014 an fbi sting recovered 168 children who were victims of sex trafficking. nearly each one of those children--nearly all of them had been involved in some kind of foster care or the child welfare system. many of them had been reported missing--by the way, with insufficient information to find them. it is a strong correlation, and it is one that any effort to stop human trafficking must also address. that is what my legislation does. the bringing missing children home act strengthens law enforcement reporting and response procedures, making it easier to communicate and work with child welfare agencies. it accomplishes this in a number of ways. first, it amends the current missing children's assistance act so that federal law makes clear that children who are trafficked or sexually exploited are treated as victims and not as criminals. you will hear this in this debate, and this is one of the great underlying aspects of this legislation, we are changing the way we look at this, to understand that there is simply no such thing as a child prostitute. second, this legislation requires law enforcement to update their records of missing children within 30 days with all the relevant information obtained during the initial investigation. this is very important because this new information will allow us to find these children more easily and more quickly, to avoid them falling into the trap of sexual trafficking and traffickers. specifically, the bill requires new dental and medical records, as well as photograph, if available. for almost all of these children, there is a photograph available if you take the time to try to find it. i can't stress this last part enough. it is so hard to find these kids, and without having a photograph, it is made much more difficult. yet in most instances we apparently don't. we tracked this in ohio. let me give an interesting statistic. since january 1 of this year there have been 87 children reported missing in the state of ohio--87 kids. we only have photographs for 21 of them, so for 66 of these young people we have no photographs. it is tough to find them when you don't know what they look like. this bill will help change that. third, it requires law enforcement to work directly with state and local child welfare systems after someone is reported missing so that all the relevant information can be obtained as quickly as possible. finally, it removes all the roadblocks that prevent state attorneys general from modifying records in the national crime information center. we want these records to be updated [[page s1371]] constantly as new information is provided. to put it simply, we think it is a commonsense bill that streamlines how missing children cases are handled. it makes it easier to share information that could lead to recovery. the second bill i wish to talk about that is part of this underlying legislation is called the combat human trafficking act which i coauthored with senator feinstein. the bringing missing children home act is about helping victims. this legislation, the combat human trafficking act, is about punishing the traffickers. we start by giving prosecutors expanded tools to put traffickers behind bars. our legislation enlarges the number of charges federal prosecutors can level against traffickers and those who conspire with them. it also makes those engaged in trafficking strictly liable for their crimes. we also expand the training available for our federal law enforcement tasked with investigating and prosecuting traffickers, and we require that the bureau of justice statistics prepare an annual report detailing our success in this fight. just as importantly, this bill strengthens victims' rights by providing more information to victims on ongoing prosecutions, requiring them to be informed in a timely manner of any plea agreements or prosecution agreements in cases in which they are involved. the legislation we are considering passed out of the committee unanimously for a reason. there are things that do divide us in this place. we talk about those a lot, and everybody reads and hears about them. but this is an exception. this is about bringing us together, in this case to protect our kids from human trafficking. human traffickers and sexual trafficking are issues on which we should not have any divide. this is legislation both republicans and democrats can enthusiastically support. earlier today i joined with some of my colleagues in introducing some amendments to the legislation because although i support the underlying bill--it is a good bill--it can be made even better, and i am looking forward to the debate. in the process, i hope we will raise awareness about the issue, raise consciousness about the issue not just among our colleagues and around capitol hill but around the country because ultimately, if we are going to solve this problem in our communities, everyone needs to be part of it, everyone needs to be vigilant, and everyone needs to understand that this happens in your community, it happens in your state, and it happens, unfortunately, in our country. if we can raise awareness about this wicked practice of human trafficking and sex trafficking, that would do a lot to try to curb it, to reduce it, and eventually to stop it. this is what we came to washington to do--to pass legislation that actually helps back home. with this legislation, we can stand together to protect the most innocent among us from the most heinous of crimes. i thank you the presiding officer. i suggest the absence of a quorum. the presiding officer. the clerk will call the roll. the senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. mr. grassley. mr. president, i ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. the presiding officer. without objection, it is so ordered. mr. grassley. mr. president, i ask unanimous consent that the remarks i am going to make now not be part of the remarks on the bill that is before the senate. the presiding officer. without objection, it is so ordered. (the remarks of mr. grassley are printed in today's record under ``morning business.'') mr. grassley. i suggest the absence of a quorum. the presiding officer. the clerk will call the roll. the bill clerk proceeded to call the roll. mr. cornyn. mr. president, i ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. the presiding officer. without objection, it is so ordered. mr. cornyn. mr. president, yesterday the democratic leader, senator reid, told us that democrats and republicans could finally agree on one thing; that is, we ought to focus not on the partisan politics and the ideology that so often divides us, but we ought to focus on the victims of human trafficking, largely middle school-age girls who are bought and sold like commodities. i came to the floor yesterday and said that i believe we are all created in the image of god, and it is a sin, it is the very personification of evil for people to treat those same human beings as if they were things. that is what the scourge of human trafficking is all about. i was very glad to see that finally we seemed to be chipping away at the dysfunction of the senate that we have experienced over the last few years and, in the new majority, given an opportunity for an open amendment process on a subject that we all agree needs to be dealt with that we could work on together. so imagine my surprise when earlier today the same democratic leader said the democrats were going to filibuster this anti-human trafficking legislation. why in the world would they take a 180-degree turn? why would they do such an about-face or flip-flop? well, they said because there was language contained in the bill they disagreed with. no, they didn't say they would use this open amendment process to file an amendment and have a vote to strip it out or to modify it or otherwise change it; they said: we are going to block the bill; it is dead unless this language comes out. yet they do nothing to try to effect that outcome. we might wonder what this language is that they are so upset about that they would literally kick the tens of thousands of children and other victims to the curb because of their outrage that this language is contained in this legislation. well, imagine my surprise to find out that the reason why the democratic minority is going to filibuster this antitrafficking bill is because they object to language that has been the law of the land for 39 years--39 years. so i guess they woke up this morning and thought, well, we better do something about it. what is the provision that causes them so much discomfort, that they are so upset about that they are willing to block this legislation? well, it is something called the hyde amendment. basically what that does is it prohibits the use of taxpayer funds for abortions. i realize that in america we are of different minds on the subject of abortion. i am proudly pro-life, but others in our senate are pro- choice, and we probably have a whole spectrum of views on this very personal issue. but we have had a bipartisan consensus--unanimity almost--for the last 39 years that whatever else the law is, as handed down by the supreme court or by congress, we are not going to use taxpayer funds for abortion. so imagine my surprise when that very language and very reference was included in the justice for victims of trafficking act bill that now today i find out for the first time our democratic friends object to. imagine my surprise when that very language was part of the bill that was filed in mid-january and a month later was marked up and voted on in the senate judiciary committee and all members of the judiciary committee, democrats and republicans alike, voted for it. they voted for it unanimously. well, i don't believe that was a mistake. our friends across the aisle have outstanding staff. they are very talented people. i don't always agree with them, but they are good at what they do. i don't believe for a minute that they would have missed a reference in this legislation to a restriction on funding taxpayer- provided abortions, and i don't believe that those staff members, being the diligent professionals they are, didn't tell their principal, their member of the senate judiciary committee. so this idea that there has been some kind of ambush is preposterous. it is just not credible. well, imagine my surprise when not only did we have a 15-to-0 vote, i believe it was--in other words, a unanimous vote of the judiciary committee--for this bill, we have democratic cosponsors of this bill. not only do they support the bill, they have been actively working with us on the legislation. just looking at the face of the bill, i count 10 democratic cosponsors. do you think they didn't read the [[page s1372]] bill before they put their names on it? do you think their staffs didn't tell them what is in the bill? well, as we all know, this sort of thing is ordinarily very hotly debated. there are no shrinking violets in the u.s. senate, no people who sit passively on the sidelines and say: well, i better not speak up and express my views. that doesn't happen. we have strong-willed, talented people on both sides of the aisle, and there are no shrinking violets. let's just lay that to rest. people are willing to speak up, and they do speak up every day, every hour, virtually every minute on things they feel strongly about. so this idea that we have created an ambush, that we have surprised our colleagues by including this language in a bill that is on the floor, the justice for victims of trafficking act--voted unanimously out of the judiciary committee, all republicans and all democrats, with 10 democratic cosponsors--that we have somehow surprised them by including this restriction on taxpayer-funded abortion that has been the law of the land for 39 years is patently ridiculous. it is just not believable. let me provide a little more information. the reference in the bill is on page 50 under limitations. it says: ``amounts in the fund, or otherwise transferred from the fund''--that is, the crime victims compensation fund created by this legislation, $30 million that goes to help treat victims and help them heal and get on with their lives--this bill says that this fund ``shall be subject to the limitations on the use or expending of amounts described in sections 506 and 507 of division h of the consolidated appropriations act, 2014 . . . to the same extent as if amounts in the fund were funds appropriated under division h of such act.'' i went to see how many democrats voted for that consolidated appropriations act in 2014 that contained the hyde amendment language and the limitations on taxpayer-funded abortions. imagine my surprise when i saw that 55 democrats voted for that language in the 2014 consolidated appropriations bill that is referred to on pages 50 and 51 of the justice for victims of trafficking act. this is the same bill the democratic leader said democrats were going to filibuster because they were so outraged, they were surprised, they were bushwhacked, they were ambushed, they were tricked. twenty-three democrats voted for that same appropriation language in 2014. but it gets better--or worse, as the case may be. democrats have supported legislation consistent with the hyde amendment for a long time. as i have said, it has been the law of the land for 39 years. when was the last time? well, the department of homeland security funding. remember this back-and-forth we had over the defunding of the president's executive action on immigration that so many on our side of the aisle are upset about because it is not within the president's authority to do it--and that is not just my opinion; it is the federal judge's in brownsville who has issued a preliminary injunction--but how many democrats voted for the department of homeland security funding bill that contains that same limitation on taxpayer funding for abortions? forty-five democrats voted for it. so imagine my surprise when 45 democrats recently voted for that appropriations bill to come to the senate today and be told: we are outraged. we are never going to support that. and, by the way, we didn't know it was in the bill when we voted for it in the judiciary committee or when we cosponsored the bill. well, they presumably knew about it when they voted for the department of homeland security funding in february of 2015, when 32 of them voted for the cr omni or cromni in december of 2014. and, oh, by the way, remember obamacare? every single democrat voted to support obamacare which contained the same restriction on taxpayer funding for abortions. they have also voted for the children's health insurance program, the so-called schip, for defense authorization bills. in other words, our democratic friends have voted time and time and time again for the exact same language they now say they are going to filibuster on the justice for victims of trafficking act, language they said they weren't aware of when they voted for it--they didn't read it, their staff didn't tell them about it. well, if that is true, i would get new staff. but i know the staff on the democratic side, like the staff on the republican side, are highly professional people and they wouldn't fail to identify offensive language that their senator could not and would not and never has voted for, or they would be out of a job. so i plead with our democratic friends, please don't make this justice for victims of trafficking act another political football. for heaven's sake, if we can't agree to protect the most vulnerable victims of this heinous crime, what can we ever agree on? if we can't agree on that, if we are going to try to find a way to flyspeck legislation and say, well, i won't allow this bill to go forward if that language is included in there--even though it has been the law of the land for 39 years, even though routinely democrats have voted for that restriction on taxpayer-funded abortion time and time and time again--why start now, when we are talking about the most vulnerable victims of this heinous crime, and say: well, we are going to punish you. we are not going to provide you the services you need in order to heal and get better and get on with your life, because we woke up this morning, march 10, 2015, and after 39 years we decided this is where we draw the line. we are drawing the line here. never again will we ever vote for the hyde amendment to be applied to any funds appropriated by or in the possession of the federal government. so i really would ask my colleagues: please reconsider. please let's not do this. don't do this to these children and these victims of trafficking. don't do it to this institution. we all understand that washington can be a pretty tough place. all of us are volunteers, and we understand politics can sometimes be a tough business. but let's not take it out on these victims of human trafficking. that should be beneath us. they don't deserve that. they deserve better. if we pass this legislation and we get it to the president's desk and he signs it--which i believe he will--hundreds, if not thousands, of victims of human trafficking have a safe place to sleep, they will have people who love them and care for them try to help them heal and get better. we will take the money from the people who perpetrate these crimes and we will use that money to help provide needed services to these children and other victims of human trafficking. we will say ``no more'' to the teenaged girl who is arrested for prostitution, because she is a victim of trafficking--we will tell her, no more are you a criminal. we will recognize her for the victim she is, and we will treat her appropriately. we will deal not only with the supply side of this terrible crime, we will deal with the demand side--people who get off the hook too easily with impunity, people who purchase these illicit services, and somehow always seem to avoid responsibility and continue to participate in this crime with impunity. so the domestic trafficking victims fund in our legislation supplements existing authorized grant programs that are already subject to appropriation laws such as the hyde amendment. they are already subject to the same provisions. our legislation clarifies that the hyde amendment also applies to any funds that are used to supplement those existing grant programs. our legislation does not in any way expand or change the scope of the hyde amendment. it just says these funds operate under the same rules that cover the existing grant programs they supplement. everyone agrees the programs we supplement in this legislation need more funds. i know the distinguished ranking member, the senator from vermont, has made an impassioned plea to add more money beyond the victims compensation fund that we created. he is saying there needs to be more money. as a long-time member of the appropriations committee, i hope the appropriations committee looks at that and makes a decision whether they ought to supplement what we do. but these funds are being subjected to the same limitation on spending as [[page s1373]] every dollar the senate appropriations committee has appropriated during the last 39 years. so my hope is this, that members of the senate will rise above this disagreement, this posturing, this attempt to try to play ``gotcha'' at the expense of these victims of human trafficking. no member should attempt to make this bill a debate about extraneous issues and policies that have been settled on a bipartisan basis for 39 years. mr. president, i yield the floor. the presiding officer (ms. ayotte). the senator from vermont. mr. leahy. madam president, i have listened very carefully to my good friend from texas. we have worked together on many pieces of legislation over the years. in fact, i hoped we could have gotten this trafficking bill up during the last congress, as he knows. unfortunately, there were objections raised and we couldn't. i hope we are not going to get into a question where we compare apples and oranges and forget what we are supposed to be doing. the distinguished senator says on the one hand during the debate on the affordable care act, according to him--and i will take him at his word--that this language was in there and every democrat voted for it-- which meant, of course, that every republican voted against it. if you are going to use and follow his argument that the language in the affordable care act was voted for by democrats, it was voted against by republicans. i am not suggesting they don't care about the hyde amendment because they voted against it, according to the senator from texas. but let's talk about things that should be on appropriations bills. i am one of the few members of either party in this body who has actually prosecuted child molesters. i am one of the few members of this body who has actually gone to crime scenes and seen the results of child molestation. i am one of the few people in this body who has prosecuted a child molester, not with evidence from the child, but because the child was dead. the young boy had been raped by the man whom i prosecuted, and molested over a long period of time. so i don't need to have people tell me about the horrors of child molestation. i have seen it. i remember being in a room and looking at that dead child, the same age as one of my children. and i remember the man who did it who would have done anything to escape my prosecution, and i worked day and night around the clock for weeks. i was a young prosecutor in my twenties, and i prosecuted him and convicted him. he went up on appeal to the supreme court--our supreme court--and i argued that appeal myself, and his conviction was upheld. so i know the need for this. let's not let political ``gotcha'' games stop us from legislation that might protect these people. the senator from texas suggests i want more money. that is not quite what i said. he said he wanted $30 million based on fines. i said i just want to guarantee that $30 million was there. i think again of that child molester, that child murderer. he was just one of the many cases i prosecuted. we could have fined him $1 million or $20 million or $1 billion--or $200--and he would not have been able to pay it and wouldn't have paid it. if the victim had lived, there would be no money. all i want to make sure of--and i would be happy to see--is that if there are fines collected, that they go to help victims as they should. but if no money is collected from fines, i want to make sure there is money. we will prosecute somebody who has been involved with child trafficking or child molestation. we will prosecute them, as we should. they will go to prison and we will spend $25,000 to $35,000 a year of taxpayer dollars to keep them in prison, and we should. but we will say to the victim: i am sorry; we fined him $100,000 to go to the victims' fund, but he is basically judgment proof. i just want you to know we had good intentions. if he had paid that $100,000 fine, we would have given it to you to help you. but, gosh, go in peace. have a good life. all i am saying is this: if there is money from a fine, sure. the senator from texas and i agree that it should be put in the fund. but if there are no funds, don't promise a $30 million pot of money that will never be filled if there are no fines, if there is no money in it. if there is money from fines, put the money from fines in, but where there is a difference between the amount that is in there and the $30 million, then shouldn't we, as a country that spends trillions of dollars, give the difference between the fines and the actual $30 million? shouldn't we care about these victims? shouldn't we care about the people who are victimized? shouldn't we also do this: if we have the money in there, we could take increased steps to prevent victims from becoming victims in the first place. i would have given anything if there had been some program, some money, to have found out that this child i talked about was being victimized, and then we could have stopped it before the state's attorney got called in to look at the dead body. how much better it would have been if we could have stopped it to begin with. so all i am saying is this: i am happy to work with the senior senator from texas on this bill, just as i was last year. we had a bill without this provision, and i was hoping and trying to get consent to bring it up and pass it when we had a bill without this provision. it is important to note, though, that when it didn't have this provision last year, i wish we could have passed it. now let's work on a bill that will pass. if you want to score political points, do it on something that doesn't involve vulnerable children. let's work together to get a bill passed that helps them. and let's make sure that on the point i raised, that we address this at some point. if there is going to be $30 million worth of fines that go in there, i am all for it. my guess is that we would be lucky to get a small percentage of that. back when this came up in the house of representatives, they rejected this method of funding, and they called it budgetary gimmickry. actually, what the house did in authorizing the bill--they did what they were supposed to do. they authorized actual funding so we could stand up for the victims of human trafficking, not just stand here trying to score political points. in other words, let's have the money. let's make sure the money is there. this is like saying: if you commit a crime, we are going to fine you $100 million or $300 million or $1 billion. but if the person never had more than a net worth of $1,000, what difference does it make? put real teeth in here. stop the traffickers, and ensure there is money to help the victims. have money to help the victims. the distinguished presiding officer was one of the senators who testified at the judiciary committee hearing on human trafficking last month. other senators testified as well. their testimony had people tearing people up. the distinguished presiding officer was attorney general for her state. she understands the reality of this, as i do and others do. it has been years since i was state's attorney, but, i say to my friend from texas, i still wake up some nights from nightmares about the crime scenes i went to. i would wake up from them at night when we were debating the violence against women act, and i am glad that republicans and democrats joined together on that both here and in the other body so we could pass it. a victim is a victim is a victim, not a number, not a concept. those of us who have spent time with victims and those of us who have been at crime scenes of victims understand this. too often victims could no longer speak, could no longer testify. we would hear about them at their funeral. we can do better. so let's not talk about who scores points or who doesn't score points. there are good people who worked on this, good people in both parties. we are not going to be voting on something tonight, i imagine. let's spend the time between now and tomorrow sitting down and trying to work out a way forward. save the political points for something where the most vulnerable in society do not suffer. we can talk about what we will do on stock frauds or who gets taxed or what regulations we will have for corporations. there, raise your points. make political points there. but for anyone who has seen these victims and anyone who has talked with these victims and anyone who has been with these victims, they know this is not the time for politics. [[page s1374]] let's get together this evening or tomorrow. let's work it out so we can have something that will really protect victims, something that will have real funding to protect them--not something illusion, but real funding. and maybe if we can do that, i might have less nightmares about some of those victims i saw. my friend from texas was a judge; he certainly saw those cases. the presiding officer was attorney general; she saw those cases. we have a number of former prosecutors on both sides here. any one of us who has handled these cases has to remember every single aspect of them. i remember preparing for trial in these cases, having young children at home. i would work late in the office. i wouldn't bring the materials home at all because i didn't want my kids to see what i was looking at. i will admit there is another reason: i didn't want my children to see their father cry as i read these police investigations. these aren't statistics; these are real people. let's work together. i yield the floor. i suggest the absence of a quorum. the presiding officer. the clerk will call the roll. the bill clerk proceeded to call the roll. mr. vitter. madam president, i ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. the presiding officer. without objection, it is so ordered. mr. vitter. thank you, madam president. i have an amendment at the desk which has been slightly modified from its original form, and i ask unanimous consent that it be called up. the presiding officer. is there an objection? mr. leahy. madam president, i will object until i have had a chance to see the modification. the presiding officer. objection is heard. mr. vitter. madam president, i suggest the absence of a quorum. the presiding officer. the clerk will call the roll. the bill clerk proceeded to call the roll. mr. vitter. madam president, i ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. the presiding officer. without objection, it is so ordered. mr. vitter. madam president, i have now filed my slightly modified amendment--i will explain the modification in a minute--and it is at the desk. i ask unanimous consent to set aside the pending amendment so my amendment can be called up. the presiding officer. is there objection? mr. leahy. madam president, i object. some members on my side of the aisle have concerns about certain aspects of the senator's amendment, so on their behalf, i object to setting aside the pending amendment. the presiding officer. objection is heard. mr. vitter. madam president, i will explain and speak on this amendment even though it is not pending as we speak. i will also file an ongoing objection to anyone setting aside the pending amendment for another or for any votes being scheduled until this matter can be worked out. mr. vitter. madam president, the amendment i have at the desk is about a very important issue. before i explain what it is, i will say that i strongly support the underlying bill. i compliment senator cornyn and others who have worked on a bipartisan basis on this bill. i certainly look forward to supporting this bill irrespective of how the vote goes on my amendment, but i obviously hope my amendment is adopted in the context of this bill. clearly, this issue of human trafficking is a very serious one. it takes many forms, all of them ugly. one form is a phenomenon i am going to talk about today, which is the issue of birth tourism and trafficking in women and families who want to get into this country in order to physically have their children in this country because present policy recognizes those children immediately as u.s. citizens simply because they were born in this country. this phenomenon of birth tourism is a very real one, and it often puts these birth mothers and families in very dangerous situations, quite frankly, at the hands of human smugglers or the equivalent. madam president, i ask unanimous consent to have two news reports which illustrate this phenomenon printed in the record. the first news report is an article entitled ``no vacancy at california birth hotels,'' which underscores some of the abuses and horrendous conditions that go on as a result of this, and the second article is from the washington post, which is entitled ``inside the shadowy world of birth tourism at `maternity hotels.' '' there being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the record, as follows: [from worldmag.com, march 12, 2013] no vacancy at california birth hotels (by alaina gillogly and les sillars) it started last summer. neighbors of a tan, sunbaked mansion in chino hills, calif, knew something was going on in the large spanish-style home with stucco walls and a tiled roof overlooking the community. cars sped up and down the quiet little road:and a remarkable number of pregnant asian women came and went throughout the day. then in september, disgruntled neighbors became anxious citizens when 2,000 gallons of raw sewage spilled down the hillside. city authorities discovered in the subsequent investigation that the seven-bedroom house had become a 17-room ``birth hotel.'' the 7,964-square-foot residence on woodglen drive had been housing up to 30 pregnant chinese women who wanted to give birth to their children on american soil. each room had matching bedding and furniture, room keys, monogrammed towels, and a portable hot water kettle. last month, a local court shut down the operation, owned by los angeles hermas hotel inc., for building code violations that included exposed wires, missing smoke alarms, improper ventilation, and carpet stretched over a 3-foot-wide hole in the floor. the owners have six months to fix the problems and get the proper business permits, or they face permanent closure. this operation was just one of about 15 baby hotels in the heavily asian chino hills area, with dozens more around the country. ``birth tourism'' has made the news recently, but the chino hills incident touched off a crackdown in california as local authorities apply zoning and building codes in an effort to control the operations. it's also reopened the debate over the fourteenth amendment. birth hotels are legal in the u.s. because the fourteenth amendment gives citizenship to children born on american soil. they have the right to vote, immigrate from their parents' home country, and apply for permanent visas for their parents once they turn 21. birth tourism is a rising industry in countries like china, south korea, and saudi arabia. a three-month stay, plus medical fees, can easily run more than $50,000. although the chino hills operation had a variety of safety and health issues, other birth hotels offer luxurious accommodations with chefs to prepare food from the home country. recent studies by the national center for health statistics have reported the number of babies born to non-resident women topped 7,000 per year, up 50 percent since 2000, although it's not clear how many are the result of birth tourism. that is a tiny fraction of the number of children born with at least one parent in the country illegally--350,000 in 2009, according to the pew hispanic research center. but critics say ``birth tourism'' is an abuse of an american law designed to enfranchise slaves born on american soil. ``the practice is a misinterpretation of the fourteenth amendment,'' said john fonte, hudson institute senior fellow and director of the center for american common culture. ``u.s. citizens should be very concerned.'' some californians are concerned. rosanna mitchell started a group called not in chino hills to protest against the facility. ``our mission is to keep a vigilant eye and use all our efforts necessary to do so,'' wrote mitchell on the website. she told world that, aside from worries about sanitation, traffic, and under-the-table businesses, she doubts those patronizing birth hotels are genuinely pursuing the american dream. ``something needs to be done,'' she said. ``it's outrageous that they would take advantage of the u.s.'' rep. steve king, an iowa republican, introduced a bill in january to amend the fourteenth amendment to ``clarify'' that citizenship applies to those born in the u.s. provided at least one parent is a u.s. citizen, a lawful immigrant, or serving in the military. the bill, with 13 co-sponsors, is currently in committee. ____ [from the washington post, mar. 5] inside the shadowy world of birth tourism at ``maternity hotels'' (by abby phillip) in luxury apartment complexes in southern california and in grand, single-family homes in new york, ``maternity hotels'' are brimming with pregnant women and cooing newborn babies. for wealthy foreign women, the facilities offer the promise of a comfortable, worry- [[page s1375]] free vacation complete with a major perk: a u.s. passport for their newborn. one such maternity hotel in new york resembled a nursery: newborn babies rested in a row of bassinets that lined the wall, according to an nbc news report that offered a look inside the facility. women who book rooms at these properties can expect to live in well-stocked apartment complexes or large suburban homes with laundry and catered food as part of the package. once their babies are born in an american hospital, they are cared for by nurses while the mothers rest for at least a month. they can pass their time with shopping trips to luxury stores, trips to amusement parks or poolside at the ``hotel'' while attentive caretakers look after the infants, feeding, bathing and putting them to sleep on a regimented schedule, nbc news found. the cost--$40,000 to $80,000 per stay--is worth it for the prospect that the visitor's child will automatically be afforded the benefits given to u.s. citizens--and perhaps will have an easier time gaining legal residency in the united states when that child turns 21. ``for my baby, it's a chance to, a step to two countries'' cultures . . . chinese culture and american culture,'' one woman told nbc. there's nothing illegal about foreign nationals giving birth in the united states. but traveling to the hotels requires the illegal practice of lying about the real reason for visiting the united states. pregnant women purporting to be tourists enter the country in the latter stages of pregnancy, some overstaying their visas to recover in the comfort of the ``maternity hotels.'' birth tourism companies have flourished in recent years, according to federal officials--and many of them prefer hard- to-track cash to fuel their operations. that money, federal officials allege, is being pocketed by a group of individuals who have skirted tax law, flouted immigration laws and helped their clients defraud u.s. hospitals of tens of thousands of dollars for each baby born. on tuesday, federal agencies, including immigration and customs enforcement and the irs, along with the los angeles police department, conducted a massive operation to raid more than 30 california locations operated by ``birth tourism businesses.'' officials collected piles of evidence that will likely be used against some of the ``maternity hotel'' operators in future prosecutions. the companies advertise their services online--and no foreign language skills are necessary to guess the subtext. what are the benefits of a u.s. passport for a foreign national's unborn child? ``too many,'' the web site of starbabycare explains to prospective clients. ``you can enjoy the free education from junior high school to public high school. . . . you can apply loans or grants which is only for the u.s. citizen. . . . you can receive your senior supplement benefits when you are living overseas. . . . to the parent, after the baby becomes an adult, he/she can petition the parents for a green card.'' according to court documents, an undercover investigator was told: ``the baby will then have a birth certificate and `freedom.' the baby will have a bright future having united states citizenship.'' federal officials say that chao chen and jie zhu, the couple that operated the you win baby tourism company, engaged in ``sham marriages'' to get green cards for themselves. in documents filed in federal court this week, officials said that the two ``divorced'' in 2012, but married u.s. citizens in las vegas months later. both applied for permanent residency, and an immigration officer reviewing the cases noted that the marriages were ``suspect'' based on the timing. such companies have openly encouraged women willing to pay for the service to commit visa fraud as well. they were counseled not to tell customs and immigration officials that they were pregnant, to wear loose clothes and to avoid traveling to the united states while looking visibly pregnant. ``u.s. might refuse entry due to the belly is too big,'' starbabycare's web site informed potential customers. ``therefore the size of the belly is quite important to determine when you should arrive in los angeles.'' according to court documents, birth tourists were told to avoid traveling directly.to los angeles international airport from overseas, to avoid raising suspicion. they might even consider studying u.s. culture and booking recreational visits in order to make their travel seem more legitimate, the company advised. alternate arrival ports such as hawaii or las vegas were preferable. you win paid more than $60,000 a year to rent southern california apartments that housed the women, according to court documents. federal officials believe that starbabycare operated a ``maternity hotel'' from at least 10 units at one complex. as more attention has been trained on the practice in recent years, the outrage has--predictably--followed. los angeles county officials have cited the ``hotels'' for illegally operating business in residential homes in 2013. angry neighbors at a chino hills ``hotel'' picketed as the report became public. among its findings: the 17-bedroom, 17- bathroom operation was blamed for overloading the septic tank in the community. usually, the women participating in the programs paid several thousand dollars up front as a deposit and thousands more upon arrival in united states, according to investigators. the balance was paid after childbirth. but ``some or all'' of that money--which for you win likely amounted to over $1 million--went unreported to federal authorities in 2013. ``chen failed to report hundreds of thousands of dollars in income on his 2013 federal tax return,'' according to federal officials. as women went into birth, they were taken to local hospitals and declared jobless. as many as 400 babies associated with just one of these companies were born after 2013 in orange county, calif., hospitals. despite the fact that many of these women paid tens of thousands of dollars to participate in the ``maternity hotel'' scheme, they claimed to be unable to pay the hospitals, which typically charged about $25,000 per birth. some paid nothing at all, while others paid a fee closer to $4,000. no one was arrested during tuesday's raids. but immigration and customs enforcement agents collected evidence and potential witnesses for use in future prosecutions on tax, immigration and fraud charges. mr. vitter. madam president, recently the obama administration conducted a raid on some of these shadowy operations. i compliment them for doing that. there needs to be a crackdown on these operations, but the ultimate crackdown and ultimate solution is to change the policy of the federal government that recognizes these children immediately as u.s. citizens simply because they are physically born in this country even though both of their parents are here illegally. no parent is here under any sort of legal status, and that is the ultimate response and ultimate solution we need, and that is what my amendment--that i will call up as soon as that is allowed and get a vote on--is about. my amendment would change the present practice, policy, and law to say that only somebody born in this country who has at least one parent who is a u.s. citizen, a legal green card holder, or a serving member of the u.s. military, immediately gets that recognition as a u.s. citizen. as i suggested, this issue and practice--including this shadowy world of birth tourism and human smuggling--is a very serious issue. in fact, it is an exploding issue, as these recent cases in the press have brought to light. according to the center for immigration studies, each year about 300,000 to 400,000 children are born to illegal aliens in the united states, and under our present practice, all of them are immediately recognized as u.s. citizens. this is a huge magnet for more illegal crossings into our country, often at the hands of very dangerous people. birthright citizenship draws women from mexico and central america to make that dangerous trek north, often in the hands of coyotes and drug cartels. these women put their lives into the hands of criminal gangs with a demonstrated pension for sexual assault and sex trafficking. in addition, there is a huge business of birth tourism, including those who market to women and families in china. as i mentioned, on tuesday, march 3, federal agents broke up an alleged birth tourism ring in southern california, raiding several homes and apartment complexes where pregnant chinese women, who were here on fraudulent visas, paid up to $80,000 in some cases so their babies would be born here. dhs and irs investigators were seeking evidence and statements against those alleged in the scheme. besides visa fraud, authorities are looking into possible tax and money laundering charges. as i referred to the news reports that are now part of the record, in some cases this involves horrendous conditions and a very shadowy world in terms of this so-called birth tourism. the ultimate solution to this enormous magnet for illegal crossings-- often at the hands of very dangerous people--is to not recognize everyone who is simply born in the united states to be a citizen of the united states because of that fact alone. again, that is what my amendment would do. that is far more effective than any set of raids on these operations or on any enforcement provisions. if we move toward this, we would be in the company of a huge majority of countries in the world. of advanced economies, only canada and the united states grant automatic citizenship to children born to illegal aliens. no european country does that. no other advanced industrialized country does [[page s1376]] that, nor should we. as i suggested, it is a huge magnet for more and more illegal crossings, and my amendment would fix that. some people will argue this is not possible with a statutory change. this is embedded in the u.s. constitution through the 14th amendment and any change would have to be a constitutional amendment. i believe that is not the case and is a result of a fundamental misunderstanding of the constitution in this regard, including the 14th amendment. the 14th amendment does not say that all persons born in the united states are citizens, period, end of story. if we look at the precise language, it is very instructive. it states that citizenship extends to ``all persons born or naturalized in the united states and subject to the jurisdiction thereof.'' that latter phrase--``and subject to the jurisdiction thereof''--was included because it means something, and its original meaning clearly refers to the political allegiance of an individual and the jurisdiction that a foreign government has over that person. that is exactly why american indians and their children were not immediately recognized as u.s. citizens simply because of their birth in this country. there was actually litigation about that going directly to this language of the 14th amendment. the courts decided, no, the fact that these american indian children were born in the united states in and of itself did not make them u.s. citizens because ``and subject to the jurisdiction thereof'' had a meaning. it meant these children could not be subject to any other governmental or quasi- governmental authority and an american indian tribe was such an authority. because of that litigation and interpretation, in order for those american indian children to be recognized as american citizens, it actually took specific congressional action, and congress passed the indian citizenship act of 1924. i believe that goes directly to this issue that this practice is not embedded in the constitution and in the 14th amendment, and so that allows the statutory fix my language would offer. senator harry reid, the minority leader, actually introduced a bill in 1993 titled the ``immigration stabilization act,'' which included nearly identical language to my amendment and stand-alone bill. this language has broad support in the country, including broad bipartisan support. in senator reid's bill--now that is going back a ways--it stated ``in the exercise of its powers under section 5 of the 14th article of the amendment to the constitution of the united states, the congress has determined and hereby declares that any person born after the date of enactment of this title to a mother who is neither a citizen of the united states nor admitted to the united states as a lawful permanent resident will not be a u.s. citizen.'' so there we have language from a leading democratic member that goes to the same issue. there is broad bipartisan support, not just in the congress but in the country for this fix, particularly in the context of these huge illegal alien flows into the country. i believe americans recognize that we cannot continue to adopt and recognize this policy. it is an enormous magnet for the continuing flows of illegal aliens into the country. it brings up industries such as this shadowy world of birth tourism which was recently raided by federal authorities. it puts those mothers and families in the hands of very unsavory criminal elements in many cases, and we should not allow this to continue. my amendment would stop that practice, stop those abuses, and stop encouraging those flows of illegal aliens. i strongly encourage the senate to directly consider this amendment, vote on it, and to adopt it as part of this very important underlying bill. finally, i ask unanimous consent to have two letters that were written by leading groups on immigration reform, fair and the eagle forum, printed in the record. they are in strong support of this measure. i will submit additional letters of support as they develop over the next day or two. there being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the record, as follows: federation for american immigration reform, washington, dc, march 10, 2015. hon. david vitter, u.s. senate, hart senate office building, washington, dc. dear senator vitter: i am writing to thank you for your efforts as a united states senator to end birthright citizenship--the practice of automatically granting u.s. citizenship to anyone born in the united states, regardless of the parents' immigration status. your amendment to the justice for victims of trafficking act of 2015 (s. 178) would close this loophole that is based on a misinterpretation of the 14th amendment. specifically, your amendment would amend the constitution so that children born in the u.s. only gain citizenship automatically if one parent is either a u.s. citizen, legal permanent resident, or a non-immigrant active member of the armed forces. your language is consistent with the intent behind the ``subject to the jurisdiction thereof' clause of excluding from automatic citizenship american-born persons whose allegiance to the united states is incomplete. even the obama administration recognizes that the current practice of birthright citizenship encourages unlawful behavior and abuse of the system. indeed, just last week federal and local law enforcement officials raided the southern california offices of a company that encourages foreign pregnant women to come to the u.s. to give birth, promising them benefits like citizenship and free education. known as ``birth tourism,'' these companies arrange for pregnant women to come to the u.s. and advise them to provide false information on visa applications. this particular irvine business made approximately $2 million in 2013, with fees ranging from $15,000 to $50,000. your amendment would end this magnet of illegal immigration because the u.s.-born children of illegal aliens will not be eligible to sponsor family members for legal permanent resident status (green cards) once they reach the age of twenty-one. again, we thank you for sponsoring this commonsense legislation. sincerely, dan stein, president. ____ eagle forum, washington, dc, march 10, 2015. dear senator vitter, on behalf of eagle forum and the families we represent, we express our support for your amendment to s. 178 ending the practice of birthright citizenship. automatically granting citizenship to any child born on u.s. soil, even if the child's parents are temporary visitors or illegal aliens, cheapens the value of american citizenship. action by congress to clarify the long- misinterpreted intent of section 1 of the fourteenth amendment is both necessary and appropriate. birthright citizenship is an invitation to exploit the benefits of american citizenship. simply being born in our country, whatever the citizenship of the parents, entitles a child to government aid. it circumvents the lengthy process of naturalization, including the pledge of new citizens to ``support and defend the constitution and laws of the united states.'' this loophole encourages illegal immigration and even ``birth tourism,'' which brings pregnant women to this country just in time to give birth. both illegal immigration and birth tourism fuel human trafficking, which stems from a desire to claim the protections of our laws and the support of the welfare state. permitting birthright citizenship is a misreading of the fourteenth amendment. the amendment states that u.s. citizens are ``all persons born or naturalized in the united states and subject to the jurisdiction thereof'' those final five words are critical and clearly limit the application of the amendment. visitors who are not u.s. citizens are ``subject to the jurisdiction'' of their country of origin, not the united states. furthermore, the constitution vests control over immigration law to congress. it is past time for the legislative branch to exercise its power to end birthright citizenship. eagle forum thanks you for your leadership on this critical issue and stands ready to assist you. faithfully, phyllis schlafly, chairman. mr. vitter. i thank the presiding officer and yield the floor. mr. leahy. madam president, i suggest the absence of a quorum. the presiding officer. the clerk will call the roll. the senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. mr. kirk. madam president, i ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. the presiding officer. without objection, it is so ordered. mr. kirk. madam president, i ask unanimous consent to set aside the pending amendment to consider my amendment no. 273. mr. leahy. reserving the right to object, and i have to object. the senator has the right, of course, to file his amendment, but there is an amendment presently pending and it would have to be set aside. there is [[page s1377]] someone on this side who does not want it set aside, so i will object. of course, the senator can file his amendment, but the request, as i understand it, is to set aside the pending amendment. on behalf of several senators on this side, i object. the presiding officer. objection is heard. mr. kirk. madam president, i ask the senator from vermont if he opposes the amendment that was also cosponsored by senator feinstein. mr. leahy. i don't know who is cosponsoring the amendment. madam president, addressing the senator through the chair, as we are required to do by the senate rules, i would say that my objection is to setting aside the pending amendment. i would further address the senator from illinois--but through the chair--that when the amendment is up, i will be glad to look at it and take a position on it. of course, he and i have known each other for a long time. i will be happy to tell him whether i will vote for it or not. mr. kirk. madam president, i would say that this amendment is directed at backpage.com, probably the largest provider of online slavery services in the united states. i would hope the senator is not defending lacey and larkin, who make $30 million a year off of slavery. mr. leahy. madam president, to respond to the senator, i may very well support his amendment. the technical question is, should the amendment of the senator from ohio be set aside so that this one may be the one pending? on that issue, there is objection. when the senator's amendment is pending before the senate, it may very well be one i will vote for, and i will be happy to discuss it at that time. mr. kirk. i thank the senator. madam president, this is an amendment that is directed at attacking backpage.com, which stands on the principle that was well established in the civil war--that we americans have freedom and we should not be free to enslave other americans. i think, as the largest provider of online slavery services, lacey and larkin should be put out of business. i think it is incumbent on us, in the underlying legislation--i would remind the senator from vermont that we would live up to the full spirit of this legislation to make sure that just because the internet was invented, slavery should not be empowered by the internet. mr. cornyn. madam president, will the senator yield for a question? mr. kirk. yes, i will yield. mr. cornyn. madam president, through the chair, i ask my friend from illinois, who has been a warrior on these issues, particularly with this backpage.com and this advertisement of children and other people trafficked as part of this modern day slavery, if the senator's amendment, the hero act, is actually included, if i am not mistaken. mr. kirk. amendment no. 273 would include the save act, which has already substantially passed with huge bipartisan support of the party of the senator from vermont in the house of representatives. if we look, we will find that backpage.com is active in every state, providing online services to the public. mr. cornyn. my question and point was that the save act, i understand, is the subject of the amendment that the senator is seeking to offer and for which i hope our friends on the other side will relent and allow us to go forward, debating and amending this important piece of legislation. as distinguished from the save act, which is the subject of the senator's your amendment, the hero act, i believe is already a part of the underlying legislation. i just wanted to congratulate the senator from illinois and thank him for his longstanding dedication to this issue and the contribution he has made to the underlying piece of legislation. mr. kirk. as a senator from illinois, our true gift to the people of this country has been individual freedom and dignity, epitomized by the lincoln candidacy for the senate, and by the victory in the civil war. we should not allow the freedom of the internet to allow freedom to enslave others. these two men have made tens of millions of dollars. i yield back to the distinguished majority whip. mr. cornyn. i would just ask the senator to yield for one final question. would the senator please outline his bill, his amendment, the save act? mr. kirk. the critical issue is how to restrict the ability of americans to enslave each other. i don't think we should have that freedom. we want to make sure we thread the needle very carefully here, to make sure the freedom and commerce available on the internet is not going to help people such as lacey and larkin to enslave others. we want to make sure that there is an ever-widening sphere of freedom inside the united states that is not inhibited by the internet. mr. cornyn. i would ask, is the senator's amendment targeted in a way that respects the freedom of the internet and the right of the people? mr. kirk. very much so. the way we thread the needle here is to make online providers of slavery services liable for the costs that local governments incur in cleaning up the mess they create. in the case of cook county, il, we have had our crusading sheriff, who i would note is also a democratic sheriff, establish a great effort to recover the young, underage girls involved and to make sure the costs incurred in helping out these young women--these citizens of the united states--to make sure they can charge it against the online provider, which makes eminent sense. i would say that our freedoms are protected because tom dart was elected by the people of cook county. as an elected official, he is trying to simply carry out his goal there. this makes eminent sense to do this. mr. cornyn. i thank the senator. mr. kirk. i yield the floor. the presiding officer. the senator from new hampshire. mrs. shaheen. madam president, i ask unanimous consent to speak as in morning business. the presiding officer. without objection, it is so ordered. remembering jonathan myrick daniels mrs. shaheen. madam president, this past weekend we saw a huge commemoration of the 50th anniversary of the selma to montgomery voting rights march. i rise to honor the work and sacrifice of jonathan myrick daniels. he was a young episcopalian seminary student from keene. the presiding officer certainly knows his name and keene, as well. he was from keene, nh, and he answered the call of rev. martin luther king, jr., for clergy to travel to alabama to join him on that march. jonathan lost his life 5 months later, in an act that reverend king called ``one of the most heroic christian deeds of which i have heard in my entire ministry.'' although jonathan had originally intended to spend a short time in the south and then return to his studies at the episcopal theological school in boston, he felt compelled by events to remain in alabama through the spring and summer to register voters with the episcopalian society for cultural and racial unity. on august 14, 1965, jonathan was arrested along with a number of other civil rights activists at a demonstration in fort deposit, al, a small town outside of montgomery. they had gone there to protest segregation in the town's stores. but their demonstration was over within minutes. armed white men from the town descended on them and took them to jail. jonathan and his fellow activists spent 6 days in the hayneville jail. many in the group were still teenagers. despite the conditions, jonathan somehow maintained an unflaggingly upbeat attitude and good humor. he wrote his mother in new hampshire a brief letter from the jail, apologetically describing it as a peculiar birthday card for her. he wrote: the food is vile and we aren't allowed to bathe (whew!) . . . as you can imagine, i'll have a tale or two to swap over our next martini. he declined an offer of bail money from an episcopal organization because the amount would not have covered the release of the rest of his group. on friday, august 20, the whole group was suddenly released. strangely, their bail had been waived, but no one was there to meet them or take them home. the town seemed completely deserted. jonathan and a few others walked a block away to a store to buy something to eat and drink. as he climbed the steps of the porch to the store, he suddenly heard someone shout from inside [[page s1378]] and threaten to shoot if they didn't leave. jonathan barely had time to react before the man opened fire, but somehow he managed to jump in front of his friend ruby sales, a 17-year-old african-american girl. he saved ruby's life, but jonathan was killed by the close-range shot that was intended for her. he was just 26 years old. the shooter called the murder in to the sheriff's office himself. he said: i just shot two preachers. you better get on down here. an all- white jury later acquitted the man, taking just 2 hours to find him not guilty. while jonathan was sacrificing his life for civil rights in alabama, here in the senate debate raged over the federal government's role in protecting the voting rights of disfranchised american citizens. since 1870 the 15th amendment to the constitution had prohibited state governments from denying a citizen's right to vote based on race. however, in precincts throughout the south, black americans were subjected to discriminatory poll taxes, literacy tests, and other forms of voter intimidation. in many places, town clerks outright refused to register black voters. just 2 weeks before jonathan was killed, congress finally passed the voting rights act, which outlawed electoral practices that discriminated against minority groups. well, 2015 marks the 50th anniversary not just of that march in selma but of this landmark law. while this anniversary presents an obvious time for reflection, it is also a time to look forward and address the challenges still facing our country. the impact of the supreme court's 2013 ruling in shelby county v. holder, which struck down a critical section of the law requiring federal approval for electoral law changes in districts with the history of discrimination, is particularly troubling. this ruling now allows states to implement restrictive voting requirements that will make it more difficult for voters to cast their ballots. in fact, since this ruling, almost all of the affected states have already begun attempts to restrict voting, targeting seniors, students, minorities, and threatening their access to the polls. the right to make your voice heard as a citizen of this nation is a fundamental principle of our democracy, and it should never be infringed upon. we have a responsibility to protect this right and address these injustices. while our nation has made a lot of progress since the 1960s and 1970s, the struggle is far from over. inequality and racism remain in our society. as long as discrimination and racial disparities exist, the full protections of the voting rights act are necessary to guarantee the rights of citizenship for every american. jonathan daniels should be turning 76 years old in march. he is widely recognized as a martyr of the 20th century. in keene, his hometown, an elementary school bears his name. as we mark the 50th anniversary of his passing, as well as the passage of the voting rights act, we must strive to honor his legacy by ensuring that all current and future american citizens can exercise the rights he died to protect. i yield the floor. i suggest the absence of a quorum. the presiding officer. the clerk will call the roll. the senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. mr. mcconnell. mr. president, i ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. the presiding officer (mr. gardner). without objection, it is so ordered. ____________________",98839

Mr. President, the House of Representatives recently passed H.R. 749, the Passenger Rail Reform and Investment Act of 2015. I am pleased to see the House take bipartisan action on this bill. Intercity passenger rail is a critical part of our transportation infrastructure. People in many regions of the country are in desperate need of better ways to travel between fast-growing cities, and passenger rail is our best hope at relieving congestion on highways and runways that don't have additional room to expand. The House bill is a good step forward. H.R. 749 would maintain current levels of Federal support for Amtrak to operate routes that connect the country. It would also authorize some additional funding to invest in passenger rail projects and improve a Federal loan program that can be used for rail infrastructure. This is a productive place to start. The authorization levels in this bill are too low to get our passenger rail network where it needs to be, let alone to keep up with the rest of the world by bringing high-speed rail to the United States. H.R. 749 also fails to address critical rail safety priorities or even reauthorize funding for the Federal Railroad Administration's safety oversight activities.

Mr. President, today I honor the life of Aaron Anderson, a longtime resident of San Francisco, a passionate advocate for education, a devoted and loyal friend, and most of all a dedicated family man, who passed away on February 7, 2015. He spent 25 years in higher education as a learner, educator and contributor, most recently as an administrator and instructor at San Francisco State University's College of Business. He was 50 years old. Aaron was originally from Old Saybrook, CT, and attended the University of Connecticut, where he was captain of the men's cross country team. He began his career in higher education in student services at California Polytechnic State University and University of California, Berkeley, and went on to receive his Ph.D. in higher education from the University of Michigan. He was an expert and author in the area of organizational behavior and change, and brought this expertise to his passion for advancing education at all levels. At SFSU, Aaron served as director of strategic organizational initiatives, following stints as executive MBA program director and graduate business programs acting director. As an instructor in organizational change and psychology, he inspired and fostered creativity in his students and colleagues and served as a mentor to many of the graduate students in his classes. His passion for education extended outside the classroom as well, where he found time to serve as a Board member for Educate Our State and as President of the McKinley Elementary School PTA. In addition to the passion he brought to his profession, Aaron had a love for life that could not be suppressed. He remained physically active, biking wherever he went and never missing an opportunity to run up Mt. Tam or windsurf at Chrissy Field. He played weekly at traditional Irish music sessions in Berkeley and San Francisco and was an avid photographer and a prolific user of social media. Most importantly, however, he was deeply committed to his family, and embraced his early role as a stay-at-home dad. Aaron will be deeply missed by all those lucky enough to have known him. I send my heartfelt condolences to his loving wife, Darby Davenport, as well as his two sons, Clayton and Jeremy. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 40 (Tuesday, March 10, 2015)] [Senate] [Page S1381] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] REMEMBERING AARON ANDERSON Mrs. BOXER.

Mr. President, I wish today to honor Bob Hufford, an icon in the Missouri food industry for the past 63 years. He announced his retirement from the Associated Wholesale Grocers, AWG, board of directors after four decades of service with the last 11 years having served as its chairman. AWG is a retailer-owned cooperative serving over 2,300 retail member stores with a complete assortment of grocery, fresh meat, fresh produce, specialty foods, health care, and general merchandise items. During Bob's tenure as chairman, AWG sales grew from $4.5 billion in 2004 to almost $9 billion in 2014, while patronage paid to members grew by 155 percent. Bob helped direct the addition of the Fort Worth division in 2007, the replacement of the Oklahoma City distribution center in the same year, and the addition of the gulf coast division in 2013. During the same period, Bob grew his own company, Town and Country, in Fredericktown, MO, to be one of the largest employers in southeast Missouri with over 10,000 employees. Bob's passion for the food business was sparked early in his life by his father's work for a meatpacking company. Bob's first job was working in a local supermarket, while going through high school and later college. He became a sales representative for the National Biscuit Company, otherwise known as Nabisco, in 1958. While working for Nabisco, Bob called on two grocers, Max Penner and Wayne Gott, who recognized his leadership skills and work ethic. In 1970 they invited him to become a third partner in a new 5,000-square-foot store in Fredericktown, which Bob accepted. From that modest beginning Bob grew his business to 44 stores currently operating. Recently, Bob converted his company into an employee-owned company, allowing his employees to share in the store's profits. Today Bob serves as the CEO of the company, which operates stores in Missouri, Arkansas, Tennessee, and Kentucky. He and his wife Marsha have a wonderful family of five children, eight grandchildren, and two great-grandchildren. Many of his family members have worked in the business next to Bob. [[Page S1381]] Bob was named Missouri grocer of the year and inducted into the Missouri Grocers Association Hall of Fame, along with his good friend and former partner Wayne Gott. I ask that all my colleagues join me in congratulating Bob Hufford on his decades of success.

Bob's first job was working in a local supermarket, while going through high school and later college. He became a sales representative for the National Biscuit Company, otherwise known as Nabisco, in 1958. While working for Nabisco, Bob called on two grocers, Max Penner and Wayne Gott, who recognized his leadership skills and work ethic. In 1970 they invited him to become a third partner in a new 5,000-square-foot store in Fredericktown, which Bob accepted. From that modest beginning Bob grew his business to 44 stores currently operating. Recently, Bob converted his company into an employee-owned company, allowing his employees to share in the store's profits. Today Bob serves as the CEO of the company, which operates stores in Missouri, Arkansas, Tennessee, and Kentucky. He and his wife Marsha have a wonderful family of five children, eight grandchildren, and two great-grandchildren. Many of his family members have worked in the business next to Bob. [[Page S1381]] Bob was named Missouri grocer of the year and inducted into the Missouri Grocers Association Hall of Fame, along with his good friend and former partner Wayne Gott. I ask that all my colleagues join me in congratulating Bob Hufford on his decades of success. I wish him the best in his well-deserved retirement. ____________________",package_114_112.csv,2671,2671,2739,"[congressional record volume 161, number 40 (tuesday, march 10, 2015)] [senate] [pages s1380-s1381] from the congressional record online through the government publishing office [ www.gpo.gov ] additional statements mr. blunt. mr. president, i wish today to honor bob hufford, an icon in the missouri food industry for the past 63 years. he announced his retirement from the associated wholesale grocers, awg, board of directors after four decades of service with the last 11 years having served as its chairman. awg is a retailer-owned cooperative serving over 2,300 retail member stores with a complete assortment of grocery, fresh meat, fresh produce, specialty foods, health care, and general merchandise items. during bob's tenure as chairman, awg sales grew from $4.5 billion in 2004 to almost $9 billion in 2014, while patronage paid to members grew by 155 percent. bob helped direct the addition of the fort worth division in 2007, the replacement of the oklahoma city distribution center in the same year, and the addition of the gulf coast division in 2013. during the same period, bob grew his own company, town and country, in fredericktown, mo, to be one of the largest employers in southeast missouri with over 10,000 employees. bob's passion for the food business was sparked early in his life by his father's work for a meatpacking company. bob's first job was working in a local supermarket, while going through high school and later college. he became a sales representative for the national biscuit company, otherwise known as nabisco, in 1958. while working for nabisco, bob called on two grocers, max penner and wayne gott, who recognized his leadership skills and work ethic. in 1970 they invited him to become a third partner in a new 5,000-square-foot store in fredericktown, which bob accepted. from that modest beginning bob grew his business to 44 stores currently operating. recently, bob converted his company into an employee-owned company, allowing his employees to share in the store's profits. today bob serves as the ceo of the company, which operates stores in missouri, arkansas, tennessee, and kentucky. he and his wife marsha have a wonderful family of five children, eight grandchildren, and two great-grandchildren. many of his family members have worked in the business next to bob.

Mr. President, I wish to recognize the 302 U.S. Department of Agriculture Farm Service Agency--FSA--staff in North Dakota and thank them for their hard work and dedication to serving our State's farmers and ranchers. The farm bill is perhaps the most important piece of legislation we can pass for North Dakota, and I am proud to have been a part of writing and passing it. But the work doesn't end when the President signs the bill. In fact, that is when the real work begins for hundreds of FSA employees. Our farmers are faced with a big decision this month, when they will decide on both base acre reallocation and yield updates as well as elect which farm program they will participate in for the next 5 years. This is a big decision for farmers, and one that will have effects on their bottom lines for the next 5 years. It is also a complicated decision. The 2014 farm bill gave producers the opportunity to tailor farm programs to their specific operation by choosing between revenue protection--at the county or individual farm level--or price protection coverage, or a combination of the two. These important decisions are compounded for farmers with declining commodity prices and producers facing greater economic uncertainty than they have in recent years. And that is why the FSA staff are so important. They held 307 informational sessions attended by 15,469 individuals across our State throughout the winter to update as many producers as possible on their options. And they have had long days with our farmers at the local level helping folks with base reallocation, yield updates, and program election. Producers recognize and appreciate their hard work and dedication, and I thank them for their service to our State. I have heard from farmers more than once that ``the ladies in the office know what they're doing and have been very helpful.'' I would also like to thank the North Dakota State University Extension Service staff for the countless hours they have put into educating producers about their options and walking them through how each program and economic scenario could affect them for the next 5 years. Farmers and ranchers are the backbone of my State and this country. It is important that we continue to provide them with the tools and certainty they need. I thank the dedicated men and women of the Farm Service Agency who work daily to make this a reality. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 40 (Tuesday, March 10, 2015)] [Senate] [Page S1381] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] RECOGNIZING NORTH DAKOTA FARM SERVICE AGENCY EMPLOYEES Ms. HEITKAMP.

CREC-2015-03-10-pt1-PgS1385-2,CREC-2015-03-10,114,Introductory Statement on S. 683,"[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 40 (Tuesday, March 10, 2015)] [Senate] [Pages S1385-S1386] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] By Mr. BOOKER (for himself, Mrs. Gillibrand, and Mr. Paul): S. 683. A bill to extend the principle of federalism to State drug policy, provide access to medical marijuana, and enable research into the medicinal properties of marijuana; to the Committee on the Judiciary. Mr. BOOKER. Mr. President, I wish to introduce the Compassionate Access, Research Expansion, and Respect States Act CARERS Act. This commonsense legislation would make our Federal marijuana criminal laws fairer and more in line with our values and ensure that medical marijuana is more accessible to the millions of Americans who need it for treatment purposes. I thank Senator Kirsten Gillibrand and Senator Rand Paul for joining me on this bill, and I appreciate their hard work on this legislation. The CARERS Act would clarify how the Federal Government handles medical marijuana in the States. Currently, 23 States and the District of Columbia have passed laws legalizing medical marijuana for qualified patients. But the Federal Government still bans medical marijuana and treats the people who use it with contempt. It is time we end this backward approach toward a substance that helps treat millions of Americans, including veterans, who suffer from debilitating diseases. Today, the Federal Government classifies marijuana as a schedule I drug, meaning it lacks a recognized medical value and it has a high potential for abuse. Incredibly, marijuana shares the same classification with such drugs as heroin or LSD-substances that no one disputes are incredibly dangerous and harmful. Schedule II is the next controlled substances category for drugs deemed to have some medical use, such as cocaine and methamphetamine. The view that marijuana has no medical use whatsoever, but the methamphetamine has some medicinal use is troubling and contrary to science. We can do better. In 2013, the Department of Justice issued guidance to Federal prosecutors and regulators to refrain from prosecuting individuals that use, purchase or sell marijuana in States where it is legal as long as a State regulatory framework exists that maintains certain standards, such as a ban on sales to minors. As a result of this guidance, more and more States have taken steps to legalize medical marijuana. Sadly, despite this guidance, the inability of Federal and State law to be on the same page regarding the legality of medical marijuana has resulted in confusion and uncertainty for State regulators and the public about what the law requires. This lack of clarity is only part of the problem. Individual users of medical marijuana in States with legalized medical marijuana continue to be targeted by the Drug Enforcement Agency. That is unacceptable and must change. Individuals who use medical marijuana in States where it is legal should not fear prosecution simply based on prosecutorial discretion. We can do better. I am encouraged that the winds of change are blowing at the Federal level on whether to prosecute medical marijuana, but confusion remains. While the 2013 guidance likely trumps the prior two memorandum, what message do these documents send? Is medical marijuana legal or not? Is it right that the law can be changed at a moment's notice by an unelected Federal prosecutor? And what protection does State law afford medical marijuana users when State and Federal law collide, especially when marijuana is classified by the Federal Government as a schedule I drug? This legislation brings certainty and uniformity to these issues. Another problem with current law is that medical marijuana operates largely in the shadows because financial institutions are scared to do business with legitimate marijuana businesses. Banks and other financial institutions are hesitant to do business with legitimate marijuana businesses because they are concerned about losing their Federal depository insurance or facing Federal prosecution. As a result, the medical marijuana industry operates largely as a cash business which is bad for the economy and endangers public safety. Dealing with high quantities of cash and having to transport it leaves these businesses and their operatives as easy targets for criminals. The current medical marijuana situation in America is untenable. It is unfair for the Americans that operate legitimate marijuana businesses. It is unfair to people with disabilities, including veterans with post-traumatic [[Page S1386]] stress, traumatic brain injury or missing limbs who rely on medical marijuana for treatment. It is unfair to children with intractable epilepsy who need cannabidiol-known as CBD-to control their seizures. This issue has a real impact on the lives of ordinary Americans. Recently, my staff met with Jennie Stormes, a woman recently forced to leave my home State of New Jersey because of our restrictive medical marijuana laws. Ms. Stormes' son Jackson suffers from Dravet syndrome, a severe and debilitating form of epilepsy. Without medication, Jackson can have multiple seizures in a day. This condition has affected Jackson's development and put him through a tremendous amount of pain. Jeannie Stormes and her family shared with my staff the hardships of living in a State where it is hard to gain access to the medication Jackson needs. Jackson has tried 23 different drugs in 60-plus different combinations, but nothing worked to control his seizures. She talked about how medical marijuana was the first drug that controlled his seizures and changed their lives. Unfortunately, Jennie announced her family was moving to Colorado because it was too difficult in New Jersey to access the medicine Jackson needed to stay alive. We need this legislation to help the Jackson Stormes of the world. No child in America with a debilitating disease deserves to live a life of pain without access to the medication that he or she needs. Jennie and Jackson's story pains me. It tells me that we have a long way to go. But their story also gives me hope. It gives me hope because despite all the hardships they have gone through, they remain strong and committed to their cause. It is people like Jennie and Jackson who make our country great. It is for them that we need to continue to fight to move our country forward. The CARERS Act would take significant steps towards addressing the situation that Jackson and Jennie went through. First, the bill would end the Federal prohibition of medical marijuana. Millions of Americans need to gain access to the medicine that works best for them. The Federal Government's current stance on medical marijuana has only created confusion and uncertainty. This bill would prohibit the Federal Government from prosecuting persons who are in compliance with State medical marijuana laws and let people, like Jackson, gain access to the care they need. The bill would reschedule marijuana as a schedule II drug. The Drug Enforcement Agency insists that medical marijuana is a fallacy. It insists that marijuana is a dangerous substance and it is properly classified as a schedule I drug. Doctors know that is wrong, I know that is wrong, Jennie and Jackson know that is wrong. It is time we finally properly classify marijuana. The bill would also allow States to import CBD. CBD is an oil substance made from a marijuana plant that contains virtually no THC- meaning you experience no high from the drug. CBD is the medicine Jackson needs-along with thousands of other individuals with Dravet syndrome-to control his seizures. We must make this important drug more available so people can access the medication they need. The bill would create a safe harbor for banks and financial institutions that want to do business with legal medical marijuana businesses. It is not safe that these businesses are forced to deal only in cash. It is bad for our economy and it is bad for law enforcement. The bill would institute protections that these institutions need to feel comfortable doing business with medical marijuana establishments. The bill would promote research. A large problem for our Nation is that not enough research exists on the impact of medical marijuana. We know there are legitimate medical uses of the drug, but we can learn much more. We need to allow experts to access the drug to conduct tests and clinical trials to fully understand the effects of the drug and how it can best be utilized. This will only benefit the doctors who prescribe it, the lawmakers who regulate it, and the people who need it. Finally, the bill would allow VA doctors to prescribe medical marijuana to veterans in States that have legalized medical marijuana. Many men and women in uniform who have bravely served our Nation come home with invisible wounds of war and they deserve the best care available. This means allowing them access to the medicine they need to heal or control their condition. Those who have served our country deserve to be served by us, and that means receiving the best care available. I want to thank Senators Paul and Gillibrand for working on this legislation with me and I urge my colleagues to work with us to help ensure the CARERS Act is signed into law. ______","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 40 (Tuesday, March 10, 2015)] [Senate] [Pages S1385-S1386] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] By Mr. BOOKER (for himself, Mrs. Gillibrand, and Mr. Paul): S. 683.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide a limitation on certain aliens from claiming the earned income tax credit; to the Committee on Finance. Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation with Senator Enzi and a few other Senators to close a tax loophole that could mean billions of dollars in tax benefits going to individuals based on work they performed illegally in the United States. The tax benefit I am referring to is the earned-income tax credit. The earned-income tax credit was established as a work incentive to help move more individuals from the welfare rolls to the payrolls. The policy behind the EITC is one I and many of my colleagues support as it is intended to foster betterment and personal responsibility by giving those on the lowest rungs of the labor pool an extra incentive to jump in and stay in the workforce rather than rely on welfare programs. It does this by providing a tax benefit to low-income individuals based on the amount of earned income they have. The earned income tax credit is refundable, so it benefits even those who don't earn enough money to have a Federal income tax liability by providing them a cash payment. In 1996 Congress as a matter of policy determined that the earned income tax credit should be ``denied to individuals not authorized to be employed in the United States.'' That is the exact language used in the title of the relevant provision that was enacted in 1996. Congress carried this policy out by requiring those claiming the earned income tax credit to provide a Social Security number for themselves, their spouse, and their children. From a policy perspective, this rule made a lot of sense to me and many of my colleagues, as it passed both the House and the Senate with broad support. Obviously, if the object of the earned income tax credit is to encourage work, it makes no sense to provide such an incentive to those who are not legally allowed to work. Why would we want to encourage individuals to break our immigration laws? What Congress didn't know at the time was that at an unknown future date, a President, with the stroke of a pen, would essentially grant millions of undocumented workers amnesty. Under the President's action, those previously working illegally in the United States will be eligible for work authorization and a Social Security number. Based on an IRS interpretation of the earned income tax credit eligibility requirements, those who obtain a Social Security number will be eligible to claim the earned income tax credit not only for future years but for previous years while they were living and working in the United States undocumented. Based on the statute of limitations, those obtaining deferred action could then go back and amend or file returns for up to 3 previous tax years to take advantage of a credit that can be worth several thousands of dollars each year. The legislation I am introducing today with Senator Enzi will fix this loophole by making it clear that those granted deferred action are not eligible to claim the earned income tax credit for the years they worked in the United States as undocumented workers. This proposal is simply an extension of current policy. Those granted deferred action will still be able to claim the earned income tax credit in years going forward for work they perform legally. This proposal reflects the commonsense proposition that American taxpayers should not subsidize [[Page S1387]] work they performed illegally in the United States. This bill should be a no-brainer for any of my colleagues who agree that we should not reward individuals for breaking our immigration laws and our employment laws. I encourage my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support this commonsense piece of legislation. ______","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 40 (Tuesday, March 10, 2015)] [Senate] [Pages S1386-S1387] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] By Mr. GRASSLEY (for himself, Mr. Enzi, Mr. Crapo, Mr. Inhofe, Mr. Perdue, Mr. Scott, Mr. Roberts, Mr. Isakson, Mr. Risch, Mr. Boozman, Mr. Cornyn, and Mr. Johnson): S. 686.

CREC-2015-03-10-pt1-PgS1385,CREC-2015-03-10,114,STATEMENTS ON INTRODUCED BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS,"[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 40 (Tuesday, March 10, 2015)] [Senate] [Pages S1385-S1388] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] STATEMENTS ON INTRODUCED BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS ______ By Mr. BOOKER (for himself, Mrs. Gillibrand, and Mr. Paul): S. 683. A bill to extend the principle of federalism to State drug policy, provide access to medical marijuana, and enable research into the medicinal properties of marijuana; to the Committee on the Judiciary. Mr. BOOKER. Mr. President, I wish to introduce the Compassionate Access, Research Expansion, and Respect States Act CARERS Act. This commonsense legislation would make our Federal marijuana criminal laws fairer and more in line with our values and ensure that medical marijuana is more accessible to the millions of Americans who need it for treatment purposes. I thank Senator Kirsten Gillibrand and Senator Rand Paul for joining me on this bill, and I appreciate their hard work on this legislation. The CARERS Act would clarify how the Federal Government handles medical marijuana in the States. Currently, 23 States and the District of Columbia have passed laws legalizing medical marijuana for qualified patients. But the Federal Government still bans medical marijuana and treats the people who use it with contempt. It is time we end this backward approach toward a substance that helps treat millions of Americans, including veterans, who suffer from debilitating diseases. Today, the Federal Government classifies marijuana as a schedule I drug, meaning it lacks a recognized medical value and it has a high potential for abuse. Incredibly, marijuana shares the same classification with such drugs as heroin or LSD-substances that no one disputes are incredibly dangerous and harmful. Schedule II is the next controlled substances category for drugs deemed to have some medical use, such as cocaine and methamphetamine. The view that marijuana has no medical use whatsoever, but the methamphetamine has some medicinal use is troubling and contrary to science. We can do better. In 2013, the Department of Justice issued guidance to Federal prosecutors and regulators to refrain from prosecuting individuals that use, purchase or sell marijuana in States where it is legal as long as a State regulatory framework exists that maintains certain standards, such as a ban on sales to minors. As a result of this guidance, more and more States have taken steps to legalize medical marijuana. Sadly, despite this guidance, the inability of Federal and State law to be on the same page regarding the legality of medical marijuana has resulted in confusion and uncertainty for State regulators and the public about what the law requires. This lack of clarity is only part of the problem. Individual users of medical marijuana in States with legalized medical marijuana continue to be targeted by the Drug Enforcement Agency. That is unacceptable and must change. Individuals who use medical marijuana in States where it is legal should not fear prosecution simply based on prosecutorial discretion. We can do better. I am encouraged that the winds of change are blowing at the Federal level on whether to prosecute medical marijuana, but confusion remains. While the 2013 guidance likely trumps the prior two memorandum, what message do these documents send? Is medical marijuana legal or not? Is it right that the law can be changed at a moment's notice by an unelected Federal prosecutor? And what protection does State law afford medical marijuana users when State and Federal law collide, especially when marijuana is classified by the Federal Government as a schedule I drug? This legislation brings certainty and uniformity to these issues. Another problem with current law is that medical marijuana operates largely in the shadows because financial institutions are scared to do business with legitimate marijuana businesses. Banks and other financial institutions are hesitant to do business with legitimate marijuana businesses because they are concerned about losing their Federal depository insurance or facing Federal prosecution. As a result, the medical marijuana industry operates largely as a cash business which is bad for the economy and endangers public safety. Dealing with high quantities of cash and having to transport it leaves these businesses and their operatives as easy targets for criminals. The current medical marijuana situation in America is untenable. It is unfair for the Americans that operate legitimate marijuana businesses. It is unfair to people with disabilities, including veterans with post-traumatic [[Page S1386]] stress, traumatic brain injury or missing limbs who rely on medical marijuana for treatment. It is unfair to children with intractable epilepsy who need cannabidiol-known as CBD-to control their seizures. This issue has a real impact on the lives of ordinary Americans. Recently, my staff met with Jennie Stormes, a woman recently forced to leave my home State of New Jersey because of our restrictive medical marijuana laws. Ms. Stormes' son Jackson suffers from Dravet syndrome, a severe and debilitating form of epilepsy. Without medication, Jackson can have multiple seizures in a day. This condition has affected Jackson's development and put him through a tremendous amount of pain. Jeannie Stormes and her family shared with my staff the hardships of living in a State where it is hard to gain access to the medication Jackson needs. Jackson has tried 23 different drugs in 60-plus different combinations, but nothing worked to control his seizures. She talked about how medical marijuana was the first drug that controlled his seizures and changed their lives. Unfortunately, Jennie announced her family was moving to Colorado because it was too difficult in New Jersey to access the medicine Jackson needed to stay alive. We need this legislation to help the Jackson Stormes of the world. No child in America with a debilitating disease deserves to live a life of pain without access to the medication that he or she needs. Jennie and Jackson's story pains me. It tells me that we have a long way to go. But their story also gives me hope. It gives me hope because despite all the hardships they have gone through, they remain strong and committed to their cause. It is people like Jennie and Jackson who make our country great. It is for them that we need to continue to fight to move our country forward. The CARERS Act would take significant steps towards addressing the situation that Jackson and Jennie went through. First, the bill would end the Federal prohibition of medical marijuana. Millions of Americans need to gain access to the medicine that works best for them. The Federal Government's current stance on medical marijuana has only created confusion and uncertainty. This bill would prohibit the Federal Government from prosecuting persons who are in compliance with State medical marijuana laws and let people, like Jackson, gain access to the care they need. The bill would reschedule marijuana as a schedule II drug. The Drug Enforcement Agency insists that medical marijuana is a fallacy. It insists that marijuana is a dangerous substance and it is properly classified as a schedule I drug. Doctors know that is wrong, I know that is wrong, Jennie and Jackson know that is wrong. It is time we finally properly classify marijuana. The bill would also allow States to import CBD. CBD is an oil substance made from a marijuana plant that contains virtually no THC- meaning you experience no high from the drug. CBD is the medicine Jackson needs-along with thousands of other individuals with Dravet syndrome-to control his seizures. We must make this important drug more available so people can access the medication they need. The bill would create a safe harbor for banks and financial institutions that want to do business with legal medical marijuana businesses. It is not safe that these businesses are forced to deal only in cash. It is bad for our economy and it is bad for law enforcement. The bill would institute protections that these institutions need to feel comfortable doing business with medical marijuana establishments. The bill would promote research. A large problem for our Nation is that not enough research exists on the impact of medical marijuana. We know there are legitimate medical uses of the drug, but we can learn much more. We need to allow experts to access the drug to conduct tests and clinical trials to fully understand the effects of the drug and how it can best be utilized. This will only benefit the doctors who prescribe it, the lawmakers who regulate it, and the people who need it. Finally, the bill would allow VA doctors to prescribe medical marijuana to veterans in States that have legalized medical marijuana. Many men and women in uniform who have bravely served our Nation come home with invisible wounds of war and they deserve the best care available. This means allowing them access to the medicine they need to heal or control their condition. Those who have served our country deserve to be served by us, and that means receiving the best care available. I want to thank Senators Paul and Gillibrand for working on this legislation with me and I urge my colleagues to work with us to help ensure the CARERS Act is signed into law. ______ By Mr. GRASSLEY (for himself, Mr. Enzi, Mr. Crapo, Mr. Inhofe, Mr. Perdue, Mr. Scott, Mr. Roberts, Mr. Isakson, Mr. Risch, Mr. Boozman, Mr. Cornyn, and Mr. Johnson): S. 686.

SHORT TITLE. This Act may be cited as the ``Reducing Exposure to Asbestos Database Act of 2015'' or the ``READ Act''. SEC. 2. FINDINGS. Congress finds that-- (1) the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency has classified asbestos as a category A human carcinogen, the highest cancer hazard classification for a substance; (2) the International Agency for Research on Cancer has classified asbestos as a class 1 human carcinogen; (3) despite the enactment of the Asbestos Information Act of 1988 (15 U.S.C. 2607 note; Public Law 100-577), which sought to improve transparency and public awareness of the presence of asbestos in commercial materials and products, many people in the United States still incorrectly believe that-- (A) asbestos has been banned in the United States; and (B) there is no risk of exposure to asbestos through the use of new commercial products; (4) asbestos is still being imported and used, and is otherwise present as a contaminant, in some consumer and industrial products in the United States; (5) according to the Environmental Protection Agency, the manufacture, importation, processing, and distribution in commerce of many asbestos-containing products are not banned in the United States, including-- (A) cement corrugated sheet; (B) cement flat sheet; (C) clothing; (D) pipeline wrap; (E) roofing felt; (F) vinyl floor tile; (G) cement shingle; (H) millboard; (I) cement pipe; (J) automatic transmission components; (K) clutch facings; (L) friction materials; (M) disc brake pads; (N) drum brake linings; (O) brake blocks; (P) gaskets; (Q) non-roofing coatings; and (R) roof coatings; (6) consumers and workers are at risk of asbestos exposure, and families of workers are also put at risk because of asbestos brought home by the workers on the shoes, clothes, skin, and hair of the workers; (7) the Environmental Working Group estimates that as many as 10,000 citizens of the United States die each year from mesothelioma and other asbestos-related diseases; (8) the National Institutes of Health reported to Congress that mesothelioma is a difficult disease to detect, diagnose, and treat; (9) mesothelioma responds poorly to conventional chemotherapy, and although new combination treatments for mesothelioma have demonstrated some benefits-- (A) the median survival period for mesothelioma is only 1 year after diagnosis of the disease; and (B) the majority of mesothelioma patients die within 2 years of diagnosis of the disease; and (10) until asbestos is completely banned from being used in or imported into the United States, transparent and accessible information about the location and identity of asbestos and asbestos-containing products in the United States is necessary to better protect consumers, workers, families, and the people of the United States.

A bill to extend the principle of federalism to State drug policy, provide access to medical marijuana, and enable research into the medicinal properties of marijuana; to the Committee on the Judiciary. Mr. BOOKER. Mr. President, I wish to introduce the Compassionate Access, Research Expansion, and Respect States Act CARERS Act. This commonsense legislation would make our Federal marijuana criminal laws fairer and more in line with our values and ensure that medical marijuana is more accessible to the millions of Americans who need it for treatment purposes. I thank Senator Kirsten Gillibrand and Senator Rand Paul for joining me on this bill, and I appreciate their hard work on this legislation. The CARERS Act would clarify how the Federal Government handles medical marijuana in the States. Currently, 23 States and the District of Columbia have passed laws legalizing medical marijuana for qualified patients. But the Federal Government still bans medical marijuana and treats the people who use it with contempt. It is time we end this backward approach toward a substance that helps treat millions of Americans, including veterans, who suffer from debilitating diseases. Today, the Federal Government classifies marijuana as a schedule I drug, meaning it lacks a recognized medical value and it has a high potential for abuse. Incredibly, marijuana shares the same classification with such drugs as heroin or LSD-substances that no one disputes are incredibly dangerous and harmful. Schedule II is the next controlled substances category for drugs deemed to have some medical use, such as cocaine and methamphetamine. The view that marijuana has no medical use whatsoever, but the methamphetamine has some medicinal use is troubling and contrary to science. We can do better. In 2013, the Department of Justice issued guidance to Federal prosecutors and regulators to refrain from prosecuting individuals that use, purchase or sell marijuana in States where it is legal as long as a State regulatory framework exists that maintains certain standards, such as a ban on sales to minors. As a result of this guidance, more and more States have taken steps to legalize medical marijuana. Sadly, despite this guidance, the inability of Federal and State law to be on the same page regarding the legality of medical marijuana has resulted in confusion and uncertainty for State regulators and the public about what the law requires. This lack of clarity is only part of the problem. Individual users of medical marijuana in States with legalized medical marijuana continue to be targeted by the Drug Enforcement Agency. That is unacceptable and must change. Individuals who use medical marijuana in States where it is legal should not fear prosecution simply based on prosecutorial discretion. We can do better. I am encouraged that the winds of change are blowing at the Federal level on whether to prosecute medical marijuana, but confusion remains. While the 2013 guidance likely trumps the prior two memorandum, what message do these documents send? Is medical marijuana legal or not? Is it right that the law can be changed at a moment's notice by an unelected Federal prosecutor? And what protection does State law afford medical marijuana users when State and Federal law collide, especially when marijuana is classified by the Federal Government as a schedule I drug? This legislation brings certainty and uniformity to these issues. Another problem with current law is that medical marijuana operates largely in the shadows because financial institutions are scared to do business with legitimate marijuana businesses. Banks and other financial institutions are hesitant to do business with legitimate marijuana businesses because they are concerned about losing their Federal depository insurance or facing Federal prosecution. As a result, the medical marijuana industry operates largely as a cash business which is bad for the economy and endangers public safety. Dealing with high quantities of cash and having to transport it leaves these businesses and their operatives as easy targets for criminals. The current medical marijuana situation in America is untenable. It is unfair for the Americans that operate legitimate marijuana businesses. It is unfair to people with disabilities, including veterans with post-traumatic [[Page S1386]] stress, traumatic brain injury or missing limbs who rely on medical marijuana for treatment. It is unfair to children with intractable epilepsy who need cannabidiol-known as CBD-to control their seizures. This issue has a real impact on the lives of ordinary Americans. Recently, my staff met with Jennie Stormes, a woman recently forced to leave my home State of New Jersey because of our restrictive medical marijuana laws. Ms. Stormes' son Jackson suffers from Dravet syndrome, a severe and debilitating form of epilepsy. Without medication, Jackson can have multiple seizures in a day. This condition has affected Jackson's development and put him through a tremendous amount of pain. Jeannie Stormes and her family shared with my staff the hardships of living in a State where it is hard to gain access to the medication Jackson needs. Jackson has tried 23 different drugs in 60-plus different combinations, but nothing worked to control his seizures. She talked about how medical marijuana was the first drug that controlled his seizures and changed their lives. Unfortunately, Jennie announced her family was moving to Colorado because it was too difficult in New Jersey to access the medicine Jackson needed to stay alive. We need this legislation to help the Jackson Stormes of the world. No child in America with a debilitating disease deserves to live a life of pain without access to the medication that he or she needs. Jennie and Jackson's story pains me. It tells me that we have a long way to go. But their story also gives me hope. It gives me hope because despite all the hardships they have gone through, they remain strong and committed to their cause. It is people like Jennie and Jackson who make our country great. It is for them that we need to continue to fight to move our country forward. The CARERS Act would take significant steps towards addressing the situation that Jackson and Jennie went through. First, the bill would end the Federal prohibition of medical marijuana. Millions of Americans need to gain access to the medicine that works best for them. The Federal Government's current stance on medical marijuana has only created confusion and uncertainty. This bill would prohibit the Federal Government from prosecuting persons who are in compliance with State medical marijuana laws and let people, like Jackson, gain access to the care they need. The bill would reschedule marijuana as a schedule II drug. The Drug Enforcement Agency insists that medical marijuana is a fallacy. It insists that marijuana is a dangerous substance and it is properly classified as a schedule I drug. Doctors know that is wrong, I know that is wrong, Jennie and Jackson know that is wrong. It is time we finally properly classify marijuana. The bill would also allow States to import CBD. CBD is an oil substance made from a marijuana plant that contains virtually no THC- meaning you experience no high from the drug. CBD is the medicine Jackson needs-along with thousands of other individuals with Dravet syndrome-to control his seizures. We must make this important drug more available so people can access the medication they need. The bill would create a safe harbor for banks and financial institutions that want to do business with legal medical marijuana businesses. It is not safe that these businesses are forced to deal only in cash. It is bad for our economy and it is bad for law enforcement. The bill would institute protections that these institutions need to feel comfortable doing business with medical marijuana establishments. The bill would promote research. A large problem for our Nation is that not enough research exists on the impact of medical marijuana. We know there are legitimate medical uses of the drug, but we can learn much more. We need to allow experts to access the drug to conduct tests and clinical trials to fully understand the effects of the drug and how it can best be utilized. This will only benefit the doctors who prescribe it, the lawmakers who regulate it, and the people who need it. Finally, the bill would allow VA doctors to prescribe medical marijuana to veterans in States that have legalized medical marijuana. Many men and women in uniform who have bravely served our Nation come home with invisible wounds of war and they deserve the best care available. This means allowing them access to the medicine they need to heal or control their condition. Those who have served our country deserve to be served by us, and that means receiving the best care available. I want to thank Senators Paul and Gillibrand for working on this legislation with me and I urge my colleagues to work with us to help ensure the CARERS Act is signed into law. ______ By Mr. GRASSLEY (for himself, Mr. Enzi, Mr. Crapo, Mr. Inhofe, Mr. Perdue, Mr. Scott, Mr. Roberts, Mr. Isakson, Mr. Risch, Mr. Boozman, Mr. Cornyn, and Mr. Johnson): S. 686. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide a limitation on certain aliens from claiming the earned income tax credit; to the Committee on Finance. Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation with Senator Enzi and a few other Senators to close a tax loophole that could mean billions of dollars in tax benefits going to individuals based on work they performed illegally in the United States. The tax benefit I am referring to is the earned-income tax credit. The earned-income tax credit was established as a work incentive to help move more individuals from the welfare rolls to the payrolls. The policy behind the EITC is one I and many of my colleagues support as it is intended to foster betterment and personal responsibility by giving those on the lowest rungs of the labor pool an extra incentive to jump in and stay in the workforce rather than rely on welfare programs. It does this by providing a tax benefit to low-income individuals based on the amount of earned income they have. The earned income tax credit is refundable, so it benefits even those who don't earn enough money to have a Federal income tax liability by providing them a cash payment. In 1996 Congress as a matter of policy determined that the earned income tax credit should be ``denied to individuals not authorized to be employed in the United States.'' That is the exact language used in the title of the relevant provision that was enacted in 1996. Congress carried this policy out by requiring those claiming the earned income tax credit to provide a Social Security number for themselves, their spouse, and their children. From a policy perspective, this rule made a lot of sense to me and many of my colleagues, as it passed both the House and the Senate with broad support. Obviously, if the object of the earned income tax credit is to encourage work, it makes no sense to provide such an incentive to those who are not legally allowed to work. Why would we want to encourage individuals to break our immigration laws? What Congress didn't know at the time was that at an unknown future date, a President, with the stroke of a pen, would essentially grant millions of undocumented workers amnesty. Under the President's action, those previously working illegally in the United States will be eligible for work authorization and a Social Security number. Based on an IRS interpretation of the earned income tax credit eligibility requirements, those who obtain a Social Security number will be eligible to claim the earned income tax credit not only for future years but for previous years while they were living and working in the United States undocumented. Based on the statute of limitations, those obtaining deferred action could then go back and amend or file returns for up to 3 previous tax years to take advantage of a credit that can be worth several thousands of dollars each year. The legislation I am introducing today with Senator Enzi will fix this loophole by making it clear that those granted deferred action are not eligible to claim the earned income tax credit for the years they worked in the United States as undocumented workers. This proposal is simply an extension of current policy. Those granted deferred action will still be able to claim the earned income tax credit in years going forward for work they perform legally. This proposal reflects the commonsense proposition that American taxpayers should not subsidize [[Page S1387]] work they performed illegally in the United States. This bill should be a no-brainer for any of my colleagues who agree that we should not reward individuals for breaking our immigration laws and our employment laws. I encourage my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support this commonsense piece of legislation. ______ By Mr. REID (for himself and Mr. Heller): S. 691. A bill to require the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to obtain the consent of affected State and local governments before authorizing the construction of a nuclear waste repository; to the Committee on Environment and Public Works. Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record. There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows: S. 691 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. This Act may be cited as the ``Nuclear Waste Informed Consent Act''. SEC. 2. DEFINITIONS. In this Act, the terms ``affected Indian tribe'', ``Commission'', ``high-level radioactive waste'', ``repository'', and ``spent nuclear fuel'' have the meanings given the terms in section 2 of the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982 (42 U.S.C. 10101). SEC. 3. CONSENT BASED APPROVAL. (a) In General.--The Commission may not authorize construction of a repository unless the Secretary has entered into an agreement to host the repository with-- (1) the Governor of the State in which the repository is proposed to be located; (2) each affected unit of local government; (3) any unit of general local government contiguous to the affected unit of local government if spent nuclear fuel or high-level radioactive waste will be transported through that unit of general local government for disposal at the repository; and (4) each affected Indian tribe.

A bill to amend the Asbestos Information Act of 1988 to establish a public database of asbestos-containing products, to require public disclosure of information pertaining to the manufacture, processing, distribution, and use of asbestos-containing products in the United States, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Environment and Public Works. Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record. There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows: S. 700 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. This Act may be cited as the ``Reducing Exposure to Asbestos Database Act of 2015'' or the ``READ Act''. SEC. 2. FINDINGS. Congress finds that-- (1) the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency has classified asbestos as a category A human carcinogen, the highest cancer hazard classification for a substance; (2) the International Agency for Research on Cancer has classified asbestos as a class 1 human carcinogen; (3) despite the enactment of the Asbestos Information Act of 1988 (15 U.S.C. 2607 note; Public Law 100-577), which sought to improve transparency and public awareness of the presence of asbestos in commercial materials and products, many people in the United States still incorrectly believe that-- (A) asbestos has been banned in the United States; and (B) there is no risk of exposure to asbestos through the use of new commercial products; (4) asbestos is still being imported and used, and is otherwise present as a contaminant, in some consumer and industrial products in the United States; (5) according to the Environmental Protection Agency, the manufacture, importation, processing, and distribution in commerce of many asbestos-containing products are not banned in the United States, including-- (A) cement corrugated sheet; (B) cement flat sheet; (C) clothing; (D) pipeline wrap; (E) roofing felt; (F) vinyl floor tile; (G) cement shingle; (H) millboard; (I) cement pipe; (J) automatic transmission components; (K) clutch facings; (L) friction materials; (M) disc brake pads; (N) drum brake linings; (O) brake blocks; (P) gaskets; (Q) non-roofing coatings; and (R) roof coatings; (6) consumers and workers are at risk of asbestos exposure, and families of workers are also put at risk because of asbestos brought home by the workers on the shoes, clothes, skin, and hair of the workers; (7) the Environmental Working Group estimates that as many as 10,000 citizens of the United States die each year from mesothelioma and other asbestos-related diseases; (8) the National Institutes of Health reported to Congress that mesothelioma is a difficult disease to detect, diagnose, and treat; (9) mesothelioma responds poorly to conventional chemotherapy, and although new combination treatments for mesothelioma have demonstrated some benefits-- (A) the median survival period for mesothelioma is only 1 year after diagnosis of the disease; and (B) the majority of mesothelioma patients die within 2 years of diagnosis of the disease; and (10) until asbestos is completely banned from being used in or imported into the United States, transparent and accessible information about the location and identity of asbestos and asbestos-containing products in the United States is necessary to better protect consumers, workers, families, and the people of the United States. SEC. 3. ESTABLISHMENT OF ASBESTOS-CONTAINING PRODUCT DATABASE. The Asbestos Information Act of 1988 (15 U.S.C. 2607 note; Public Law 100-577) is amended-- (1) in section 4-- (A) by redesignating paragraphs (3) through (7) as paragraphs (4) through (8), respectively; and (B) by inserting after paragraph (2) the following: ``(3) Asbestos-containing product.--The term `asbestos- containing product' means any product (including any part) to which asbestos is deliberately or knowingly added or in which asbestos is deliberately used or knowingly present in any concentration.''; (2) in section 2, by inserting ``(referred to in this Act as the `Administrator')'' after ``Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency''; and (3) by adding at the end the following: ``SEC. 5. ASBESTOS-CONTAINING PRODUCT DATABASE. ``(a) In General.--Using funds otherwise made available to the Administrator, the Administrator shall, in accordance with this section, establish and maintain a database of asbestos-containing products (referred to in this Act as the `database') that is-- ``(1) publicly available; ``(2) searchable; and ``(3) accessible through the website of the Administrator. ``(b) Submission of Detailed Implementation Plan to Congress.-- ``(1) In general.--Not later than 180 days after the date of enactment of this section, the Administrator shall submit to the appropriate congressional committees a detailed plan for establishing and maintaining the database, including plans for the operation, content, maintenance, and functionality of the database. ``(2) Integration.--The plan described in paragraph (1) shall detail the integration of the database into the overall information technology improvement objectives and plans of the Administrator. ``(3) Implementation.--The plan described in paragraph (1) shall include-- ``(A) a detailed implementation schedule for the database; and ``(B) plans for a public awareness campaign conducted by the Administrator to increase awareness of the database. ``(c) Date of Initial Availability.--Not later than 180 days after the date on which the Administrator submits the plan under subsection (b)(1), the Administrator shall establish the database. ``(d) Submission of Information on Asbestos-containing Products.-- ``(1) In general.--Beginning on the date that is 270 days after the date of enactment of this section, and not less frequently than annually thereafter, any person who manufactured, processed, distributed, sold, imported, transported, or stored an asbestos-containing product in the immediately preceding calendar year shall submit to the Administrator a written report, in a form to be determined by the Administrator, containing information sufficient to identify the characteristics and location of the asbestos- containing products. ``(2) Contents.--The report under paragraph (1) shall include-- ``(A) the type or class of asbestos-containing product; ``(B) the manufacturer of the asbestos-containing product; [[Page S1388]] ``(C) any applicable import history of the asbestos- containing product; ``(D) the name and street address of any location accessible by the public in which the person has reasonable knowledge that the asbestos-containing product has been present within the immediately preceding calendar year; and ``(E) any additional information the Administrator determines is appropriate to enable consumers and workers to avoid exposure to asbestos-containing products. ``(e) Organization of Database.--The Administrator shall-- ``(1) categorize the information available on the database-- ``(A) in a manner consistent with the public interest; and ``(B) in such manner as the Administrator determines will facilitate easy use by consumers; and ``(2) ensure, to the maximum extent practicable, that the database is sortable and accessible by-- ``(A) the date on which information is submitted for inclusion in the database; ``(B) the name of the asbestos-containing product; ``(C) the model name; ``(D) the name of the manufacturer; ``(E) the name of the importer, if applicable; ``(F) the name of the reporting person; ``(G) the name and street address of any location in which an asbestos-containing product is reported to have been present; and ``(H) any other element the Administrator considers to be in the public interest. ``SEC. 6.

It insists that marijuana is a dangerous substance and it is properly classified as a schedule I drug. Doctors know that is wrong, I know that is wrong, Jennie and Jackson know that is wrong. It is time we finally properly classify marijuana. The bill would also allow States to import CBD. CBD is an oil substance made from a marijuana plant that contains virtually no THC- meaning you experience no high from the drug. CBD is the medicine Jackson needs-along with thousands of other individuals with Dravet syndrome-to control his seizures. We must make this important drug more available so people can access the medication they need. The bill would create a safe harbor for banks and financial institutions that want to do business with legal medical marijuana businesses. It is not safe that these businesses are forced to deal only in cash. It is bad for our economy and it is bad for law enforcement. The bill would institute protections that these institutions need to feel comfortable doing business with medical marijuana establishments. The bill would promote research. A large problem for our Nation is that not enough research exists on the impact of medical marijuana. We know there are legitimate medical uses of the drug, but we can learn much more. We need to allow experts to access the drug to conduct tests and clinical trials to fully understand the effects of the drug and how it can best be utilized. This will only benefit the doctors who prescribe it, the lawmakers who regulate it, and the people who need it. Finally, the bill would allow VA doctors to prescribe medical marijuana to veterans in States that have legalized medical marijuana. Many men and women in uniform who have bravely served our Nation come home with invisible wounds of war and they deserve the best care available. This means allowing them access to the medicine they need to heal or control their condition. Those who have served our country deserve to be served by us, and that means receiving the best care available. I want to thank Senators Paul and Gillibrand for working on this legislation with me and I urge my colleagues to work with us to help ensure the CARERS Act is signed into law. ______ By Mr. GRASSLEY (for himself, Mr. Enzi, Mr. Crapo, Mr. Inhofe, Mr. Perdue, Mr. Scott, Mr. Roberts, Mr. Isakson, Mr. Risch, Mr. Boozman, Mr. Cornyn, and Mr. Johnson): S. 686. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide a limitation on certain aliens from claiming the earned income tax credit; to the Committee on Finance. Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation with Senator Enzi and a few other Senators to close a tax loophole that could mean billions of dollars in tax benefits going to individuals based on work they performed illegally in the United States. The tax benefit I am referring to is the earned-income tax credit. The earned-income tax credit was established as a work incentive to help move more individuals from the welfare rolls to the payrolls. The policy behind the EITC is one I and many of my colleagues support as it is intended to foster betterment and personal responsibility by giving those on the lowest rungs of the labor pool an extra incentive to jump in and stay in the workforce rather than rely on welfare programs. It does this by providing a tax benefit to low-income individuals based on the amount of earned income they have. The earned income tax credit is refundable, so it benefits even those who don't earn enough money to have a Federal income tax liability by providing them a cash payment. In 1996 Congress as a matter of policy determined that the earned income tax credit should be ``denied to individuals not authorized to be employed in the United States.'' That is the exact language used in the title of the relevant provision that was enacted in 1996. Congress carried this policy out by requiring those claiming the earned income tax credit to provide a Social Security number for themselves, their spouse, and their children. From a policy perspective, this rule made a lot of sense to me and many of my colleagues, as it passed both the House and the Senate with broad support. Obviously, if the object of the earned income tax credit is to encourage work, it makes no sense to provide such an incentive to those who are not legally allowed to work. Why would we want to encourage individuals to break our immigration laws? What Congress didn't know at the time was that at an unknown future date, a President, with the stroke of a pen, would essentially grant millions of undocumented workers amnesty. Under the President's action, those previously working illegally in the United States will be eligible for work authorization and a Social Security number. Based on an IRS interpretation of the earned income tax credit eligibility requirements, those who obtain a Social Security number will be eligible to claim the earned income tax credit not only for future years but for previous years while they were living and working in the United States undocumented. Based on the statute of limitations, those obtaining deferred action could then go back and amend or file returns for up to 3 previous tax years to take advantage of a credit that can be worth several thousands of dollars each year. The legislation I am introducing today with Senator Enzi will fix this loophole by making it clear that those granted deferred action are not eligible to claim the earned income tax credit for the years they worked in the United States as undocumented workers. This proposal is simply an extension of current policy. Those granted deferred action will still be able to claim the earned income tax credit in years going forward for work they perform legally. This proposal reflects the commonsense proposition that American taxpayers should not subsidize [[Page S1387]] work they performed illegally in the United States. This bill should be a no-brainer for any of my colleagues who agree that we should not reward individuals for breaking our immigration laws and our employment laws. I encourage my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support this commonsense piece of legislation. ______ By Mr. REID (for himself and Mr. Heller): S. 691.

A bill to amend the Asbestos Information Act of 1988 to establish a public database of asbestos-containing products, to require public disclosure of information pertaining to the manufacture, processing, distribution, and use of asbestos-containing products in the United States, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Environment and Public Works. Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record. There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows: S. 700 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. This Act may be cited as the ``Reducing Exposure to Asbestos Database Act of 2015'' or the ``READ Act''. SEC. 2. FINDINGS. Congress finds that-- (1) the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency has classified asbestos as a category A human carcinogen, the highest cancer hazard classification for a substance; (2) the International Agency for Research on Cancer has classified asbestos as a class 1 human carcinogen; (3) despite the enactment of the Asbestos Information Act of 1988 (15 U.S.C. 2607 note; Public Law 100-577), which sought to improve transparency and public awareness of the presence of asbestos in commercial materials and products, many people in the United States still incorrectly believe that-- (A) asbestos has been banned in the United States; and (B) there is no risk of exposure to asbestos through the use of new commercial products; (4) asbestos is still being imported and used, and is otherwise present as a contaminant, in some consumer and industrial products in the United States; (5) according to the Environmental Protection Agency, the manufacture, importation, processing, and distribution in commerce of many asbestos-containing products are not banned in the United States, including-- (A) cement corrugated sheet; (B) cement flat sheet; (C) clothing; (D) pipeline wrap; (E) roofing felt; (F) vinyl floor tile; (G) cement shingle; (H) millboard; (I) cement pipe; (J) automatic transmission components; (K) clutch facings; (L) friction materials; (M) disc brake pads; (N) drum brake linings; (O) brake blocks; (P) gaskets; (Q) non-roofing coatings; and (R) roof coatings; (6) consumers and workers are at risk of asbestos exposure, and families of workers are also put at risk because of asbestos brought home by the workers on the shoes, clothes, skin, and hair of the workers; (7) the Environmental Working Group estimates that as many as 10,000 citizens of the United States die each year from mesothelioma and other asbestos-related diseases; (8) the National Institutes of Health reported to Congress that mesothelioma is a difficult disease to detect, diagnose, and treat; (9) mesothelioma responds poorly to conventional chemotherapy, and although new combination treatments for mesothelioma have demonstrated some benefits-- (A) the median survival period for mesothelioma is only 1 year after diagnosis of the disease; and (B) the majority of mesothelioma patients die within 2 years of diagnosis of the disease; and (10) until asbestos is completely banned from being used in or imported into the United States, transparent and accessible information about the location and identity of asbestos and asbestos-containing products in the United States is necessary to better protect consumers, workers, families, and the people of the United States. SEC. 3. ESTABLISHMENT OF ASBESTOS-CONTAINING PRODUCT DATABASE. The Asbestos Information Act of 1988 (15 U.S.C. 2607 note; Public Law 100-577) is amended-- (1) in section 4-- (A) by redesignating paragraphs (3) through (7) as paragraphs (4) through (8), respectively; and (B) by inserting after paragraph (2) the following: ``(3) Asbestos-containing product.--The term `asbestos- containing product' means any product (including any part) to which asbestos is deliberately or knowingly added or in which asbestos is deliberately used or knowingly present in any concentration.''; (2) in section 2, by inserting ``(referred to in this Act as the `Administrator')'' after ``Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency''; and (3) by adding at the end the following: ``SEC. 5.

congressional record online through the government publishing office [ www.gpo.gov ] statements on introduced bills and joint resolutions ______ by mr. booker (for himself, mrs. gillibrand, and mr. paul): s. 683. a bill to extend the principle of federalism to state drug policy, provide access to medical marijuana, and enable research into the medicinal properties of marijuana; to the committee on the judiciary. mr. booker. mr. president, i wish to introduce the compassionate access, research expansion, and respect states act carers act. this commonsense legislation would make our federal marijuana criminal laws fairer and more in line with our values and ensure that medical marijuana is more accessible to the millions of americans who need it for treatment purposes. i thank senator kirsten gillibrand and senator rand paul for joining me on this bill, and i appreciate their hard work on this legislation. the carers act would clarify how the federal government handles medical marijuana in the states. currently, 23 states and the district of columbia have passed laws legalizing medical marijuana for qualified patients. but the federal government still bans medical marijuana and treats the people who use it with contempt. it is time we end this backward approach toward a substance that helps treat millions of americans, including veterans, who suffer from debilitating diseases. today, the federal government classifies marijuana as a schedule i drug, meaning it lacks a recognized medical value and it has a high potential for abuse. incredibly, marijuana shares the same classification with such drugs as heroin or lsd-substances that no one disputes are incredibly dangerous and harmful. schedule ii is the next controlled substances category for drugs deemed to have some medical use, such as cocaine and methamphetamine. the view that marijuana has no medical use whatsoever, but the methamphetamine has some medicinal use is troubling and contrary to science. we can do better. in 2013, the department of justice issued guidance to federal prosecutors and regulators to refrain from prosecuting individuals that use, purchase or sell marijuana in states where it is legal as long as a state regulatory framework exists that maintains certain standards, such as a ban on sales to minors. as a result of this guidance, more and more states have taken steps to legalize medical marijuana. sadly, despite this guidance, the inability of federal and state law to be on the same page regarding the legality of medical marijuana has resulted in confusion and uncertainty for state regulators and the public about what the law requires. this lack of clarity is only part of the problem. individual users of medical marijuana in states with legalized medical marijuana continue to be targeted by the drug enforcement agency. that is unacceptable and must change. individuals who use medical marijuana in states where it is legal should not fear prosecution simply based on prosecutorial discretion. we can do better. i am encouraged that the winds of change are blowing at the federal level on whether to prosecute medical marijuana, but confusion remains. while the 2013 guidance likely trumps the prior two memorandum, what message do these documents send? is medical marijuana legal or not? is it right that the law can be changed at a moment's notice by an unelected federal prosecutor? and what protection does state law afford medical marijuana users when state and federal law collide, especially when marijuana is classified by the federal government as a schedule i drug? this legislation brings certainty and uniformity to these issues. another problem with current law is that medical marijuana operates largely in the shadows because financial institutions are scared to do business with legitimate marijuana businesses. banks and other financial institutions are hesitant to do business with legitimate marijuana businesses because they are concerned about losing their federal depository insurance or facing federal prosecution. as a result, the medical marijuana industry operates largely as a cash business which is bad for the economy and endangers public safety. dealing with high quantities of cash and having to transport it leaves these businesses and their operatives as easy targets for criminals. the current medical marijuana situation in america is untenable. it is unfair for the americans that operate legitimate marijuana businesses. it is unfair to people with disabilities, including veterans with post-traumatic [[page s1386]] stress, traumatic brain injury or missing limbs who rely on medical marijuana for treatment. it is unfair to children with intractable epilepsy who need cannabidiol-known as cbd-to control their seizures. this issue has a real impact on the lives of ordinary americans. recently, my staff met with jennie stormes, a woman recently forced to leave my home state of new jersey because of our restrictive medical marijuana laws. ms. stormes' son jackson suffers from dravet syndrome, a severe and debilitating form of epilepsy. without medication, jackson can have multiple seizures in a day. this condition has affected jackson's development and put him through a tremendous amount of pain. jeannie stormes and her family shared with my staff the hardships of living in a state where it is hard to gain access to the medication jackson needs. jackson has tried 23 different drugs in 60-plus different combinations, but nothing worked to control his seizures. she talked about how medical marijuana was the first drug that controlled his seizures and changed their lives. unfortunately, jennie announced her family was moving to colorado because it was too difficult in new jersey to access the medicine jackson needed to stay alive. we need this legislation to help the jackson stormes of the world. no child in america with a debilitating disease deserves to live a life of pain without access to the medication that he or she needs. jennie and jackson's story pains me. it tells me that we have a long way to go. but their story also gives me hope. it gives me hope because despite all the hardships they have gone through, they remain strong and committed to their cause. it is people like jennie and jackson who make our country great. it is for them that we need to continue to fight to move our country forward. the carers act would take significant steps towards addressing the situation that jackson and jennie went through. first, the bill would end the federal prohibition of medical marijuana. millions of americans need to gain access to the medicine that works best for them. the federal government's current stance on medical marijuana has only created confusion and uncertainty. this bill would prohibit the federal government from prosecuting persons who are in compliance with state medical marijuana laws and let people, like jackson, gain access to the care they need. the bill would reschedule marijuana as a schedule ii drug. the drug enforcement agency insists that medical marijuana is a fallacy. it insists that marijuana is a dangerous substance and it is properly classified as a schedule i drug. doctors know that is wrong, i know that is wrong, jennie and jackson know that is wrong. it is time we finally properly classify marijuana. the bill would also allow states to import cbd. cbd is an oil substance made from a marijuana plant that contains virtually no thc- meaning you experience no high from the drug. cbd is the medicine jackson needs-along with thousands of other individuals with dravet syndrome-to control his seizures. we must make this important drug more available so people can access the medication they need. the bill would create a safe harbor for banks and financial institutions that want to do business with legal medical marijuana businesses. it is not safe that these businesses are forced to deal only in cash. it is bad for our economy and it is bad for law enforcement. the bill would institute protections that these institutions need to feel comfortable doing business with medical marijuana

will only benefit the doctors who prescribe it, the lawmakers who regulate it, and the people who need it. finally, the bill would allow va doctors to prescribe medical marijuana to veterans in states that have legalized medical marijuana. many men and women in uniform who have bravely served our nation come home with invisible wounds of war and they deserve the best care available. this means allowing them access to the medicine they need to heal or control their condition. those who have served our country deserve to be served by us, and that means receiving the best care available. i

Mr. RUBIO (for himself and Mr. Brown) submitted an amendment intended to be proposed by him to the bill S. 178, to provide justice for the victims of trafficking; which was ordered to lie on the table; as follows: At the end of the bill, add the following: TITLE IV--PREVENTING DEMAND FOR CHILD SEX TRAFFICKING SEC. 401. SHORT TITLE. This title may be cited as the ``International Megan's Law to Prevent Demand for Child Sex Trafficking''. SEC. 402. FINDINGS. Congress finds the following: (1) Megan Nicole Kanka, who was 7 years old, was abducted, sexually assaulted, and murdered in 1994, in the State of New Jersey by a violent predator living across the street from her home. Unbeknownst to Megan Kanka and her family, her attacker had been convicted previously of a sex offense against a child. (2) In 1996, Congress adopted Megan's Law (Public Law 104- 145) as a means to encourage States to protect children by identifying the whereabouts of sex offenders and providing the means to monitor their activities. (3) In 2006, Congress passed the Adam Walsh Child Protection and Safety Act of 2006 (Public Law 109-248) to protect children and the public at large by establishing a comprehensive national system for the registration and notification to the public and law enforcement officers of convicted sex offenders. (4) Law enforcement reports indicate that known child-sex offenders are traveling internationally, and that the criminal background of such individuals may not be known to local law enforcement prior to their arrival. (5) The commercial sexual exploitation of minors in child sex trafficking and pornography is a global phenomenon. The International Labour Organization has estimated that 1,800,000 children worldwide are victims of child sex trafficking and pornography each year. (6) Child sex tourism, where an individual travels to a foreign country and engages in sexual activity with a child in that country, is a form of child exploitation and, where commercial, child sex trafficking. (7) According to research conducted by The Protection Project of The Johns Hopkins University Paul H. Nitze School of Advanced International Studies, sex tourists from the United States who target children form a significant percentage of child sex tourists in some of the most significant destination countries for child sex tourism. (8) In order to protect children, it is essential that United States law enforcement be able to identify child-sex offenders in the United States who are traveling abroad and child-sex offenders from other countries entering the United States. Such identification requires cooperative efforts between the United States and foreign governments. In exchange for providing notice of child-sex offenders traveling to the United States, foreign authorities will expect United States authorities to provide reciprocal notice of child-sex offenders traveling to their countries.

Mr. RUBIO (for himself and Mr. Brown) submitted an amendment intended to be proposed by him to the bill S. 178, to provide justice for the victims of trafficking; which was ordered to lie on the table; as follows: At the end of the bill, add the following: TITLE IV--PREVENTING DEMAND FOR CHILD SEX TRAFFICKING SEC. 401. SHORT TITLE. This title may be cited as the ``International Megan's Law to Prevent Demand for Child Sex Trafficking''. SEC. 402. FINDINGS. Congress finds the following: (1) Megan Nicole Kanka, who was 7 years old, was abducted, sexually assaulted, and murdered in 1994, in the State of New Jersey by a violent predator living across the street from her home. Unbeknownst to Megan Kanka and her family, her attacker had been convicted previously of a sex offense against a child. (2) In 1996, Congress adopted Megan's Law (Public Law 104- 145) as a means to encourage States to protect children by identifying the whereabouts of sex offenders and providing the means to monitor their activities. (3) In 2006, Congress passed the Adam Walsh Child Protection and Safety Act of 2006 (Public Law 109-248) to protect children and the public at large by establishing a comprehensive national system for the registration and notification to the public and law enforcement officers of convicted sex offenders. (4) Law enforcement reports indicate that known child-sex offenders are traveling internationally, and that the criminal background of such individuals may not be known to local law enforcement prior to their arrival. (5) The commercial sexual exploitation of minors in child sex trafficking and pornography is a global phenomenon. The International Labour Organization has estimated that 1,800,000 children worldwide are victims of child sex trafficking and pornography each year. (6) Child sex tourism, where an individual travels to a foreign country and engages in sexual activity with a child in that country, is a form of child exploitation and, where commercial, child sex trafficking. (7) According to research conducted by The Protection Project of The Johns Hopkins University Paul H. Nitze School of Advanced International Studies, sex tourists from the United States who target children form a significant percentage of child sex tourists in some of the most significant destination countries for child sex tourism. (8) In order to protect children, it is essential that United States law enforcement be able to identify child-sex offenders in the United States who are traveling abroad and child-sex offenders from other countries entering the United States. Such identification requires cooperative efforts between the United States and foreign governments. In exchange for providing notice of child-sex offenders traveling to the United States, foreign authorities will expect United States authorities to provide reciprocal notice of child-sex offenders traveling to their countries.

Mr. RUBIO (for himself and Mr. Brown) submitted an amendment intended to be proposed by him to the bill S. 178, to provide justice for the victims of trafficking; which was ordered to lie on the table; as follows: At the end of the bill, add the following: TITLE IV--PREVENTING DEMAND FOR CHILD SEX TRAFFICKING SEC. 401. SHORT TITLE. This title may be cited as the ``International Megan's Law to Prevent Demand for Child Sex Trafficking''. SEC. 402. FINDINGS. Congress finds the following: (1) Megan Nicole Kanka, who was 7 years old, was abducted, sexually assaulted, and murdered in 1994, in the State of New Jersey by a violent predator living across the street from her home. Unbeknownst to Megan Kanka and her family, her attacker had been convicted previously of a sex offense against a child. (2) In 1996, Congress adopted Megan's Law (Public Law 104- 145) as a means to encourage States to protect children by identifying the whereabouts of sex offenders and providing the means to monitor their activities. (3) In 2006, Congress passed the Adam Walsh Child Protection and Safety Act of 2006 (Public Law 109-248) to protect children and the public at large by establishing a comprehensive national system for the registration and notification to the public and law enforcement officers of convicted sex offenders. (4) Law enforcement reports indicate that known child-sex offenders are traveling internationally, and that the criminal background of such individuals may not be known to local law enforcement prior to their arrival. (5) The commercial sexual exploitation of minors in child sex trafficking and pornography is a global phenomenon. The International Labour Organization has estimated that 1,800,000 children worldwide are victims of child sex trafficking and pornography each year. (6) Child sex tourism, where an individual travels to a foreign country and engages in sexual activity with a child in that country, is a form of child exploitation and, where commercial, child sex trafficking. (7) According to research conducted by The Protection Project of The Johns Hopkins University Paul H. Nitze School of Advanced International Studies, sex tourists from the United States who target children form a significant percentage of child sex tourists in some of the most significant destination countries for child sex tourism. (8) In order to protect children, it is essential that United States law enforcement be able to identify child-sex offenders in the United States who are traveling abroad and child-sex offenders from other countries entering the United States. Such identification requires cooperative efforts between the United States and foreign governments. In exchange for providing notice of child-sex offenders traveling to the United States, foreign authorities will expect United States authorities to provide reciprocal notice of child-sex offenders traveling to their countries.

(ii) Exception.--The requirement to provide constructive notice under clause (i) shall not apply in the case of impending international travel of a child-sex offender to the country or countries of destination of the child-sex offender if such constructive notice would conflict with an existing investigation involving the child-sex offender. (B) Specific notification regarding risk to life or well- being of offender.--If the Center has reason to believe that to transmit notice under paragraph (1) poses a risk to the life or well-being of the child-sex offender, the Center shall make reasonable efforts to provide constructive notice through electronic or telephonic communication to the child- sex offender of such risk.

(2) in 1996, congress adopted megan's law (public law 104- 145) as a means to encourage states to protect children by identifying the whereabouts of sex offenders and providing the means to monitor their activities. (3) in 2006, congress passed the adam walsh child protection and safety act of 2006 (public law 109-248) to protect children and the public at large by establishing a comprehensive national system for the registration and notification to the public and law enforcement officers of convicted sex offenders. (4) law enforcement reports indicate that known child-sex offenders are traveling internationally, and that the criminal background of such individuals may not be known to local law enforcement prior to their arrival. (5) the commercial sexual exploitation of minors in child sex trafficking and pornography is a global phenomenon. the international labour organization has estimated that 1,800,000 children worldwide are victims of child sex trafficking and pornography each year. (6) child sex tourism, where an individual travels to a foreign country and engages in sexual activity with a child in that country, is a form of child exploitation and, where commercial, child sex trafficking. (7) according to research conducted by the protection project of the johns hopkins university paul h. nitze school of advanced international studies, sex tourists from the united states who target children form a significant percentage of child sex tourists in some of the most significant destination countries for child sex tourism. (8) in order to protect children, it is essential that united states law enforcement be able to identify child-sex offenders in the united states who are traveling abroad and child-sex offenders from other countries entering the united states. such identification requires cooperative efforts between the united states and foreign governments. in exchange for providing notice of child-sex offenders traveling to the united states, foreign authorities will expect united states authorities to provide reciprocal notice of child-sex offenders traveling to their countries. sec. 403. definitions. in this title: (1) center.--the term ``center'' means the angel watch center established pursuant to section 404(a).

SHORT TITLE. This title may be cited as the ``International Megan's Law to Prevent Demand for Child Sex Trafficking''. SEC. 402. FINDINGS. Congress finds the following: (1) Megan Nicole Kanka, who was 7 years old, was abducted, sexually assaulted, and murdered in 1994, in the State of New Jersey by a violent predator living across the street from her home. Unbeknownst to Megan Kanka and her family, her attacker had been convicted previously of a sex offense against a child. (2) In 1996, Congress adopted Megan's Law (Public Law 104- 145) as a means to encourage States to protect children by identifying the whereabouts of sex offenders and providing the means to monitor their activities. (3) In 2006, Congress passed the Adam Walsh Child Protection and Safety Act of 2006 (Public Law 109-248) to protect children and the public at large by establishing a comprehensive national system for the registration and notification to the public and law enforcement officers of convicted sex offenders. (4) Law enforcement reports indicate that known child-sex offenders are traveling internationally, and that the criminal background of such individuals may not be known to local law enforcement prior to their arrival.

(2) in 1996, congress adopted megan's law (public law 104- 145) as a means to encourage states to protect children by identifying the whereabouts of sex offenders and providing the means to monitor their activities. (3) in 2006, congress passed the adam walsh child protection and safety act of 2006 (public law 109-248) to protect children and the public at large by establishing a comprehensive national system for the registration and notification to the public and law enforcement officers of convicted sex offenders. (4) law enforcement reports indicate that known child-sex offenders are traveling internationally, and that the criminal background of such individuals may not be known to local law enforcement prior to their arrival. (5) the commercial sexual exploitation of minors in child sex trafficking and pornography is a global phenomenon. the international labour organization has estimated that 1,800,000 children worldwide are victims of child sex trafficking and pornography each year. (6) child sex tourism, where an individual travels to a foreign country and engages in sexual activity with a child in that country, is a form of child exploitation and, where commercial, child sex trafficking. (7) according to research conducted by the protection project of the johns hopkins university paul h. nitze school of advanced international studies, sex tourists from the united states who target children form a significant percentage of child sex tourists in some of the most significant destination countries for child sex tourism. (8) in order to protect children, it is essential that united states law enforcement be able to identify child-sex offenders in the united states who are traveling abroad and child-sex offenders from other countries entering the united states. such identification requires cooperative efforts between the united states and foreign governments. in exchange for providing notice of child-sex offenders traveling to the united states, foreign authorities will expect united states authorities to provide reciprocal notice of child-sex offenders traveling to their countries. sec. 403. definitions. in this title: (1) center.--the term ``center'' means the angel watch center established pursuant to section 404(a).

SIMON W. CHANG ______ HON. SAM FARR of california in the house of representatives Tuesday, March 10, 2015 Mr. FARR. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the remarkable public service career of Dr. Simon W. Chang, who is retiring as the Superintendent of the Naval Research Laboratory (NRL) Marine Meteorology Division in Monterey, CA following a 32-year career with the Federal Government. During that time, Dr. Chang built an unparalleled reputation for scientific excellence and insightful leadership through overseeing the development of state of the art weather prediction systems to support U.S. military operations. Dr. Chang's insightful leadership was recognized in 2007 with the Presidential Rank Award of Meritorious Executive, and in 2009 with his election as a Fellow of the American Meteorology Society. A native of Nanjing, China, Dr. Chang earned his Bachelor of Science Degree in Meteorology from the National Taiwan University. After immigrating to the United States he earned his Master of Science Degree in Atmospheric Sciences from the South Dakota School of Mines and Technology and his PhD in Meteorology from Pennsylvania State University. Dr. Chang joined NRL in 1983, and has led the Monterey Meteorology Division since 2003. His work has advanced the science of meteorology and, in particular, the study of tropical cyclones, air-sea interactions, numerical weather prediction, satellite data assimilation, and mesoscale meteorology. He authored the definitive mesoscale meteorological analysis for the 1991 Gulf War Illness study that determined the extent to which our deployed military forces could have been exposed to dangerous contaminants in the aftermath of Operation Desert Storm. As the NRL Monterey Division Superintendent, Dr. Chang was in charge of developing several key Navy global and regional scale weather models, tropical cyclone prediction models, highly accurate data assimilation systems to bring millions of observations per day into those models, and user-friendly tactical-scale tools to translate raw weather data into actionable military information. He established close collaborations with other regional scientific organizations; such as the Fleet Numerical Meteorology and Oceanography Center, the Naval Postgraduate School, the Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute, and the Central and Northern California Ocean Observing System, to put the Monterey Bay Area at the forefront of atmospheric and oceanographic research. For my part, I had the great pleasure of working with Dr. Chang to secure funding for a new state of the art lab building for the Monterey Division. Mr. Speaker, I know that I speak for the whole House in sharing our gratitude to Dr. Chang for a job well done and extend our best wishes to Simon and his family in this next chapter of life. I know that even in retirement, he will still find himself involved in the community and helping people in need and will continue to stand as an example for others. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 40 (Tuesday, March 10, 2015)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E319] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] IN HONOR OF DR.

G.K. BUTTERFIELD of north carolina in the house of representatives Tuesday, March 10, 2015 Mr. BUTTERFIELD. Mr. Speaker, today it is with great pleasure that I rise to commemorate the contributions of Sam Jones. Mr. Jones was a star Guard in college and went on to play professionally for the Boston Celtics. On March 5, 2015, Mr. Jones' alma mater of North Carolina Central University will retire his jersey inside McDougald-McLendon Gymnasium. Sam Jones was born June 24, 1933 in Wilmington, North Carolina and attended Laurinburg Institute located in Scotland County, North Carolina. After, Mr. Jones went to Durham where he attended what was then known as North Carolina College and quickly became a breakout star on the basketball court. Mr. Jones played at North Carolina College from 1951 until 1954 and again from 1956 until 1957. While there, he amassed 1,745 career points under head coaches John McLendon and Floyd Brown. Nearly 60 years after leaving North Carolina College, Mr. Jones is still the school's second-leading scorer. In 1957, Mr. Jones entered the NBA draft and was selected by the Boston Celtics in the first round as the eighth overall pick. During his remarkable 12 year career with the Celtics, Mr. Jones scored 15,411 points and averaged 17.7 points per game and also had 4,305 career rebounds and 2,209 career assists. Impressively, Mr. Jones led the Boston Celtics to 10 NBA championship wins--the second most of any NBA player--behind his then teammate--Bill Russell. He also played in five All Star games and is widely regarded as one of the greatest NBA players of all time. Mr. Jones was inducted into the North Carolina Sports Hall of Fame in 1969 and both the North Carolina Central University Hall of Fame and the prestigious Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame in 1984. In 1970, Mr. Jones was selected as part of the NBA 25th Anniversary All- Time Team and was later honored by being named among the top 50 players in the history of the NBA as a member of the 50th Anniversary All-Time Team in 1996. Throughout his career, Sam Jones never lost sight of what was most important--his family. He is married to Gladys Jones and together they have five adult children--Aubrey, Phyllis, Michael, Terri, and Ashley and many grandchildren. Mr. Speaker, Sam Jones has served as inspiration to generations of young men and women both here and around the world who are drawn to the game of basketball. I ask my colleagues to join me in congratulating Mr. Sam Jones on the high honor bestowed upon him by our shared alma mater of North Carolina Central University. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 40 (Tuesday, March 10, 2015)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E319] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] RECOGNIZING BASKETBALL LEGEND SAM JONES ______ HON.

TED LIEU of california in the house of representatives Tuesday, March 10, 2015 Mr. TED LIEU of California. Mr. Speaker, I rise to celebrate the life of Rose Toren--mother, wife, grandmother, successful business woman, author, and Holocaust survivor--who passed away on February 2, 2015, at the age of 91. Rose's favorite saying, ``Never give up,'' which she passed along to her family, dictated the way she lived her life. Born into a traditional Jewish family in Poland as Rosalia Orenstein, she was the sole member of her family to survive the Holocaust. On an otherwise ordinary evening in 1939, Nazi soldiers pounded on her door and ordered the family of seven to gather in a field. Her younger sister, Eda, decided to escape and was never seen again. At her father's urging, Rose also ran, never to see her family again. With the help of classmate Urszula Grande, Rose obtained forged paperwork and assumed the identity of a displaced Christian Pole, Kazimiera Lukashuk. She clung to her new identity but was plagued by feelings of anger and isolation in denying her Jewish heritage. In a moment of despair, she admitted her true identity to someone whom she believed was a friend. Rose quickly found herself in the walls of Auschwitz, where she was spared the gas chamber and worked knitting sweaters. She escaped Auschwitz shortly before the end of the war. Like many Jewish survivors of the Holocaust, Rose fled Europe to Israel, where she met her husband, Jack Toren. The young couple later moved to New York, where their daughter Lili was born. When Lili was 9, the Toren family moved to Beverly Hills to provide the best life possible to their daughter. Rose was quick to laugh and lived a life of defiance, thriving and bringing joy to countless others, against all odds. She is survived by her daughter, Mayor Lili Bosse, her son-in-law, John Bosse, and her grandchildren, whom I hope take comfort in the way Rose lived her life as a resilient and astounding woman. May her memory be a blessing to us all.","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 40 (Tuesday, March 10, 2015)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E320] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] HONORING THE LIFE OF ROSE TOREN ______ HON.
