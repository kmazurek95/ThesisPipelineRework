CREC-2015-03-16-pt1-PgH1637-4,CREC-2015-03-16,114,CHRISTIAN PERSECUTION,"[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 44 (Monday, March 16, 2015)] [House] [Pages H1637-H1638] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] CHRISTIAN PERSECUTION The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Indiana (Mrs. Brooks) for 5 minutes. Mrs. BROOKS of Indiana. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to discuss the sobering but extremely consequential topic of Christian persecution. Last week, I had the honor of visiting with more than 100 parishioners of St. Alphonsus Liguori Catholic Church in Zionsville, Indiana, including many interested high school students who shared with me their passionate concerns about the senseless persecution of their Christian brethren. Through the church's Social Action Committee, they wanted to know how a small, faithful community could make a difference in bringing attention to this commonly overlooked matter. However, they wondered if their cries for mercy were falling on deaf ears in Washington. They felt helpless in bringing to light the barbarity, torture, and living conditions that Christians in places like Iran endure. The parishioners at St. Alphonsus felt that too often horrendous massacres are met with isolationism and arguments that it is not America's job to promote human rights beyond our shores. Today I want to let the people of St. Alphonsus and all those who seek to give a voice to the silenced victims of religious persecution know I hear you, and others in Washington, D.C., do as well. I believe that America must reassume its leadership role in protecting those most destitute and downtrodden, that American leadership in the world should advance not only our national interests but also the interests of those who yearn for freedom across the globe, that Christians who have to shield their faith for fear of crucifixion or beheading have an ally in America, an ally who will fight for the dignity of all mankind. Incidents of persecution of Christians more than doubled in 2014 alone. I wish I could say I was surprised by this increase, but I am not. I think this is part of the larger trend around the globe. The world we live in is remarkably unstable right now. People lack security. Too many regions of our world are fending off the rise of groups that espouse extremely radical ideologies, groups that hate this Nation, groups that often hate all other religions, groups that feed off of destruction and poverty, groups that value violence over peace, groups that are clearly not a true or worthy representation of the religions they claim as their own. The parishioners at St. Alphonsus Church asked me: What can we do? I told them America first needs a smart and decisive plan because the threat Christians face is significant, and it is not going away. The United States must work with free nations across the globe to reaffirm a simple but important message: human rights are not negotiable. Countries don't get to pick and choose which rights they allow and which ones they deny. We also need to work more locally to raise awareness of the specific issue of Christian persecution. There must be a strong grassroots element to this effort. Each month, approximately 180 Christians are killed across the globe because of their faith. That is a startling number. In America, a country where it is so easy to take our freedoms for granted, it is easy not to notice the pain and suffering of others, but we must. And I know we are a truly generous and kind people. When Japanese communities were torn apart by a massive tsunami in 2009, Americans mobilized to donate more than $700 million in charitable relief. Americans always answer the call when people are suffering. Well, today there is clearly a tsunami of hatred sweeping parts of the world, and there are people who need our help. So churches and other groups with a concern for their fellow Christians and all global citizens need to take a stand. Like those at St. Alphonsus have, Christians and people of all faiths across this Nation need to reach out to their elected officials and let them know of the tragic persecution of Christians and that it deserves attention, that religious freedom is a value we must defend and promote. Only then will everyone in this body know what was foretold in Matthew, that [[Page H1638]] blessed are those who are persecuted because of righteousness, for theirs is the kingdom of Heaven. Let us now work to bring that kingdom of Heaven closer to Earth. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 44 (Monday, March 16, 2015)] [House] [Pages H1637-H1638] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] CHRISTIAN PERSECUTION The SPEAKER pro tempore.

The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Burgess). General Leave Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and insert extraneous materials in the Record on the bill. [[Page H1642]] The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Texas? There was no objection. Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased that the House today will consider two bills relating to Federal support for trauma care. These bills have both passed the Energy and Commerce Committee at the subcommittee and full committee levels on voice votes. Trauma is the leading cause of death under the age of 65. It is expensive, costing over $400 billion per year, third only to heart disease and cancer. It affects individuals of all ages--35 million Americans annually, or one person every 15 minutes. Over many years, the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Gene Green) and I have worked closely on this issue to update the law and ensure the reauthorization of crucial trauma grant programs occurs. As a result of this coordination, today we will be voting on two bills that continue our long bipartisan record of support for efforts to shore up the Nation's trauma systems and centers. The Access to Life-Saving Trauma Care for All Americans Act, H.R. 647, will authorize two grant programs, which will expire this year, that provide critically needed Federal funding to help cover uncompensated costs in trauma centers, support core mission trauma services, provide emergency funding to trauma centers, and address trauma center physician shortages in order to ensure the future availability of trauma care for all our citizens. Trauma can happen at any time to anyone. It can happen to a family in a highway crash or a gunshot victim or a construction worker who is injured at the worksite. Trauma centers must be available for all victims of traumatic injury. Getting a trauma victim to a trauma center right away is the first step in saving that person's life. These bills draw support from the American Association of Neurological Surgeons, the American Association of Orthopedic Surgeons, the American Burn Association, the American College of Emergency Physicians, the American College of Surgeons, the American Trauma Society, the Congress of Neurological Surgeons, the Association of Critical Care Transport, the American Heart Association, the American Stroke Association, Emergency Nurses Association, Society of Trauma Nurses, the American Association for the Surgery of Trauma, Eastern Association for the Surgery of Trauma, National Association of Emergency Medical Technicians, the Orthopedic Trauma Association, and the Trauma Center Association of America. I strongly urge the House to support both of these bills. I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. GENE GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself as much time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 647, the Access to Life-Saving Trauma Care for All Americans Act. My colleague and fellow Texan, Dr. Mike Burgess, and I have introduced this legislation. I thank him for his leadership and partnership on this issue. The bill would reauthorize vital programs to prevent more trauma center closures and improve access to trauma care. The trauma center care grants were created to prevent trauma center closures by supporting their core missions, covering a portion of the losses from uncompensated care, and providing emergency awards to centers at risk of closing. The trauma service availability grants are awarded through the States to address shortfalls in trauma services and improve access and availability of trauma care in underserved areas. {time} 1545 Despite our best prevention efforts, trauma injury will continue to occur. Unfortunately, access to trauma care is threatened by losses associated with the high cost of treating severely injured patients, including those unable to pay for their care, and a growing shortage of trauma-related physicians. The public expects that appropriate trauma care will always be available to them wherever they reside or travel, yet this is not a reality. Profound challenges face our Nation's trauma centers, trauma systems, and the physicians who treat the most vulnerable patients. Thus, I urge swift passage of this important legislation. Again, I want to thank Representative Burgess for championing this effort with me, and his staff, J.P. Paluskiewicz, for their hard work. I also want to acknowledge the leadership of Chairman Upton, Chairman Pitts, Ranking Member Pallone and the work of the committee's staff in advancing this bill through the Energy and Commerce Committee. I support this bipartisan bill. I urge my colleagues to do the same. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Speaker, I would just point out the gentleman's name is J.P. Paluskiewicz, and we do, indeed, thank him for his efforts on the bill. I have no more speakers, and I reserve the balance of my time to close. Mr. GENE GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, we have no more speakers. I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Speaker, I just want to point out many people nowadays are familiar with what is called the golden hour, that first hour that occurs after a traumatic injury where the ability to save life and limb is vastly increased if a person can be delivered to a center within that golden hour's time. It is imperative to reauthorize these programs. They are critically needed for our citizens. Mr. Speaker, I urge an ``aye'' vote on the bill. I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Burgess) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 647. The question was taken. The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the opinion of the Chair, two-thirds being in the affirmative, the ayes have it. Mr. GENE GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays. The yeas and nays were ordered. The SPEAKER pro tempore.

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Pitts) and the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Gene Green) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Pennsylvania. General Leave Mr. PITTS. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and insert extraneous materials into the Record on the bill. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Pennsylvania? [[Page H1640]] There was no objection. Mr. PITTS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I will include an exchange of letters between the Committee on Energy and Commerce and the Committee on the Judiciary. Mr. Speaker, H.R. 639 seeks to improve the transparency and consistency of the Drug Enforcement Administration's first scheduling of new FDA-approved drugs under the Controlled Substances Act, the CSA, and, secondly, its registration process for the manufacture of controlled substances for use in clinical trials. Ultimately, this will allow new and innovative treatments to get to patients who desperately need them. Due to the cost and uncertainty of the drug development process, there is broad agreement that a predictable timeline for approval decisions is a necessary component to successful drug development. Industry, the FDA, and Congress have taken steps to provide more transparency and consistency in the drug approval process through the negotiation and authorization of the Prescription Drug User Fee program and a commitment to review goals embedded in the PDUFA agreements. However, drugs that contain substances that have not been previously marketed in the U.S. and that have abuse potential must also be scheduled under the Controlled Substances Act, the CSA, by the DEA before they can reach patients. Under the CSA, there is no deadline for the DEA to make a scheduling decision, and the delays in DEA decisions have increased significantly. Between 1997 and 1999 and 2009 and 2013, the average time between FDA approval and DEA's final scheduling increased from an average of 49.3 days to an average of 237.6 days. Recently, a company had to wait over 13 months after FDA approval to receive a final scheduling recommendation from the DEA. The lack of predictability in the timing of DEA scheduling decisions leads to unnecessary uncertainty in the drug development process and needless delays in patient access to new therapies. Section 2 of H.R. 639, as amended by the full committee, would require DEA to issue an interim final rule, scheduling the new drug no later than 90 days after it is approved or when it receives the FDA's scheduling recommendation, whichever comes later. After receiving the FDA's recommendation, the DEA would continue to conduct its own analysis prior to scheduling the drug, but patients would now have peace of mind in knowing this will no longer be an open-ended process. Of note: since 1996, the DEA has not made any scheduling decision for a new drug that was contrary to the FDA recommendation. Further, section 3 of this bill would bring much-needed certainty to another open-ended DEA process. Manufacturers of controlled substances are required to be registered with the DEA. The requirement to register extends to manufacturers of controlled substances intended to be used in clinical trials for products not yet approved by the FDA. There is no timetable for the DEA to grant approval of registration applications, and there is not a process for the applicant to determine the reasons for delay in the application. The lack of transparency, predictability, and timeliness in the registration process leaves companies unable to properly plan clinical trial schedules for prospective new therapies. For registration applications related to schedule III, IV, and V drugs that will only be used in clinical trials, section 3, as amended by the full committee, would require the DEA to register the applicant or serve an order to show cause on why the applicant shall not be registered within 180 days of the filing of the application. For drugs in schedule I and II that will only be used in a clinical trial, the DEA would be required to issue a notice of application not later than 90 days after an application is accepted for filing. Ninety days after the end of the comment period, pursuant to the notice, the DEA would be required to register the applicant or serve an order to show cause on why the registrant should not be registered. Such a solution does not force the DEA to make a particular decision but will provide transparency to the process so companies can better plan when regulatory decisions will be made. I would urge all Members to support this critical piece of legislation. I reserve the balance of my time. House of Representatives, Committee on the Judiciary, March 16, 2015. Hon. Fred Upton, Chairman, Committee on Energy and Commerce, Rayburn House Office Building, Washington, DC. Dear Chairman Upton: I am writing with respect to H.R. 639, the ``Improving Regulatory Transparency for New Medical Therapies Act.'' As a result of your having consulted with us on provisions in H.R. 639 that fall within the Rule X jurisdiction of the Committee on the Judiciary, I agree to discharge our Committee from further consideration of this bill so that it may proceed expeditiously to the House floor for consideration. The Judiciary Committee takes this action with our mutual understanding that by foregoing consideration of H.R. 639 at this time, we do not waive any jurisdiction over subject matter contained in this or similar legislation, and that our Committee will be appropriately consulted and involved as this bill or similar legislation moves forward so that we may address any remaining issues in our jurisdiction. Our Committee also reserves the right to seek appointment of an appropriate number of conferees to any House-Senate conference involving this or similar legislation, and asks that you support any such request. I would appreciate a response to this letter confirming this understanding with respect to H.R. 639, and would ask that a copy of our exchange of letters on this matter be included in the Congressional Record during Floor consideration of H.R. 639. Sincerely, Bob Goodlatte, Chairman. ____ House of Representatives, Committee on Energy and Commerce, Washington, DC, March 16, 2015. Hon. Bob Goodlatte, Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary, Rayburn House Office Building Washington, DC. Dear Chairman Goodtette: Thank you for your letter regarding H.R. 639, the ``Improving Regulatory Transparency for New Medical Therapies Act.'' As you noted, there are provisions of the bill that fall within the Committee on the Judiciary's Rule X jurisdiction. I appreciate your willingness to forgo action on H.R. 639, and I agree that your decision is not a waiver of any of the Committee on the Judiciary's jurisdiction over the subject matter contained in this or similar legislation, and that the Committee will be consulted appropriately and involved as the bill or similar legislation moves forward. In addition, I understand the Committee reserves the right to seek the appointment of an appropriate number of conferees to any House-Senate conference involving this or similar legislation, for which you will have my support. I will include a copy of your letter and this response in the Congressional Record during consideration of H.R. 639 on the House floor. Sincerely, Fred Upton, Chairman. Mr. GENE GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself as much time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 639, the Improving Regulatory Transparency for New Medical Therapies Act. This legislation was introduced by the chair of our Health Subcommittee, Joe Pitts of Pennsylvania; the ranking member of the full committee, Frank Pallone of New Jersey; and myself to provide a solution to delays experienced by patients in need. Currently, new drugs and substances that previously have not been marketed in the United States and that have abuse potential must be scheduled by the Drug Enforcement Administration prior to being marketed. The amount of time the DEA has taken before acting on FDA recommendations has significantly lengthened in recent years, which delays the availability of new therapies. This legislation will improve patient access by bringing clarity and transparency to the process of scheduling a new FDA-approved therapy. I was pleased to join the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Pitts) and the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Pallone) in supporting this legislation to continue the great work they started last Congress. I thank them and their staff for working on this important access issue. I want to acknowledge the leadership of Chairman Upton and the work of the committee's minority and majority staff in advancing this bill through the Energy and Commerce Committee. I [[Page H1641]] support this bipartisan bill and urge my colleagues to do the same. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. PITTS. Mr. Speaker, I urge all Members to support this bipartisan legislation, and I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Speaker, I would like to submit the cost estimate prepared by the Congressional Budget Office for H.R. 639. U.S. Congress, Congressional Budget Office, Washington, DC, March 16, 2015. Hon. Fred Upton, Chairman, Committee on Energy and Commerce, House of Representatives, Washington, DC. Dear Mr. Chairman: The Congressional Budget Office has prepared the enclosed cost estimate for H.R. 639, the Improving Regulatory Transparency for New Medical Therapies Act. If you wish further details on this estimate, we will be pleased to provide them. The CBO staff contact is Julia Christensen. Sincerely, Douglas W. Elmendorf. Enclosure. ____ as ordered reported by the house committee on energy and commerce on february 12, 2015 H.R. 639 would modify the administrative procedures followed by the Department of Justice in regulating new drugs that are already approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and in authorizing drugs to be used in clinical trials. The legislation would aim to streamline the current review and approval process. CBO estimates that implementing the bill would have no significant effect on spending subject to appropriation. Enacting the legislation would affect direct spending and revenues related to federal health care costs; therefore, pay-as-you-go procedures apply. CBO estimates that that those effects would also not be significant over the 2015-2025 period. The legislation would change the effective date of FDA approval for certain new drugs that undergo review by the Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) to determine if the drug should be marketed with restrictions as a controlled substance. Such a change could extend certain regulatory periods during which FDA will not accept marketing applications or permit another manufacturer to market a version of an affected drug and could also result in the extension of patent terms for certain products. Extending such periods of marketing exclusivity could delay the entry of lower-priced generic drugs on the market, and such a delay would increase the average cost for prescription drugs. Any increase in health care costs resulting from delaying the market entry of generic drugs would affect direct spending and revenues by increasing the cost of prescription drugs for federal health programs and private health insurance. CBO expects that the bill's provisions would apply to a limited number of drugs subject to DEA classification after enactment. Because most drugs generally retain patent protections after FDA approval for more than 10 years, CBO anticipates that the likelihood that drugs affected by the bill will face generic competition before 2025 under current law would be small. As a result, we estimate that enacting the bill would not significantly affect direct spending or revenues over the 2015-2025 period. Beyond 2025, however, the potential for the legislation to delay the market entry of generic drugs would be greater, and the effect on direct spending and revenues would increase in later years. H.R. 639 contains no intergovernmental mandates as defined in the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act (UMRA) and would impose no costs on state, local, or tribal governments. The bill would impose a private-sector mandate, as defined under UMRA, on manufacturers of generic drugs by delaying the entry of those products in the market. The cost of the mandate would be the net loss of income, which could be significant depending on the drug. Based on information from industry sources, CBO estimates that the cost of the mandate would probably fall below the annual threshold established in UMRA for private-sector mandates ($154 million in 2015, adjusted annually for inflation). The CBO staff contacts for this estimate are Julia Christensen and Mark Grabowicz (for federal costs) and Amy Petz (for private sector costs). The estimate was approved by Theresa Gullo, Deputy Assistant Director for Budget Analysis. Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to lend my support to H.R. 639, the Improving Regulatory Transparency for New Medical Therapies Act. This important public health bill aims to bring better reliability and transparency to medical therapies, while continuing to ensure that they reach patients in need quickly, but most importantly safely and effectively. When a new drug is approved by the FDA, a company can begin marketing the product upon its approval. However, for a subset of drugs, FDA recommends to the DEA they be included in the Controlled Substance Act--or ``scheduled,'' if there is abuse potential. Until DEA makes a final decision, a drug cannot be released to the public. Unfortunately, there is no deadline for the DEA to make a decision. As a result, the process has lengthened over time, in some instances lasting years before a decision is made. So even if a drug is considered safe and effective, patients and physicians are being forced to wait to access these therapies. This bill would continue to allow DEA to conduct its own analysis, but would remove much of the uncertainty from the process. It also would speed up the DEA registration process allowing the manufacture and distribution of controlled substances for use only in clinical trials. I want to thank Chairman Pitts for working with me on this bill last Congress, and committing to move forward early this Congress. Thank you to Mr. Green as well for joining us on this important bill. I am glad that we have been able to work with both DEA and FDA, our Senate counterparts and the bill sponsors, to ensure that the goals of this bill is met. I urge members to support H.R 639 and I look forward to its swift passage. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Pitts) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 639, as amended. The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 44 (Monday, March 16, 2015)] [House] [Pages H1638-H1641] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] IMPROVING REGULATORY TRANSPARENCY FOR NEW MEDICAL THERAPIES ACT Mr. PITTS.

SEC. 3. ENHANCING NEW DRUG DEVELOPMENT. Section 303 of the Controlled Substances Act (21 U.S.C. 823) is amended by adding at the end the following: ``(i)(1) For purposes of registration to manufacture a controlled substance under subsection (d) for use only in a clinical trial, the Attorney General shall register the applicant, or serve an order to show cause upon the applicant in accordance with section 304(c), not later than 180 days after the date on which the application is accepted for filing. ``(2) For purposes of registration to manufacture a controlled substance under subsection (a) for use only in a clinical trial, the Attorney General shall, in accordance with the regulations issued by the Attorney General, issue a notice of application not later than 90 days after the application is accepted for filing.

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Pitts) and the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Gene Green) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Pennsylvania. General Leave Mr. PITTS. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and insert extraneous materials into the Record on the bill. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Pennsylvania? [[Page H1640]] There was no objection. Mr. PITTS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I will include an exchange of letters between the Committee on Energy and Commerce and the Committee on the Judiciary. Mr. Speaker, H.R. 639 seeks to improve the transparency and consistency of the Drug Enforcement Administration's first scheduling of new FDA-approved drugs under the Controlled Substances Act, the CSA, and, secondly, its registration process for the manufacture of controlled substances for use in clinical trials. Ultimately, this will allow new and innovative treatments to get to patients who desperately need them. Due to the cost and uncertainty of the drug development process, there is broad agreement that a predictable timeline for approval decisions is a necessary component to successful drug development. Industry, the FDA, and Congress have taken steps to provide more transparency and consistency in the drug approval process through the negotiation and authorization of the Prescription Drug User Fee program and a commitment to review goals embedded in the PDUFA agreements. However, drugs that contain substances that have not been previously marketed in the U.S. and that have abuse potential must also be scheduled under the Controlled Substances Act, the CSA, by the DEA before they can reach patients. Under the CSA, there is no deadline for the DEA to make a scheduling decision, and the delays in DEA decisions have increased significantly. Between 1997 and 1999 and 2009 and 2013, the average time between FDA approval and DEA's final scheduling increased from an average of 49.3 days to an average of 237.6 days. Recently, a company had to wait over 13 months after FDA approval to receive a final scheduling recommendation from the DEA. The lack of predictability in the timing of DEA scheduling decisions leads to unnecessary uncertainty in the drug development process and needless delays in patient access to new therapies. Section 2 of H.R. 639, as amended by the full committee, would require DEA to issue an interim final rule, scheduling the new drug no later than 90 days after it is approved or when it receives the FDA's scheduling recommendation, whichever comes later. After receiving the FDA's recommendation, the DEA would continue to conduct its own analysis prior to scheduling the drug, but patients would now have peace of mind in knowing this will no longer be an open-ended process. Of note: since 1996, the DEA has not made any scheduling decision for a new drug that was contrary to the FDA recommendation. Further, section 3 of this bill would bring much-needed certainty to another open-ended DEA process. Manufacturers of controlled substances are required to be registered with the DEA. The requirement to register extends to manufacturers of controlled substances intended to be used in clinical trials for products not yet approved by the FDA. There is no timetable for the DEA to grant approval of registration applications, and there is not a process for the applicant to determine the reasons for delay in the application. The lack of transparency, predictability, and timeliness in the registration process leaves companies unable to properly plan clinical trial schedules for prospective new therapies. For registration applications related to schedule III, IV, and V drugs that will only be used in clinical trials, section 3, as amended by the full committee, would require the DEA to register the applicant or serve an order to show cause on why the applicant shall not be registered within 180 days of the filing of the application. For drugs in schedule I and II that will only be used in a clinical trial, the DEA would be required to issue a notice of application not later than 90 days after an application is accepted for filing. Ninety days after the end of the comment period, pursuant to the notice, the DEA would be required to register the applicant or serve an order to show cause on why the registrant should not be registered. Such a solution does not force the DEA to make a particular decision but will provide transparency to the process so companies can better plan when regulatory decisions will be made. I would urge all Members to support this critical piece of legislation. I reserve the balance of my time. House of Representatives, Committee on the Judiciary, March 16, 2015. Hon. Fred Upton, Chairman, Committee on Energy and Commerce, Rayburn House Office Building, Washington, DC. Dear Chairman Upton: I am writing with respect to H.R. 639, the ``Improving Regulatory Transparency for New Medical Therapies Act.'' As a result of your having consulted with us on provisions in H.R. 639 that fall within the Rule X jurisdiction of the Committee on the Judiciary, I agree to discharge our Committee from further consideration of this bill so that it may proceed expeditiously to the House floor for consideration. The Judiciary Committee takes this action with our mutual understanding that by foregoing consideration of H.R. 639 at this time, we do not waive any jurisdiction over subject matter contained in this or similar legislation, and that our Committee will be appropriately consulted and involved as this bill or similar legislation moves forward so that we may address any remaining issues in our jurisdiction. Our Committee also reserves the right to seek appointment of an appropriate number of conferees to any House-Senate conference involving this or similar legislation, and asks that you support any such request. I would appreciate a response to this letter confirming this understanding with respect to H.R. 639, and would ask that a copy of our exchange of letters on this matter be included in the Congressional Record during Floor consideration of H.R. 639. Sincerely, Bob Goodlatte, Chairman. ____ House of Representatives, Committee on Energy and Commerce, Washington, DC, March 16, 2015. Hon. Bob Goodlatte, Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary, Rayburn House Office Building Washington, DC. Dear Chairman Goodtette: Thank you for your letter regarding H.R. 639, the ``Improving Regulatory Transparency for New Medical Therapies Act.'' As you noted, there are provisions of the bill that fall within the Committee on the Judiciary's Rule X jurisdiction. I appreciate your willingness to forgo action on H.R. 639, and I agree that your decision is not a waiver of any of the Committee on the Judiciary's jurisdiction over the subject matter contained in this or similar legislation, and that the Committee will be consulted appropriately and involved as the bill or similar legislation moves forward. In addition, I understand the Committee reserves the right to seek the appointment of an appropriate number of conferees to any House-Senate conference involving this or similar legislation, for which you will have my support. I will include a copy of your letter and this response in the Congressional Record during consideration of H.R. 639 on the House floor. Sincerely, Fred Upton, Chairman. Mr. GENE GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself as much time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 639, the Improving Regulatory Transparency for New Medical Therapies Act. This legislation was introduced by the chair of our Health Subcommittee, Joe Pitts of Pennsylvania; the ranking member of the full committee, Frank Pallone of New Jersey; and myself to provide a solution to delays experienced by patients in need. Currently, new drugs and substances that previously have not been marketed in the United States and that have abuse potential must be scheduled by the Drug Enforcement Administration prior to being marketed. The amount of time the DEA has taken before acting on FDA recommendations has significantly lengthened in recent years, which delays the availability of new therapies. This legislation will improve patient access by bringing clarity and transparency to the process of scheduling a new FDA-approved therapy. I was pleased to join the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Pitts) and the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Pallone) in supporting this legislation to continue the great work they started last Congress. I thank them and their staff for working on this important access issue. I want to acknowledge the leadership of Chairman Upton and the work of the committee's minority and majority staff in advancing this bill through the Energy and Commerce Committee. I [[Page H1641]] support this bipartisan bill and urge my colleagues to do the same. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. PITTS. Mr. Speaker, I urge all Members to support this bipartisan legislation, and I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Speaker, I would like to submit the cost estimate prepared by the Congressional Budget Office for H.R. 639. U.S. Congress, Congressional Budget Office, Washington, DC, March 16, 2015. Hon. Fred Upton, Chairman, Committee on Energy and Commerce, House of Representatives, Washington, DC. Dear Mr. Chairman: The Congressional Budget Office has prepared the enclosed cost estimate for H.R. 639, the Improving Regulatory Transparency for New Medical Therapies Act. If you wish further details on this estimate, we will be pleased to provide them. The CBO staff contact is Julia Christensen. Sincerely, Douglas W. Elmendorf. Enclosure. ____ as ordered reported by the house committee on energy and commerce on february 12, 2015 H.R. 639 would modify the administrative procedures followed by the Department of Justice in regulating new drugs that are already approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and in authorizing drugs to be used in clinical trials. The legislation would aim to streamline the current review and approval process. CBO estimates that implementing the bill would have no significant effect on spending subject to appropriation. Enacting the legislation would affect direct spending and revenues related to federal health care costs; therefore, pay-as-you-go procedures apply. CBO estimates that that those effects would also not be significant over the 2015-2025 period. The legislation would change the effective date of FDA approval for certain new drugs that undergo review by the Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) to determine if the drug should be marketed with restrictions as a controlled substance. Such a change could extend certain regulatory periods during which FDA will not accept marketing applications or permit another manufacturer to market a version of an affected drug and could also result in the extension of patent terms for certain products. Extending such periods of marketing exclusivity could delay the entry of lower-priced generic drugs on the market, and such a delay would increase the average cost for prescription drugs. Any increase in health care costs resulting from delaying the market entry of generic drugs would affect direct spending and revenues by increasing the cost of prescription drugs for federal health programs and private health insurance. CBO expects that the bill's provisions would apply to a limited number of drugs subject to DEA classification after enactment. Because most drugs generally retain patent protections after FDA approval for more than 10 years, CBO anticipates that the likelihood that drugs affected by the bill will face generic competition before 2025 under current law would be small. As a result, we estimate that enacting the bill would not significantly affect direct spending or revenues over the 2015-2025 period. Beyond 2025, however, the potential for the legislation to delay the market entry of generic drugs would be greater, and the effect on direct spending and revenues would increase in later years. H.R. 639 contains no intergovernmental mandates as defined in the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act (UMRA) and would impose no costs on state, local, or tribal governments. The bill would impose a private-sector mandate, as defined under UMRA, on manufacturers of generic drugs by delaying the entry of those products in the market. The cost of the mandate would be the net loss of income, which could be significant depending on the drug. Based on information from industry sources, CBO estimates that the cost of the mandate would probably fall below the annual threshold established in UMRA for private-sector mandates ($154 million in 2015, adjusted annually for inflation). The CBO staff contacts for this estimate are Julia Christensen and Mark Grabowicz (for federal costs) and Amy Petz (for private sector costs). The estimate was approved by Theresa Gullo, Deputy Assistant Director for Budget Analysis. Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to lend my support to H.R. 639, the Improving Regulatory Transparency for New Medical Therapies Act. This important public health bill aims to bring better reliability and transparency to medical therapies, while continuing to ensure that they reach patients in need quickly, but most importantly safely and effectively. When a new drug is approved by the FDA, a company can begin marketing the product upon its approval. However, for a subset of drugs, FDA recommends to the DEA they be included in the Controlled Substance Act--or ``scheduled,'' if there is abuse potential. Until DEA makes a final decision, a drug cannot be released to the public. Unfortunately, there is no deadline for the DEA to make a decision. As a result, the process has lengthened over time, in some instances lasting years before a decision is made. So even if a drug is considered safe and effective, patients and physicians are being forced to wait to access these therapies. This bill would continue to allow DEA to conduct its own analysis, but would remove much of the uncertainty from the process. It also would speed up the DEA registration process allowing the manufacture and distribution of controlled substances for use only in clinical trials. I want to thank Chairman Pitts for working with me on this bill last Congress, and committing to move forward early this Congress. Thank you to Mr. Green as well for joining us on this important bill. I am glad that we have been able to work with both DEA and FDA, our Senate counterparts and the bill sponsors, to ensure that the goals of this bill is met. I urge members to support H.R 639 and I look forward to its swift passage. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Pitts) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 639, as amended. The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. ____________________","Congressional Record, Volume 161 Issue 44 (Monday, March 16, 2015) [Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 44 (Monday, March 16, 2015)] [House] [Pages H1638-H1641] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] IMPROVING REGULATORY TRANSPARENCY FOR NEW MEDICAL THERAPIES ACT Mr. PITTS.

Sincerely, Bob Goodlatte, Chairman. ____ House of Representatives, Committee on Energy and Commerce, Washington, DC, March 16, 2015. Hon. Bob Goodlatte, Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary, Rayburn House Office Building Washington, DC. Dear Chairman Goodtette: Thank you for your letter regarding H.R. 639, the ``Improving Regulatory Transparency for New Medical Therapies Act.'' As you noted, there are provisions of the bill that fall within the Committee on the Judiciary's Rule X jurisdiction. I appreciate your willingness to forgo action on H.R. 639, and I agree that your decision is not a waiver of any of the Committee on the Judiciary's jurisdiction over the subject matter contained in this or similar legislation, and that the Committee will be consulted appropriately and involved as the bill or similar legislation moves forward. In addition, I understand the Committee reserves the right to seek the appointment of an appropriate number of conferees to any House-Senate conference involving this or similar legislation, for which you will have my support. I will include a copy of your letter and this response in the Congressional Record during consideration of H.R. 639 on the House floor. Sincerely, Fred Upton, Chairman. Mr. GENE GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself as much time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 639, the Improving Regulatory Transparency for New Medical Therapies Act. This legislation was introduced by the chair of our Health Subcommittee, Joe Pitts of Pennsylvania; the ranking member of the full committee, Frank Pallone of New Jersey; and myself to provide a solution to delays experienced by patients in need. Currently, new drugs and substances that previously have not been marketed in the United States and that have abuse potential must be scheduled by the Drug Enforcement Administration prior to being marketed. The amount of time the DEA has taken before acting on FDA recommendations has significantly lengthened in recent years, which delays the availability of new therapies. This legislation will improve patient access by bringing clarity and transparency to the process of scheduling a new FDA-approved therapy. I was pleased to join the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Pitts) and the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Pallone) in supporting this legislation to continue the great work they started last Congress. I thank them and their staff for working on this important access issue. I want to acknowledge the leadership of Chairman Upton and the work of the committee's minority and majority staff in advancing this bill through the Energy and Commerce Committee. I [[Page H1641]] support this bipartisan bill and urge my colleagues to do the same. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. PITTS. Mr. Speaker, I urge all Members to support this bipartisan legislation, and I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Speaker, I would like to submit the cost estimate prepared by the Congressional Budget Office for H.R. 639. U.S. Congress, Congressional Budget Office, Washington, DC, March 16, 2015. Hon. Fred Upton, Chairman, Committee on Energy and Commerce, House of Representatives, Washington, DC. Dear Mr. Chairman: The Congressional Budget Office has prepared the enclosed cost estimate for H.R. 639, the Improving Regulatory Transparency for New Medical Therapies Act. If you wish further details on this estimate, we will be pleased to provide them. The CBO staff contact is Julia Christensen. Sincerely, Douglas W. Elmendorf. Enclosure. ____ as ordered reported by the house committee on energy and commerce on february 12, 2015 H.R. 639 would modify the administrative procedures followed by the Department of Justice in regulating new drugs that are already approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and in authorizing drugs to be used in clinical trials. The legislation would aim to streamline the current review and approval process. CBO estimates that implementing the bill would have no significant effect on spending subject to appropriation. Enacting the legislation would affect direct spending and revenues related to federal health care costs; therefore, pay-as-you-go procedures apply. CBO estimates that that those effects would also not be significant over the 2015-2025 period. The legislation would change the effective date of FDA approval for certain new drugs that undergo review by the Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) to determine if the drug should be marketed with restrictions as a controlled substance. Such a change could extend certain regulatory periods during which FDA will not accept marketing applications or permit another manufacturer to market a version of an affected drug and could also result in the extension of patent terms for certain products. Extending such periods of marketing exclusivity could delay the entry of lower-priced generic drugs on the market, and such a delay would increase the average cost for prescription drugs. Any increase in health care costs resulting from delaying the market entry of generic drugs would affect direct spending and revenues by increasing the cost of prescription drugs for federal health programs and private health insurance. CBO expects that the bill's provisions would apply to a limited number of drugs subject to DEA classification after enactment. Because most drugs generally retain patent protections after FDA approval for more than 10 years, CBO anticipates that the likelihood that drugs affected by the bill will face generic competition before 2025 under current law would be small. As a result, we estimate that enacting the bill would not significantly affect direct spending or revenues over the 2015-2025 period. Beyond 2025, however, the potential for the legislation to delay the market entry of generic drugs would be greater, and the effect on direct spending and revenues would increase in later years. H.R. 639 contains no intergovernmental mandates as defined in the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act (UMRA) and would impose no costs on state, local, or tribal governments. The bill would impose a private-sector mandate, as defined under UMRA, on manufacturers of generic drugs by delaying the entry of those products in the market. The cost of the mandate would be the net loss of income, which could be significant depending on the drug. Based on information from industry sources, CBO estimates that the cost of the mandate would probably fall below the annual threshold established in UMRA for private-sector mandates ($154 million in 2015, adjusted annually for inflation). The CBO staff contacts for this estimate are Julia Christensen and Mark Grabowicz (for federal costs) and Amy Petz (for private sector costs). The estimate was approved by Theresa Gullo, Deputy Assistant Director for Budget Analysis. Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to lend my support to H.R. 639, the Improving Regulatory Transparency for New Medical Therapies Act. This important public health bill aims to bring better reliability and transparency to medical therapies, while continuing to ensure that they reach patients in need quickly, but most importantly safely and effectively. When a new drug is approved by the FDA, a company can begin marketing the product upon its approval. However, for a subset of drugs, FDA recommends to the DEA they be included in the Controlled Substance Act--or ``scheduled,'' if there is abuse potential. Until DEA makes a final decision, a drug cannot be released to the public. Unfortunately, there is no deadline for the DEA to make a decision. As a result, the process has lengthened over time, in some instances lasting years before a decision is made. So even if a drug is considered safe and effective, patients and physicians are being forced to wait to access these therapies. This bill would continue to allow DEA to conduct its own analysis, but would remove much of the uncertainty from the process. It also would speed up the DEA registration process allowing the manufacture and distribution of controlled substances for use only in clinical trials. I want to thank Chairman Pitts for working with me on this bill last Congress, and committing to move forward early this Congress. Thank you to Mr. Green as well for joining us on this important bill. I am glad that we have been able to work with both DEA and FDA, our Senate counterparts and the bill sponsors, to ensure that the goals of this bill is met. I urge members to support H.R 639 and I look forward to its swift passage. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Pitts) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 639, as amended. The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. ____________________",package_114_109.csv,26104,26104,26171,"[congressional record volume 161, number 44 (monday, march 16, 2015)] [house] [pages h1638-h1641] from the congressional record online through the government publishing office [ www.gpo.gov ] improving regulatory transparency for new medical therapies act mr. pitts. mr. speaker, i move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (h.r. 639) to amend the controlled substances act with respect to drug scheduling recommendations by the secretary of health and human services, and with respect to registration of manufacturers and distributors seeking to conduct clinical testing, as amended. the clerk read the title of the bill. the text of the bill is as follows: h.r. 639 be it enacted by the senate and house of representatives of the united states of america in congress assembled, section 1. short title. this act may be cited as the ``improving regulatory transparency for new medical therapies act''. sec. 2. scheduling of substances included in new fda-approved drugs.

[[page h1640]] there was no objection. mr. pitts. mr. speaker, i yield myself such time as i may consume. i will include an exchange of letters between the committee on energy and commerce and the committee on the judiciary. mr. speaker, h.r. 639 seeks to improve the transparency and consistency of the drug enforcement administration's first scheduling of new fda-approved drugs under the controlled substances act, the csa, and, secondly, its registration process for the manufacture of controlled substances for use in clinical trials. ultimately, this will allow new and innovative treatments to get to patients who desperately need them. due to the cost and uncertainty of the drug development process, there is broad agreement that a predictable timeline for approval decisions is a necessary component to successful drug development. industry, the fda, and congress have taken steps to provide more transparency and consistency in the drug approval process through the negotiation and authorization of the prescription drug user fee program and a commitment to review goals embedded in the pdufa agreements. however, drugs that contain substances that have not been previously marketed in the u.s. and that have abuse potential must also be scheduled under the controlled substances act, the csa, by the dea before they can reach patients. under the csa, there is no deadline for the dea to make a scheduling decision, and the delays in dea decisions have increased significantly. between 1997 and 1999 and 2009 and 2013, the average time between fda approval and dea's final scheduling increased from an average of 49.3 days to an average of 237.6 days. recently, a company had to wait over 13 months after fda approval to receive a final scheduling recommendation from the dea. the lack of predictability in the timing of dea scheduling decisions leads to unnecessary uncertainty in the drug development process and needless delays in patient access to new therapies. section 2 of h.r. 639, as amended by the full committee, would require dea to issue an interim final rule, scheduling the new drug no later than 90 days after it is approved or when it receives the fda's scheduling recommendation, whichever comes later. after receiving the fda's recommendation, the dea would continue to conduct its own analysis prior to scheduling the drug, but patients would now have peace of mind in knowing this will no longer be an open-ended process. of note: since 1996, the dea has not made any scheduling decision for a new drug that was contrary to the fda recommendation. further, section 3 of this bill would bring much-needed certainty to another open-ended dea process. manufacturers of controlled substances are required to be registered with the dea. the requirement to register extends to manufacturers of controlled substances intended to be used in clinical trials for products not yet approved by the fda. there is no timetable for the dea to grant approval of registration applications, and there is not a process for the applicant to determine the reasons for delay in the application. the lack of transparency, predictability, and timeliness in the registration process leaves companies unable to properly plan clinical trial schedules for prospective new therapies. for registration applications related to schedule iii, iv, and v drugs that will only be used in clinical trials, section 3, as amended by the full committee, would require the dea to register the applicant or serve an order to show cause on why the applicant shall not be registered within 180 days of the filing of the application. for drugs in schedule i and ii that will only be used in a clinical trial, the dea would be required to issue a notice of application not later than 90 days after an application is accepted for filing. ninety days after the end of the comment period, pursuant to the notice, the dea would be required to register the applicant or serve an order to show cause on why the registrant should not be registered. such a solution does not force the dea to make a particular decision but will provide transparency to the process so companies can better plan when regulatory decisions will be made. i would urge all members to support this critical piece of legislation. i reserve the balance of my time. house of

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and insert extraneous materials into the Record on the bill. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Texas? There was no objection. Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, the Trauma Systems and Regionalization of Emergency Care Reauthorization Act, H.R. 648, is identical to H.R. 4080 that passed the House last year unanimously. This legislation has also passed both the subcommittee and the full committee. This support extends back to 1990 when the grant was created and authorized. This reauthorization allows funding for trauma systems development and the regionalization of emergency care. These programs are designed to improve patient outcomes, and they are designed to save lives and cut costs, objectives where I believe there is bipartisan agreement. Trauma systems are organized efforts in a defined geographic area that deliver the full range of care to injured patients. Many members of the subcommittee have trauma systems in their districts or ones nearby that are able to serve their constituents. Regionalizing emergency care allows States to coordinate their resources and helps first responders act faster, leading to lower costs and better outcomes. A study released last year found that patients living near a recently closed trauma facility were 20 percent more likely to die from their injuries. Two years after closure, the likelihood of death increased to 29 percent, emphasizing the importance of these grants. This legislation is broadly supported by medicine, sharing the list of supporting organizations that I previously read on H.R. 647. It is bipartisan. I would stress it has gone through regular order. I want to thank Chairman Upton and Chairman Pitts, as well as Ranking Member Pallone and Ranking Member Green, for their help and support on this legislation. I want to thank the Energy and Commerce staff on both sides of the dais: Clay Alspach, Katie Novaria, as well as Hannah Green, and a special thanks to Adrianna Simonelli, who championed both of these bills as my legislative fellow and who is now working on the committee. Mr. Green and I have worked on these issues literally for years, and I appreciate his continued partnership on this bill. I want to thank his staff, Kristen O'Neill. Finally, I do want to thank J.P. Paluskiewicz, who shepherded this bill through the entire process. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. GENE GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself as much time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 648, the Trauma Systems and Regionalization of Emergency Care Reauthorization Act. I am proud to be the lead sponsor of this bill, along with my colleague, Dr. Burgess, and I want to thank him for his leadership and commitment to this issue. The bill reauthorizes the programs that provide grants to States for planning, implementing, and developing trauma care systems and establishing pilot projects to design innovative models of emergency care systems. Ideally, trauma and emergency care systems respond quickly and efficiently to ensure that seriously injured individuals receive the care they need within the golden hour, the time period in which medical intervention is most effective at saving lives. However, unintentional injury remains the leading cause of death for Americans ages 44 years and younger, and access to trauma centers is inconsistent throughout the country. In fact, 45 million Americans lack access to a trauma center within the first hour after injury. Emergency departments and trauma centers are overcrowded. The emergency care system is splintered, and surgical specialists are often unavailable to patients when they need them. This legislation helps establish a system that saves lives and improves the functioning of our trauma care systems. Again, I want to thank Representative Burgess for championing this effort with me and his staff for their efforts. I also want to acknowledge the leadership of Chairman Upton, Chairman Pitts, Ranking Member Pallone, and the work of the committee's staff in advancing this bill through the Energy and Commerce Committee. Mr. Speaker, I support this bipartisan bill. I urge my colleagues to do the same. Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers, and I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Speaker, let me just conclude by strongly urging all Members of the House to vote in favor of this legislation. I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore.

Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 876) to amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to require hospitals to provide certain notifications to individuals classified by such hospitals under observation status rather than admitted as inpatients of such hospitals, as amended. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The text of the bill is as follows: H.R. 876 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. This Act may be cited as the ``Notice of Observation Treatment and Implication for Care Eligibility Act'' or the ``NOTICE Act''. SEC. 2. MEDICARE REQUIREMENT FOR HOSPITAL NOTIFICATIONS OF OBSERVATION STATUS. Section 1866(a)(1) of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1395cc(a)(1)) is amended-- (1) in subparagraph (V), by striking at the end ``and''; (2) in the first subparagraph (W), by striking at the end the period and inserting a comma; (3) in the second subparagraph (W)-- (A) by redesignating such subparagraph as subparagraph (X); and (B) by striking at the end the period and inserting ``, and''; and (4) by inserting after such subparagraph (X) the following new subparagraph: ``(Y) beginning 12 months after the date of the enactment of this subparagraph, in the case of a hospital or critical access hospital, with respect to each individual who receives observation services as an outpatient at such hospital or critical access hospital for more than 24 hours, to provide to such individual not later than 36 hours after the time such individual begins receiving such services (or, if sooner, upon release)-- ``(i) such oral explanation of the written notification described in clause (ii), and such documentation of the provision of such explanation, as the Secretary determines to be appropriate; ``(ii) a written notification (as specified by the Secretary pursuant to rulemaking and containing such language as the Secretary prescribes consistent with this paragraph) which-- ``(I) explains the status of the individual as an outpatient receiving observation services and not as an inpatient of the hospital or critical access hospital and the reasons for such status of such individual; ``(II) explains the implications of such status on services furnished by the hospital or critical access hospital (including services furnished on an inpatient basis), such as implications for cost-sharing requirements under this title and for subsequent eligibility for coverage under this title for services furnished by a skilled nursing facility; ``(III) includes such additional information as the Secretary determines appropriate; ``(IV) either-- ``(aa) is signed by such individual or a person acting on such individual's behalf to acknowledge receipt of such notification; or ``(bb) if such individual or person refuses to provide the signature described in item (aa), is signed by the staff member of the hospital or critical access hospital who presented the written notification and includes the name and title of such staff member, a certification that the notification was presented, and the date and time the notification was presented; and ``(V) is written and formatted using plain language and is made available in appropriate languages as determined by the Secretary.''. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. Ryan) and the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Doggett) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Wisconsin. General Leave Mr. RYAN of Wisconsin. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous material on H.R. 876, currently under consideration. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Wisconsin? There was no objection. Mr. RYAN of Wisconsin. Mr. Speaker, this is commonsense legislation dealing with the Medicare program that is bipartisan that the Committee on Ways and Means marked up a couple of weeks ago. I want to just commend my colleagues Congressman Young from Indiana and Congressman Doggett from Texas for their work on this. This is common sense. This tells patients what the rules are so that they know what is going to happen when they are in the hospital, so they know what kind of billing they are going to have. I yield whatever time he may consume to the gentleman from Indiana (Mr. Young), the coauthor of this legislation, for the purpose of describing this legislation. Mr. YOUNG of Indiana. Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman for taking up this important piece of legislation today. I also want to thank the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Doggett) for his leadership on this issue. When seniors require a hospital stay, they are rightfully more concerned with their recovery than with understanding how the hospital classifies their status as a patient; but when that classification can impact future coverage of health care services related to their recovery, they deserve to be made aware of the potential ramifications. This act, the NOTICE Act, would require hospitals to provide meaningful written and oral notification to patients who are in the hospital under observation for more than 24 hours. This notice would alert the beneficiary or person acting on their behalf of the Medicare patient's admission status and the financial implications of that classification so he or she can advocate on their own behalf while in the hospital. No one should be caught off guard by a large medical bill just because they weren't aware of the status codes or the billing procedures. In a time of sickness and stress, families should focus on the recovery of their loved ones instead of dealing with the hidden costs due to lack of notice. Mr. DOGGETT. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the bill and yield myself such time as I might consume. The NOTICE Act, as the name suggests, is about giving notice. In this case, it gives notice to patients when they are about to be billed personally, perhaps for many thousands of dollars, because they were characterized as under observation rather than regular inpatient status without them even knowing. I am pleased to have worked on this legislation since last summer with Mr. Young when we originally filed the bill, and I am appreciative of Chairman Ryan's prompt consideration of it in our committee. This is a consumer protection bill designed to provide at least limited protection to health care consumers. Currently, a hospital may either admit a patient as an inpatient or keep them under observation. This categorization might apply to heart murmur, irregular heartbeat, indigestion, or other symptoms that would cause a senior or an individual with a disability who is covered by Medicare to go into the hospital. It probably makes little or no difference in the way the hospital treats the physical condition, but it can make a very big difference in terms of how the patient's pocketbook is cared for. Indeed, the effect of being under observation is that the patient gets stuck with the bill for any skilled nursing home care that is required for rehabilitative services after the stay at the hospital. Medicare will pay for that needed care if a Medicare recipient patient is hospitalized for more than 3 days as an inpatient, but Medicare will not pay for skilled nursing home care if someone is simply under observation. Since Medicare has paid nothing, there is also no gap to be covered by Medigap; and instead of being in a gap, folks like this are really left in just a giant black hole. A Medicare patient that is sucked into this hole will be billed for the entire cost of rehabilitation at the nursing home, which can run into tens of thousands of dollars. This practice is happening more and more across America, though it is largely unknown to most people until they get caught up in it. In 2012, Medicare patients had more than 600,000 observation stays that lasted 3 days or more. According to one study, over a 6-year span, the number of stays under observation has increased by 88 percent. Many Medicare patients are being put under observation for a length of time that exceeds the guidelines that have been set by Medicare. Last year on the NBC Nightly News, Kate Snow profiled Ms. Kelley- Nelum, who discovered that this costly classification had a big impact on her hospitalized husband. After repeated questioning and demanding to know why [[Page H1645]] her husband was under observation, she got the hospital to reclassify him. She later learned that had that not occurred, had she not been persistent in standing up for her ill husband, that they would have faced about $22,000 in out-of-pocket rehabilitation bills. Last year, with so many patients facing insurmountable out-of-pocket costs for skilled nursing care after unknowingly being placed under observation, The New York Times actually ran a piece that was designed to provide guidance to health care consumers about how to get out of this observation category. The first step is knowing you are in it, and this bill provides for that meaningful disclosure. This legislation is endorsed by AARP, by the Alliance for Retired Americans, the Center for Medicare Advocacy, the National Association of Professional Geriatric Care Managers, LeadingAge, American Health Care Association, and the National Committee to Preserve Social Security and Medicare. I include in the Record letters from two of those groups in support of the legislation. AARP, February 24, 2015. Hon. Lloyd Doggett, Rayburn Office Building, House of Representatives, Washington, DC. Hon. Todd Young, Longworth Office Building, House of Representatives, Washington, DC. Dear Representative Doggett and Representative Young: On behalf of the nearly 38 million AARP members and the millions more Americans with Medicare, we are pleased to endorse the Notice of Observation Treatment and Implication for Care Eligibility (NOTICE) Act of 2015 (H.R. 876). Thank you for working together to address the growing problem of Medicare beneficiaries paying high out-of-pocket costs due to hospital stays in which they were classified as an outpatient, rather than being formally admitted as an inpatient. As you know, the use of ``observation status'' has become more prevalent in recent years, and the duration of observation stays has grown longer. While there may be several reasons for these trends, it is clear that Medicare beneficiaries are spending more and more time in the hospital without being formally admitted. Admission as an inpatient activates Medicare Part A cost-sharing and a three-day stay requirement for skilled nursing facility (SNF) coverage; in contrast, observation status is billed under Part B, and can expose beneficiaries to unexpectedly high out-of-pocket costs amounting to thousands of dollars. Beneficiaries must be informed and made aware of how any changes to their status will affect them. This legislation would require hospitals to provide meaningful written and oral notification to patients who are in the hospital ``under observation'' for more than 24 hours. While this does not solve all the problems regarding cost-sharing and access to SNF coverage, it is an important step to ensuring Medicare beneficiaries have access to information about their care. Clearly understanding their admission status will help patients, and their caregivers, better plan treatment options with their health care providers. Again, thank you for your continued work to protect Medicare beneficiaries. If you have any questions, please contact me, or have your staff contact Ariel Gonzalez, Director of Federal Health and Family. Sincerely, Joyce A. Rogers, Senior Vice President, Government Affairs. ____ American Health Care Association, Washington, DC, February 11, 2015. Hon. Lloyd Doggett, Rayburn House Office Building, Washington, DC. Congressman Doggett: I serve as the president and chief executive officer of AHCA/NCAL, the nation's largest association of long term and post-acute care providers. The association advocates for quality care and services for the frail, elderly, and individuals with disabilities. Our members provide essential care to millions of individuals in more than 12,000 not for profit and for profit member facilities. AHCA/NCAL, its affiliates, and member providers advocate for the continuing vitality of the long term care provider community. We are committed to developing and advocating for public policies that support quality care and quality of life for our nation's most vulnerable. Therefore, we are in support of the legislation, Notice of Observation Treatment and Implication for Care Eligibility (NOTICE) Act, that you and Congressman Todd Young (R-IN-9) have introduced again this Congress. The NOTICE Act requires hospitals to give formal notice to patients within a period of time after classifying them as an inpatient or as an outpatient under observation. More specifically, the legislation works to ensure that hospitals notify patients entitled to Medicare part A coverage of their outpatient status within 36 hours after the time of their classification or, if sooner, upon discharge. Often times, patients have no idea what their status is in a hospital or the importance of it. This can lead to thousands of dollars in out-of-pocket medical expenses should they need skilled nursing center care following their hospital stay. The observation stays issue is a financial burden on seniors and their families. It can cause unnecessary spend-down, accelerating the time frame in which seniors will have to turn to programs such as Medicaid to pay for their care. This legislation is a positive step forward, and raises attention to a complex and critical issue hurting the nation's seniors. AHCA/NCAL applauds Congressmen Doggett and Young for serving as champions for seniors and those individuals who need our services the most. Sincerely, Mark Parkinson, AHCA/NCAL President & CEO. Mr. DOGGETT. Mr. Speaker, I also appreciate the help we have received from the Center for Medicare Advocacy. They have had reports, again, from people all over the country being placed in this situation. The hospitals may act in the best interests of a patient's health but not always in the best interest of the patient's pocketbook. The NOTICE Act will equip patients and their loved ones with the knowledge that they need to be effective advocates and avoid crippling financial repercussions. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. RYAN of Wisconsin. Mr. Speaker, may I inquire of the gentleman from Texas if they have any other speakers? We are prepared to close. Mr. DOGGETT. I have one speaker on the way. If you are prepared to close and he is not arriving, then we will close. Do you have any other speakers? Mr. RYAN of Wisconsin. I will just say a few things. I yield myself such time as I may consume, Mr. Speaker. This is basically common sense. What is happening is people on Medicare are going to the hospital. They don't know what their status is, whether they are considered inpatient or outpatient. As far as they are concerned, it is the same thing. The problem is they are being declared one or the other, unbeknownst to them, and that has a huge difference in the billing that they receive. So what this bill simply says is you will know your status so that you can make an informed decision as a patient in a hospital, because there are huge financial implications to that status. This is very simple. It is good government. I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. DOGGETT. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 15 seconds and will welcome my colleague, Joe Courtney, who has long sought to respond legislatively to protect health care consumers from the financial pain of this observation status. While the passage of the NOTICE Act is an important step, Representative Courtney has an Improving Access to Medicare Coverage Act that would treat observation stays the same as inpatient stays. I support his legislation as he has supported, from the beginning, this initiative, and I appreciate his leadership. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Connecticut (Mr. Courtney). Mr. COURTNEY. Mr. Speaker, I want to, first of all, salute Congressman Doggett for his effort in terms of bringing this legislation forward. As the chairman of the committee said, this is really about giving patients a fighting chance to challenge this coding, a change that happens while people are in the hospital and have absolutely no idea that they are not being treated as full part A inpatient patients at hospital facilities. The impact of being coded as observation versus inpatient may sound extremely arcane, but what that means is that at time of discharge, if a patient is medically prescribed to go to a nursing home for rehab care for a broken bone or for home health services for a heart condition, they are not covered by Medicare if they are in the observation bucket as opposed to the inpatient bucket. The inspector general's office for Medicare issued a report in 2012 that 600,000 patients across the country with long-stay hospital visits over 3 days fell into this black hole, this no man's land where, again, their doctors are telling them that they need to have rehab services so that people can walk again and deal with activities of daily living; but the price for doing that, because you are in observation status, [[Page H1646]] can be tens of thousands of dollars, which is where long-term care facilities, nursing home coverage for private-pay patients, out-of- pocket patients, exist today. This bill at least gives patients the opportunity to challenge that decision. But the fact of the matter is, what we need to do is to restore the 3-day rule, which is in statute. It has been there since 1965. Observation status is something new within the last 10 years, and what we need to do as a Congress is to restore that 3-day rule, which says to a patient: If you are coded observation or if you are coded inpatient, it should not interfere with your medically prescribed course of treatment at the time that you are discharged from the hospital. That, unfortunately, is not going to be fixed as a result of this legislation. We should build on this legislation and again restore Medicare's promise, which, again, from day one, has said that medically prescribed care will be covered by the system at time of discharge from a hospital for longer than 3 days. The horror stories of people who in some instances were in hospital for 9 days with broken bones, broken hips, who, again, are staring at a 10 to $15,000 fee to be admitted to a nursing home--again, 600,000 cases in 2012. So again, we need to build on this legislation, but fundamentally, we need to restore the 3-day rule which has been in statute since 1965. We will be introducing that legislation later this week. It will be a bipartisan bill. We think we can withstand the test of any pay-fors to make sure that it allows the Medicare system's finances to stay in a stable condition. In the meantime, we should pass this legislation today. Again, I want to salute the Member from Texas for his leadership on this issue. {time} 1645 Mr. DOGGETT.

Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 876) to amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to require hospitals to provide certain notifications to individuals classified by such hospitals under observation status rather than admitted as inpatients of such hospitals, as amended. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The text of the bill is as follows: H.R. 876 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. This Act may be cited as the ``Notice of Observation Treatment and Implication for Care Eligibility Act'' or the ``NOTICE Act''. SEC. 2. MEDICARE REQUIREMENT FOR HOSPITAL NOTIFICATIONS OF OBSERVATION STATUS. Section 1866(a)(1) of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1395cc(a)(1)) is amended-- (1) in subparagraph (V), by striking at the end ``and''; (2) in the first subparagraph (W), by striking at the end the period and inserting a comma; (3) in the second subparagraph (W)-- (A) by redesignating such subparagraph as subparagraph (X); and (B) by striking at the end the period and inserting ``, and''; and (4) by inserting after such subparagraph (X) the following new subparagraph: ``(Y) beginning 12 months after the date of the enactment of this subparagraph, in the case of a hospital or critical access hospital, with respect to each individual who receives observation services as an outpatient at such hospital or critical access hospital for more than 24 hours, to provide to such individual not later than 36 hours after the time such individual begins receiving such services (or, if sooner, upon release)-- ``(i) such oral explanation of the written notification described in clause (ii), and such documentation of the provision of such explanation, as the Secretary determines to be appropriate; ``(ii) a written notification (as specified by the Secretary pursuant to rulemaking and containing such language as the Secretary prescribes consistent with this paragraph) which-- ``(I) explains the status of the individual as an outpatient receiving observation services and not as an inpatient of the hospital or critical access hospital and the reasons for such status of such individual; ``(II) explains the implications of such status on services furnished by the hospital or critical access hospital (including services furnished on an inpatient basis), such as implications for cost-sharing requirements under this title and for subsequent eligibility for coverage under this title for services furnished by a skilled nursing facility; ``(III) includes such additional information as the Secretary determines appropriate; ``(IV) either-- ``(aa) is signed by such individual or a person acting on such individual's behalf to acknowledge receipt of such notification; or ``(bb) if such individual or person refuses to provide the signature described in item (aa), is signed by the staff member of the hospital or critical access hospital who presented the written notification and includes the name and title of such staff member, a certification that the notification was presented, and the date and time the notification was presented; and ``(V) is written and formatted using plain language and is made available in appropriate languages as determined by the Secretary.''. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. Ryan) and the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Doggett) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Wisconsin. General Leave Mr. RYAN of Wisconsin. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous material on H.R. 876, currently under consideration. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Wisconsin? There was no objection. Mr. RYAN of Wisconsin. Mr. Speaker, this is commonsense legislation dealing with the Medicare program that is bipartisan that the Committee on Ways and Means marked up a couple of weeks ago. I want to just commend my colleagues Congressman Young from Indiana and Congressman Doggett from Texas for their work on this. This is common sense. This tells patients what the rules are so that they know what is going to happen when they are in the hospital, so they know what kind of billing they are going to have. I yield whatever time he may consume to the gentleman from Indiana (Mr. Young), the coauthor of this legislation, for the purpose of describing this legislation. Mr. YOUNG of Indiana. Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman for taking up this important piece of legislation today. I also want to thank the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Doggett) for his leadership on this issue. When seniors require a hospital stay, they are rightfully more concerned with their recovery than with understanding how the hospital classifies their status as a patient; but when that classification can impact future coverage of health care services related to their recovery, they deserve to be made aware of the potential ramifications. This act, the NOTICE Act, would require hospitals to provide meaningful written and oral notification to patients who are in the hospital under observation for more than 24 hours. This notice would alert the beneficiary or person acting on their behalf of the Medicare patient's admission status and the financial implications of that classification so he or she can advocate on their own behalf while in the hospital. No one should be caught off guard by a large medical bill just because they weren't aware of the status codes or the billing procedures. In a time of sickness and stress, families should focus on the recovery of their loved ones instead of dealing with the hidden costs due to lack of notice. Mr. DOGGETT. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the bill and yield myself such time as I might consume. The NOTICE Act, as the name suggests, is about giving notice. In this case, it gives notice to patients when they are about to be billed personally, perhaps for many thousands of dollars, because they were characterized as under observation rather than regular inpatient status without them even knowing. I am pleased to have worked on this legislation since last summer with Mr. Young when we originally filed the bill, and I am appreciative of Chairman Ryan's prompt consideration of it in our committee. This is a consumer protection bill designed to provide at least limited protection to health care consumers. Currently, a hospital may either admit a patient as an inpatient or keep them under observation. This categorization might apply to heart murmur, irregular heartbeat, indigestion, or other symptoms that would cause a senior or an individual with a disability who is covered by Medicare to go into the hospital. It probably makes little or no difference in the way the hospital treats the physical condition, but it can make a very big difference in terms of how the patient's pocketbook is cared for. Indeed, the effect of being under observation is that the patient gets stuck with the bill for any skilled nursing home care that is required for rehabilitative services after the stay at the hospital. Medicare will pay for that needed care if a Medicare recipient patient is hospitalized for more than 3 days as an inpatient, but Medicare will not pay for skilled nursing home care if someone is simply under observation. Since Medicare has paid nothing, there is also no gap to be covered by Medigap; and instead of being in a gap, folks like this are really left in just a giant black hole. A Medicare patient that is sucked into this hole will be billed for the entire cost of rehabilitation at the nursing home, which can run into tens of thousands of dollars. This practice is happening more and more across America, though it is largely unknown to most people until they get caught up in it. In 2012, Medicare patients had more than 600,000 observation stays that lasted 3 days or more. According to one study, over a 6-year span, the number of stays under observation has increased by 88 percent. Many Medicare patients are being put under observation for a length of time that exceeds the guidelines that have been set by Medicare. Last year on the NBC Nightly News, Kate Snow profiled Ms. Kelley- Nelum, who discovered that this costly classification had a big impact on her hospitalized husband. After repeated questioning and demanding to know why [[Page H1645]] her husband was under observation, she got the hospital to reclassify him. She later learned that had that not occurred, had she not been persistent in standing up for her ill husband, that they would have faced about $22,000 in out-of-pocket rehabilitation bills. Last year, with so many patients facing insurmountable out-of-pocket costs for skilled nursing care after unknowingly being placed under observation, The New York Times actually ran a piece that was designed to provide guidance to health care consumers about how to get out of this observation category. The first step is knowing you are in it, and this bill provides for that meaningful disclosure. This legislation is endorsed by AARP, by the Alliance for Retired Americans, the Center for Medicare Advocacy, the National Association of Professional Geriatric Care Managers, LeadingAge, American Health Care Association, and the National Committee to Preserve Social Security and Medicare. I include in the Record letters from two of those groups in support of the legislation. AARP, February 24, 2015. Hon. Lloyd Doggett, Rayburn Office Building, House of Representatives, Washington, DC. Hon. Todd Young, Longworth Office Building, House of Representatives, Washington, DC. Dear Representative Doggett and Representative Young: On behalf of the nearly 38 million AARP members and the millions more Americans with Medicare, we are pleased to endorse the Notice of Observation Treatment and Implication for Care Eligibility (NOTICE) Act of 2015 (H.R. 876). Thank you for working together to address the growing problem of Medicare beneficiaries paying high out-of-pocket costs due to hospital stays in which they were classified as an outpatient, rather than being formally admitted as an inpatient. As you know, the use of ``observation status'' has become more prevalent in recent years, and the duration of observation stays has grown longer. While there may be several reasons for these trends, it is clear that Medicare beneficiaries are spending more and more time in the hospital without being formally admitted. Admission as an inpatient activates Medicare Part A cost-sharing and a three-day stay requirement for skilled nursing facility (SNF) coverage; in contrast, observation status is billed under Part B, and can expose beneficiaries to unexpectedly high out-of-pocket costs amounting to thousands of dollars. Beneficiaries must be informed and made aware of how any changes to their status will affect them. This legislation would require hospitals to provide meaningful written and oral notification to patients who are in the hospital ``under observation'' for more than 24 hours. While this does not solve all the problems regarding cost-sharing and access to SNF coverage, it is an important step to ensuring Medicare beneficiaries have access to information about their care. Clearly understanding their admission status will help patients, and their caregivers, better plan treatment options with their health care providers. Again, thank you for your continued work to protect Medicare beneficiaries. If you have any questions, please contact me, or have your staff contact Ariel Gonzalez, Director of Federal Health and Family. Sincerely, Joyce A. Rogers, Senior Vice President, Government Affairs. ____ American Health Care Association, Washington, DC, February 11, 2015. Hon. Lloyd Doggett, Rayburn House Office Building, Washington, DC. Congressman Doggett: I serve as the president and chief executive officer of AHCA/NCAL, the nation's largest association of long term and post-acute care providers. The association advocates for quality care and services for the frail, elderly, and individuals with disabilities. Our members provide essential care to millions of individuals in more than 12,000 not for profit and for profit member facilities. AHCA/NCAL, its affiliates, and member providers advocate for the continuing vitality of the long term care provider community. We are committed to developing and advocating for public policies that support quality care and quality of life for our nation's most vulnerable. Therefore, we are in support of the legislation, Notice of Observation Treatment and Implication for Care Eligibility (NOTICE) Act, that you and Congressman Todd Young (R-IN-9) have introduced again this Congress. The NOTICE Act requires hospitals to give formal notice to patients within a period of time after classifying them as an inpatient or as an outpatient under observation. More specifically, the legislation works to ensure that hospitals notify patients entitled to Medicare part A coverage of their outpatient status within 36 hours after the time of their classification or, if sooner, upon discharge. Often times, patients have no idea what their status is in a hospital or the importance of it. This can lead to thousands of dollars in out-of-pocket medical expenses should they need skilled nursing center care following their hospital stay. The observation stays issue is a financial burden on seniors and their families. It can cause unnecessary spend-down, accelerating the time frame in which seniors will have to turn to programs such as Medicaid to pay for their care. This legislation is a positive step forward, and raises attention to a complex and critical issue hurting the nation's seniors. AHCA/NCAL applauds Congressmen Doggett and Young for serving as champions for seniors and those individuals who need our services the most. Sincerely, Mark Parkinson, AHCA/NCAL President & CEO. Mr. DOGGETT. Mr. Speaker, I also appreciate the help we have received from the Center for Medicare Advocacy. They have had reports, again, from people all over the country being placed in this situation. The hospitals may act in the best interests of a patient's health but not always in the best interest of the patient's pocketbook. The NOTICE Act will equip patients and their loved ones with the knowledge that they need to be effective advocates and avoid crippling financial repercussions. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. RYAN of Wisconsin. Mr. Speaker, may I inquire of the gentleman from Texas if they have any other speakers? We are prepared to close. Mr. DOGGETT. I have one speaker on the way. If you are prepared to close and he is not arriving, then we will close. Do you have any other speakers? Mr. RYAN of Wisconsin. I will just say a few things. I yield myself such time as I may consume, Mr. Speaker. This is basically common sense. What is happening is people on Medicare are going to the hospital. They don't know what their status is, whether they are considered inpatient or outpatient. As far as they are concerned, it is the same thing. The problem is they are being declared one or the other, unbeknownst to them, and that has a huge difference in the billing that they receive. So what this bill simply says is you will know your status so that you can make an informed decision as a patient in a hospital, because there are huge financial implications to that status. This is very simple. It is good government. I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. DOGGETT. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 15 seconds and will welcome my colleague, Joe Courtney, who has long sought to respond legislatively to protect health care consumers from the financial pain of this observation status. While the passage of the NOTICE Act is an important step, Representative Courtney has an Improving Access to Medicare Coverage Act that would treat observation stays the same as inpatient stays. I support his legislation as he has supported, from the beginning, this initiative, and I appreciate his leadership. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Connecticut (Mr. Courtney). Mr. COURTNEY. Mr. Speaker, I want to, first of all, salute Congressman Doggett for his effort in terms of bringing this legislation forward. As the chairman of the committee said, this is really about giving patients a fighting chance to challenge this coding, a change that happens while people are in the hospital and have absolutely no idea that they are not being treated as full part A inpatient patients at hospital facilities. The impact of being coded as observation versus inpatient may sound extremely arcane, but what that means is that at time of discharge, if a patient is medically prescribed to go to a nursing home for rehab care for a broken bone or for home health services for a heart condition, they are not covered by Medicare if they are in the observation bucket as opposed to the inpatient bucket. The inspector general's office for Medicare issued a report in 2012 that 600,000 patients across the country with long-stay hospital visits over 3 days fell into this black hole, this no man's land where, again, their doctors are telling them that they need to have rehab services so that people can walk again and deal with activities of daily living; but the price for doing that, because you are in observation status, [[Page H1646]] can be tens of thousands of dollars, which is where long-term care facilities, nursing home coverage for private-pay patients, out-of- pocket patients, exist today. This bill at least gives patients the opportunity to challenge that decision. But the fact of the matter is, what we need to do is to restore the 3-day rule, which is in statute. It has been there since 1965. Observation status is something new within the last 10 years, and what we need to do as a Congress is to restore that 3-day rule, which says to a patient: If you are coded observation or if you are coded inpatient, it should not interfere with your medically prescribed course of treatment at the time that you are discharged from the hospital. That, unfortunately, is not going to be fixed as a result of this legislation. We should build on this legislation and again restore Medicare's promise, which, again, from day one, has said that medically prescribed care will be covered by the system at time of discharge from a hospital for longer than 3 days. The horror stories of people who in some instances were in hospital for 9 days with broken bones, broken hips, who, again, are staring at a 10 to $15,000 fee to be admitted to a nursing home--again, 600,000 cases in 2012. So again, we need to build on this legislation, but fundamentally, we need to restore the 3-day rule which has been in statute since 1965. We will be introducing that legislation later this week. It will be a bipartisan bill. We think we can withstand the test of any pay-fors to make sure that it allows the Medicare system's finances to stay in a stable condition. In the meantime, we should pass this legislation today. Again, I want to salute the Member from Texas for his leadership on this issue. {time} 1645 Mr. DOGGETT.

Mr. COURTNEY. Mr. Speaker, I want to, first of all, salute Congressman Doggett for his effort in terms of bringing this legislation forward. As the chairman of the committee said, this is really about giving patients a fighting chance to challenge this coding, a change that happens while people are in the hospital and have absolutely no idea that they are not being treated as full part A inpatient patients at hospital facilities. The impact of being coded as observation versus inpatient may sound extremely arcane, but what that means is that at time of discharge, if a patient is medically prescribed to go to a nursing home for rehab care for a broken bone or for home health services for a heart condition, they are not covered by Medicare if they are in the observation bucket as opposed to the inpatient bucket. The inspector general's office for Medicare issued a report in 2012 that 600,000 patients across the country with long-stay hospital visits over 3 days fell into this black hole, this no man's land where, again, their doctors are telling them that they need to have rehab services so that people can walk again and deal with activities of daily living; but the price for doing that, because you are in observation status, [[Page H1646]] can be tens of thousands of dollars, which is where long-term care facilities, nursing home coverage for private-pay patients, out-of- pocket patients, exist today. This bill at least gives patients the opportunity to challenge that decision. But the fact of the matter is, what we need to do is to restore the 3-day rule, which is in statute. It has been there since 1965. Observation status is something new within the last 10 years, and what we need to do as a Congress is to restore that 3-day rule, which says to a patient: If you are coded observation or if you are coded inpatient, it should not interfere with your medically prescribed course of treatment at the time that you are discharged from the hospital. That, unfortunately, is not going to be fixed as a result of this legislation. We should build on this legislation and again restore Medicare's promise, which, again, from day one, has said that medically prescribed care will be covered by the system at time of discharge from a hospital for longer than 3 days. The horror stories of people who in some instances were in hospital for 9 days with broken bones, broken hips, who, again, are staring at a 10 to $15,000 fee to be admitted to a nursing home--again, 600,000 cases in 2012. So again, we need to build on this legislation, but fundamentally, we need to restore the 3-day rule which has been in statute since 1965. We will be introducing that legislation later this week. It will be a bipartisan bill. We think we can withstand the test of any pay-fors to make sure that it allows the Medicare system's finances to stay in a stable condition. In the meantime, we should pass this legislation today. Again, I want to salute the Member from Texas for his leadership on this issue. {time} 1645 Mr. DOGGETT.

eligibility act mr. ryan of wisconsin. mr. speaker, i move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (h.r. 876) to amend title xviii of the social security act to require hospitals to provide certain notifications to individuals classified by such hospitals under observation status rather than admitted as inpatients of such hospitals, as amended. the clerk read the title of the bill. the text of the bill is as follows: h.r. 876 be it enacted by the senate and house of representatives of the united states of america in congress assembled, section 1. short title. this act may be cited as the ``notice of observation treatment and implication for care eligibility act'' or the ``notice act''. sec. 2. medicare requirement for hospital notifications of observation status. section 1866(a)(1) of the social security act (42 u.s.c. 1395cc(a)(1)) is amended-- (1) in subparagraph (v), by striking at the end ``and''; (2) in the first subparagraph (w), by striking at the end the period and inserting a comma; (3) in the second subparagraph (w)-- (a) by redesignating such subparagraph as subparagraph (x); and (b) by striking at the end the period and inserting ``, and''; and (4) by inserting after such subparagraph (x) the following new subparagraph: ``(y) beginning 12 months after the date of the enactment of this subparagraph, in the case of a hospital or critical access hospital, with respect to each individual who receives observation services as an outpatient at such hospital or critical access hospital for more than 24 hours, to provide to such individual not later than 36 hours after the time such individual begins receiving such services (or, if sooner, upon release)-- ``(i) such oral explanation of the written notification described in clause (ii), and

by the secretary.''. the speaker pro tempore. pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from wisconsin (mr. ryan) and the gentleman from texas (mr. doggett) each will control 20 minutes. the chair recognizes the gentleman from wisconsin. general leave mr. ryan of wisconsin. mr. speaker, i ask unanimous consent that all members may have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous material on h.r. 876, currently under consideration. the speaker pro tempore. is there objection to the request of the gentleman from wisconsin? there was no objection. mr. ryan of wisconsin. mr. speaker, this is commonsense legislation dealing with the medicare program that is bipartisan that the committee on ways and means marked up a couple of weeks ago. i want to just commend my colleagues congressman young from indiana and congressman doggett from texas for their work on this. this is common sense. this tells patients what the rules are so that they know what is going to happen when they are in the hospital, so they know what kind of billing they are going to have. i yield whatever time he may consume to the gentleman from indiana (mr. young), the coauthor of this legislation, for the purpose of describing this legislation. mr. young of indiana. mr. speaker, i thank the chairman for taking up this important piece of legislation today. i also want to thank the gentleman from texas (mr. doggett) for his leadership on this issue. when seniors require a hospital stay, they are rightfully more concerned with their recovery than with understanding how the hospital classifies their status as a patient; but when that classification can impact future coverage of health care services related to their recovery, they deserve to be made aware of the potential ramifications. this act, the notice act, would require hospitals to provide meaningful written and oral notification to patients who are in the hospital under observation for more than 24 hours. this notice would alert the beneficiary or person acting on their behalf of the medicare patient's admission status and the financial implications of that classification so he or she can advocate on their own behalf while in the hospital. no one should be caught off guard by a large medical bill just because they weren't aware of the status codes or the billing procedures. in a time of sickness and stress, families should focus on the recovery of their loved ones instead of dealing with the hidden costs due to lack of notice. mr. doggett. mr. speaker, i rise in support of the bill and yield myself such time as i might consume. the notice act, as the name suggests, is about giving notice. in this case, it gives notice to patients when they are about to be billed personally, perhaps for many thousands of dollars, because they were characterized as under observation rather than regular inpatient status without them even knowing. i am pleased to have worked on this legislation since last summer with mr. young when we originally filed the bill, and i am appreciative of chairman ryan's prompt consideration of it in our committee. this is a consumer protection bill designed to provide at least limited protection to health care consumers. currently, a hospital may either admit a patient as an inpatient or keep them under observation. this categorization might apply to heart murmur, irregular heartbeat, indigestion, or other symptoms that would cause a senior or an individual with a disability who is covered by medicare to go into the hospital. it probably makes little or no difference in the way the hospital treats the physical condition, but it can make a very big difference in terms of how the patient's pocketbook is cared for. indeed, the effect of being under observation is that the patient gets stuck with the bill for any skilled nursing home care that is required for rehabilitative services after the stay at the hospital. medicare will pay for that needed care if a medicare recipient patient is hospitalized for more than 3 days as an inpatient, but medicare will not pay for skilled nursing home care if someone is simply under observation. since medicare has paid nothing, there is also no gap to be covered by medigap; and instead of being in a gap, folks like this are really left in just a giant black hole. a medicare patient that is sucked into this hole will be billed for the entire cost of rehabilitation at the nursing home, which can run into tens of thousands of dollars. this practice is happening more and more across america, though it is largely unknown to most people until they get caught up in it. in 2012, medicare patients had more than 600,000 observation stays that lasted 3 days or more. according to one study, over a 6-year span, the number of stays under observation has increased by 88 percent. many medicare patients are being put under observation for a length of time that exceeds the guidelines that have been set by medicare. last year on the nbc nightly news, kate snow profiled ms. kelley- nelum, who discovered that this costly classification had a big impact on her hospitalized husband. after repeated questioning and demanding to know why [[page h1645]] her husband was under observation, she got the hospital to reclassify him. she later learned that had that not occurred, had she not been persistent in standing up for her ill husband, that they would have faced about $22,000 in out-of-pocket rehabilitation bills. last year, with so many patients facing insurmountable out-of-pocket costs for skilled nursing care after unknowingly being placed under observation, the new york times actually ran a piece that was designed to provide guidance to health care consumers about how to get out of this observation category. the first step is knowing you are in it, and this bill provides for that meaningful disclosure. this legislation is endorsed by aarp, by the alliance for retired americans, the center for medicare advocacy, the national association of professional geriatric care managers, leadingage, american health care association, and the national committee to preserve social security and medicare. i include in the record letters from two of those groups in support of the legislation. aarp, february 24, 2015. hon. lloyd doggett, rayburn office building, house of representatives, washington, dc. hon. todd young, longworth office building, house of representatives, washington, dc. dear representative doggett and representative young: on behalf of the nearly 38 million aarp members and the millions more americans with medicare, we are pleased to endorse the notice of observation treatment and implication for care eligibility (notice) act of 2015 (h.r. 876). thank you for working together to address the growing problem of medicare beneficiaries paying high out-of-pocket costs due to hospital stays in which they were classified as an outpatient, rather than being formally admitted as an inpatient. as you know, the use of ``observation status'' has become more prevalent in recent years, and the duration of observation stays has grown longer. while there may be several reasons for these trends, it is clear that medicare beneficiaries are spending more and more time in the hospital without being formally admitted. admission as an inpatient activates medicare part a cost-sharing and a three-day stay requirement for skilled nursing facility (snf) coverage; in contrast, observation status is billed under part b, and can expose beneficiaries to unexpectedly high out-of-pocket costs amounting to thousands of dollars. beneficiaries must be informed and made aware of how any changes to their status will affect them. this legislation would require hospitals to provide meaningful written and oral notification to patients who are in the hospital ``under observation'' for more than 24 hours. while this does not solve all the problems regarding cost-sharing and access to snf coverage, it is an important step to ensuring medicare beneficiaries have access to information about their care. clearly understanding their admission status will help patients, and their caregivers, better plan treatment options with their health care providers. again, thank you for your continued work to protect medicare beneficiaries. if you have any questions, please contact me, or have your staff contact ariel gonzalez, director of federal health and family. sincerely, joyce a. rogers, senior vice president, government affairs. ____ american health care association, washington, dc, february 11, 2015. hon. lloyd doggett, rayburn house office building, washington, dc. congressman doggett: i serve as the president and chief executive officer of ahca/ncal, the nation's largest association of long term and post-acute care providers. the association advocates for quality care and services for the frail, elderly, and individuals with disabilities. our members provide essential care to millions of individuals in more than 12,000 not for profit and for profit member facilities. ahca/ncal, its affiliates, and member providers advocate for the continuing vitality of the long term care provider community. we are committed to developing and advocating for public policies that support quality care and quality of life for our nation's most vulnerable. therefore, we are in support of the legislation, notice of observation treatment and implication for care eligibility (notice) act, that you and congressman todd young (r-in-9) have introduced again this congress. the notice act requires hospitals to give formal notice to patients within a period of time after classifying them as an inpatient or as an outpatient under observation. more specifically, the legislation works to ensure that hospitals notify patients entitled to medicare part a coverage of their outpatient status within 36 hours after the time of their classification or, if sooner, upon discharge. often times, patients have no idea what their status is in a hospital or the importance of it. this can lead to thousands of dollars in out-of-pocket medical expenses should they need skilled nursing center care following their hospital stay. the observation stays issue is a financial burden on seniors and their families. it can cause unnecessary spend-down, accelerating the time frame in which seniors will have to turn to programs such as medicaid to pay for their care. this legislation is a positive step forward, and raises attention to a complex and critical issue hurting the nation's seniors. ahca/ncal applauds congressmen doggett and young for serving as champions for seniors and those individuals who need our services the most. sincerely, mark parkinson, ahca/ncal president & ceo. mr. doggett. mr. speaker, i also appreciate the help we have received from the center for medicare advocacy. they have had reports, again, from people all over the country being placed in this situation. the hospitals may act in the best interests of a patient's health but not always in the best interest of the patient's pocketbook. the notice act will equip patients and their loved ones with the knowledge that they need to be effective advocates and avoid crippling financial repercussions. mr. speaker, i reserve the balance of my time. mr. ryan of wisconsin. mr. speaker, may i inquire of the gentleman from texas if they have any other speakers? we are prepared to close. mr. doggett. i have one speaker on the way. if you are prepared to close and he is not arriving, then we will close. do you have any other speakers? mr. ryan of wisconsin. i will just say a few things. i yield myself such time as i may consume, mr. speaker. this is basically common sense. what is happening is people on medicare are going to the hospital. they don't know what their status is, whether they are considered inpatient or outpatient. as far as they are concerned, it is the same thing. the problem is they are being declared one or the other, unbeknownst to them, and that has a huge difference in the billing that they receive. so what this bill simply says is you will know your status so that you can make an informed decision as a patient in a hospital, because there are huge financial implications to that status. this is very simple. it is good government. i reserve the balance of my time. mr. doggett. mr. speaker, i yield myself 15 seconds and will welcome my colleague, joe courtney, who has long sought to respond legislatively to protect health care consumers from the financial pain of this observation status. while the passage of the notice act is an important step, representative courtney has an improving access to medicare coverage act that would treat observation stays the same as inpatient stays. i support his legislation as he has supported, from the beginning, this initiative, and i appreciate his leadership. mr. speaker, i yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from connecticut (mr. courtney). mr. courtney. mr. speaker, i want to, first of all, salute congressman doggett for his effort in terms of bringing this legislation forward. as the chairman of the committee said, this is really about giving patients a fighting chance to challenge this

h1646]] can be tens of thousands of dollars, which is where long-term care facilities, nursing home coverage for private-pay patients, out-of- pocket patients, exist today. this bill at least gives

Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 284) to amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to require State licensure and bid surety bonds for entities submitting bids under the Medicare durable medical equipment, prosthetics, orthotics, and supplies (DMEPOS) competitive acquisition program, and for other purposes, as amended. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The text of the bill is as follows: H.R. 284 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. This Act may be cited as the ``Medicare DMEPOS Competitive Bidding Improvement Act of 2015''. SEC. 2. REQUIRING BID SURETY BONDS AND STATE LICENSURE FOR ENTITIES SUBMITTING BIDS UNDER THE MEDICARE DMEPOS COMPETITIVE ACQUISITION PROGRAM. (a) Bid Surety Bonds.--Section 1847(a)(1) of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1395w-3(a)(1)) is amended by adding at the end the following new subparagraphs: ``(G) Requiring bid bonds for bidding entities.--With respect to rounds of competitions beginning under this subsection for contracts beginning not earlier than January 1, 2017, and not later than January 1, 2019, an entity may not submit a bid for a competitive acquisition area unless, as of the deadline for bid submission, the entity has obtained (and provided the Secretary with proof of having obtained) a bid surety bond (in this paragraph referred to as a `bid bond') in a form specified by the Secretary consistent with subparagraph (H) and in an amount that is not less than $50,000 and not more than $100,000 for each competitive acquisition area in which the entity submits the bid. ``(H) Treatment of bid bonds submitted.-- ``(i) For bidders that submit bids at or below the median and are offered but do not accept the contract.--In the case of a bidding entity that is offered a contract for any product category for a competitive acquisition area, if-- ``(I) the entity's composite bid for such product category and area was at or below the median composite bid rate for all bidding entities included in the calculation of the single payment amounts for such product category and area; and ``(II) the entity does not accept the contract offered for such product category and area, the bid bond submitted by such entity for such area shall be forfeited by the entity and the Secretary shall collect on it. ``(ii) Treatment of other bidders.--In the case of a bidding entity for any product category for a competitive acquisition area, if the entity does not meet the bid forfeiture conditions in subclauses (I) and (II) of clause (i) for any product category for such area, the bid bond submitted by such entity for such area shall be returned within 90 days of the public announcement of the contract suppliers for such area.''. (b) State Licensure.-- (1) In general.--Section 1847(b)(2)(A) of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1395w-3(b)(2)(A)) is amended by adding at the end the following new clause: ``(v) The entity meets applicable State licensure requirements.''.

(c) GAO Report on Bid Bond Impact on Small Suppliers.-- (1) Study.--The Comptroller General of the United States shall conduct a study that evaluates the effect of the bid surety bond requirement under the amendment made by subsection (a) on the participation of small suppliers in the Medicare DMEPOS competitive acquisition program under section 1847 of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1395w-3). (2) Report.--Not later than 6 months after the date contracts are first awarded subject to such bid surety bond requirement, the Comptroller General shall submit to Congress a report on the study conducted under paragraph (1). Such report shall include recommendations for changes in such requirement in order to ensure robust participation by legitimate small suppliers in the Medicare DMEPOS competition acquisition program. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. Ryan) and the gentlewoman from California (Ms. Linda T. Sanchez) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Wisconsin. General Leave Mr. RYAN of Wisconsin. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous material on H.R. 284, currently under consideration. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Wisconsin? There was no objection. Mr. RYAN of Wisconsin. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I simply want to, again, commend our committee, Republicans and Democrats, for working on a bipartisan basis to fix a problem in the Medicare Program that needs fixing. I want to specifically highlight Mr. Tiberi, a senior member of our committee from Ohio, along with Mr. Larson, a senior member of the committee from the Democratic side of the aisle, for working together to fix a very deep flaw in a competitive bidding system which needs a lot of work to be improved. At this time, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Tiberi) for the purpose of describing and explaining the need for this legislation. Mr. TIBERI. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, for your support of H.R. 284, the Medicare Competitive Bidding Improvement Act which, as you said, I introduced with my friend and colleague from Connecticut, Mr. John Larson. The bill does fix a fundamental flaw in the Medicare durable medical equipment Competitive Bidding Program by simply requiring that bids be binding. It will promote fairer competition. More importantly, it protects our seniors and supports small businesses. [[Page H1647]] DME includes items like home oxygen, blood sugar monitors, and walkers for seniors. The Competitive Bidding Program was intended to reduce out-of-pocket costs for these seniors. However, over the last several years, it has become very clear, Mr. Speaker, that the bidding process is extremely flawed, in large part because the bids are not binding. This encourages low-ball bidding--or suicide bidding--which artificially drives down prices and will eventually lead to market failure because there is no performance on many of these bids, meaning seniors don't get their equipment. I have heard from seniors, beneficiaries, and small business suppliers in my State of Ohio that the program is impeding access to needed items for seniors, like the ones I just described, ultimately harming their health and making costs more expensive for our seniors and the program itself. This is absolutely unacceptable. The goal of the bill is to reduce the number of bad actors who are now participating in the program by simply imposing a penalty if the supplier who wins the bid doesn't accept the contract to the bid they won. The bill will help ensure that these suppliers submit bids in good faith, creating more certainty for those suppliers, and, most importantly, making sure that seniors get the supplies and the equipment that they need and qualify for, increasing access to more quality products and services at the end of the process. If this bill is signed into law, seniors across the country will no longer have to worry about whether the company in their area will provide the information and, more importantly, the equipment to which they bid on and actually be able to provide that wheelchair, walker, or oxygen tank that that senior so desperately needs. As the chairman of the Ways and Means Committee mentioned, the bill has bipartisan support. It is a commonsense bill that actually passed the Ways and Means Committee unanimously. It was scored by the Congressional Budget Office to actually save taxpayer dollars over the next 10 years. I encourage my colleagues to support the bill, and I thank Mr. Larson for his partnership. Ms. LINDA T. SANCHEZ of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I know that this legislation has been in the works by Representatives Tiberi and my good friend Mr. Larson from the State of Connecticut. Unfortunately, he could not be here to speak on his own bill due to unforeseen circumstances, so I am but a poor fill-in for Mr. Larson. The bill is a commonsense bill that will save a lot of money. The durable medical equipment Competitive Bidding Program has reduced well- documented overpayments to DME providers. It is estimated that it would result in $42 billion in savings over a 10-year period, with $26 billion in savings for the Federal Government and more than $17 billion in out-of-pocket savings for beneficiaries themselves. This legislation, as I mentioned, was introduced in the Ways and Means Committee by Representatives Tiberi and Larson. What they are essentially trying to get at is the issue of low-ball bidders, and what this legislation would do is require bonds for companies who wish to participate in the program. The Ways and Means Committee did pass this bill out of the committee on a unanimous voice vote, and I, as well, support its passage. I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 284 as a commonsense solution that will save money in the long run. I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. RYAN of Wisconsin. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time to say the gentlewoman understates the point. She is a perfectly fine fill-in for Mr. Larson. I congratulate my colleagues on the committee for seeing a problem and rushing to fix this problem. This is what we are supposed to do here. We are legislating a solution to make sure that senior citizens have access to the highest quality, lowest price durable medical equipment. There is a flaw in the law in how that is being done, and this bill rectifies that. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. Ryan) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 284, as amended. The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 44 (Monday, March 16, 2015)] [House] [Pages H1646-H1647] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] MEDICARE DMEPOS COMPETITIVE BIDDING IMPROVEMENT ACT OF 2015 Mr. RYAN of Wisconsin.

The text of the bill is as follows: H.R. 284 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. This Act may be cited as the ``Medicare DMEPOS Competitive Bidding Improvement Act of 2015''. SEC. 2. REQUIRING BID SURETY BONDS AND STATE LICENSURE FOR ENTITIES SUBMITTING BIDS UNDER THE MEDICARE DMEPOS COMPETITIVE ACQUISITION PROGRAM. (a) Bid Surety Bonds.--Section 1847(a)(1) of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1395w-3(a)(1)) is amended by adding at the end the following new subparagraphs: ``(G) Requiring bid bonds for bidding entities.--With respect to rounds of competitions beginning under this subsection for contracts beginning not earlier than January 1, 2017, and not later than January 1, 2019, an entity may not submit a bid for a competitive acquisition area unless, as of the deadline for bid submission, the entity has obtained (and provided the Secretary with proof of having obtained) a bid surety bond (in this paragraph referred to as a `bid bond') in a form specified by the Secretary consistent with subparagraph (H) and in an amount that is not less than $50,000 and not more than $100,000 for each competitive acquisition area in which the entity submits the bid. ``(H) Treatment of bid bonds submitted.-- ``(i) For bidders that submit bids at or below the median and are offered but do not accept the contract.--In the case of a bidding entity that is offered a contract for any product category for a competitive acquisition area, if-- ``(I) the entity's composite bid for such product category and area was at or below the median composite bid rate for all bidding entities included in the calculation of the single payment amounts for such product category and area; and ``(II) the entity does not accept the contract offered for such product category and area, the bid bond submitted by such entity for such area shall be forfeited by the entity and the Secretary shall collect on it. ``(ii) Treatment of other bidders.--In the case of a bidding entity for any product category for a competitive acquisition area, if the entity does not meet the bid forfeiture conditions in subclauses (I) and (II) of clause (i) for any product category for such area, the bid bond submitted by such entity for such area shall be returned within 90 days of the public announcement of the contract suppliers for such area.''. (b) State Licensure.-- (1) In general.--Section 1847(b)(2)(A) of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1395w-3(b)(2)(A)) is amended by adding at the end the following new clause: ``(v) The entity meets applicable State licensure requirements.''. (2) Construction.--Nothing in the amendment made by paragraph (1) shall be construed as affecting the authority of the Secretary of Health and Human Services to require State licensure of an entity under the Medicare competitive acquisition program under section 1847 of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1395w-3) before the date of the enactment of this Act. (c) GAO Report on Bid Bond Impact on Small Suppliers.-- (1) Study.--The Comptroller General of the United States shall conduct a study that evaluates the effect of the bid surety bond requirement under the amendment made by subsection (a) on the participation of small suppliers in the Medicare DMEPOS competitive acquisition program under section 1847 of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1395w-3). (2) Report.--Not later than 6 months after the date contracts are first awarded subject to such bid surety bond requirement, the Comptroller General shall submit to Congress a report on the study conducted under paragraph (1). Such report shall include recommendations for changes in such requirement in order to ensure robust participation by legitimate small suppliers in the Medicare DMEPOS competition acquisition program. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. Ryan) and the gentlewoman from California (Ms. Linda T. Sanchez) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Wisconsin. General Leave Mr. RYAN of Wisconsin. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous material on H.R. 284, currently under consideration. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Wisconsin? There was no objection. Mr. RYAN of Wisconsin. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I simply want to, again, commend our committee, Republicans and Democrats, for working on a bipartisan basis to fix a problem in the Medicare Program that needs fixing. I want to specifically highlight Mr. Tiberi, a senior member of our committee from Ohio, along with Mr. Larson, a senior member of the committee from the Democratic side of the aisle, for working together to fix a very deep flaw in a competitive bidding system which needs a lot of work to be improved. At this time, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Tiberi) for the purpose of describing and explaining the need for this legislation. Mr. TIBERI. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, for your support of H.R. 284, the Medicare Competitive Bidding Improvement Act which, as you said, I introduced with my friend and colleague from Connecticut, Mr. John Larson. The bill does fix a fundamental flaw in the Medicare durable medical equipment Competitive Bidding Program by simply requiring that bids be binding. It will promote fairer competition. More importantly, it protects our seniors and supports small businesses. [[Page H1647]] DME includes items like home oxygen, blood sugar monitors, and walkers for seniors. The Competitive Bidding Program was intended to reduce out-of-pocket costs for these seniors. However, over the last several years, it has become very clear, Mr. Speaker, that the bidding process is extremely flawed, in large part because the bids are not binding. This encourages low-ball bidding--or suicide bidding--which artificially drives down prices and will eventually lead to market failure because there is no performance on many of these bids, meaning seniors don't get their equipment. I have heard from seniors, beneficiaries, and small business suppliers in my State of Ohio that the program is impeding access to needed items for seniors, like the ones I just described, ultimately harming their health and making costs more expensive for our seniors and the program itself. This is absolutely unacceptable. The goal of the bill is to reduce the number of bad actors who are now participating in the program by simply imposing a penalty if the supplier who wins the bid doesn't accept the contract to the bid they won. The bill will help ensure that these suppliers submit bids in good faith, creating more certainty for those suppliers, and, most importantly, making sure that seniors get the supplies and the equipment that they need and qualify for, increasing access to more quality products and services at the end of the process. If this bill is signed into law, seniors across the country will no longer have to worry about whether the company in their area will provide the information and, more importantly, the equipment to which they bid on and actually be able to provide that wheelchair, walker, or oxygen tank that that senior so desperately needs. As the chairman of the Ways and Means Committee mentioned, the bill has bipartisan support. It is a commonsense bill that actually passed the Ways and Means Committee unanimously. It was scored by the Congressional Budget Office to actually save taxpayer dollars over the next 10 years. I encourage my colleagues to support the bill, and I thank Mr. Larson for his partnership. Ms. LINDA T. SANCHEZ of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I know that this legislation has been in the works by Representatives Tiberi and my good friend Mr. Larson from the State of Connecticut. Unfortunately, he could not be here to speak on his own bill due to unforeseen circumstances, so I am but a poor fill-in for Mr. Larson. The bill is a commonsense bill that will save a lot of money. The durable medical equipment Competitive Bidding Program has reduced well- documented overpayments to DME providers. It is estimated that it would result in $42 billion in savings over a 10-year period, with $26 billion in savings for the Federal Government and more than $17 billion in out-of-pocket savings for beneficiaries themselves. This legislation, as I mentioned, was introduced in the Ways and Means Committee by Representatives Tiberi and Larson. What they are essentially trying to get at is the issue of low-ball bidders, and what this legislation would do is require bonds for companies who wish to participate in the program. The Ways and Means Committee did pass this bill out of the committee on a unanimous voice vote, and I, as well, support its passage. I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 284 as a commonsense solution that will save money in the long run. I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. RYAN of Wisconsin. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time to say the gentlewoman understates the point. She is a perfectly fine fill-in for Mr. Larson. I congratulate my colleagues on the committee for seeing a problem and rushing to fix this problem. This is what we are supposed to do here. We are legislating a solution to make sure that senior citizens have access to the highest quality, lowest price durable medical equipment. There is a flaw in the law in how that is being done, and this bill rectifies that. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. Ryan) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 284, as amended. The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. ____________________","Congressional Record, Volume 161 Issue 44 (Monday, March 16, 2015) [Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 44 (Monday, March 16, 2015)] [House] [Pages H1646-H1647] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] MEDICARE DMEPOS COMPETITIVE BIDDING IMPROVEMENT ACT OF 2015 Mr. RYAN of Wisconsin.

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Wisconsin? There was no objection. Mr. RYAN of Wisconsin. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. This is a very commonsense bill aimed at protecting our volunteer firefighters across America. I want to congratulate the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Barletta) for bringing this issue to our attention. It is something that he, as a former mayor, is very familiar with. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Barletta) for the purposes of explaining his bill. [[Page H1648]] Mr. BARLETTA. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of my bill, H.R. 1191, the Protecting Volunteer Firefighters and Emergency Responders Act. I had hoped by now that we would not have to be on the floor of this body talking about my legislation once again. This is the third time I have brought this bill to the floor of the House. It is intended to protect volunteer firefighters and emergency services personnel from ObamaCare. The first two times I introduced it, it passed the House by a combined vote of 811-0. I know that there are very few pieces of legislation that attract such amazing bipartisan support, and for that, I thank my colleagues on both sides of the aisle. Today, I come asking for your support again. Let me tell you why this bill is necessary. In 2013, a firefighter from back home named Bob Timko approached me at a parade in Mechanicsburg, Pennsylvania. He told me about a serious problem regarding volunteer firefighters and the Affordable Care Act, or ACA. Because the Internal Revenue Service specifically considered volunteer firefighters employees for Federal tax purposes, there was the fear that they would fall under the employer mandate of the ACA. If volunteer fire companies were subject to the employer mandate, they could be liable for crippling new health care costs, causing many to have to close their doors. Mr. Speaker, as we all know, the threshold for the employer mandate is 50 employees. That raised the question of how volunteer firefighters would be counted. Would they be counted as employees just under the fire company, or would they be counted as municipal employees? If that were the case, many volunteer fire companies could easily achieve 50 employees. If they did, these companies could be forced to pay health insurance costs for their volunteers or pay a fine. This is very important in my home State of Pennsylvania. Ninety-seven percent of our fire companies depend either mostly or entirely on volunteers. Across the country, 87 percent of fire companies depend on volunteers. As a former mayor, I can tell you that volunteer firefighters are part of the essential fabric of our communities. These are people who risk their lives every day to protect their friends, families, and people they don't even know. I can tell you that no one becomes a volunteer firefighter because they want health insurance. While they are on duty, they are, of course, covered by workman's compensation insurance. Our volunteer firefighters have a hard enough time raising money needed for basic equipment. They cannot afford to pay for health insurance--or pay a fine--on top of it. Last year, the IRS finally decided--after months of pressure from Members of the House, from firefighters, and from the media--that they will not consider volunteer firefighters ``employees'' for Federal tax purposes, but I don't think we should leave something as important as public safety in the hands of unelected bureaucrats at the IRS. Our brave volunteer emergency personnel deserve certainty. As I said, this is the third time we have had this bill before this body. The first time, in 2014, it passed the House of Representatives 410-0. When it got to the Senate, they used it to attach unrelated language about emergency unemployment insurance. The bill died. The second time, just earlier this year, it passed the House of Representatives 401-0. This time, the Senate stripped all of my language out of the bill. It got turned into a 1-week funding measure for the Department of Homeland Security. This is a bill that deserves to become law. This legislation has the strong support of the National Volunteer Fire Council, the International Association of Fire Chiefs, and the Congressional Fire Services Institute. I appreciate their support and the work of all the men and women they represent who protect us every day in our hometowns. We all agree that public safety is too important of an issue to play politics with. Mr. Speaker, I urge passage of this bill, and I ask all Members to vote ``yes.'' Ms. LINDA T. SANCHEZ of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I am heartened that my Republican colleagues are acting on legislation to improve the Affordable Care Act, rather than to simply repeal it. Technical corrections have long been part of the legislative process for such fundamental pieces of legislation, and this bill does the same. Volunteer first responders are absolutely critical to the safety and security of communities across the country. Seventy percent of all firefighters across the country are volunteers. For the communities aided by volunteer first responders, the services donated annually by these volunteers are estimated to be worth more than $140 billion. This legislation allows communities to continue to benefit for the time and commitment of our firefighters and other first responders. {time} 1700 Treasury has responded to the concerns that Mr. Barletta and many other Members raised through their final regulations. But this legislation makes permanent the reasonable solution that the administration put forward. Mr. Speaker, I will insert into the Record a letter from the Department of the Treasury specifically outlining the regulations that address those concerns. This bill is bipartisan, and it is noncontroversial. It, as I said, codifies a regulation that has already been issued by the administration. I urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I yield back the balance of my time. Department of the Treasury, Washington, DC, January 10, 2014. Hon. Steve Israel, House of Representatives, Washington, DC. Dear Representative Israel: I am writing regarding your interest in how the employer shared responsibility provisions of the Affordable Care Act will apply to volunteer firefighters and volunteer emergency medical personnel. In particular, you have urged the Treasury Department to consider not requiring the volunteer hours of these personnel to be counted in determining an employer's full-time employees or full-time equivalent employees for purposes of the employer shared responsibility rules. We appreciate your efforts and leadership on behalf of the volunteer emergency responder community, and want to assure you that we share your concern that emergency volunteer service be accorded appropriate treatment. Treasury and the IRS issued proposed regulations providing guidance on the employer shared responsibility provisions under section 4980H of the Internal Revenue Code (Code) in December 2012 and invited public comments. Numerous comments were received from individuals and local fire and EMS departments that rely on volunteers, from the International Association of Fire Chiefs (IAFC), and from Members of Congress. The comments generally suggested that the final employer responsibility rules not count volunteer hours of nominally compensated volunteer firefighters and emergency medical personnel in determining an employer's full-time employees or full-time equivalent employees. Treasury and the IRS carefully reviewed those comments and spoke with IAFC representatives to gain a better understanding of the specific issues presented by volunteer firefighters and volunteer emergency personnel under the employer responsibility provisions. Treasury and the IRS also reviewed pertinent rules that apply to such volunteer personnel under other laws. These include the statutory provisions applicable to bona fide volunteers for different purposes under Code section 457(e)(11) (relating to deferred compensation plans of state and local governments and tax- exempt organizations) and rules governing the treatment of volunteers for purposes of the wage and hour laws. As a result of that review and further analysis concerning the appropriate treatment of volunteer firefighters and volunteer emergency personnel under section 4980H, the forthcoming final regulations generally will pot require volunteer hours of bona fide volunteer firefighters and volunteer emergency medical personnel at governmental entities or tax-exempt organizations to be counted when determining an employer's full-time employees or full-time equivalent employees. The forthcoming final regulations, which we expect to be issued very shortly, should provide timely guidance for the volunteer emergency responder community. Under the transition relief announced by Treasury in July of 2013, no employer shared responsibility payments will be assessed for 2014; such payments will be assessed only for 2015 and subsequent years (see IRS Notice 2013-45). I hope this information is helpful. And thank you for the important insights you have provided with this issue. If you have [[Page H1649]] any questions, please contact me, or ask a member of your staff to contact Sandra Salstrom at 202-622-1900. Sincerely, Alastair M. Fitzpayne, Assistant Secretary for Legislative Affairs. Mr. RYAN of Wisconsin. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time. I want to thank Mr. Barletta for bringing this to our attention. This is a problem with the law and, therefore, the law needs to change. It is insufficient that we have some regulatory forbearance from the administrative branch because the law has to be changed, and that is why this legislation is necessary. Again, I just wanted to thank Mr. Barletta for his leadership on this issue. We need to do right by our volunteer firefighters, and this does that. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. COURTNEY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 284. I have heard from many stakeholders in eastern Connecticut about this issue, and believe that this bill is a commonsense approach to making needed improvements to the competitive bidding process for durable medical equipment, prosthetics, orthotics, and supplies. Requiring bidding entities to meet state licensure requirements in product category areas and obtaining reasonable bid surety bonds for each area are sensible prerequisites to improving the competitive acquisition program. Requiring vendor bidders to be licensed, means that they have attained basic standards of education and training, which patients can rely on. These reforms will ensure that the competitive DME bidding process produces a more stable supply chain of life saving equipment for Medicare patients. I am proud to support this legislation, and urge bipartisan support for this bill today. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. Ryan) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 1191, as amended. The question was taken. The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the opinion of the Chair, two-thirds being in the affirmative, the ayes have it. Mr. BARLETTA. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays. The yeas and nays were ordered. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further proceedings on this motion will be postponed. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 44 (Monday, March 16, 2015)] [House] [Pages H1647-H1649] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] PROTECTING VOLUNTEER FIREFIGHTERS AND EMERGENCY RESPONDERS ACT Mr. RYAN of Wisconsin.

We all agree that public safety is too important of an issue to play politics with. Mr. Speaker, I urge passage of this bill, and I ask all Members to vote ``yes.'' Ms. LINDA T. SANCHEZ of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I am heartened that my Republican colleagues are acting on legislation to improve the Affordable Care Act, rather than to simply repeal it. Technical corrections have long been part of the legislative process for such fundamental pieces of legislation, and this bill does the same. Volunteer first responders are absolutely critical to the safety and security of communities across the country. Seventy percent of all firefighters across the country are volunteers. For the communities aided by volunteer first responders, the services donated annually by these volunteers are estimated to be worth more than $140 billion. This legislation allows communities to continue to benefit for the time and commitment of our firefighters and other first responders. {time} 1700 Treasury has responded to the concerns that Mr. Barletta and many other Members raised through their final regulations. But this legislation makes permanent the reasonable solution that the administration put forward. Mr. Speaker, I will insert into the Record a letter from the Department of the Treasury specifically outlining the regulations that address those concerns. This bill is bipartisan, and it is noncontroversial. It, as I said, codifies a regulation that has already been issued by the administration. I urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I yield back the balance of my time. Department of the Treasury, Washington, DC, January 10, 2014. Hon. Steve Israel, House of Representatives, Washington, DC. Dear Representative Israel: I am writing regarding your interest in how the employer shared responsibility provisions of the Affordable Care Act will apply to volunteer firefighters and volunteer emergency medical personnel. In particular, you have urged the Treasury Department to consider not requiring the volunteer hours of these personnel to be counted in determining an employer's full-time employees or full-time equivalent employees for purposes of the employer shared responsibility rules. We appreciate your efforts and leadership on behalf of the volunteer emergency responder community, and want to assure you that we share your concern that emergency volunteer service be accorded appropriate treatment. Treasury and the IRS issued proposed regulations providing guidance on the employer shared responsibility provisions under section 4980H of the Internal Revenue Code (Code) in December 2012 and invited public comments. Numerous comments were received from individuals and local fire and EMS departments that rely on volunteers, from the International Association of Fire Chiefs (IAFC), and from Members of Congress. The comments generally suggested that the final employer responsibility rules not count volunteer hours of nominally compensated volunteer firefighters and emergency medical personnel in determining an employer's full-time employees or full-time equivalent employees. Treasury and the IRS carefully reviewed those comments and spoke with IAFC representatives to gain a better understanding of the specific issues presented by volunteer firefighters and volunteer emergency personnel under the employer responsibility provisions. Treasury and the IRS also reviewed pertinent rules that apply to such volunteer personnel under other laws. These include the statutory provisions applicable to bona fide volunteers for different purposes under Code section 457(e)(11) (relating to deferred compensation plans of state and local governments and tax- exempt organizations) and rules governing the treatment of volunteers for purposes of the wage and hour laws. As a result of that review and further analysis concerning the appropriate treatment of volunteer firefighters and volunteer emergency personnel under section 4980H, the forthcoming final regulations generally will pot require volunteer hours of bona fide volunteer firefighters and volunteer emergency medical personnel at governmental entities or tax-exempt organizations to be counted when determining an employer's full-time employees or full-time equivalent employees. The forthcoming final regulations, which we expect to be issued very shortly, should provide timely guidance for the volunteer emergency responder community. Under the transition relief announced by Treasury in July of 2013, no employer shared responsibility payments will be assessed for 2014; such payments will be assessed only for 2015 and subsequent years (see IRS Notice 2013-45). I hope this information is helpful. And thank you for the important insights you have provided with this issue. If you have [[Page H1649]] any questions, please contact me, or ask a member of your staff to contact Sandra Salstrom at 202-622-1900. Sincerely, Alastair M. Fitzpayne, Assistant Secretary for Legislative Affairs. Mr. RYAN of Wisconsin. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time. I want to thank Mr. Barletta for bringing this to our attention. This is a problem with the law and, therefore, the law needs to change. It is insufficient that we have some regulatory forbearance from the administrative branch because the law has to be changed, and that is why this legislation is necessary. Again, I just wanted to thank Mr. Barletta for his leadership on this issue. We need to do right by our volunteer firefighters, and this does that. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. COURTNEY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 284. I have heard from many stakeholders in eastern Connecticut about this issue, and believe that this bill is a commonsense approach to making needed improvements to the competitive bidding process for durable medical equipment, prosthetics, orthotics, and supplies. Requiring bidding entities to meet state licensure requirements in product category areas and obtaining reasonable bid surety bonds for each area are sensible prerequisites to improving the competitive acquisition program. Requiring vendor bidders to be licensed, means that they have attained basic standards of education and training, which patients can rely on. These reforms will ensure that the competitive DME bidding process produces a more stable supply chain of life saving equipment for Medicare patients. I am proud to support this legislation, and urge bipartisan support for this bill today. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. Ryan) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 1191, as amended. The question was taken. The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the opinion of the Chair, two-thirds being in the affirmative, the ayes have it. Mr. BARLETTA. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays. The yeas and nays were ordered. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further proceedings on this motion will be postponed. ____________________",package_114_109.csv,15074,15074,15141,"[congressional record volume 161, number 44 (monday, march 16, 2015)] [house] [pages h1647-h1649] from the congressional record online through the government publishing office [ www.gpo.gov ] protecting volunteer firefighters and emergency responders act mr. ryan of wisconsin. mr. speaker, i move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (h.r. 1191) to amend the internal revenue code of 1986 to ensure that emergency services volunteers are not taken into account as employees under the shared responsibility requirements contained in the patient protection and affordable care act, as amended. the clerk read the title of the bill. the text of the bill is as follows: h.r. 1191 be it enacted by the senate and house of representatives of the united states of america in congress assembled, section 1. short title. this act may be cited as the ``protecting volunteer firefighters and emergency responders act''. sec. 2. emergency services, government, and certain nonprofit volunteers. (a) in general.--section 4980h(c) of the internal revenue code of 1986 is amended by redesignating paragraphs (5), (6), and (7) as paragraphs (6), (7), and (8), respectively, and by inserting after paragraph (4) the following new paragraph: ``(5) special rules for certain emergency services, government, and nonprofit volunteers.-- ``(a) emergency services volunteers.--qualified services rendered as a bona fide volunteer to an eligible employer shall not be taken into account under this section as service provided by an employee. for purposes of the preceding sentence, the terms `qualified services', `bona fide volunteer', and `eligible employer' shall have the respective meanings given such terms under section 457(e). ``(b) certain other government and nonprofit volunteers.-- ``(i) in general.--services rendered as a bona fide volunteer to a specified employer shall not be taken into account under this section as service provided by an employee. ``(ii) bona fide volunteer.--for purposes of this subparagraph, the term `bona fide volunteer' means an employee of a specified employer whose only compensation from such employer is in the form of-- ``(i) reimbursement for (or reasonable allowance for) reasonable expenses incurred in the performance of services by volunteers, or ``(ii) reasonable benefits (including length of service awards), and nominal fees, customarily paid by similar entities in connection with the performance of services by volunteers. ``(iii) specified employer.--for purposes of this subparagraph, the term `specified employer' means-- ``(i) any government entity, and ``(ii) any organization described in section 501(c) and exempt from tax under section 501(a). ``(iv) coordination with subparagraph (a).--this subparagraph shall not fail to apply with respect to services merely because such services are qualified services (as defined in section 457(e)(11)(c)).''. (b) effective date.--the amendments made by this section shall apply to months beginning after december 31, 2013. the speaker pro tempore. pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from wisconsin (mr. ryan) and the gentlewoman from california (ms. linda t. sanchez) each will control 20 minutes. the chair recognizes the gentleman from wisconsin. general leave mr. ryan of wisconsin. mr. speaker, i ask unanimous consent that all members may have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous material on h.r. 1191, currently under consideration. the speaker pro tempore. is there objection to the request of the gentleman from wisconsin? there was no objection. mr. ryan of wisconsin. mr. speaker, i yield myself such time as i may consume. this is a very commonsense bill aimed at protecting our volunteer firefighters across america. i want to congratulate the gentleman from pennsylvania (mr. barletta) for bringing this issue to our attention. it is something that he, as a former mayor, is very familiar with. mr. speaker, i yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from pennsylvania (mr. barletta) for the purposes of explaining his bill. [[page h1648]] mr. barletta. mr. speaker, i rise today in support of my bill, h.r. 1191, the protecting volunteer firefighters and emergency responders act. i had hoped by now that we would not have to be on the floor of this body talking about my legislation once again. this is the third time i have brought this bill to the floor of the house. it is intended to protect volunteer firefighters and emergency services personnel from obamacare. the first two times i introduced it, it passed the house by a combined vote of 811-0. i know that there are very few pieces of legislation that attract such amazing bipartisan support, and for that, i thank my colleagues on both sides of the aisle. today, i come asking for your support again. let me tell you why this bill is necessary. in 2013, a firefighter from back home named bob timko approached me at a parade in mechanicsburg, pennsylvania. he told me about a serious problem regarding volunteer firefighters and the affordable care act, or aca. because the internal revenue service specifically considered volunteer firefighters employees for federal tax purposes, there was the fear that they would fall under the employer mandate of the aca. if volunteer fire companies were subject to the employer mandate, they could be liable for crippling new health care costs, causing many to have to close their doors. mr. speaker, as we all know, the threshold for the employer mandate is 50 employees. that raised the question of how volunteer firefighters would be counted. would they be counted as employees just under the fire company, or would they be counted as municipal employees? if that were the case, many volunteer fire companies could easily achieve 50 employees. if they did, these companies could be forced to pay health insurance costs for their volunteers or pay a fine. this is very important in my home state of pennsylvania. ninety-seven percent of our fire companies depend either mostly or entirely on volunteers. across the country, 87 percent of fire companies depend on volunteers. as a former mayor, i can tell you that volunteer firefighters are part of the essential fabric of our communities. these are people who risk their lives every day to protect their friends, families, and people they don't even know. i can tell you that no one becomes a volunteer firefighter because they want health insurance. while they are on duty, they are, of course, covered by workman's compensation insurance. our volunteer firefighters have a hard enough time raising money needed for basic equipment. they cannot afford to pay for health insurance--or pay a fine--on top of it. last year, the irs finally decided--after months of pressure from members of the house, from firefighters, and from the media--that they will not consider volunteer firefighters ``employees'' for federal tax purposes, but i don't think we should leave something as important as public safety in the hands of unelected bureaucrats at the irs. our brave volunteer emergency personnel deserve certainty. as i said, this is the third time we have had this bill before this body. the first time, in 2014, it passed the house of representatives 410-0. when it got to the senate, they used it to attach unrelated language about emergency unemployment insurance. the bill died. the second time, just earlier this year, it passed the house of representatives 401-0. this time, the senate stripped all of my language out of the bill. it got turned into a 1-week funding measure for the department of homeland security. this is a bill that deserves to become law. this legislation has the strong support of the national volunteer fire council, the international association of fire chiefs, and the congressional fire services institute. i appreciate their support and the work of all the men and women they represent who protect us every day in our hometowns. we all agree that public safety is too important of an issue to play politics with. mr. speaker, i urge passage of this bill, and i ask all members to vote ``yes.'' ms. linda t. sanchez of california. mr. speaker, i yield myself such time as i may consume. mr.

He came under enemy fire from all sides on Iwo Jima when his amphibious tank was disabled, causing him and his partner, Charlie, to evacuate on foot. The two escaped unharmed, earning them the nickname ``rain- walkers.'' If they could survive that kind of heavy fire, they could surely walk through rain without getting wet. On Iwo Jima, Keep cleared out huge tunnels that were used by the enemy to launch attacks on the Marines, and he helped carry a fellow marine who was injured back to the beach. He told him: ``You're getting off this rock. I'll trade places with you.'' Jimmy Keep is a true hero. I ask all my colleagues to join me in honoring Malcolm James ``Jimmy'' Keep for his service and bravery as a marine with the 4th Marine Division during the Pacific campaigns in World War II.

Under the Speaker's announced policy of January 6, 2015, the gentlewoman from Illinois (Ms. Kelly) is recognized for 60 minutes as the designee of the minority leader. General Leave Ms. KELLY of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members be given 5 days to revise and extend their remarks. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentlewoman from Illinois? There was no objection. Ms. KELLY of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, it is an honor and a privilege to be before you this evening on the heels of our Nation's recognizing the 50th anniversary of the Selma marchers which tore down many obstructive barriers to voting for African Americans and which led to the passage of the Voting Rights Act of 1965. We have grown as a nation since the night Jimmie Lee Jackson was murdered peacefully marching for voting rights in Alabama, and we are not the America we were when Mamie Till made the world see what had been done to her baby. But we are still living in dynamic times for our democracy. Selma has changed, but the issues of Ferguson, Missouri, remain. Nearly 60 years after Emmett Till was buried, Black mothers still worry about the value of their son's lives when they leave home. We are reminded of this every time we look into the eyes of Trayvon Martin's mother. We are better today than we were then, [[Page H1654]] and the changes we made to our laws paved our path to prosperity. The President spoke of this in Selma, and Republicans and Democrats alike were united in our feeling that we must uphold the promise of the Nation we inherited because of Selma. {time} 1930 The U.S. Senate should vote to confirm very qualified and exceptional U.S. Attorney Loretta Lynch as the next Attorney General. The CBC devoted an hour of floor testimony last month in defense of her confirmation, but in her role as Attorney General, Loretta Lynch will be tasked with defending the Federal laws that protect the right to vote, and that brings us to our topic this evening. Tonight's Congressional Black Caucus Special Order hour is entitled: ``The Battle Wages On: Securing Equal Voting Rights in the United States.'' This topic is truly timely. This conversation needs to take place now. Work remains to secure equal voting rights in the United States. Actions like the Supreme Court's decision to gut the Voting Rights Act remind us that the equality that should exist at the ballot is still lacking and why I dream of a day when the Voting Rights Act is no longer necessary. The truth is that voter discrimination and suppression remain as tragic legacies of our past. In the past few years, many States have introduced restrictive legislation that diminishes an individual's access to the voting booth. The Justice Department may have the tools to fix this problem and go after places that are discriminating against certain voters. In some places, getting a voter ID that you can use to vote can cost up to $150, and that can be a burden for someone who is on a fixed income and not driving anymore and doesn't have a license. Discriminatory laws and policies that hamper access to the ballot box are reasons that the protections and the Voting Rights Act are necessary. The VRA must remain intact as its principles are powerful democratic agents that make our Union more perfect. With that, I would like to kick off this Special Order hour by yielding to my colleague and anchor, a man who has dedicated his life to the issues of justice in America--a lawyer, judge, and statesman who has defended voting rights--the chairman of the Congressional Black Caucus, the Honorable G.K. Butterfield of North Carolina. Mr. BUTTERFIELD. Thank you very much, Congresswoman Kelly. Thank you for your leadership, and thank you for what you mean to the Congressional Black Caucus. The Congressional Black Caucus is now the largest caucus in our history. We are very proud to announce that we have 46 members now in CBC, representing more than 30 million people from 23 States, in addition to the District of Columbia and the Virgin Islands, so I am delighted that you have taken this responsibility each week, Ms. Kelly, to come to the floor and manage this time. Typically, Congressman Donald Payne would be joining Congresswoman Kelly tonight, but Mr. Payne is not able to come to the floor tonight to help with this Special Order due to, what I am told, is complications from foot surgery, so we wish Congressman Payne a very speedy recovery. Ms. Kelly, I wanted to particularly thank you for selecting this subject this evening. This is a very timely conversation that we must have in this Congress, and that is the whole subject of the Voting Rights Act. The topic that you have chosen, ``The Battle Wages On: Securing Equal Voting Rights in the United States,'' is so very appropriate; and, hopefully, in the next 2 or 3 minutes, I want to tell you why. Let me just start by explaining the whole voting rights story. Some of my colleagues may not fully appreciate it and understand that when we talk about voting rights, we just don't talk about 1965. In order to fully appreciate the voting rights history in this country, we must go back to the end of slavery when 4 million slaves became free. They did not have the right to vote. Once the 15th Amendment was added to the Constitution, then all of the former slave men got and obtained the right to vote. They got engaged. They got involved in the political process. From 1870 until 1900, a period of some 30 years, African American males, particularly in the South, were fully engaged in the political process. But do you know what? In 1900, Mr. Speaker, in 1900, that right to vote came to an end. It came to an end because of Southern States like South Carolina, North Carolina, Alabama, Mississippi, and the like, all of these Southern States passed disfranchisement laws, particularly a literacy test. This literacy test had the practical effect of denying the former slaves and their descendants the right to vote. Not only did you have to read and write in order to be able to register to vote, you had to convince the registrar that you were literate. The practical effect of that was that the whole voting rights movement during those days came to an abrupt end in 1901 when Congressman George H. White, who was one of my predecessors in North Carolina, stood on this House floor on March 3, 1901, and made a very profound welfare speech to the Congress. Mr. Speaker, that is the first era of voting rights in this country. The next era, I would say, would be from 1901 to 1965, when African Americans, for the most part, were not allowed to register to vote because of the literacy test and were not meaningfully involved. The next and final phase would be from 1965 until the present. In 1965, this Congress passed a historic 1965 Voting Rights Act, and it was a bipartisan bill. Democrats and Republicans promoted the bill all the way to the finish line with the help of then President Lyndon B. Johnson. The 1965 voting rights, Mr. Speaker, did many great things, but the three things that I will highlight tonight are: Number one, it eliminated the literacy test; number two, it gave a right of action, it gave to African American communities all across the United States the right to bring legal action to file civil lawsuits in Federal court to challenge discriminatory election laws or practices or procedures; the third part of the Voting Rights Act was what we now refer to as section 5. The Congress in 1965 set aside certain States in the country and certain subdivisions within a State to require them to get preclearance before election laws when new election laws went into effect. Many of our Southern States did not like section 5, but it was put on the books for a purpose because, if given the opportunity, these States were going to pass discriminatory election laws that made it very difficult for African Americans to vote. Section 5 has now been on the books since 1965. It has been strongly enforced by the Attorney General. Section 2 has been strongly enforced in courts all across the country. Now, we have 46 African Americans serving in Congress, we have thousands elected at State and local levels all across the country, and it was because of the Voting Rights Act in many respects. Well, Mr. Speaker, we received a great surprise on June 25 of 2013. The U.S. Supreme Court declared that section 5 could not be enforced because the formula that gives life to section 5, which is section 4, the court said that section 4 needed to be updated and called on this Congress to amend section 4 to make it more contemporary in its application. This Congress has failed to act. Now, this is the spring of 2015, and we have failed to act. Our voting rights are under continuous assault with more and more States and counties enacting voting laws that, on their face, appear to not be an impediment to voting. Many of these new laws are discriminatory, I want you to know. Some are intended to be. Others, though not intentional, will have a discriminatory result. In closing, Mr. Speaker, I am just unable to understand why my Republican colleagues refuse to support an amendment to section 5 to make this provision compliant with the Supreme Court decision. Through the years, this Congress has been called upon to extend section 5, and it has done so in a bipartisan way. In 2006, as section 5 was about to expire then, there was a bipartisan bill passed by this Congress, signed by President [[Page H1655]] George W. Bush. There were 192 Republicans who voted for the bill. I want to say that to you again, my colleagues: 192 Republicans voted to extend section 5 just a few years ago. I saluted them then; I salute them now. Sixty-six of those Republicans continue to serve in the House today, including the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, Mr. Goodlatte. Mr. Speaker, we must fix section 5 to comply with the Supreme Court's decision to update the formula. If we continue down this path and if we do nothing, the practical effect will be that jurisdictions will pass election laws or implement election practices or procedures that will discriminate, and we know it, and we must prevent it from happening. The only remedy African American communities have to obtain redress from discriminatory practices will be to file very expensive litigation. In the meantime, the law, the new law goes into effect. If section 5 was in place, there wouldn't be the need for expensive litigation. The jurisdiction would simply be required to make a showing to the Department of Justice, and the Attorney General would determine the effect of the change on minority voting strength. That is the way we have done it for the last 50 years. I call on my Republican colleagues to please join with us in a bipartisan, bicameral effort to fix the formula so that section 5 can be enforced in our country. Thank you, Ms. Kelly. Ms. KELLY of Illinois. Thank you, Congressman Butterfield. It is now my honor to introduce the gentlewoman from Alabama, one that was our gracious host last weekend, and we appreciate everything she did, Terri Sewell. Ms. SEWELL of Alabama. Mr. Speaker, on March 7, 2015, nearly 100 Members of Congress from both sides of the aisle went to Selma to commemorate the 50th anniversary of Bloody Sunday and the 1965 march from Selma to Montgomery. I was humbled to welcome so many of my colleagues in Congress to my hometown of Selma, Alabama. It meant a lot to me and the State of Alabama to also welcome President and Mrs. Obama and their daughters, as well as President and Mrs. George W. Bush to Selma to commemorate the significant events in American history. The Selma movement for voting rights was a uniquely American story of how ordinary Americans working together achieved extraordinary social change. I want to thank all of the Members and everyone who participated in the Faith & Politics pilgrimage to Alabama this year. I especially want to thank my Alabama colleagues--Senator Sessions, Representative Martha Roby, Representative Robert Aderholt, Representative Bradley Byrne, and Representative Gary Palmer--for their participation in the delegation. A special thanks to Congressman John Lewis and the Faith & Politics Institute for a job well done. You know, Mr. Speaker, the opportunity to walk in the footsteps of John Lewis with John Lewis is an unforgettable experience that is truly transformative. The bipartisan participation by Republicans and Democrats alike was truly something to behold, especially given the hyperpartisanship of Washington. It was something to see us gather together in Selma, Alabama, to honor the sacrifices of the foot soldiers who dared to fight for voter equality 50 years ago. I tried not to have any expectation from this bipartisan showing, but I must admit my hope was that all of us would be motivated by the experience of traveling with John Lewis, in his footsteps with him, to honestly look at modern-day threats to voting rights today. Now that the spotlight is no longer on Selma, we must move beyond the bridge and see that there is still a need to fight to ensure that all Americans can participate equally in the political process. New barriers to voting rights have been legitimized in State legislatures across this country. Photo ID laws and efforts nationwide to get rid of early voting or weekend voting are modern-day efforts that have had the profound effect of restricting access to voting. Any effort that restricts or decreases the likelihood of citizens to vote is a threat to the voting rights of all Americans. There is no denying that modern-day laws imposed to ostensibly prevent voter fraud has had the ``unintended consequence'' of making it much harder for certain sectors of the population to vote. My father is a perfect example of an individual who has found it harder to vote because of these modern-day laws. Prior to the State of Alabama imposing a photo ID law to vote, my father, Andrew, a stroke victim who has been wheelchair bound for the last 10 years, had been voting by using his federally issued Social Security card, which does not have a photo; but once the law was imposed, my father--who no longer drives, who no longer works, is retired--had no way of getting a photo ID. After the Alabama law changed, my mother and I made sure that my father would get a photo ID to vote. The effort was tremendous. We transported my father in a special wheelchair access van and got him into the old Dallas County courthouse, which was grandfathered in from having ADA laws and, therefore, no wheelchair ramp. Once inside the courthouse, the elevator to the registrar's office was being serviced, and we had to wait an hour in order to use it. Once we finally got to the office of the board of registrars, there was only one person waiting on 25 people in line. My mother and father persevered. They persevered to make sure that my father got a photo ID that day because he was resolved in voting because his daughter was on the ballot for reelection. {time} 1945 Just think of all of the seniors or disabled citizens who do not have a relative or a person to take them to get a photo ID. This photo requirement definitely reduces the number of and the ability of certain segments of the society to exercise their right to vote. In the Supreme Court ruling which invalidated the preclearance provisions of the VRA, the Court said that the formula used by Congress to determine the covered States was outdated, and it implied that there was no need for the Voting Rights Act today since, after all, there was an African American elected as President. Oh, how shortsighted the Supreme Court was. As long as there are vulnerable communities that face barriers to voting, there is still a need for Federal protection. Just last year, after the Supreme Court ruling, the city of Evergreen, Alabama, came under Federal scrutiny for unfairly excluding African Americans from the voting rolls and for attempting to further dilute their voting power with a redistricting plan that would pack its majority Black population into only two of the five municipal districts. Incidences like this in Evergreen, Alabama, remind us that progress is always illusive and that the injustice suffered on the Edmund Pettus Bridge 50 years ago has not been fully vindicated. Mr. Speaker, beyond the bridge, there are still laws that explicitly or unintentionally limit the access of Americans to vote. Now that we have commemorated the movement that led to the passage of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, what are we going to do to protect the progress that has been made and to expand access to the sacred right to vote? On March 7, 2015, while en route to Selma, President Obama signed H.R. 431, the bill that awarded a Congressional Gold Medal to the foot soldiers of the Selma to Montgomery march of 1965. Finally, this Nation is acknowledging the bravery of these foot soldiers, who dared to make this Nation live up to its ideals of justice and equality for all. While a great honor, a medal is not adequate repayment for their sacrifice. Mr. Speaker, the greatest tribute that we as Members of Congress can give is to work honestly and earnestly on a bipartisan bill to restore Federal voting protections to vulnerable communities under the Voting Rights Act. While I applaud bipartisan efforts made in the Voting Rights Amendment Act of 2015, which creates a new formula that would determine which jurisdictions require Federal preclearance, this new formula that is in the current VRA Amendment Act omits key States, key States like North Carolina, South [[Page H1656]] Carolina, and Alabama. I can't imagine, Mr. Speaker, that the very State--Alabama--that prompted the Voting Rights Act that was signed into law 50 years ago would now not be afforded the protection of Federal oversight. The fight for voting rights was born in Alabama, and on my watch, it will not die there. Voting rights advocates and everyday citizens must remain vigilant and do all that they can to safeguard against efforts to constrict democracy in State and local governments. Our democracy requires it. We can all pay a debt of gratitude to those foot soldiers by voting in every election--local, State, and Federal. We all have our part to play, and we in Congress can play a vital role. To echo the President's call to action, President Obama said on that day: Selma shows us that America is not the project of any one person. The single most powerful word in our democracy is the word ``we.'' We the people are tasked with strengthening and safeguarding our democracy. We the people are responsible for ensuring our Nation lives up to its very principles. On the 50th anniversary of the Voting Rights Act and the historic march from Selma to Montgomery, I urge my colleagues--Democrats and Republicans alike--to recommit ourselves to the work that was done by our predecessors, to work together to restore the Voting Rights Act for all Americans. That is the least we can do on this, the 50th anniversary. I look forward to this august body taking up a voting rights amendment act that fully restores Federal protection to all vulnerable communities so that all Americans can definitely exercise that sacred right to vote. Ms. KELLY of Illinois. Thank you to the gentlewoman from Alabama. Thank you for sharing the challenges citizens like your dad can have in complying with the new Voting Rights Act law. Thank you for standing up. At this time, I would like to introduce the fierce and gentle woman from the District of Columbia, Eleanor Holmes Norton. Ms. NORTON. I thank my good friend, Representative Robin Kelly from Illinois, for her leadership on this night, this first night back. For Members back from Selma, I appreciate that our chair of the Congressional Black Caucus has been here to give us very important background and history. I particularly appreciate that we have just heard from a Member from Alabama, itself, Representative Terri Sewell, and all of that seems to me to be the appropriate prelude for what we are doing here tonight. Mr. Speaker, yes, this is the first day we are back from this historic trip and are back from the 50th anniversary of the Voting Rights Act. There is no place for the almost 100 Members who went to Selma to be but on this floor this evening. I want to thank Attorney General Holder for taking the crippled Voting Rights Act and continuing to enforce it. The trip to Selma essentially set the stage for Members to come back and to regard our trip as a call to action and get down to work to revitalize the 1965 Voting Rights Act. My thanks to Representative Jim Sensenbrenner and to Representative John Conyers for cosponsoring a revised version of the act. My thanks to John Lewis, who has kept Selma and the Voting Rights Act alive by his annual trips with Members and others to Selma. I am appreciative of the almost 100 Members from both parties who went to Selma on the 6th and 7th. What was the purpose of going? It could not have been a celebration. You can celebrate the 1964 Civil Rights Act. It has not been dismembered. You can celebrate the 1968 fair housing law. It still is on the books. But you go to Selma to try to bring back to its full glory the Voting Rights Act of 1965, where setback with section 5 has rendered the act virtually obsolete for most of its original purposes. I stress that the Supreme Court did not invalidate the 1965 Voting Rights Act. It invited the 100 Members who went to Selma and the others in this body to modernize the act. We may differ on how to do that. I do not think there can be any doubt that it has to be revised and that we have to meet the challenge that the Supreme Court has given us. After all, the Voting Rights Act has prevented, literally, hundreds of discriminatory voting practices, and there were countless practices that it simply deterred. I must say that I was disappointed that, early on in this session, the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, Representative Goodlatte, indicated that he did not believe that the act was necessary, and he talked about the 11 Southern States that had been under the act. The fact is that the preclearance Voting Rights Act requirements went far beyond those States. At the time of the Supreme Court decision in 2013, Arizona and Alaska were covered. Parts of California, New York, South Dakota, and Michigan were covered. In the past, parts of Hawaii, Colorado, New Hampshire, Idaho, Connecticut, Massachusetts, Wyoming, Maine, New Mexico, and Oklahoma have been covered. It is true that at the heart of the coverage were the 11 Southern States, but that is where the heart of the violations were, in fact, tracked. That is where the poll taxes were. That is where the violations were. There has been a compromise bill that has been put forward by Mr. Sensenbrenner and Mr. Conyers. In the very act of going to Selma, there was put upon us an obligation to come back and respond to that trip. The bill before us has tried to meet some of the objections that were raised. There is a rolling preclearance formula, for example, that does not require congressional reauthorization. There is a bail-in section of the act to reach those who had not been covered. There are a minimum number of violations over a period of time that have to be recorded in order for a state to come under the act. As my good friend from Alabama, Terri Sewell, says, the act is not what all of us wanted, but it does mean that in the spirit of compromise and because of the necessity of this act, this act which democratized the South and is necessary now--perhaps not as necessary as it was 50 years ago--but no one can doubt, as a Supreme Court Justice himself said when he said he didn't doubt that there was still discrimination in voting practices, but he said it was up to the Congress to modernize the bill. I don't see how almost 100 Republican and Democratic Members can have gone to Selma on the 50th anniversary without coming back to revise the act. We went emptyhanded. We went without a bill. I hope that what we got in Selma was the gumption to come back and to put forward a bill. Yes, the act has been dismembered by the Supreme Court, but the Court asked us to reshape it. It asked us to restore it. It was one thing to go without a bill. It is quite another to come back and do nothing about a bill. The President did not hesitate to say where the responsibility, in fact, lies, and I am quoting from his speech in Selma: One hundred Members of Congress have come here today to honor people who were willing to die for the right it protects. If we want to honor this day, let these 100 go back to Washington and gather 400 more and, together, pledge to make it their mission to restore the law this year. That is our mission. The trip to Selma, where we went in the name of the entire Congress, demands that we act before the end of this Congress. Ms. KELLY of Illinois. Thank you so much to the gentlewoman from Washington, D.C. At this time, I would like to introduce the gentleman from South Carolina, our leader, James Clyburn. (Mr. CLYBURN asked and was given permission to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. CLYBURN. Mr. Speaker, I often refer to this Hall as America's classroom. I do that because I do believe that, as we conduct ourselves here on this floor, it is to set an example for all citizens, especially our young citizens, who look in on our proceedings and get some idea about how they ought to conduct themselves as Americans going forward. One of those things, I think, that we ought to be very careful of is how we address the rights and responsibilities that we all have as citizens. {time} 2000 We teach our children in our classrooms and in our homes that the right to vote is basic to this democracy of ours. I know that all of us are aware that in our past it is a right that has not always been practiced, but in its [[Page H1657]] wisdom this body, acting collectively, decided back in 1965 that it would do something about making right the wrongs that have been heaped upon citizens for decades when it comes to voting. And so we did. A formula was adopted that was based upon the 1964 results of the Presidential election. We have renewed time and time again that law, always updating under that formula; but several months ago the United States Supreme Court looked at the formula and decided that the formula had outlived its usefulness, but the Voting Rights Act was still needed. They invited the Congress to take a look at the formula and update it, as the chair said, and to make it more contemporary. We have worked for months. I want to thank Mr. Sensenbrenner of Wisconsin and Mr. Conyers of Michigan for the work they have done to put together some amendments that would update that formula. This time we decided to look back just a few years and to see, within the last 10 or 12 years, what jurisdictions have still continued to violate people's rights and who have been found guilty of doing so. Rather than apply the formula to everybody, what we will do is come up with a series of wrongs, put some numerical qualification on it, and make a new formula. Now, that formula is not going to cover South Carolina today, but under the formula, any jurisdiction, any State that permits these kinds of atrocities and is found to have done so, they will be brought under the formula. So the formula applies to every jurisdiction in the country. I think that it is time for us to be honest that everybody will not do right, but we should have something in place so when a jurisdiction fails to do right, we will have a mechanism to address those ills. Now, let me hasten to add--and I want all that are listening in to understand--this part of the Voting Rights Act is a preventive measure. It says that it allows for the Justice Department to move to prevent any kind of implementation of a change in the voting laws so that we won't have expensive litigation if something in it is not quite right. I believe that it is incumbent upon us to do what we can to employ methods that will not require citizens and the jurisdiction, their States, their cities and counties, to go to the expense of litigation when we can have an administrative procedure in place to take a look at what has been done and make a decision as to whether or not there is any possibility that someone's voting rights could be taken away. That is all this formula does. That is all section 5 is about. I would hope that those of us who traveled to Selma last week to renew our commitment to making this country of ours a more perfect Union will sit down in the near future, and before we get to the 50th anniversary of the signing of that 1965 Voting Rights Act, which comes on August 6 of this year, sometime between now and August 6, let's put in place the kind of amendments that would allow the Voting Rights Act to maintain the life that it has given to so many communities for so many years. I want to thank Ms. Kelly for putting together this Special Order. Let me close by saying: The longer I live, the more I get in touch with those old adages that we grew up with, one of which was ``an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure.'' I believe that these amendments that we are proposing are preventive measures, and it is much more valuable than for us to come back looking for a cure that could be very, very expensive. Ms. KELLY of Illinois. Thank you to the gentleman from South Carolina (Mr. Clyburn) for your important insight and your important comments. Now it is my honor to introduce the gentlelady from Texas, Congresswoman Sheila Jackson Lee. Ms. JACKSON LEE. Let me thank my colleagues and thank Congresswoman Kelly and Chairman Butterfield for the opportunity to carry forward the spirit of the 50th commemoration of the march over the Edmund Pettus Bridge. Let me also begin by thanking our colleague Congresswoman Terri Sewell and all of the Alabama delegation for their hospitality and their spirit of unity. In fact, Mr. Speaker, I am so moved by that experience that I frankly believe that now is the time to move the bill that is bipartisan that is a response to the United States Supreme Court to the floor of the House, to the Committee on the Judiciary and to the floor of the House. Leader Clyburn was very apt in describing a very significant point that really answers the question of the Supreme Court. If I had my way, coming from the State of Texas, I frankly believe that the reauthorization that we did through the Committee on the Judiciary, of which I am a member, and which I was very much engaged in in 2006 and 2007, was a thorough expose of the value of the Voting Rights Act. We did 15,000 pages of testimony, and witness after witness from different perspectives indicated that the formula that we were using at that time on the preclearance was an effective formula. Of course, the Supreme Court challenged the data, and I would only argue that it is appropriate to update the data. I welcome that. But we have gone even further. As has been articulated by the bill that has just been introduced by a number of us, we have crafted a formula that says it is an even playing field, an even playing field for a State to opt in because they have voting rights abuses for all people or to opt out because they have a smooth, evenhanded process for citizens in their State to vote. So I believe it is important that the message get out of what the Voting Rights Act stands for and what it meant for those foot soldiers to cross that bridge. They crossed that bridge, and they were willing-- and were bloodied, frankly--to do something nonviolent, and that is to petition their leaders at the voting box. I can't imagine that there is any Member here in this place, in this august Congress, that would not want to go to their constituents, whether they live in South Dakota or Utah or Mississippi or New York or Texas, as I do, that there is an unfettered right to vote. I will soon be introducing a Voting Rights Act that establishes the date that we signed the Voting Rights Act by the President that came from Texas, Lyndon Baines Johnson, with the leaders of Martin Luther King and John Lewis and many others standing at his side, to introduce that as being Voting Rights Act Day, to reinforce the value to Americans of the importance of voting. Who would want to oppose the idea that voting is not important? So I am looking forward to having Members join on the simple premise that it is important to vote in America and that it is important to commemorate the signing of the Voting Rights Act and make it Voting Rights Day. That inspiration came as we saw the thousands that were marching across the Edmund Pettus Bridge. Let me just clarify for a moment, under section 5, the submitting jurisdiction under the Voting Rights Act of 1965 and H.R. 885, Voting Rights Amendment Act of 2015, has to prove that the proposed changes are not retrogressive, that they do not have the purpose and will not have the effect of denying or abridging the right to vote on account of race or color. We have expanded that, again, to go by acts, by occurrences that would keep someone from voting. So I believed that this past weekend, or the weekend of Bloody Sunday, was a moving moment that would draw us together, that would allow us to understand H.R. 885. And might I say this: I know that many of us will be willing to have teach-ins to ensure that our colleagues understand the importance of this legislation and that we do it in a bipartisan manner. Let me conclude my remarks by saying, earlier today I stood on the floor and asked for a bipartisan approach to the approval of the Attorney General nominee by the other body. I say that from the spirit of recognition of the three branches of government. A President has nominated a very well-qualified, distinguished member of the bar, Loretta Lynch, to be the next Attorney General of the United States of America. We understand differences of opinion with legislation. I have no quarrel with those differences. I happen to support the human trafficking bill and recognize that there is a disagreement on language that I agree with the disagreement, but that disagreement can [[Page H1658]] be worked out through ongoing talks and however they want to approach it or a vote on the floor. But Loretta Lynch, the Attorney General nominee, should not be held up captive to disagreements on legislation and moving toward a constitutional crisis. All of this, Mr. Speaker, is wrapped up together. The Department of Justice enforces the Voting Rights Act, enforces the voting rights of Americans. As we look to the future, as we formulate the understanding of the three branches of government, to avoid a constitutional crisis of not having the leadership that is timely for the work that has to be done, I would hope the Senate would move forward, and I would hope that all of us would honor the Voting Rights Act and the message of Selma that we stand together under this wonderful flag and stand for voting rights for all. Since its passage in 1965, and through four reauthorizations signed by Republican presidents (1970, 1975, 1982, 2006), more Americans, especially those in the communities we represent, have been empowered by the Voting Rights Act of 1965 than any other single piece of legislation. Section 5 of the Act requires covered jurisdictions to submit proposed changes to any voting law or procedure to the Department of Justice or the U.S. District Court in Washington, D.C. for pre- approval, hence the term ``pre-clearance.'' Under Section 5, the submitting jurisdiction has the burden of proving that the proposed change(s) are not retrogressive, i.e. that they do not have the purpose and will not have the effect of denying or abridging the right to vote on account of race or color. In announcing his support for the 1982 extension of the Voting Rights Act, President Reagan said, ``the right to vote is the crown jewel of American liberties.'' And Section is the ``crown jewel'' of the Voting Rights Act. But a terrible blow was dealt to the Voting Rights Act on June 25, 2013, when the Supreme Court handed down the decision in Shelby County v. Holder, 537 U.S. 193 (2013), which invalidated Section 4(b), the provision of the law determining which jurisdictions would be subject to Section 5 ``pre-clearance.'' Facts of Shelby County v. Holder In 2006, the City of Calera, which lies within Shelby County, enacted a discriminatory redistricting plan without complying with Section 5, leading to the loss of the city's sole African-American councilman, Ernest Montgomery. In compliance with Section 5, however, Calera was required to draw a nondiscriminatory redistricting plan and conduct another election in which Mr. Montgomery regained his seat. According to the Supreme Court majority, the reason for striking down Section 4(b): ``Times change.'' Now, the Court was right; times have changed. But what the Court did not fully appreciate is that the positive changes it cited are due almost entirely to the existence and vigorous enforcement of the Voting Rights Act. And that is why the Voting Rights Act is still needed. Let me put it this way: in the same way that the vaccine invented by Dr. Jonas Salk in 1953 eradicated the crippling effects but did not eliminate the cause of polio, the Voting Rights Act succeeded in stymying the practices that resulted in the wholesale disenfranchisement of African Americans and language minorities but did eliminate them entirely. Before the Voting Rights Act was passed in 1965, the right to vote did not exist in practice for most African Americans. And until 1975, most American citizens who were not proficient in English faced significant obstacles to voting, because they could not understand the ballot. Asian Americans and Asian immigrants also suffered systematic exclusion from the political process. In 1964, the year before the Voting Rights Act became law, there were approximately 300 African-Americans in public office, including just three in Congress. Few, if any, black elected officials were elected anywhere in the South. Because of the Voting Rights Act, there are now more than 9,100 black elected officials, including 43 members of Congress, the largest number ever. The Voting Rights Act opened the political process for many of the approximately 6,000 Latino public officials that have been elected and appointed nationwide, including 263 at the state or federal level, 27 of whom serve in Congress. Now to be sure, the Supreme Court did not invalidate the preclearance provisions of Section 5; it only invalidated Section 4(b). But that is like leaving the car undamaged but destroying the key that unlocks the doors and starts the engine. According to the Court, the coverage formula in Section 4(b) had to be struck down because the data upon which it was based--registration rates and turn-out gaps--was too old and outdated. But my colleagues in Congress and I refuse to let the Voting Rights Act die. And so we went to work, crafting and drafting the legislation that would repair the damage done to the Voting Rights Act by the Supreme Court decision and capable of winning majorities in the House and Senate and the signature of the President. After months of hard work, consultation, negotiation, and collaboration, we produced and have reintroduced in the 114th Congress, a bill, H.R. 885, ``Voting Rights Amendments Act of 2015'' that can achieve these goals. To be sure, this legislation is not perfect, no bill ever is. But--and this is important--the bill represents an important step forward because it: 1. is responsive to the concern expressed by the Supreme Court; and 2. establishes a new coverage formula that is carefully tailored but sufficiently potent to protect the voting rights of all Americans. First, H.R. 885 specifies a new coverage formula that is based on current problems in voting and therefore directly responds to the Court's concern that the previous formula was outdated. The importance of this feature is hard to overestimate. Legislators and litigators understand that the likelihood of the Court upholding an amended statute that fails to correct the provision previously found to be defective is very low and indeed. H.R. 885 replaces the old ``static'' coverage formula with a new dynamic coverage formula, or ``rolling trigger,'' which works as follows: 1. for states, it requires at least one finding of discrimination at the state level and at least four adverse findings by its sub-jurisdictions within the previous 15 years; 2. for political subdivisions, it requires at least three adverse findings within the previous 15 years; but 3. political subdivisions with ``persistent and extremely low minority voter turnout,'' can also be covered if they have a single adverse finding of discrimination. The effect of the ``rolling trigger'' mechanism effectively gives the legislation nationwide reach because any state and any jurisdiction in any state potentially is subject to being covered if the requisite number of violations are found to have been committed. Prior to Shelby County v. Holder, the Voting Rights Act covered 16 states in whole or in part, including most of the states in the Deep South. The rolling trigger contained in H.R. 885, unfortunately, does not; at least not initially. The only states that would be covered initially under the new bill are: 1. Texas 2. North Carolina 3. Louisiana 4. Florida 5. South Carolina. To compensate for the fact that fewer jurisdictions are covered, our bill also includes several key provisions that are consistent with the needs created by a narrower Section 5 trigger. For example, H.R. 885: 1. Expands judicial ``bail-in'' authority under Section 3 so that it applies to voting changes that result in discrimination (not just intentional discrimination); 2. Requires nationwide transparency of ``late breaking'' voting changes; allocation of poll place resources; and changes within the boundaries of voting districts; 3. Clarifies and expands the ability of plaintiffs to seek a preliminary injunction against voting discrimination; and 4. Clarifies and expands Attorney General's authority to send election observers to protect against voting discrimination. The Voting Rights Act of 1965 is no ordinary piece of legislation. For millions of Americans, and many of us in Congress, the Voting Rights Act of 1965 is a sacred treasure, earned by the sweat and toil and tears and blood of ordinary Americans who showed the world it was possible to accomplish extraordinary things. ABOUT TEXAS NAACP V. BERRY (Texas Photo ID case; consolidated with Veasey v. Perry) 1. The suit alleges that the State of Texas' photo ID requirement for in-person voting, enacted in 2011, was adopted for discriminatory reasons, in violation of the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments and Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act, and has a discriminatory ``result'' in violation of Section 2. The case is consolidated with similar suits filed by the United States and other private plaintiffs. 2. Trial was held from September 2 to September 11, 2014, and closing arguments were presented on September 22, 2014. 3. On October 9, 2014, U.S. District Judge Nelva Gonzales Ramos issued a 147-page opinion in which she ruled that the Texas photo ID requirement violates both the U.S. Constitution and Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act. 4. Judge Ramos found that the law was enacted for the purpose of discriminating against African-American and Latino voters, and that it denies minority voters an equal opportunity to participate in the political process in violation of the Section 2 results standard. [[Page H1659]] 5. Judge Ramos also found that the photo ID law unconstitutionally burdens the right to vote, and functions as an unconstitutional poll tax. 6. On October 14, 2014, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit granted Texas' motion to stay the district court's permanent injunction until Texas' appeal is briefed, argued and decided. 7. On October 15, 2014, the Lawyers' Committee and co-counsel filed an emergency application with the Supreme Court to reinstate the district court's injunction. 8. On October 18, 2014, the Supreme Court denied the application to vacate the stay; Justice Ginsburg filed a dissent, joined by Justices Sotomayor and Kagan. 9. Oral argument before the 5th Circuit is scheduled to take place during the last week in April. 10. Previously, in a lawsuit litigated under Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act, a three-judge district court in Texas v. Holder, 888 F. Supp. 2d 113 (D.D.C. 2012), ruled that Texas' photo ID law did not satisfy the nondiscrimination requirements of Section 5. 11. However, the district court ruling was vacated by the Supreme Court, 133 S. Ct. 2886 (2013), following the Court's decision in Shelby County v. Holder, 133 S. Ct. 2612 (2013), that the geographic coverage formula for Section 5 is unconstitutional. Ms. KELLY of Illinois. I thank the gentlelady from Texas for her remarks. Now it is my honor to yield to the gentlelady from Milwaukee, Wisconsin, Congresswoman Gwen Moore. Ms. MOORE. Mr. Speaker, I was privileged just recently to stand hand in hand and shoulder to shoulder in Selma, Alabama, with 100 Members of Congress, with civil rights leaders, friends of the movement of all races from every State in the United States, with civil rights luminaries such as Mrs. Abernathy, Dorothy Cotton, Amelia Boynton--113 years old--Doris Crenshaw, and, of course, our very own colleague, John Lewis, who helped lead a march for a better life and more equality for all of America. But it was very, very hard to celebrate. There was a very sober mood in the crowd as we realized that the voting rights of Americans, particularly African Americans, were under threat 50 years after the Voting Rights Act was signed. As the President said in his remarks: Right now, in 2015, 50 years after Selma, there are laws across the country designed to make it harder for people to vote. {time} 2015 As we speak, more of such laws are being proposed. Meanwhile, the Voting Rights Act, the culmination of so much blood, so much sweat and tears, the product of so much sacrifice in the face of wanton violence, the Voting Rights Act stands weakened, its future subject to political rancor. As we think of those martyrs like Viola Liuzzo, James Earl Chaney, Andy Goodman, and Michael Schwerner, it is very, very difficult to deal with the reality that States such as the one that I hail from, Wisconsin, is one of the States who has joined the map of shame and passed one of the strictest voter ID laws in the country. In the following years since 2011, Wisconsin has been a battleground in fighting this pernicious law. In 2014, a Federal judge ruled that our voter ID law was unconstitutional and violated section 2 of the Voting Rights Act and the equal protection clause of the 14th Amendment. It found that 300,000 Wisconsinites lacked the proper ID needed under the law and that the law would have a disparate impact on Blacks and Latinos. Despite that powerful finding, the Federal district court was recklessly overturned by a three-judge panel in the Seventh Circuit. Right before our 2014 election, the United States Supreme Court stepped in and enjoined this law in an emergency stay to prevent them from implementing the voter ID law only 6 weeks before the 2014 election. Recently, members of the Congressional Black Caucus have sent an amicus brief, and I am optimistic that justice will prevail. I know that there have been many African Americans and people of other races who have marched across that Edmund Pettus Bridge. As a woman, I know that the brave suffragettes fought equal treatment for over 70 years while they faced humiliation and shame from society. History has made it so very, very clear that voting rights are so fundamental. The 14th Amendment to the Constitution protects voting rights; the 15th Amendment provided that males, even former slaves and males of any race, could vote; women's suffrage; with the 24th Amendment, poll taxes supposedly were eliminated, and the 26th Amendment allowed 18-year-olds to vote. Of course, we have the Voting Rights Act of 1965. I think it is very, very clear, when you look at the history of this protection, that it is one of the most constitutionally protected rights that there is. I would urge my colleagues here in this body to do more than hold hands and sing, ``We Shall Overcome,'' but to really pass laws to strengthen the Voting Rights Act. We have all heard the adage that history repeats itself, and we have seen a race across the country for Republican legislatures and Governors to pass these voter ID laws, but I think we also have the power to shape our future by drawing from the lessons of the past: our civil rights movement, our march in Selma, where we stood hand in hand, arm in arm, and fought back against this tide of oppression. Ms. KELLY of Illinois. I thank the gentlewoman from Wisconsin. Thank you for sharing your thoughts. Now, it is my honor to yield to the gentlewoman from Florida, Frederica Wilson. Ms. WILSON of Florida. In Miami-Dade County, I have a program called the 5000 Role Models of Excellence Project. It is a program of Black and Hispanic boys who are trying to grow up into good men. The Friday before Bloody Sunday, over 500 12th graders--graduating seniors--from that program went to a movie to watch a private screening of the movie ``Selma.'' I want to give a special shout-out to Nancy Sewell, who is the mother of Terri Sewell. As I watched the two of them on C-SPAN, MSNBC, and CNN, I was so proud of them. These boys were prepared by men who experienced the civil rights battles and know the bitter history and violent battles we had to endure. I wish I had the resources to take all 500 of them to Selma. During the movie, we planned a Twitter war. Thousands participated all across the Nation. Movie stars, rappers, sports legends, and the White House joined in the Twitter war. These boys will never be the same. They were visibly moved; and their applause, tears, hugs, and tweets proved their transformation. The next day, on that Saturday, when the President spoke, the Twitter war continued. It was based at my home. So many of them watched and marveled at Representative John Lewis, a card-carrying, sworn-in member of the 5000 Role Models of Excellence Project. They watched so proudly as he introduced the first Black President of the United States. In fact, he is the only President that they know. They are beyond proud. Why did I do this? I wanted as many students as possible to experience the importance of voting, and I am not finished. All 8,000 of them will see the movie as soon as it is released for distribution. This generation of children needs to know the importance of voting. They need to know what their forefathers had to endure so that they could vote. When I was on the Miami-Dade County School Board in 1996, we set up a process in partnership with the department of elections. Every eligible student is registered to vote in the 11th grade, and when they graduate and turn 18, their voter registration card is mailed to their homes. This is a policy that all school districts all across America should adopt. While they repair the damage to the Voting Rights Act through legislation, graduating seniors in Miami-Dade public schools--Black, White, and Hispanic--will still have the opportunity to vote. Every single one of them will vote. I hope that other school districts will adopt this policy so that children will know and understand the importance of voting. It is their voice. God of our weary years, God of our silent tears, let us as a people march on until victory is won. Ms. KELLY of Illinois. Thank you to the gentlewoman from Florida. Thank you for sharing your success stories. Hopefully, those can be duplicated. At this time, I yield to the gentlewoman from North Carolina, Congresswoman Alma Adams. Ms. ADAMS. Thank you, Congresswoman Kelly, for your leadership. I [[Page H1660]] appreciate what you are doing very much. Certainly, it is something that we need to do, and we must do. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to stress the importance of equal voting rights for everyone. Just over a week ago, I traveled to Selma with several of my colleagues to retrace the steps of those who shed blood as they tried, again, to gain equal access to the ballot box. As a professor for 40 years at Bennett College in North Carolina, I made sure that the students that passed through my classroom and our campus knew just how important it was to have their voices heard, and to this day, students know: ``Bennett Belles are voting belles.'' In 2013, the Supreme Court struck down a major provision of the Voting Rights Act limiting Federal oversight over State voting laws. Sadly, my home State of North Carolina quickly implemented voting laws that disenfranchise voters by making cuts to early voting, reenforcing strict ID requirements, and ending some preregistration programs which did not allow young high school students to be able to register to vote. As I think about those who risked their lives in order to exercise their right to vote, I cannot believe that 50 years later, in 2015, that simple freedom given to us in the Constitution is still under attack. It is time for all of us, Mr. Speaker, to come together to restore the Voting Rights Act, to ensure that every voter--no matter their race, no matter their class or creed--can make their voice heard and elect the leaders of their choice. Ms. KELLY of Illinois. I thank the gentlewoman from North Carolina, again, for her insight and comments. Here we are, 50 years removed from Selma, 50 years after Americans-- young and old, Black, White, Asian, Hispanic, Native American, Jewish-- made a decision to stand up for what they knew was right. They stood up for democracy and demanded fair and unobstructed access to the ballot. As you have heard this hour, the evolution to the America we are today has been a long and challenging journey. The Voting Rights Act has done much to make our Union more perfect, but the strength of the Voting Rights Act has been diminished. With new, discriminatory laws on the books, this Congress must act. This Congress can pass a bipartisan bill that extends section 5 of the Voting Rights Act. As was the case in Selma, the law is not equal for all. We must unite, as we did then. I urge my colleagues to take up this important issue and strengthen the Voting Rights Act. I would like to take this time to thank the gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. Butterfield) and all my colleagues who took the time to speak to us this evening. I yield back the balance of my time. Ms. FUDGE. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my colleagues Congressmen Payne and Kelly for leading the Congressional Black Caucus Special Order Hour. Mr. Speaker, fifty years ago 600 men and women began a peaceful march in Selma, Alabama to demand their full and equal right to participate in our democracy. Their quest for equal voting rights was met with physical violence and racial hatred on what has become known as ``Bloody Sunday.'' The marchers were turned back that day, but they remained steadfast. With unwavering determination, residents of Selma, civil rights activists, and inspired people from across the nation completed the march from Selma to Montgomery. Their heroism was instrumental in the passage of the Voting Rights Act of 1965; a watershed bipartisan action of the U.S. Congress. Fifty years later, on the anniversary of Bloody Sunday, I stood with President Obama and my House and Senate colleagues to honor the legacy of those brave foot soldiers for justice. But unfortunately, the battle wages on. There is still much to be done to ensure the sacrifice of those marchers was not in vain. The Supreme Court's decision in Shelby County v. Holder to strike down Section 4 of the Voting Rights Act left many Americans more vulnerable to voting discrimination. In the absence of this historic safeguard, numerous states have attempted to suppress voting through restrictive voter ID laws and limits on early voting. My home state of Ohio is one of them. Congress must act to restore Section 4 of the Voting Rights Act and update critical voter protections. In 2015, no eligible citizen should be disenfranchised. No eligible citizen should be denied full participation in our democracy. Let us recommit to rejecting intolerance and injustice in all forms, and continue the fight for equal voting rights for all Americans. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 44 (Monday, March 16, 2015)] [House] [Pages H1653-H1660] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] THE BATTLE WAGES ON: SECURING EQUAL VOTING RIGHTS IN THE UNITED STATES The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under the Speaker's announced policy of January 6, 2015, the gentlewoman from Illinois (Ms. Kelly) is recognized for 60 minutes as the designee of the minority leader. General Leave Ms. KELLY of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members be given 5 days to revise and extend their remarks. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentlewoman from Illinois? There was no objection. Ms. KELLY of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, it is an honor and a privilege to be before you this evening on the heels of our Nation's recognizing the 50th anniversary of the Selma marchers which tore down many obstructive barriers to voting for African Americans and which led to the passage of the Voting Rights Act of 1965. We have grown as a nation since the night Jimmie Lee Jackson was murdered peacefully marching for voting rights in Alabama, and we are not the America we were when Mamie Till made the world see what had been done to her baby. But we are still living in dynamic times for our democracy. Selma has changed, but the issues of Ferguson, Missouri, remain. Nearly 60 years after Emmett Till was buried, Black mothers still worry about the value of their son's lives when they leave home. We are reminded of this every time we look into the eyes of Trayvon Martin's mother. We are better today than we were then, [[Page H1654]] and the changes we made to our laws paved our path to prosperity. The President spoke of this in Selma, and Republicans and Democrats alike were united in our feeling that we must uphold the promise of the Nation we inherited because of Selma. {time} 1930 The U.S. Senate should vote to confirm very qualified and exceptional U.S. Attorney Loretta Lynch as the next Attorney General. The CBC devoted an hour of floor testimony last month in defense of her confirmation, but in her role as Attorney General, Loretta Lynch will be tasked with defending the Federal laws that protect the right to vote, and that brings us to our topic this evening. Tonight's Congressional Black Caucus Special Order hour is entitled: ``The Battle Wages On: Securing Equal Voting Rights in the United States.'' This topic is truly timely. This conversation needs to take place now. Work remains to secure equal voting rights in the United States. Actions like the Supreme Court's decision to gut the Voting Rights Act remind us that the equality that should exist at the ballot is still lacking and why I dream of a day when the Voting Rights Act is no longer necessary. The truth is that voter discrimination and suppression remain as tragic legacies of our past. In the past few years, many States have introduced restrictive legislation that diminishes an individual's access to the voting booth. The Justice Department may have the tools to fix this problem and go after places that are discriminating against certain voters. In some places, getting a voter ID that you can use to vote can cost up to $150, and that can be a burden for someone who is on a fixed income and not driving anymore and doesn't have a license. Discriminatory laws and policies that hamper access to the ballot box are reasons that the protections and the Voting Rights Act are necessary. The VRA must remain intact as its principles are powerful democratic agents that make our Union more perfect. With that, I would like to kick off this Special Order hour by yielding to my colleague and anchor, a man who has dedicated his life to the issues of justice in America--a lawyer, judge, and statesman who has defended voting rights--the chairman of the Congressional Black Caucus, the Honorable G.K. Butterfield of North Carolina. Mr. BUTTERFIELD. Thank you very much, Congresswoman Kelly. Thank you for your leadership, and thank you for what you mean to the Congressional Black Caucus. The Congressional Black Caucus is now the largest caucus in our history. We are very proud to announce that we have 46 members now in CBC, representing more than 30 million people from 23 States, in addition to the District of Columbia and the Virgin Islands, so I am delighted that you have taken this responsibility each week, Ms. Kelly, to come to the floor and manage this time. Typically, Congressman Donald Payne would be joining Congresswoman Kelly tonight, but Mr. Payne is not able to come to the floor tonight to help with this Special Order due to, what I am told, is complications from foot surgery, so we wish Congressman Payne a very speedy recovery. Ms. Kelly, I wanted to particularly thank you for selecting this subject this evening. This is a very timely conversation that we must have in this Congress, and that is the whole subject of the Voting Rights Act. The topic that you have chosen, ``The Battle Wages On: Securing Equal Voting Rights in the United States,'' is so very appropriate; and, hopefully, in the next 2 or 3 minutes, I want to tell you why. Let me just start by explaining the whole voting rights story. Some of my colleagues may not fully appreciate it and understand that when we talk about voting rights, we just don't talk about 1965. In order to fully appreciate the voting rights history in this country, we must go back to the end of slavery when 4 million slaves became free. They did not have the right to vote. Once the 15th Amendment was added to the Constitution, then all of the former slave men got and obtained the right to vote. They got engaged. They got involved in the political process. From 1870 until 1900, a period of some 30 years, African American males, particularly in the South, were fully engaged in the political process. But do you know what? In 1900, Mr. Speaker, in 1900, that right to vote came to an end. It came to an end because of Southern States like South Carolina, North Carolina, Alabama, Mississippi, and the like, all of these Southern States passed disfranchisement laws, particularly a literacy test. This literacy test had the practical effect of denying the former slaves and their descendants the right to vote. Not only did you have to read and write in order to be able to register to vote, you had to convince the registrar that you were literate. The practical effect of that was that the whole voting rights movement during those days came to an abrupt end in 1901 when Congressman George H. White, who was one of my predecessors in North Carolina, stood on this House floor on March 3, 1901, and made a very profound welfare speech to the Congress. Mr. Speaker, that is the first era of voting rights in this country. The next era, I would say, would be from 1901 to 1965, when African Americans, for the most part, were not allowed to register to vote because of the literacy test and were not meaningfully involved. The next and final phase would be from 1965 until the present. In 1965, this Congress passed a historic 1965 Voting Rights Act, and it was a bipartisan bill. Democrats and Republicans promoted the bill all the way to the finish line with the help of then President Lyndon B. Johnson. The 1965 voting rights, Mr. Speaker, did many great things, but the three things that I will highlight tonight are: Number one, it eliminated the literacy test; number two, it gave a right of action, it gave to African American communities all across the United States the right to bring legal action to file civil lawsuits in Federal court to challenge discriminatory election laws or practices or procedures; the third part of the Voting Rights Act was what we now refer to as section 5. The Congress in 1965 set aside certain States in the country and certain subdivisions within a State to require them to get preclearance before election laws when new election laws went into effect. Many of our Southern States did not like section 5, but it was put on the books for a purpose because, if given the opportunity, these States were going to pass discriminatory election laws that made it very difficult for African Americans to vote. Section 5 has now been on the books since 1965. It has been strongly enforced by the Attorney General. Section 2 has been strongly enforced in courts all across the country. Now, we have 46 African Americans serving in Congress, we have thousands elected at State and local levels all across the country, and it was because of the Voting Rights Act in many respects. Well, Mr. Speaker, we received a great surprise on June 25 of 2013. The U.S. Supreme Court declared that section 5 could not be enforced because the formula that gives life to section 5, which is section 4, the court said that section 4 needed to be updated and called on this Congress to amend section 4 to make it more contemporary in its application. This Congress has failed to act. Now, this is the spring of 2015, and we have failed to act. Our voting rights are under continuous assault with more and more States and counties enacting voting laws that, on their face, appear to not be an impediment to voting. Many of these new laws are discriminatory, I want you to know. Some are intended to be. Others, though not intentional, will have a discriminatory result. In closing, Mr. Speaker, I am just unable to understand why my Republican colleagues refuse to support an amendment to section 5 to make this provision compliant with the Supreme Court decision. Through the years, this Congress has been called upon to extend section 5, and it has done so in a bipartisan way. In 2006, as section 5 was about to expire then, there was a bipartisan bill passed by this Congress, signed by President [[Page H1655]] George W. Bush. There were 192 Republicans who voted for the bill. I want to say that to you again, my colleagues: 192 Republicans voted to extend section 5 just a few years ago. I saluted them then; I salute them now. Sixty-six of those Republicans continue to serve in the House today, including the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, Mr. Goodlatte. Mr. Speaker, we must fix section 5 to comply with the Supreme Court's decision to update the formula. If we continue down this path and if we do nothing, the practical effect will be that jurisdictions will pass election laws or implement election practices or procedures that will discriminate, and we know it, and we must prevent it from happening. The only remedy African American communities have to obtain redress from discriminatory practices will be to file very expensive litigation. In the meantime, the law, the new law goes into effect. If section 5 was in place, there wouldn't be the need for expensive litigation. The jurisdiction would simply be required to make a showing to the Department of Justice, and the Attorney General would determine the effect of the change on minority voting strength. That is the way we have done it for the last 50 years. I call on my Republican colleagues to please join with us in a bipartisan, bicameral effort to fix the formula so that section 5 can be enforced in our country. Thank you, Ms. Kelly. Ms. KELLY of Illinois. Thank you, Congressman Butterfield. It is now my honor to introduce the gentlewoman from Alabama, one that was our gracious host last weekend, and we appreciate everything she did, Terri Sewell. Ms. SEWELL of Alabama. Mr. Speaker, on March 7, 2015, nearly 100 Members of Congress from both sides of the aisle went to Selma to commemorate the 50th anniversary of Bloody Sunday and the 1965 march from Selma to Montgomery. I was humbled to welcome so many of my colleagues in Congress to my hometown of Selma, Alabama. It meant a lot to me and the State of Alabama to also welcome President and Mrs. Obama and their daughters, as well as President and Mrs. George W. Bush to Selma to commemorate the significant events in American history. The Selma movement for voting rights was a uniquely American story of how ordinary Americans working together achieved extraordinary social change. I want to thank all of the Members and everyone who participated in the Faith & Politics pilgrimage to Alabama this year. I especially want to thank my Alabama colleagues--Senator Sessions, Representative Martha Roby, Representative Robert Aderholt, Representative Bradley Byrne, and Representative Gary Palmer--for their participation in the delegation. A special thanks to Congressman John Lewis and the Faith & Politics Institute for a job well done. You know, Mr. Speaker, the opportunity to walk in the footsteps of John Lewis with John Lewis is an unforgettable experience that is truly transformative. The bipartisan participation by Republicans and Democrats alike was truly something to behold, especially given the hyperpartisanship of Washington. It was something to see us gather together in Selma, Alabama, to honor the sacrifices of the foot soldiers who dared to fight for voter equality 50 years ago. I tried not to have any expectation from this bipartisan showing, but I must admit my hope was that all of us would be motivated by the experience of traveling with John Lewis, in his footsteps with him, to honestly look at modern-day threats to voting rights today. Now that the spotlight is no longer on Selma, we must move beyond the bridge and see that there is still a need to fight to ensure that all Americans can participate equally in the political process. New barriers to voting rights have been legitimized in State legislatures across this country. Photo ID laws and efforts nationwide to get rid of early voting or weekend voting are modern-day efforts that have had the profound effect of restricting access to voting. Any effort that restricts or decreases the likelihood of citizens to vote is a threat to the voting rights of all Americans. There is no denying that modern-day laws imposed to ostensibly prevent voter fraud has had the ``unintended consequence'' of making it much harder for certain sectors of the population to vote. My father is a perfect example of an individual who has found it harder to vote because of these modern-day laws. Prior to the State of Alabama imposing a photo ID law to vote, my father, Andrew, a stroke victim who has been wheelchair bound for the last 10 years, had been voting by using his federally issued Social Security card, which does not have a photo; but once the law was imposed, my father--who no longer drives, who no longer works, is retired--had no way of getting a photo ID. After the Alabama law changed, my mother and I made sure that my father would get a photo ID to vote. The effort was tremendous. We transported my father in a special wheelchair access van and got him into the old Dallas County courthouse, which was grandfathered in from having ADA laws and, therefore, no wheelchair ramp. Once inside the courthouse, the elevator to the registrar's office was being serviced, and we had to wait an hour in order to use it. Once we finally got to the office of the board of registrars, there was only one person waiting on 25 people in line. My mother and father persevered. They persevered to make sure that my father got a photo ID that day because he was resolved in voting because his daughter was on the ballot for reelection. {time} 1945 Just think of all of the seniors or disabled citizens who do not have a relative or a person to take them to get a photo ID. This photo requirement definitely reduces the number of and the ability of certain segments of the society to exercise their right to vote. In the Supreme Court ruling which invalidated the preclearance provisions of the VRA, the Court said that the formula used by Congress to determine the covered States was outdated, and it implied that there was no need for the Voting Rights Act today since, after all, there was an African American elected as President. Oh, how shortsighted the Supreme Court was. As long as there are vulnerable communities that face barriers to voting, there is still a need for Federal protection. Just last year, after the Supreme Court ruling, the city of Evergreen, Alabama, came under Federal scrutiny for unfairly excluding African Americans from the voting rolls and for attempting to further dilute their voting power with a redistricting plan that would pack its majority Black population into only two of the five municipal districts. Incidences like this in Evergreen, Alabama, remind us that progress is always illusive and that the injustice suffered on the Edmund Pettus Bridge 50 years ago has not been fully vindicated. Mr. Speaker, beyond the bridge, there are still laws that explicitly or unintentionally limit the access of Americans to vote. Now that we have commemorated the movement that led to the passage of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, what are we going to do to protect the progress that has been made and to expand access to the sacred right to vote? On March 7, 2015, while en route to Selma, President Obama signed H.R. 431, the bill that awarded a Congressional Gold Medal to the foot soldiers of the Selma to Montgomery march of 1965. Finally, this Nation is acknowledging the bravery of these foot soldiers, who dared to make this Nation live up to its ideals of justice and equality for all. While a great honor, a medal is not adequate repayment for their sacrifice. Mr. Speaker, the greatest tribute that we as Members of Congress can give is to work honestly and earnestly on a bipartisan bill to restore Federal voting protections to vulnerable communities under the Voting Rights Act. While I applaud bipartisan efforts made in the Voting Rights Amendment Act of 2015, which creates a new formula that would determine which jurisdictions require Federal preclearance, this new formula that is in the current VRA Amendment Act omits key States, key States like North Carolina, South [[Page H1656]] Carolina, and Alabama. I can't imagine, Mr. Speaker, that the very State--Alabama--that prompted the Voting Rights Act that was signed into law 50 years ago would now not be afforded the protection of Federal oversight. The fight for voting rights was born in Alabama, and on my watch, it will not die there. Voting rights advocates and everyday citizens must remain vigilant and do all that they can to safeguard against efforts to constrict democracy in State and local governments. Our democracy requires it. We can all pay a debt of gratitude to those foot soldiers by voting in every election--local, State, and Federal. We all have our part to play, and we in Congress can play a vital role. To echo the President's call to action, President Obama said on that day: Selma shows us that America is not the project of any one person. The single most powerful word in our democracy is the word ``we.'' We the people are tasked with strengthening and safeguarding our democracy. We the people are responsible for ensuring our Nation lives up to its very principles. On the 50th anniversary of the Voting Rights Act and the historic march from Selma to Montgomery, I urge my colleagues--Democrats and Republicans alike--to recommit ourselves to the work that was done by our predecessors, to work together to restore the Voting Rights Act for all Americans. That is the least we can do on this, the 50th anniversary. I look forward to this august body taking up a voting rights amendment act that fully restores Federal protection to all vulnerable communities so that all Americans can definitely exercise that sacred right to vote. Ms. KELLY of Illinois. Thank you to the gentlewoman from Alabama. Thank you for sharing the challenges citizens like your dad can have in complying with the new Voting Rights Act law. Thank you for standing up. At this time, I would like to introduce the fierce and gentle woman from the District of Columbia, Eleanor Holmes Norton. Ms. NORTON. I thank my good friend, Representative Robin Kelly from Illinois, for her leadership on this night, this first night back. For Members back from Selma, I appreciate that our chair of the Congressional Black Caucus has been here to give us very important background and history. I particularly appreciate that we have just heard from a Member from Alabama, itself, Representative Terri Sewell, and all of that seems to me to be the appropriate prelude for what we are doing here tonight. Mr. Speaker, yes, this is the first day we are back from this historic trip and are back from the 50th anniversary of the Voting Rights Act. There is no place for the almost 100 Members who went to Selma to be but on this floor this evening. I want to thank Attorney General Holder for taking the crippled Voting Rights Act and continuing to enforce it. The trip to Selma essentially set the stage for Members to come back and to regard our trip as a call to action and get down to work to revitalize the 1965 Voting Rights Act. My thanks to Representative Jim Sensenbrenner and to Representative John Conyers for cosponsoring a revised version of the act. My thanks to John Lewis, who has kept Selma and the Voting Rights Act alive by his annual trips with Members and others to Selma. I am appreciative of the almost 100 Members from both parties who went to Selma on the 6th and 7th. What was the purpose of going? It could not have been a celebration. You can celebrate the 1964 Civil Rights Act. It has not been dismembered. You can celebrate the 1968 fair housing law. It still is on the books. But you go to Selma to try to bring back to its full glory the Voting Rights Act of 1965, where setback with section 5 has rendered the act virtually obsolete for most of its original purposes. I stress that the Supreme Court did not invalidate the 1965 Voting Rights Act. It invited the 100 Members who went to Selma and the others in this body to modernize the act. We may differ on how to do that. I do not think there can be any doubt that it has to be revised and that we have to meet the challenge that the Supreme Court has given us. After all, the Voting Rights Act has prevented, literally, hundreds of discriminatory voting practices, and there were countless practices that it simply deterred. I must say that I was disappointed that, early on in this session, the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, Representative Goodlatte, indicated that he did not believe that the act was necessary, and he talked about the 11 Southern States that had been under the act. The fact is that the preclearance Voting Rights Act requirements went far beyond those States. At the time of the Supreme Court decision in 2013, Arizona and Alaska were covered. Parts of California, New York, South Dakota, and Michigan were covered. In the past, parts of Hawaii, Colorado, New Hampshire, Idaho, Connecticut, Massachusetts, Wyoming, Maine, New Mexico, and Oklahoma have been covered. It is true that at the heart of the coverage were the 11 Southern States, but that is where the heart of the violations were, in fact, tracked. That is where the poll taxes were. That is where the violations were. There has been a compromise bill that has been put forward by Mr. Sensenbrenner and Mr. Conyers. In the very act of going to Selma, there was put upon us an obligation to come back and respond to that trip. The bill before us has tried to meet some of the objections that were raised. There is a rolling preclearance formula, for example, that does not require congressional reauthorization. There is a bail-in section of the act to reach those who had not been covered. There are a minimum number of violations over a period of time that have to be recorded in order for a state to come under the act. As my good friend from Alabama, Terri Sewell, says, the act is not what all of us wanted, but it does mean that in the spirit of compromise and because of the necessity of this act, this act which democratized the South and is necessary now--perhaps not as necessary as it was 50 years ago--but no one can doubt, as a Supreme Court Justice himself said when he said he didn't doubt that there was still discrimination in voting practices, but he said it was up to the Congress to modernize the bill. I don't see how almost 100 Republican and Democratic Members can have gone to Selma on the 50th anniversary without coming back to revise the act. We went emptyhanded. We went without a bill. I hope that what we got in Selma was the gumption to come back and to put forward a bill. Yes, the act has been dismembered by the Supreme Court, but the Court asked us to reshape it. It asked us to restore it. It was one thing to go without a bill. It is quite another to come back and do nothing about a bill. The President did not hesitate to say where the responsibility, in fact, lies, and I am quoting from his speech in Selma: One hundred Members of Congress have come here today to honor people who were willing to die for the right it protects. If we want to honor this day, let these 100 go back to Washington and gather 400 more and, together, pledge to make it their mission to restore the law this year. That is our mission. The trip to Selma, where we went in the name of the entire Congress, demands that we act before the end of this Congress. Ms. KELLY of Illinois. Thank you so much to the gentlewoman from Washington, D.C. At this time, I would like to introduce the gentleman from South Carolina, our leader, James Clyburn. (Mr. CLYBURN asked and was given permission to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. CLYBURN. Mr. Speaker, I often refer to this Hall as America's classroom. I do that because I do believe that, as we conduct ourselves here on this floor, it is to set an example for all citizens, especially our young citizens, who look in on our proceedings and get some idea about how they ought to conduct themselves as Americans going forward. One of those things, I think, that we ought to be very careful of is how we address the rights and responsibilities that we all have as citizens. {time} 2000 We teach our children in our classrooms and in our homes that the right to vote is basic to this democracy of ours. I know that all of us are aware that in our past it is a right that has not always been practiced, but in its [[Page H1657]] wisdom this body, acting collectively, decided back in 1965 that it would do something about making right the wrongs that have been heaped upon citizens for decades when it comes to voting. And so we did. A formula was adopted that was based upon the 1964 results of the Presidential election. We have renewed time and time again that law, always updating under that formula; but several months ago the United States Supreme Court looked at the formula and decided that the formula had outlived its usefulness, but the Voting Rights Act was still needed. They invited the Congress to take a look at the formula and update it, as the chair said, and to make it more contemporary. We have worked for months. I want to thank Mr. Sensenbrenner of Wisconsin and Mr. Conyers of Michigan for the work they have done to put together some amendments that would update that formula. This time we decided to look back just a few years and to see, within the last 10 or 12 years, what jurisdictions have still continued to violate people's rights and who have been found guilty of doing so. Rather than apply the formula to everybody, what we will do is come up with a series of wrongs, put some numerical qualification on it, and make a new formula. Now, that formula is not going to cover South Carolina today, but under the formula, any jurisdiction, any State that permits these kinds of atrocities and is found to have done so, they will be brought under the formula. So the formula applies to every jurisdiction in the country. I think that it is time for us to be honest that everybody will not do right, but we should have something in place so when a jurisdiction fails to do right, we will have a mechanism to address those ills. Now, let me hasten to add--and I want all that are listening in to understand--this part of the Voting Rights Act is a preventive measure. It says that it allows for the Justice Department to move to prevent any kind of implementation of a change in the voting laws so that we won't have expensive litigation if something in it is not quite right. I believe that it is incumbent upon us to do what we can to employ methods that will not require citizens and the jurisdiction, their States, their cities and counties, to go to the expense of litigation when we can have an administrative procedure in place to take a look at what has been done and make a decision as to whether or not there is any possibility that someone's voting rights could be taken away. That is all this formula does. That is all section 5 is about. I would hope that those of us who traveled to Selma last week to renew our commitment to making this country of ours a more perfect Union will sit down in the near future, and before we get to the 50th anniversary of the signing of that 1965 Voting Rights Act, which comes on August 6 of this year, sometime between now and August 6, let's put in place the kind of amendments that would allow the Voting Rights Act to maintain the life that it has given to so many communities for so many years. I want to thank Ms. Kelly for putting together this Special Order. Let me close by saying: The longer I live, the more I get in touch with those old adages that we grew up with, one of which was ``an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure.'' I believe that these amendments that we are proposing are preventive measures, and it is much more valuable than for us to come back looking for a cure that could be very, very expensive. Ms. KELLY of Illinois. Thank you to the gentleman from South Carolina (Mr. Clyburn) for your important insight and your important comments. Now it is my honor to introduce the gentlelady from Texas, Congresswoman Sheila Jackson Lee. Ms. JACKSON LEE. Let me thank my colleagues and thank Congresswoman Kelly and Chairman Butterfield for the opportunity to carry forward the spirit of the 50th commemoration of the march over the Edmund Pettus Bridge. Let me also begin by thanking our colleague Congresswoman Terri Sewell and all of the Alabama delegation for their hospitality and their spirit of unity. In fact, Mr. Speaker, I am so moved by that experience that I frankly believe that now is the time to move the bill that is bipartisan that is a response to the United States Supreme Court to the floor of the House, to the Committee on the Judiciary and to the floor of the House. Leader Clyburn was very apt in describing a very significant point that really answers the question of the Supreme Court. If I had my way, coming from the State of Texas, I frankly believe that the reauthorization that we did through the Committee on the Judiciary, of which I am a member, and which I was very much engaged in in 2006 and 2007, was a thorough expose of the value of the Voting Rights Act. We did 15,000 pages of testimony, and witness after witness from different perspectives indicated that the formula that we were using at that time on the preclearance was an effective formula. Of course, the Supreme Court challenged the data, and I would only argue that it is appropriate to update the data. I welcome that. But we have gone even further. As has been articulated by the bill that has just been introduced by a number of us, we have crafted a formula that says it is an even playing field, an even playing field for a State to opt in because they have voting rights abuses for all people or to opt out because they have a smooth, evenhanded process for citizens in their State to vote. So I believe it is important that the message get out of what the Voting Rights Act stands for and what it meant for those foot soldiers to cross that bridge. They crossed that bridge, and they were willing-- and were bloodied, frankly--to do something nonviolent, and that is to petition their leaders at the voting box. I can't imagine that there is any Member here in this place, in this august Congress, that would not want to go to their constituents, whether they live in South Dakota or Utah or Mississippi or New York or Texas, as I do, that there is an unfettered right to vote. I will soon be introducing a Voting Rights Act that establishes the date that we signed the Voting Rights Act by the President that came from Texas, Lyndon Baines Johnson, with the leaders of Martin Luther King and John Lewis and many others standing at his side, to introduce that as being Voting Rights Act Day, to reinforce the value to Americans of the importance of voting. Who would want to oppose the idea that voting is not important? So I am looking forward to having Members join on the simple premise that it is important to vote in America and that it is important to commemorate the signing of the Voting Rights Act and make it Voting Rights Day. That inspiration came as we saw the thousands that were marching across the Edmund Pettus Bridge. Let me just clarify for a moment, under section 5, the submitting jurisdiction under the Voting Rights Act of 1965 and H.R. 885, Voting Rights Amendment Act of 2015, has to prove that the proposed changes are not retrogressive, that they do not have the purpose and will not have the effect of denying or abridging the right to vote on account of race or color. We have expanded that, again, to go by acts, by occurrences that would keep someone from voting. So I believed that this past weekend, or the weekend of Bloody Sunday, was a moving moment that would draw us together, that would allow us to understand H.R. 885. And might I say this: I know that many of us will be willing to have teach-ins to ensure that our colleagues understand the importance of this legislation and that we do it in a bipartisan manner. Let me conclude my remarks by saying, earlier today I stood on the floor and asked for a bipartisan approach to the approval of the Attorney General nominee by the other body. I say that from the spirit of recognition of the three branches of government. A President has nominated a very well-qualified, distinguished member of the bar, Loretta Lynch, to be the next Attorney General of the United States of America. We understand differences of opinion with legislation. I have no quarrel with those differences. I happen to support the human trafficking bill and recognize that there is a disagreement on language that I agree with the disagreement, but that disagreement can [[Page H1658]] be worked out through ongoing talks and however they want to approach it or a vote on the floor. But Loretta Lynch, the Attorney General nominee, should not be held up captive to disagreements on legislation and moving toward a constitutional crisis. All of this, Mr. Speaker, is wrapped up together. The Department of Justice enforces the Voting Rights Act, enforces the voting rights of Americans. As we look to the future, as we formulate the understanding of the three branches of government, to avoid a constitutional crisis of not having the leadership that is timely for the work that has to be done, I would hope the Senate would move forward, and I would hope that all of us would honor the Voting Rights Act and the message of Selma that we stand together under this wonderful flag and stand for voting rights for all. Since its passage in 1965, and through four reauthorizations signed by Republican presidents (1970, 1975, 1982, 2006), more Americans, especially those in the communities we represent, have been empowered by the Voting Rights Act of 1965 than any other single piece of legislation. Section 5 of the Act requires covered jurisdictions to submit proposed changes to any voting law or procedure to the Department of Justice or the U.S. District Court in Washington, D.C. for pre- approval, hence the term ``pre-clearance.'' Under Section 5, the submitting jurisdiction has the burden of proving that the proposed change(s) are not retrogressive, i.e. that they do not have the purpose and will not have the effect of denying or abridging the right to vote on account of race or color. In announcing his support for the 1982 extension of the Voting Rights Act, President Reagan said, ``the right to vote is the crown jewel of American liberties.'' And Section is the ``crown jewel'' of the Voting Rights Act. But a terrible blow was dealt to the Voting Rights Act on June 25, 2013, when the Supreme Court handed down the decision in Shelby County v. Holder, 537 U.S. 193 (2013), which invalidated Section 4(b), the provision of the law determining which jurisdictions would be subject to Section 5 ``pre-clearance.'' Facts of Shelby County v. Holder In 2006, the City of Calera, which lies within Shelby County, enacted a discriminatory redistricting plan without complying with Section 5, leading to the loss of the city's sole African-American councilman, Ernest Montgomery. In compliance with Section 5, however, Calera was required to draw a nondiscriminatory redistricting plan and conduct another election in which Mr. Montgomery regained his seat. According to the Supreme Court majority, the reason for striking down Section 4(b): ``Times change.'' Now, the Court was right; times have changed. But what the Court did not fully appreciate is that the positive changes it cited are due almost entirely to the existence and vigorous enforcement of the Voting Rights Act. And that is why the Voting Rights Act is still needed. Let me put it this way: in the same way that the vaccine invented by Dr. Jonas Salk in 1953 eradicated the crippling effects but did not eliminate the cause of polio, the Voting Rights Act succeeded in stymying the practices that resulted in the wholesale disenfranchisement of African Americans and language minorities but did eliminate them entirely. Before the Voting Rights Act was passed in 1965, the right to vote did not exist in practice for most African Americans. And until 1975, most American citizens who were not proficient in English faced significant obstacles to voting, because they could not understand the ballot. Asian Americans and Asian immigrants also suffered systematic exclusion from the political process. In 1964, the year before the Voting Rights Act became law, there were approximately 300 African-Americans in public office, including just three in Congress. Few, if any, black elected officials were elected anywhere in the South. Because of the Voting Rights Act, there are now more than 9,100 black elected officials, including 43 members of Congress, the largest number ever. The Voting Rights Act opened the political process for many of the approximately 6,000 Latino public officials that have been elected and appointed nationwide, including 263 at the state or federal level, 27 of whom serve in Congress. Now to be sure, the Supreme Court did not invalidate the preclearance provisions of Section 5; it only invalidated Section 4(b). But that is like leaving the car undamaged but destroying the key that unlocks the doors and starts the engine. According to the Court, the coverage formula in Section 4(b) had to be struck down because the data upon which it was based--registration rates and turn-out gaps--was too old and outdated. But my colleagues in Congress and I refuse to let the Voting Rights Act die. And so we went to work, crafting and drafting the legislation that would repair the damage done to the Voting Rights Act by the Supreme Court decision and capable of winning majorities in the House and Senate and the signature of the President. After months of hard work, consultation, negotiation, and collaboration, we produced and have reintroduced in the 114th Congress, a bill, H.R. 885, ``Voting Rights Amendments Act of 2015'' that can achieve these goals. To be sure, this legislation is not perfect, no bill ever is. But--and this is important--the bill represents an important step forward because it: 1. is responsive to the concern expressed by the Supreme Court; and 2. establishes a new coverage formula that is carefully tailored but sufficiently potent to protect the voting rights of all Americans. First, H.R. 885 specifies a new coverage formula that is based on current problems in voting and therefore directly responds to the Court's concern that the previous formula was outdated. The importance of this feature is hard to overestimate. Legislators and litigators understand that the likelihood of the Court upholding an amended statute that fails to correct the provision previously found to be defective is very low and indeed. H.R. 885 replaces the old ``static'' coverage formula with a new dynamic coverage formula, or ``rolling trigger,'' which works as follows: 1. for states, it requires at least one finding of discrimination at the state level and at least four adverse findings by its sub-jurisdictions within the previous 15 years; 2. for political subdivisions, it requires at least three adverse findings within the previous 15 years; but 3. political subdivisions with ``persistent and extremely low minority voter turnout,'' can also be covered if they have a single adverse finding of discrimination. The effect of the ``rolling trigger'' mechanism effectively gives the legislation nationwide reach because any state and any jurisdiction in any state potentially is subject to being covered if the requisite number of violations are found to have been committed. Prior to Shelby County v. Holder, the Voting Rights Act covered 16 states in whole or in part, including most of the states in the Deep South. The rolling trigger contained in H.R. 885, unfortunately, does not; at least not initially. The only states that would be covered initially under the new bill are: 1. Texas 2. North Carolina 3. Louisiana 4. Florida 5. South Carolina. To compensate for the fact that fewer jurisdictions are covered, our bill also includes several key provisions that are consistent with the needs created by a narrower Section 5 trigger. For example, H.R. 885: 1. Expands judicial ``bail-in'' authority under Section 3 so that it applies to voting changes that result in discrimination (not just intentional discrimination); 2. Requires nationwide transparency of ``late breaking'' voting changes; allocation of poll place resources; and changes within the boundaries of voting districts; 3. Clarifies and expands the ability of plaintiffs to seek a preliminary injunction against voting discrimination; and 4. Clarifies and expands Attorney General's authority to send election observers to protect against voting discrimination. The Voting Rights Act of 1965 is no ordinary piece of legislation. For millions of Americans, and many of us in Congress, the Voting Rights Act of 1965 is a sacred treasure, earned by the sweat and toil and tears and blood of ordinary Americans who showed the world it was possible to accomplish extraordinary things. ABOUT TEXAS NAACP V. BERRY (Texas Photo ID case; consolidated with Veasey v. Perry) 1. The suit alleges that the State of Texas' photo ID requirement for in-person voting, enacted in 2011, was adopted for discriminatory reasons, in violation of the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments and Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act, and has a discriminatory ``result'' in violation of Section 2. The case is consolidated with similar suits filed by the United States and other private plaintiffs. 2. Trial was held from September 2 to September 11, 2014, and closing arguments were presented on September 22, 2014. 3. On October 9, 2014, U.S. District Judge Nelva Gonzales Ramos issued a 147-page opinion in which she ruled that the Texas photo ID requirement violates both the U.S. Constitution and Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act. 4. Judge Ramos found that the law was enacted for the purpose of discriminating against African-American and Latino voters, and that it denies minority voters an equal opportunity to participate in the political process in violation of the Section 2 results standard. [[Page H1659]] 5. Judge Ramos also found that the photo ID law unconstitutionally burdens the right to vote, and functions as an unconstitutional poll tax. 6. On October 14, 2014, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit granted Texas' motion to stay the district court's permanent injunction until Texas' appeal is briefed, argued and decided. 7. On October 15, 2014, the Lawyers' Committee and co-counsel filed an emergency application with the Supreme Court to reinstate the district court's injunction. 8. On October 18, 2014, the Supreme Court denied the application to vacate the stay; Justice Ginsburg filed a dissent, joined by Justices Sotomayor and Kagan. 9. Oral argument before the 5th Circuit is scheduled to take place during the last week in April. 10. Previously, in a lawsuit litigated under Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act, a three-judge district court in Texas v. Holder, 888 F. Supp. 2d 113 (D.D.C. 2012), ruled that Texas' photo ID law did not satisfy the nondiscrimination requirements of Section 5. 11. However, the district court ruling was vacated by the Supreme Court, 133 S. Ct. 2886 (2013), following the Court's decision in Shelby County v. Holder, 133 S. Ct. 2612 (2013), that the geographic coverage formula for Section 5 is unconstitutional. Ms. KELLY of Illinois. I thank the gentlelady from Texas for her remarks. Now it is my honor to yield to the gentlelady from Milwaukee, Wisconsin, Congresswoman Gwen Moore. Ms. MOORE. Mr. Speaker, I was privileged just recently to stand hand in hand and shoulder to shoulder in Selma, Alabama, with 100 Members of Congress, with civil rights leaders, friends of the movement of all races from every State in the United States, with civil rights luminaries such as Mrs. Abernathy, Dorothy Cotton, Amelia Boynton--113 years old--Doris Crenshaw, and, of course, our very own colleague, John Lewis, who helped lead a march for a better life and more equality for all of America. But it was very, very hard to celebrate. There was a very sober mood in the crowd as we realized that the voting rights of Americans, particularly African Americans, were under threat 50 years after the Voting Rights Act was signed. As the President said in his remarks: Right now, in 2015, 50 years after Selma, there are laws across the country designed to make it harder for people to vote. {time} 2015 As we speak, more of such laws are being proposed. Meanwhile, the Voting Rights Act, the culmination of so much blood, so much sweat and tears, the product of so much sacrifice in the face of wanton violence, the Voting Rights Act stands weakened, its future subject to political rancor. As we think of those martyrs like Viola Liuzzo, James Earl Chaney, Andy Goodman, and Michael Schwerner, it is very, very difficult to deal with the reality that States such as the one that I hail from, Wisconsin, is one of the States who has joined the map of shame and passed one of the strictest voter ID laws in the country. In the following years since 2011, Wisconsin has been a battleground in fighting this pernicious law. In 2014, a Federal judge ruled that our voter ID law was unconstitutional and violated section 2 of the Voting Rights Act and the equal protection clause of the 14th Amendment. It found that 300,000 Wisconsinites lacked the proper ID needed under the law and that the law would have a disparate impact on Blacks and Latinos. Despite that powerful finding, the Federal district court was recklessly overturned by a three-judge panel in the Seventh Circuit. Right before our 2014 election, the United States Supreme Court stepped in and enjoined this law in an emergency stay to prevent them from implementing the voter ID law only 6 weeks before the 2014 election. Recently, members of the Congressional Black Caucus have sent an amicus brief, and I am optimistic that justice will prevail. I know that there have been many African Americans and people of other races who have marched across that Edmund Pettus Bridge. As a woman, I know that the brave suffragettes fought equal treatment for over 70 years while they faced humiliation and shame from society. History has made it so very, very clear that voting rights are so fundamental. The 14th Amendment to the Constitution protects voting rights; the 15th Amendment provided that males, even former slaves and males of any race, could vote; women's suffrage; with the 24th Amendment, poll taxes supposedly were eliminated, and the 26th Amendment allowed 18-year-olds to vote. Of course, we have the Voting Rights Act of 1965. I think it is very, very clear, when you look at the history of this protection, that it is one of the most constitutionally protected rights that there is. I would urge my colleagues here in this body to do more than hold hands and sing, ``We Shall Overcome,'' but to really pass laws to strengthen the Voting Rights Act. We have all heard the adage that history repeats itself, and we have seen a race across the country for Republican legislatures and Governors to pass these voter ID laws, but I think we also have the power to shape our future by drawing from the lessons of the past: our civil rights movement, our march in Selma, where we stood hand in hand, arm in arm, and fought back against this tide of oppression. Ms. KELLY of Illinois. I thank the gentlewoman from Wisconsin. Thank you for sharing your thoughts. Now, it is my honor to yield to the gentlewoman from Florida, Frederica Wilson. Ms. WILSON of Florida. In Miami-Dade County, I have a program called the 5000 Role Models of Excellence Project. It is a program of Black and Hispanic boys who are trying to grow up into good men. The Friday before Bloody Sunday, over 500 12th graders--graduating seniors--from that program went to a movie to watch a private screening of the movie ``Selma.'' I want to give a special shout-out to Nancy Sewell, who is the mother of Terri Sewell. As I watched the two of them on C-SPAN, MSNBC, and CNN, I was so proud of them. These boys were prepared by men who experienced the civil rights battles and know the bitter history and violent battles we had to endure. I wish I had the resources to take all 500 of them to Selma. During the movie, we planned a Twitter war. Thousands participated all across the Nation. Movie stars, rappers, sports legends, and the White House joined in the Twitter war. These boys will never be the same. They were visibly moved; and their applause, tears, hugs, and tweets proved their transformation. The next day, on that Saturday, when the President spoke, the Twitter war continued. It was based at my home. So many of them watched and marveled at Representative John Lewis, a card-carrying, sworn-in member of the 5000 Role Models of Excellence Project. They watched so proudly as he introduced the first Black President of the United States. In fact, he is the only President that they know. They are beyond proud. Why did I do this? I wanted as many students as possible to experience the importance of voting, and I am not finished. All 8,000 of them will see the movie as soon as it is released for distribution. This generation of children needs to know the importance of voting. They need to know what their forefathers had to endure so that they could vote. When I was on the Miami-Dade County School Board in 1996, we set up a process in partnership with the department of elections. Every eligible student is registered to vote in the 11th grade, and when they graduate and turn 18, their voter registration card is mailed to their homes. This is a policy that all school districts all across America should adopt. While they repair the damage to the Voting Rights Act through legislation, graduating seniors in Miami-Dade public schools--Black, White, and Hispanic--will still have the opportunity to vote. Every single one of them will vote. I hope that other school districts will adopt this policy so that children will know and understand the importance of voting. It is their voice. God of our weary years, God of our silent tears, let us as a people march on until victory is won. Ms. KELLY of Illinois. Thank you to the gentlewoman from Florida. Thank you for sharing your success stories. Hopefully, those can be duplicated. At this time, I yield to the gentlewoman from North Carolina, Congresswoman Alma Adams. Ms. ADAMS. Thank you, Congresswoman Kelly, for your leadership. I [[Page H1660]] appreciate what you are doing very much. Certainly, it is something that we need to do, and we must do. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to stress the importance of equal voting rights for everyone. Just over a week ago, I traveled to Selma with several of my colleagues to retrace the steps of those who shed blood as they tried, again, to gain equal access to the ballot box. As a professor for 40 years at Bennett College in North Carolina, I made sure that the students that passed through my classroom and our campus knew just how important it was to have their voices heard, and to this day, students know: ``Bennett Belles are voting belles.'' In 2013, the Supreme Court struck down a major provision of the Voting Rights Act limiting Federal oversight over State voting laws. Sadly, my home State of North Carolina quickly implemented voting laws that disenfranchise voters by making cuts to early voting, reenforcing strict ID requirements, and ending some preregistration programs which did not allow young high school students to be able to register to vote. As I think about those who risked their lives in order to exercise their right to vote, I cannot believe that 50 years later, in 2015, that simple freedom given to us in the Constitution is still under attack. It is time for all of us, Mr. Speaker, to come together to restore the Voting Rights Act, to ensure that every voter--no matter their race, no matter their class or creed--can make their voice heard and elect the leaders of their choice. Ms. KELLY of Illinois. I thank the gentlewoman from North Carolina, again, for her insight and comments. Here we are, 50 years removed from Selma, 50 years after Americans-- young and old, Black, White, Asian, Hispanic, Native American, Jewish-- made a decision to stand up for what they knew was right. They stood up for democracy and demanded fair and unobstructed access to the ballot. As you have heard this hour, the evolution to the America we are today has been a long and challenging journey. The Voting Rights Act has done much to make our Union more perfect, but the strength of the Voting Rights Act has been diminished. With new, discriminatory laws on the books, this Congress must act. This Congress can pass a bipartisan bill that extends section 5 of the Voting Rights Act. As was the case in Selma, the law is not equal for all. We must unite, as we did then. I urge my colleagues to take up this important issue and strengthen the Voting Rights Act. I would like to take this time to thank the gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. Butterfield) and all my colleagues who took the time to speak to us this evening. I yield back the balance of my time. Ms. FUDGE. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my colleagues Congressmen Payne and Kelly for leading the Congressional Black Caucus Special Order Hour. Mr. Speaker, fifty years ago 600 men and women began a peaceful march in Selma, Alabama to demand their full and equal right to participate in our democracy. Their quest for equal voting rights was met with physical violence and racial hatred on what has become known as ``Bloody Sunday.'' The marchers were turned back that day, but they remained steadfast. With unwavering determination, residents of Selma, civil rights activists, and inspired people from across the nation completed the march from Selma to Montgomery. Their heroism was instrumental in the passage of the Voting Rights Act of 1965; a watershed bipartisan action of the U.S. Congress. Fifty years later, on the anniversary of Bloody Sunday, I stood with President Obama and my House and Senate colleagues to honor the legacy of those brave foot soldiers for justice. But unfortunately, the battle wages on. There is still much to be done to ensure the sacrifice of those marchers was not in vain. The Supreme Court's decision in Shelby County v. Holder to strike down Section 4 of the Voting Rights Act left many Americans more vulnerable to voting discrimination. In the absence of this historic safeguard, numerous states have attempted to suppress voting through restrictive voter ID laws and limits on early voting. My home state of Ohio is one of them. Congress must act to restore Section 4 of the Voting Rights Act and update critical voter protections. In 2015, no eligible citizen should be disenfranchised. No eligible citizen should be denied full participation in our democracy. Let us recommit to rejecting intolerance and injustice in all forms, and continue the fight for equal voting rights for all Americans. ____________________","Congressional Record, Volume 161 Issue 44 (Monday, March 16, 2015) [Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 44 (Monday, March 16, 2015)] [House] [Pages H1653-H1660] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] THE BATTLE WAGES ON: SECURING EQUAL VOTING RIGHTS IN THE UNITED STATES The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under the Speaker's announced policy of January 6, 2015, the gentlewoman from Illinois (Ms. Kelly) is recognized for 60 minutes as the designee of the minority leader. General Leave Ms. KELLY of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members be given 5 days to revise and extend their remarks. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentlewoman from Illinois? There was no objection. Ms. KELLY of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, it is an honor and a privilege to be before you this evening on the heels of our Nation's recognizing the 50th anniversary of the Selma marchers which tore down many obstructive barriers to voting for African Americans and which led to the passage of the Voting Rights Act of 1965. We have grown as a nation since the night Jimmie Lee Jackson was murdered peacefully marching for voting rights in Alabama, and we are not the America we were when Mamie Till made the world see what had been done to her baby. But we are still living in dynamic times for our democracy. Selma has changed, but the issues of Ferguson, Missouri, remain. Nearly 60 years after Emmett Till was buried, Black mothers still worry about the value of their son's lives when they leave home. We are reminded of this every time we look into the eyes of Trayvon Martin's mother. We are better today than we were then, [[Page H1654]] and the changes we made to our laws paved our path to prosperity. The President spoke of this in Selma, and Republicans and Democrats alike were united in our feeling that we must uphold the promise of the Nation we inherited because of Selma. {time} 1930 The U.S. Senate should vote to confirm very qualified and exceptional U.S. Attorney Loretta Lynch as the next Attorney General. The CBC devoted an hour of floor testimony last month in defense of her confirmation, but in her role as Attorney General, Loretta Lynch will be tasked with defending the Federal laws that protect the right to vote, and that brings us to our topic this evening. Tonight's Congressional Black Caucus Special Order hour is entitled: ``The Battle Wages On: Securing Equal Voting Rights in the United States.'' This topic is truly timely. This conversation needs to take place now. Work remains to secure equal voting rights in the United States. Actions like the Supreme Court's decision to gut the Voting Rights Act remind us that the equality that should exist at the ballot is still lacking and why I dream of a day when the Voting Rights Act is no longer necessary. The truth is that voter discrimination and suppression remain as tragic legacies of our past. In the past few years, many States have introduced restrictive legislation that diminishes an individual's access to the voting booth. The Justice Department may have the tools to fix this problem and go after places that are discriminating against certain voters. In some places, getting a voter ID that you can use to vote can cost up to $150, and that can be a burden for someone who is on a fixed income and not driving anymore and doesn't have a license. Discriminatory laws and policies that hamper access to the ballot box are reasons that the protections and the Voting Rights Act are necessary. The VRA must remain intact as its principles are powerful democratic agents that make our Union more perfect. With that, I would like to kick off this Special Order hour by yielding to my colleague and anchor, a man who has dedicated his life to the issues of justice in America--a lawyer, judge, and statesman who has defended voting rights--the chairman of the Congressional Black Caucus, the Honorable G.K. Butterfield of North Carolina. Mr. BUTTERFIELD. Thank you very much, Congresswoman Kelly. Thank you for your leadership, and thank you for what you mean to the Congressional Black Caucus. The Congressional Black Caucus is now the largest caucus in our history. We are very proud to announce that we have 46 members now in CBC, representing more than 30 million people from 23 States, in addition to the District of Columbia and the Virgin Islands, so I am delighted that you have taken this responsibility each week, Ms. Kelly, to come to the floor and manage this time. Typically, Congressman Donald Payne would be joining Congresswoman Kelly tonight, but Mr. Payne is not able to come to the floor tonight to help with this Special Order due to, what I am told, is complications from foot surgery, so we wish Congressman Payne a very speedy recovery. Ms. Kelly, I wanted to particularly thank you for selecting this subject this evening. This is a very timely conversation that we must have in this Congress, and that is the whole subject of the Voting Rights Act. The topic that you have chosen, ``The Battle Wages On: Securing Equal Voting Rights in the United States,'' is so very appropriate; and, hopefully, in the next 2 or 3 minutes, I want to tell you why. Let me just start by explaining the whole voting rights story. Some of my colleagues may not fully appreciate it and understand that when we talk about voting rights, we just don't talk about 1965. In order to fully appreciate the voting rights history in this country, we must go back to the end of slavery when 4 million slaves became free. They did not have the right to vote. Once the 15th Amendment was added to the Constitution, then all of the former slave men got and obtained the right to vote. They got engaged. They got involved in the political process. From 1870 until 1900, a period of some 30 years, African American males, particularly in the South, were fully engaged in the political process. But do you know what? In 1900, Mr. Speaker, in 1900, that right to vote came to an end. It came to an end because of Southern States like South Carolina, North Carolina, Alabama, Mississippi, and the like, all of these Southern States passed disfranchisement laws, particularly a literacy test. This literacy test had the practical effect of denying the former slaves and their descendants the right to vote. Not only did you have to read and write in order to be able to register to vote, you had to convince the registrar that you were literate. The practical effect of that was that the whole voting rights movement during those days came to an abrupt end in 1901 when Congressman George H. White, who was one of my predecessors in North Carolina, stood on this House floor on March 3, 1901, and made a very profound welfare speech to the Congress. Mr. Speaker, that is the first era of voting rights in this country. The next era, I would say, would be from 1901 to 1965, when African Americans, for the most part, were not allowed to register to vote because of the literacy test and were not meaningfully involved. The next and final phase would be from 1965 until the present. In 1965, this Congress passed a historic 1965 Voting Rights Act, and it was a bipartisan bill. Democrats and Republicans promoted the bill all the way to the finish line with the help of then President Lyndon B. Johnson. The 1965 voting rights, Mr. Speaker, did many great things, but the three things that I will highlight tonight are: Number one, it eliminated the literacy test; number two, it gave a right of action, it gave to African American communities all across the United States the right to bring legal action to file civil lawsuits in Federal court to challenge discriminatory election laws or practices or procedures; the third part of the Voting Rights Act was what we now refer to as section 5. The Congress in 1965 set aside certain States in the country and certain subdivisions within a State to require them to get preclearance before election laws when new election laws went into effect. Many of our Southern States did not like section 5, but it was put on the books for a purpose because, if given the opportunity, these States were going to pass discriminatory election laws that made it very difficult for African Americans to vote. Section 5 has now been on the books since 1965. It has been strongly enforced by the Attorney General. Section 2 has been strongly enforced in courts all across the country. Now, we have 46 African Americans serving in Congress, we have thousands elected at State and local levels all across the country, and it was because of the Voting Rights Act in many respects. Well, Mr. Speaker, we received a great surprise on June 25 of 2013. The U.S. Supreme Court declared that section 5 could not be enforced because the formula that gives life to section 5, which is section 4, the court said that section 4 needed to be updated and called on this Congress to amend section 4 to make it more contemporary in its application. This Congress has failed to act. Now, this is the spring of 2015, and we have failed to act. Our voting rights are under continuous assault with more and more States and counties enacting voting laws that, on their face, appear to not be an impediment to voting. Many of these new laws are discriminatory, I want you to know. Some are intended to be. Others, though not intentional, will have a discriminatory result. In closing, Mr. Speaker, I am just unable to understand why my Republican colleagues refuse to support an amendment to section 5 to make this provision compliant with the Supreme Court decision. Through the years, this Congress has been called upon to extend section 5, and it has done so in a bipartisan way. In 2006, as section 5 was about to expire then, there was a bipartisan bill passed by this Congress, signed by President [[Page H1655]] George W. Bush. There were 192 Republicans who voted for the bill. I want to say that to you again, my colleagues: 192 Republicans voted to extend section 5 just a few years ago. I saluted them then; I salute them now. Sixty-six of those Republicans continue to serve in the House today, including the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, Mr. Goodlatte. Mr. Speaker, we must fix section 5 to comply with the Supreme Court's decision to update the formula. If we continue down this path and if we do nothing, the practical effect will be that jurisdictions will pass election laws or implement election practices or procedures that will discriminate, and we know it, and we must prevent it from happening. The only remedy African American communities have to obtain redress from discriminatory practices will be to file very expensive litigation. In the meantime, the law, the new law goes into effect. If section 5 was in place, there wouldn't be the need for expensive litigation. The jurisdiction would simply be required to make a showing to the Department of Justice, and the Attorney General would determine the effect of the change on minority voting strength. That is the way we have done it for the last 50 years. I call on my Republican colleagues to please join with us in a bipartisan, bicameral effort to fix the formula so that section 5 can be enforced in our country. Thank you, Ms. Kelly. Ms. KELLY of Illinois. Thank you, Congressman Butterfield. It is now my honor to introduce the gentlewoman from Alabama, one that was our gracious host last weekend, and we appreciate everything she did, Terri Sewell. Ms. SEWELL of Alabama. Mr. Speaker, on March 7, 2015, nearly 100 Members of Congress from both sides of the aisle went to Selma to commemorate the 50th anniversary of Bloody Sunday and the 1965 march from Selma to Montgomery. I was humbled to welcome so many of my colleagues in Congress to my hometown of Selma, Alabama. It meant a lot to me and the State of Alabama to also welcome President and Mrs. Obama and their daughters, as well as President and Mrs. George W. Bush to Selma to commemorate the significant events in American history. The Selma movement for voting rights was a uniquely American story of how ordinary Americans working together achieved extraordinary social change. I want to thank all of the Members and everyone who participated in the Faith & Politics pilgrimage to Alabama this year. I especially want to thank my Alabama colleagues--Senator Sessions, Representative Martha Roby, Representative Robert Aderholt, Representative Bradley Byrne, and Representative Gary Palmer--for their participation in the delegation. A special thanks to Congressman John Lewis and the Faith & Politics Institute for a job well done. You know, Mr. Speaker, the opportunity to walk in the footsteps of John Lewis with John Lewis is an unforgettable experience that is truly transformative. The bipartisan participation by Republicans and Democrats alike was truly something to behold, especially given the hyperpartisanship of Washington. It was something to see us gather together in Selma, Alabama, to honor the sacrifices of the foot soldiers who dared to fight for voter equality 50 years ago. I tried not to have any expectation from this bipartisan showing, but I must admit my hope was that all of us would be motivated by the experience of traveling with John Lewis, in his footsteps with him, to honestly look at modern-day threats to voting rights today. Now that the spotlight is no longer on Selma, we must move beyond the bridge and see that there is still a need to fight to ensure that all Americans can participate equally in the political process. New barriers to voting rights have been legitimized in State legislatures across this country. Photo ID laws and efforts nationwide to get rid of early voting or weekend voting are modern-day efforts that have had the profound effect of restricting access to voting. Any effort that restricts or decreases the likelihood of citizens to vote is a threat to the voting rights of all Americans. There is no denying that modern-day laws imposed to ostensibly prevent voter fraud has had the ``unintended consequence'' of making it much harder for certain sectors of the population to vote. My father is a perfect example of an individual who has found it harder to vote because of these modern-day laws. Prior to the State of Alabama imposing a photo ID law to vote, my father, Andrew, a stroke victim who has been wheelchair bound for the last 10 years, had been voting by using his federally issued Social Security card, which does not have a photo; but once the law was imposed, my father--who no longer drives, who no longer works, is retired--had no way of getting a photo ID. After the Alabama law changed, my mother and I made sure that my father would get a photo ID to vote. The effort was tremendous. We transported my father in a special wheelchair access van and got him into the old Dallas County courthouse, which was grandfathered in from having ADA laws and, therefore, no wheelchair ramp. Once inside the courthouse, the elevator to the registrar's office was being serviced, and we had to wait an hour in order to use it. Once we finally got to the office of the board of registrars, there was only one person waiting on 25 people in line. My mother and father persevered. They persevered to make sure that my father got a photo ID that day because he was resolved in voting because his daughter was on the ballot for reelection. {time} 1945 Just think of all of the seniors or disabled citizens who do not have a relative or a person to take them to get a photo ID. This photo requirement definitely reduces the number of and the ability of certain segments of the society to exercise their right to vote. In the Supreme Court ruling which invalidated the preclearance provisions of the VRA, the Court said that the formula used by Congress to determine the covered States was outdated, and it implied that there was no need for the Voting Rights Act today since, after all, there was an African American elected as President. Oh, how shortsighted the Supreme Court was. As long as there are vulnerable communities that face barriers to voting, there is still a need for Federal protection. Just last year, after the Supreme Court ruling, the city of Evergreen, Alabama, came under Federal scrutiny for unfairly excluding African Americans from the voting rolls and for attempting to further dilute their voting power with a redistricting plan that would pack its majority Black population into only two of the five municipal districts. Incidences like this in Evergreen, Alabama, remind us that progress is always illusive and that the injustice suffered on the Edmund Pettus Bridge 50 years ago has not been fully vindicated. Mr. Speaker, beyond the bridge, there are still laws that explicitly or unintentionally limit the access of Americans to vote. Now that we have commemorated the movement that led to the passage of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, what are we going to do to protect the progress that has been made and to expand access to the sacred right to vote? On March 7, 2015, while en route to Selma, President Obama signed H.R. 431, the bill that awarded a Congressional Gold Medal to the foot soldiers of the Selma to Montgomery march of 1965. Finally, this Nation is acknowledging the bravery of these foot soldiers, who dared to make this Nation live up to its ideals of justice and equality for all. While a great honor, a medal is not adequate repayment for their sacrifice. Mr. Speaker, the greatest tribute that we as Members of Congress can give is to work honestly and earnestly on a bipartisan bill to restore Federal voting protections to vulnerable communities under the Voting Rights Act. While I applaud bipartisan efforts made in the Voting Rights Amendment Act of 2015, which creates a new formula that would determine which jurisdictions require Federal preclearance, this new formula that is in the current VRA Amendment Act omits key States, key States like North Carolina, South [[Page H1656]] Carolina, and Alabama. I can't imagine, Mr. Speaker, that the very State--Alabama--that prompted the Voting Rights Act that was signed into law 50 years ago would now not be afforded the protection of Federal oversight. The fight for voting rights was born in Alabama, and on my watch, it will not die there. Voting rights advocates and everyday citizens must remain vigilant and do all that they can to safeguard against efforts to constrict democracy in State and local governments. Our democracy requires it. We can all pay a debt of gratitude to those foot soldiers by voting in every election--local, State, and Federal. We all have our part to play, and we in Congress can play a vital role. To echo the President's call to action, President Obama said on that day: Selma shows us that America is not the project of any one person. The single most powerful word in our democracy is the word ``we.'' We the people are tasked with strengthening and safeguarding our democracy. We the people are responsible for ensuring our Nation lives up to its very principles. On the 50th anniversary of the Voting Rights Act and the historic march from Selma to Montgomery, I urge my colleagues--Democrats and Republicans alike--to recommit ourselves to the work that was done by our predecessors, to work together to restore the Voting Rights Act for all Americans. That is the least we can do on this, the 50th anniversary. I look forward to this august body taking up a voting rights amendment act that fully restores Federal protection to all vulnerable communities so that all Americans can definitely exercise that sacred right to vote. Ms. KELLY of Illinois. Thank you to the gentlewoman from Alabama. Thank you for sharing the challenges citizens like your dad can have in complying with the new Voting Rights Act law. Thank you for standing up. At this time, I would like to introduce the fierce and gentle woman from the District of Columbia, Eleanor Holmes Norton. Ms. NORTON. I thank my good friend, Representative Robin Kelly from Illinois, for her leadership on this night, this first night back. For Members back from Selma, I appreciate that our chair of the Congressional Black Caucus has been here to give us very important background and history. I particularly appreciate that we have just heard from a Member from Alabama, itself, Representative Terri Sewell, and all of that seems to me to be the appropriate prelude for what we are doing here tonight. Mr. Speaker, yes, this is the first day we are back from this historic trip and are back from the 50th anniversary of the Voting Rights Act. There is no place for the almost 100 Members who went to Selma to be but on this floor this evening. I want to thank Attorney General Holder for taking the crippled Voting Rights Act and continuing to enforce it. The trip to Selma essentially set the stage for Members to come back and to regard our trip as a call to action and get down to work to revitalize the 1965 Voting Rights Act. My thanks to Representative Jim Sensenbrenner and to Representative John Conyers for cosponsoring a revised version of the act. My thanks to John Lewis, who has kept Selma and the Voting Rights Act alive by his annual trips with Members and others to Selma. I am appreciative of the almost 100 Members from both parties who went to Selma on the 6th and 7th. What was the purpose of going? It could not have been a celebration. You can celebrate the 1964 Civil Rights Act. It has not been dismembered. You can celebrate the 1968 fair housing law. It still is on the books. But you go to Selma to try to bring back to its full glory the Voting Rights Act of 1965, where setback with section 5 has rendered the act virtually obsolete for most of its original purposes. I stress that the Supreme Court did not invalidate the 1965 Voting Rights Act. It invited the 100 Members who went to Selma and the others in this body to modernize the act. We may differ on how to do that. I do not think there can be any doubt that it has to be revised and that we have to meet the challenge that the Supreme Court has given us. After all, the Voting Rights Act has prevented, literally, hundreds of discriminatory voting practices, and there were countless practices that it simply deterred. I must say that I was disappointed that, early on in this session, the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, Representative Goodlatte, indicated that he did not believe that the act was necessary, and he talked about the 11 Southern States that had been under the act. The fact is that the preclearance Voting Rights Act requirements went far beyond those States. At the time of the Supreme Court decision in 2013, Arizona and Alaska were covered. Parts of California, New York, South Dakota, and Michigan were covered. In the past, parts of Hawaii, Colorado, New Hampshire, Idaho, Connecticut, Massachusetts, Wyoming, Maine, New Mexico, and Oklahoma have been covered. It is true that at the heart of the coverage were the 11 Southern States, but that is where the heart of the violations were, in fact, tracked. That is where the poll taxes were. That is where the violations were. There has been a compromise bill that has been put forward by Mr. Sensenbrenner and Mr. Conyers. In the very act of going to Selma, there was put upon us an obligation to come back and respond to that trip. The bill before us has tried to meet some of the objections that were raised. There is a rolling preclearance formula, for example, that does not require congressional reauthorization. There is a bail-in section of the act to reach those who had not been covered. There are a minimum number of violations over a period of time that have to be recorded in order for a state to come under the act. As my good friend from Alabama, Terri Sewell, says, the act is not what all of us wanted, but it does mean that in the spirit of compromise and because of the necessity of this act, this act which democratized the South and is necessary now--perhaps not as necessary as it was 50 years ago--but no one can doubt, as a Supreme Court Justice himself said when he said he didn't doubt that there was still discrimination in voting practices, but he said it was up to the Congress to modernize the bill. I don't see how almost 100 Republican and Democratic Members can have gone to Selma on the 50th anniversary without coming back to revise the act. We went emptyhanded. We went without a bill. I hope that what we got in Selma was the gumption to come back and to put forward a bill. Yes, the act has been dismembered by the Supreme Court, but the Court asked us to reshape it. It asked us to restore it. It was one thing to go without a bill. It is quite another to come back and do nothing about a bill. The President did not hesitate to say where the responsibility, in fact, lies, and I am quoting from his speech in Selma: One hundred Members of Congress have come here today to honor people who were willing to die for the right it protects. If we want to honor this day, let these 100 go back to Washington and gather 400 more and, together, pledge to make it their mission to restore the law this year. That is our mission. The trip to Selma, where we went in the name of the entire Congress, demands that we act before the end of this Congress. Ms. KELLY of Illinois. Thank you so much to the gentlewoman from Washington, D.C. At this time, I would like to introduce the gentleman from South Carolina, our leader, James Clyburn. (Mr. CLYBURN asked and was given permission to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. CLYBURN. Mr. Speaker, I often refer to this Hall as America's classroom. I do that because I do believe that, as we conduct ourselves here on this floor, it is to set an example for all citizens, especially our young citizens, who look in on our proceedings and get some idea about how they ought to conduct themselves as Americans going forward. One of those things, I think, that we ought to be very careful of is how we address the rights and responsibilities that we all have as citizens. {time} 2000 We teach our children in our classrooms and in our homes that the right to vote is basic to this democracy of ours. I know that all of us are aware that in our past it is a right that has not always been practiced, but in its [[Page H1657]] wisdom this body, acting collectively, decided back in 1965 that it would do something about making right the wrongs that have been heaped upon citizens for decades when it comes to voting. And so we did. A formula was adopted that was based upon the 1964 results of the Presidential election. We have renewed time and time again that law, always updating under that formula; but several months ago the United States Supreme Court looked at the formula and decided that the formula had outlived its usefulness, but the Voting Rights Act was still needed. They invited the Congress to take a look at the formula and update it, as the chair said, and to make it more contemporary. We have worked for months. I want to thank Mr. Sensenbrenner of Wisconsin and Mr. Conyers of Michigan for the work they have done to put together some amendments that would update that formula. This time we decided to look back just a few years and to see, within the last 10 or 12 years, what jurisdictions have still continued to violate people's rights and who have been found guilty of doing so. Rather than apply the formula to everybody, what we will do is come up with a series of wrongs, put some numerical qualification on it, and make a new formula. Now, that formula is not going to cover South Carolina today, but under the formula, any jurisdiction, any State that permits these kinds of atrocities and is found to have done so, they will be brought under the formula. So the formula applies to every jurisdiction in the country. I think that it is time for us to be honest that everybody will not do right, but we should have something in place so when a jurisdiction fails to do right, we will have a mechanism to address those ills. Now, let me hasten to add--and I want all that are listening in to understand--this part of the Voting Rights Act is a preventive measure. It says that it allows for the Justice Department to move to prevent any kind of implementation of a change in the voting laws so that we won't have expensive litigation if something in it is not quite right. I believe that it is incumbent upon us to do what we can to employ methods that will not require citizens and the jurisdiction, their States, their cities and counties, to go to the expense of litigation when we can have an administrative procedure in place to take a look at what has been done and make a decision as to whether or not there is any possibility that someone's voting rights could be taken away. That is all this formula does. That is all section 5 is about. I would hope that those of us who traveled to Selma last week to renew our commitment to making this country of ours a more perfect Union will sit down in the near future, and before we get to the 50th anniversary of the signing of that 1965 Voting Rights Act, which comes on August 6 of this year, sometime between now and August 6, let's put in place the kind of amendments that would allow the Voting Rights Act to maintain the life that it has given to so many communities for so many years. I want to thank Ms. Kelly for putting together this Special Order. Let me close by saying: The longer I live, the more I get in touch with those old adages that we grew up with, one of which was ``an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure.'' I believe that these amendments that we are proposing are preventive measures, and it is much more valuable than for us to come back looking for a cure that could be very, very expensive. Ms. KELLY of Illinois. Thank you to the gentleman from South Carolina (Mr. Clyburn) for your important insight and your important comments. Now it is my honor to introduce the gentlelady from Texas, Congresswoman Sheila Jackson Lee. Ms. JACKSON LEE. Let me thank my colleagues and thank Congresswoman Kelly and Chairman Butterfield for the opportunity to carry forward the spirit of the 50th commemoration of the march over the Edmund Pettus Bridge. Let me also begin by thanking our colleague Congresswoman Terri Sewell and all of the Alabama delegation for their hospitality and their spirit of unity. In fact, Mr. Speaker, I am so moved by that experience that I frankly believe that now is the time to move the bill that is bipartisan that is a response to the United States Supreme Court to the floor of the House, to the Committee on the Judiciary and to the floor of the House. Leader Clyburn was very apt in describing a very significant point that really answers the question of the Supreme Court. If I had my way, coming from the State of Texas, I frankly believe that the reauthorization that we did through the Committee on the Judiciary, of which I am a member, and which I was very much engaged in in 2006 and 2007, was a thorough expose of the value of the Voting Rights Act. We did 15,000 pages of testimony, and witness after witness from different perspectives indicated that the formula that we were using at that time on the preclearance was an effective formula. Of course, the Supreme Court challenged the data, and I would only argue that it is appropriate to update the data. I welcome that. But we have gone even further. As has been articulated by the bill that has just been introduced by a number of us, we have crafted a formula that says it is an even playing field, an even playing field for a State to opt in because they have voting rights abuses for all people or to opt out because they have a smooth, evenhanded process for citizens in their State to vote. So I believe it is important that the message get out of what the Voting Rights Act stands for and what it meant for those foot soldiers to cross that bridge. They crossed that bridge, and they were willing-- and were bloodied, frankly--to do something nonviolent, and that is to petition their leaders at the voting box. I can't imagine that there is any Member here in this place, in this august Congress, that would not want to go to their constituents, whether they live in South Dakota or Utah or Mississippi or New York or Texas, as I do, that there is an unfettered right to vote. I will soon be introducing a Voting Rights Act that establishes the date that we signed the Voting Rights Act by the President that came from Texas, Lyndon Baines Johnson, with the leaders of Martin Luther King and John Lewis and many others standing at his side, to introduce that as being Voting Rights Act Day, to reinforce the value to Americans of the importance of voting. Who would want to oppose the idea that voting is not important? So I am looking forward to having Members join on the simple premise that it is important to vote in America and that it is important to commemorate the signing of the Voting Rights Act and make it Voting Rights Day. That inspiration came as we saw the thousands that were marching across the Edmund Pettus Bridge. Let me just clarify for a moment, under section 5, the submitting jurisdiction under the Voting Rights Act of 1965 and H.R. 885, Voting Rights Amendment Act of 2015, has to prove that the proposed changes are not retrogressive, that they do not have the purpose and will not have the effect of denying or abridging the right to vote on account of race or color. We have expanded that, again, to go by acts, by occurrences that would keep someone from voting. So I believed that this past weekend, or the weekend of Bloody Sunday, was a moving moment that would draw us together, that would allow us to understand H.R. 885. And might I say this: I know that many of us will be willing to have teach-ins to ensure that our colleagues understand the importance of this legislation and that we do it in a bipartisan manner. Let me conclude my remarks by saying, earlier today I stood on the floor and asked for a bipartisan approach to the approval of the Attorney General nominee by the other body. I say that from the spirit of recognition of the three branches of government. A President has nominated a very well-qualified, distinguished member of the bar, Loretta Lynch, to be the next Attorney General of the United States of America. We understand differences of opinion with legislation. I have no quarrel with those differences. I happen to support the human trafficking bill and recognize that there is a disagreement on language that I agree with the disagreement, but that disagreement can [[Page H1658]] be worked out through ongoing talks and however they want to approach it or a vote on the floor. But Loretta Lynch, the Attorney General nominee, should not be held up captive to disagreements on legislation and moving toward a constitutional crisis. All of this, Mr. Speaker, is wrapped up together. The Department of Justice enforces the Voting Rights Act, enforces the voting rights of Americans. As we look to the future, as we formulate the understanding of the three branches of government, to avoid a constitutional crisis of not having the leadership that is timely for the work that has to be done, I would hope the Senate would move forward, and I would hope that all of us would honor the Voting Rights Act and the message of Selma that we stand together under this wonderful flag and stand for voting rights for all. Since its passage in 1965, and through four reauthorizations signed by Republican presidents (1970, 1975, 1982, 2006), more Americans, especially those in the communities we represent, have been empowered by the Voting Rights Act of 1965 than any other single piece of legislation. Section 5 of the Act requires covered jurisdictions to submit proposed changes to any voting law or procedure to the Department of Justice or the U.S. District Court in Washington, D.C. for pre- approval, hence the term ``pre-clearance.'' Under Section 5, the submitting jurisdiction has the burden of proving that the proposed change(s) are not retrogressive, i.e. that they do not have the purpose and will not have the effect of denying or abridging the right to vote on account of race or color. In announcing his support for the 1982 extension of the Voting Rights Act, President Reagan said, ``the right to vote is the crown jewel of American liberties.'' And Section is the ``crown jewel'' of the Voting Rights Act. But a terrible blow was dealt to the Voting Rights Act on June 25, 2013, when the Supreme Court handed down the decision in Shelby County v. Holder, 537 U.S. 193 (2013), which invalidated Section 4(b), the provision of the law determining which jurisdictions would be subject to Section 5 ``pre-clearance.'' Facts of Shelby County v. Holder In 2006, the City of Calera, which lies within Shelby County, enacted a discriminatory redistricting plan without complying with Section 5, leading to the loss of the city's sole African-American councilman, Ernest Montgomery. In compliance with Section 5, however, Calera was required to draw a nondiscriminatory redistricting plan and conduct another election in which Mr. Montgomery regained his seat. According to the Supreme Court majority, the reason for striking down Section 4(b): ``Times change.'' Now, the Court was right; times have changed. But what the Court did not fully appreciate is that the positive changes it cited are due almost entirely to the existence and vigorous enforcement of the Voting Rights Act. And that is why the Voting Rights Act is still needed. Let me put it this way: in the same way that the vaccine invented by Dr. Jonas Salk in 1953 eradicated the crippling effects but did not eliminate the cause of polio, the Voting Rights Act succeeded in stymying the practices that resulted in the wholesale disenfranchisement of African Americans and language minorities but did eliminate them entirely. Before the Voting Rights Act was passed in 1965, the right to vote did not exist in practice for most African Americans. And until 1975, most American citizens who were not proficient in English faced significant obstacles to voting, because they could not understand the ballot. Asian Americans and Asian immigrants also suffered systematic exclusion from the political process. In 1964, the year before the Voting Rights Act became law, there were approximately 300 African-Americans in public office, including just three in Congress. Few, if any, black elected officials were elected anywhere in the South. Because of the Voting Rights Act, there are now more than 9,100 black elected officials, including 43 members of Congress, the largest number ever. The Voting Rights Act opened the political process for many of the approximately 6,000 Latino public officials that have been elected and appointed nationwide, including 263 at the state or federal level, 27 of whom serve in Congress. Now to be sure, the Supreme Court did not invalidate the preclearance provisions of Section 5; it only invalidated Section 4(b). But that is like leaving the car undamaged but destroying the key that unlocks the doors and starts the engine. According to the Court, the coverage formula in Section 4(b) had to be struck down because the data upon which it was based--registration rates and turn-out gaps--was too old and outdated. But my colleagues in Congress and I refuse to let the Voting Rights Act die. And so we went to work, crafting and drafting the legislation that would repair the damage done to the Voting Rights Act by the Supreme Court decision and capable of winning majorities in the House and Senate and the signature of the President. After months of hard work, consultation, negotiation, and collaboration, we produced and have reintroduced in the 114th Congress, a bill, H.R. 885, ``Voting Rights Amendments Act of 2015'' that can achieve these goals. To be sure, this legislation is not perfect, no bill ever is. But--and this is important--the bill represents an important step forward because it: 1. is responsive to the concern expressed by the Supreme Court; and 2. establishes a new coverage formula that is carefully tailored but sufficiently potent to protect the voting rights of all Americans. First, H.R. 885 specifies a new coverage formula that is based on current problems in voting and therefore directly responds to the Court's concern that the previous formula was outdated. The importance of this feature is hard to overestimate. Legislators and litigators understand that the likelihood of the Court upholding an amended statute that fails to correct the provision previously found to be defective is very low and indeed. H.R. 885 replaces the old ``static'' coverage formula with a new dynamic coverage formula, or ``rolling trigger,'' which works as follows: 1. for states, it requires at least one finding of discrimination at the state level and at least four adverse findings by its sub-jurisdictions within the previous 15 years; 2. for political subdivisions, it requires at least three adverse findings within the previous 15 years; but 3. political subdivisions with ``persistent and extremely low minority voter turnout,'' can also be covered if they have a single adverse finding of discrimination. The effect of the ``rolling trigger'' mechanism effectively gives the legislation nationwide reach because any state and any jurisdiction in any state potentially is subject to being covered if the requisite number of violations are found to have been committed. Prior to Shelby County v. Holder, the Voting Rights Act covered 16 states in whole or in part, including most of the states in the Deep South. The rolling trigger contained in H.R. 885, unfortunately, does not; at least not initially. The only states that would be covered initially under the new bill are: 1. Texas 2. North Carolina 3. Louisiana 4. Florida 5. South Carolina. To compensate for the fact that fewer jurisdictions are covered, our bill also includes several key provisions that are consistent with the needs created by a narrower Section 5 trigger. For example, H.R. 885: 1. Expands judicial ``bail-in'' authority under Section 3 so that it applies to voting changes that result in discrimination (not just intentional discrimination); 2. Requires nationwide transparency of ``late breaking'' voting changes; allocation of poll place resources; and changes within the boundaries of voting districts; 3. Clarifies and expands the ability of plaintiffs to seek a preliminary injunction against voting discrimination; and 4. Clarifies and expands Attorney General's authority to send election observers to protect against voting discrimination. The Voting Rights Act of 1965 is no ordinary piece of legislation. For millions of Americans, and many of us in Congress, the Voting Rights Act of 1965 is a sacred treasure, earned by the sweat and toil and tears and blood of ordinary Americans who showed the world it was possible to accomplish extraordinary things. ABOUT TEXAS NAACP V. BERRY (Texas Photo ID case; consolidated with Veasey v. Perry) 1. The suit alleges that the State of Texas' photo ID requirement for in-person voting, enacted in 2011, was adopted for discriminatory reasons, in violation of the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments and Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act, and has a discriminatory ``result'' in violation of Section 2. The case is consolidated with similar suits filed by the United States and other private plaintiffs. 2. Trial was held from September 2 to September 11, 2014, and closing arguments were presented on September 22, 2014. 3. On October 9, 2014, U.S. District Judge Nelva Gonzales Ramos issued a 147-page opinion in which she ruled that the Texas photo ID requirement violates both the U.S. Constitution and Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act. 4. Judge Ramos found that the law was enacted for the purpose of discriminating against African-American and Latino voters, and that it denies minority voters an equal opportunity to participate in the political process in violation of the Section 2 results standard. [[Page H1659]] 5. Judge Ramos also found that the photo ID law unconstitutionally burdens the right to vote, and functions as an unconstitutional poll tax. 6. On October 14, 2014, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit granted Texas' motion to stay the district court's permanent injunction until Texas' appeal is briefed, argued and decided. 7. On October 15, 2014, the Lawyers' Committee and co-counsel filed an emergency application with the Supreme Court to reinstate the district court's injunction. 8. On October 18, 2014, the Supreme Court denied the application to vacate the stay; Justice Ginsburg filed a dissent, joined by Justices Sotomayor and Kagan. 9. Oral argument before the 5th Circuit is scheduled to take place during the last week in April. 10. Previously, in a lawsuit litigated under Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act, a three-judge district court in Texas v. Holder, 888 F. Supp. 2d 113 (D.D.C. 2012), ruled that Texas' photo ID law did not satisfy the nondiscrimination requirements of Section 5. 11. However, the district court ruling was vacated by the Supreme Court, 133 S. Ct. 2886 (2013), following the Court's decision in Shelby County v. Holder, 133 S. Ct. 2612 (2013), that the geographic coverage formula for Section 5 is unconstitutional. Ms. KELLY of Illinois. I thank the gentlelady from Texas for her remarks. Now it is my honor to yield to the gentlelady from Milwaukee, Wisconsin, Congresswoman Gwen Moore. Ms. MOORE. Mr. Speaker, I was privileged just recently to stand hand in hand and shoulder to shoulder in Selma, Alabama, with 100 Members of Congress, with civil rights leaders, friends of the movement of all races from every State in the United States, with civil rights luminaries such as Mrs. Abernathy, Dorothy Cotton, Amelia Boynton--113 years old--Doris Crenshaw, and, of course, our very own colleague, John Lewis, who helped lead a march for a better life and more equality for all of America. But it was very, very hard to celebrate. There was a very sober mood in the crowd as we realized that the voting rights of Americans, particularly African Americans, were under threat 50 years after the Voting Rights Act was signed. As the President said in his remarks: Right now, in 2015, 50 years after Selma, there are laws across the country designed to make it harder for people to vote. {time} 2015 As we speak, more of such laws are being proposed. Meanwhile, the Voting Rights Act, the culmination of so much blood, so much sweat and tears, the product of so much sacrifice in the face of wanton violence, the Voting Rights Act stands weakened, its future subject to political rancor. As we think of those martyrs like Viola Liuzzo, James Earl Chaney, Andy Goodman, and Michael Schwerner, it is very, very difficult to deal with the reality that States such as the one that I hail from, Wisconsin, is one of the States who has joined the map of shame and passed one of the strictest voter ID laws in the country. In the following years since 2011, Wisconsin has been a battleground in fighting this pernicious law. In 2014, a Federal judge ruled that our voter ID law was unconstitutional and violated section 2 of the Voting Rights Act and the equal protection clause of the 14th Amendment. It found that 300,000 Wisconsinites lacked the proper ID needed under the law and that the law would have a disparate impact on Blacks and Latinos. Despite that powerful finding, the Federal district court was recklessly overturned by a three-judge panel in the Seventh Circuit. Right before our 2014 election, the United States Supreme Court stepped in and enjoined this law in an emergency stay to prevent them from implementing the voter ID law only 6 weeks before the 2014 election. Recently, members of the Congressional Black Caucus have sent an amicus brief, and I am optimistic that justice will prevail. I know that there have been many African Americans and people of other races who have marched across that Edmund Pettus Bridge. As a woman, I know that the brave suffragettes fought equal treatment for over 70 years while they faced humiliation and shame from society. History has made it so very, very clear that voting rights are so fundamental. The 14th Amendment to the Constitution protects voting rights; the 15th Amendment provided that males, even former slaves and males of any race, could vote; women's suffrage; with the 24th Amendment, poll taxes supposedly were eliminated, and the 26th Amendment allowed 18-year-olds to vote. Of course, we have the Voting Rights Act of 1965. I think it is very, very clear, when you look at the history of this protection, that it is one of the most constitutionally protected rights that there is. I would urge my colleagues here in this body to do more than hold hands and sing, ``We Shall Overcome,'' but to really pass laws to strengthen the Voting Rights Act. We have all heard the adage that history repeats itself, and we have seen a race across the country for Republican legislatures and Governors to pass these voter ID laws, but I think we also have the power to shape our future by drawing from the lessons of the past: our civil rights movement, our march in Selma, where we stood hand in hand, arm in arm, and fought back against this tide of oppression. Ms. KELLY of Illinois. I thank the gentlewoman from Wisconsin. Thank you for sharing your thoughts. Now, it is my honor to yield to the gentlewoman from Florida, Frederica Wilson. Ms. WILSON of Florida. In Miami-Dade County, I have a program called the 5000 Role Models of Excellence Project. It is a program of Black and Hispanic boys who are trying to grow up into good men. The Friday before Bloody Sunday, over 500 12th graders--graduating seniors--from that program went to a movie to watch a private screening of the movie ``Selma.'' I want to give a special shout-out to Nancy Sewell, who is the mother of Terri Sewell. As I watched the two of them on C-SPAN, MSNBC, and CNN, I was so proud of them. These boys were prepared by men who experienced the civil rights battles and know the bitter history and violent battles we had to endure. I wish I had the resources to take all 500 of them to Selma. During the movie, we planned a Twitter war. Thousands participated all across the Nation. Movie stars, rappers, sports legends, and the White House joined in the Twitter war. These boys will never be the same. They were visibly moved; and their applause, tears, hugs, and tweets proved their transformation. The next day, on that Saturday, when the President spoke, the Twitter war continued. It was based at my home. So many of them watched and marveled at Representative John Lewis, a card-carrying, sworn-in member of the 5000 Role Models of Excellence Project. They watched so proudly as he introduced the first Black President of the United States. In fact, he is the only President that they know. They are beyond proud. Why did I do this? I wanted as many students as possible to experience the importance of voting, and I am not finished. All 8,000 of them will see the movie as soon as it is released for distribution. This generation of children needs to know the importance of voting. They need to know what their forefathers had to endure so that they could vote. When I was on the Miami-Dade County School Board in 1996, we set up a process in partnership with the department of elections. Every eligible student is registered to vote in the 11th grade, and when they graduate and turn 18, their voter registration card is mailed to their homes. This is a policy that all school districts all across America should adopt. While they repair the damage to the Voting Rights Act through legislation, graduating seniors in Miami-Dade public schools--Black, White, and Hispanic--will still have the opportunity to vote. Every single one of them will vote. I hope that other school districts will adopt this policy so that children will know and understand the importance of voting. It is their voice. God of our weary years, God of our silent tears, let us as a people march on until victory is won. Ms. KELLY of Illinois. Thank you to the gentlewoman from Florida. Thank you for sharing your success stories. Hopefully, those can be duplicated. At this time, I yield to the gentlewoman from North Carolina, Congresswoman Alma Adams. Ms. ADAMS. Thank you, Congresswoman Kelly, for your leadership. I [[Page H1660]] appreciate what you are doing very much. Certainly, it is something that we need to do, and we must do. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to stress the importance of equal voting rights for everyone. Just over a week ago, I traveled to Selma with several of my colleagues to retrace the steps of those who shed blood as they tried, again, to gain equal access to the ballot box. As a professor for 40 years at Bennett College in North Carolina, I made sure that the students that passed through my classroom and our campus knew just how important it was to have their voices heard, and to this day, students know: ``Bennett Belles are voting belles.'' In 2013, the Supreme Court struck down a major provision of the Voting Rights Act limiting Federal oversight over State voting laws. Sadly, my home State of North Carolina quickly implemented voting laws that disenfranchise voters by making cuts to early voting, reenforcing strict ID requirements, and ending some preregistration programs which did not allow young high school students to be able to register to vote. As I think about those who risked their lives in order to exercise their right to vote, I cannot believe that 50 years later, in 2015, that simple freedom given to us in the Constitution is still under attack. It is time for all of us, Mr. Speaker, to come together to restore the Voting Rights Act, to ensure that every voter--no matter their race, no matter their class or creed--can make their voice heard and elect the leaders of their choice. Ms. KELLY of Illinois. I thank the gentlewoman from North Carolina, again, for her insight and comments. Here we are, 50 years removed from Selma, 50 years after Americans-- young and old, Black, White, Asian, Hispanic, Native American, Jewish-- made a decision to stand up for what they knew was right. They stood up for democracy and demanded fair and unobstructed access to the ballot. As you have heard this hour, the evolution to the America we are today has been a long and challenging journey. The Voting Rights Act has done much to make our Union more perfect, but the strength of the Voting Rights Act has been diminished. With new, discriminatory laws on the books, this Congress must act. This Congress can pass a bipartisan bill that extends section 5 of the Voting Rights Act. As was the case in Selma, the law is not equal for all. We must unite, as we did then. I urge my colleagues to take up this important issue and strengthen the Voting Rights Act. I would like to take this time to thank the gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. Butterfield) and all my colleagues who took the time to speak to us this evening. I yield back the balance of my time. Ms. FUDGE. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my colleagues Congressmen Payne and Kelly for leading the Congressional Black Caucus Special Order Hour. Mr. Speaker, fifty years ago 600 men and women began a peaceful march in Selma, Alabama to demand their full and equal right to participate in our democracy. Their quest for equal voting rights was met with physical violence and racial hatred on what has become known as ``Bloody Sunday.'' The marchers were turned back that day, but they remained steadfast. With unwavering determination, residents of Selma, civil rights activists, and inspired people from across the nation completed the march from Selma to Montgomery. Their heroism was instrumental in the passage of the Voting Rights Act of 1965; a watershed bipartisan action of the U.S. Congress. Fifty years later, on the anniversary of Bloody Sunday, I stood with President Obama and my House and Senate colleagues to honor the legacy of those brave foot soldiers for justice. But unfortunately, the battle wages on. There is still much to be done to ensure the sacrifice of those marchers was not in vain. The Supreme Court's decision in Shelby County v. Holder to strike down Section 4 of the Voting Rights Act left many Americans more vulnerable to voting discrimination. In the absence of this historic safeguard, numerous states have attempted to suppress voting through restrictive voter ID laws and limits on early voting. My home state of Ohio is one of them. Congress must act to restore Section 4 of the Voting Rights Act and update critical voter protections. In 2015, no eligible citizen should be disenfranchised. No eligible citizen should be denied full participation in our democracy. Let us recommit to rejecting intolerance and injustice in all forms, and continue the fight for equal voting rights for all Americans.

6, 2015, the gentlewoman from illinois (ms. kelly) is recognized for 60 minutes as the designee of the minority leader. general leave ms. kelly of illinois. mr. speaker, i ask unanimous consent that all members be given 5 days to revise and extend their remarks. the speaker pro tempore. is there objection to the request of the gentlewoman from illinois? there was no objection. ms. kelly of illinois. mr. speaker, it is an honor and a privilege to be before you this evening on the heels of our nation's recognizing the 50th anniversary of the selma marchers which tore down many obstructive barriers to voting for african americans and which led to the passage of the voting rights act of 1965. we have grown as a nation since the night jimmie lee jackson was murdered peacefully marching for voting rights in alabama, and we are not the america we were when mamie till made the world see what had been done to her baby. but we are still living in dynamic times for our democracy. selma has changed, but the issues of ferguson, missouri, remain. nearly 60 years after emmett till was buried, black mothers still worry about the value of their son's lives when they leave home. we are reminded of this every time we look into the eyes of trayvon martin's mother. we are better today than we were then, [[page h1654]] and the changes we made to our laws paved our path to prosperity. the president spoke of this in selma, and republicans and democrats alike were united in our feeling that we must uphold the promise of the nation we inherited because of selma. {time} 1930 the u.s. senate should vote to confirm very qualified and exceptional u.s. attorney loretta lynch as the next attorney general. the cbc devoted an hour of floor testimony last month in defense of her confirmation, but in her role as attorney general, loretta lynch will be tasked with defending the federal laws that protect the right to vote, and that brings us to our topic this evening. tonight's congressional black caucus special order hour is entitled: ``the battle wages on: securing equal voting rights in the united states.'' this topic is truly timely. this conversation needs to take place now. work remains to secure equal voting rights in the united states. actions like the supreme court's decision to gut the voting rights act remind us that the equality that should exist at the ballot is still lacking and why i dream of a day when the voting rights act is no longer necessary. the truth is that voter discrimination and suppression remain as tragic legacies of our past. in the past few years, many states have introduced restrictive legislation that diminishes an individual's access to the voting booth. the justice department may have the tools to fix this problem and go after places that are discriminating against certain voters. in some places, getting a voter id that you can use to vote can cost up to $150, and that can be a burden for someone who is on a fixed income and not driving anymore and doesn't have a license. discriminatory laws and policies that hamper access to the ballot box are reasons that the protections and the voting rights act are necessary. the vra must remain intact as its principles are powerful democratic agents that make our union more perfect. with that, i would like to kick off this special order hour by yielding to my colleague and anchor, a man who has dedicated his life to the issues of justice in america--a lawyer, judge, and statesman who has defended voting rights--the chairman of the congressional black caucus, the honorable g.k. butterfield of north carolina. mr. butterfield. thank you very much, congresswoman kelly. thank you for your leadership, and thank you for what you mean to the congressional black caucus. the congressional black caucus is now the largest caucus in our history. we are very proud to announce that we have 46 members now in cbc, representing more than 30 million people from 23 states, in addition to the district of columbia and the virgin islands, so i am delighted that you have taken this responsibility each week, ms. kelly, to come to the floor and manage this time. typically, congressman donald payne would be joining congresswoman kelly tonight, but mr. payne is not able to come to the floor tonight to help with this special order due to, what i am told, is complications from foot surgery, so we wish congressman payne a very speedy recovery. ms. kelly, i wanted to particularly thank you for selecting this subject this evening. this is a very timely conversation that we must have in this congress, and that is the whole subject of the voting rights act. the topic that you have chosen, ``the battle wages on: securing equal voting rights in the united states,'' is so very appropriate; and, hopefully, in the next 2 or 3 minutes, i want to tell you why. let me just start by explaining the whole voting rights story. some of my colleagues may not fully appreciate it and understand that when we talk about voting rights, we just don't talk about 1965. in order to fully appreciate the voting rights history in this country, we must go back to the end of slavery when 4 million slaves became free. they did not have the right to vote. once the 15th amendment was added to the constitution, then all of the former slave men got and obtained the right to vote. they got engaged. they got involved in the political process. from 1870 until 1900, a period of some 30 years, african american males, particularly in the south, were fully engaged in the political process. but do you know what? in 1900, mr. speaker, in 1900, that right to vote came to an end. it came to an end because of southern states like south carolina, north carolina, alabama, mississippi, and the like, all of these southern states passed disfranchisement laws, particularly a literacy test. this literacy test had the practical effect of denying the former slaves and their descendants the right to vote. not only did you have to read and write in order to be able to register to vote, you had to convince the registrar that you were literate. the practical effect of that was that the whole voting rights movement during those days came to an abrupt end in 1901 when congressman george h. white, who was one of my predecessors in north carolina, stood on this house floor on march 3, 1901, and made a very profound welfare speech to the congress. mr. speaker, that is the first era of voting rights in this country. the next era, i would say, would be from 1901 to 1965, when african americans, for the most part, were not allowed to register to vote because of the literacy test and were not meaningfully involved. the next and final phase would be from 1965 until the present. in 1965, this congress passed a historic 1965 voting rights act, and it was a bipartisan bill. democrats and republicans promoted the bill all the way to the finish line with the help of then president lyndon b. johnson. the 1965 voting rights, mr. speaker, did many great things, but the three things that i will highlight tonight are: number one, it eliminated the literacy test; number two, it gave a right of action, it gave to african american communities all across the united states the right to bring legal action to file civil lawsuits in federal court to challenge discriminatory election laws or practices or procedures; the third part of the voting rights act was what we now refer to as section 5. the congress in 1965 set aside certain states in the country and certain subdivisions within a state to require them to get preclearance before election laws when new election laws went into effect. many of our southern states did not like section 5, but it was put on the books for a purpose because, if given the opportunity, these states were going to pass discriminatory election laws that made it very difficult for african americans to vote. section 5 has now been on the books since 1965. it has been strongly enforced by the attorney general. section 2 has been strongly enforced in courts all across the country. now, we have 46 african americans serving in congress, we have thousands elected at state and local levels all across the country, and it was because of the voting rights act in many respects. well, mr. speaker, we received a great surprise on june 25 of 2013. the u.s. supreme court declared that section 5 could not be enforced because the formula that gives life to section 5, which is section 4, the court said that section 4 needed to be updated and called on this congress to amend section 4 to make it more contemporary in its application. this congress has failed to act. now, this is the spring of 2015, and we have failed to act. our voting rights are under continuous assault with more and more states and counties enacting voting laws that, on their face, appear to not be an impediment to voting. many of these new laws are discriminatory, i want you to know. some are intended to be. others, though not intentional, will have a discriminatory result. in closing, mr. speaker, i am just unable to understand why my republican colleagues refuse to support an amendment to section 5 to make this provision compliant with the supreme court decision. through the years, this congress has been called upon to extend section 5, and it has done so in a bipartisan way. in 2006, as section 5 was about to expire then, there was a bipartisan bill passed by this congress, signed by president [[page h1655]] george w. bush. there were 192 republicans who voted for the bill. i want to say that to you again, my colleagues: 192 republicans voted to extend section 5 just a few years ago. i saluted them then; i salute them now. sixty-six of those republicans continue to serve in the house today, including the chairman of the judiciary committee, mr. goodlatte. mr. speaker, we must fix section 5 to comply with the supreme court's decision to update the formula. if we continue down this path and if we do nothing, the practical effect will be that jurisdictions will pass election laws or implement election practices or procedures that will discriminate, and we know it, and we must prevent it from happening. the only remedy african american communities have to obtain redress from discriminatory practices will be to file very expensive litigation. in the meantime, the law, the new law goes into effect. if section 5 was in place, there wouldn't be the need for expensive litigation. the jurisdiction would simply be required to make a showing to the department of justice, and the attorney general would determine the effect of the change on minority voting strength. that is the way we have done it for the last 50 years. i call on my republican colleagues to please join with us in a bipartisan, bicameral effort to fix the formula so that section 5 can be enforced in our country. thank you, ms. kelly. ms. kelly of illinois. thank you, congressman butterfield. it is now my honor to introduce the gentlewoman from alabama, one that was our gracious host last weekend, and we appreciate everything she did, terri sewell. ms. sewell of alabama. mr. speaker, on march 7, 2015, nearly 100 members of congress from both sides of the aisle went to selma to commemorate the 50th anniversary of bloody sunday and the 1965 march from selma to montgomery. i was humbled to welcome so many of my colleagues in congress to my hometown of selma, alabama. it meant a lot to me and the state of alabama to also welcome president and mrs. obama and their daughters, as well as president and mrs. george w. bush to selma to commemorate the significant events in american history. the selma movement for voting rights was a uniquely american story of how ordinary americans working together achieved extraordinary social change. i want to thank all of the members and everyone who participated in the faith & politics pilgrimage to alabama this year. i especially want to thank my alabama colleagues--senator sessions, representative martha roby, representative robert aderholt, representative bradley byrne, and representative gary palmer--for their participation in the delegation. a special thanks to congressman john lewis and the faith & politics institute for a job well done. you know, mr. speaker, the opportunity to walk in the footsteps of john lewis with john lewis is an unforgettable experience that is truly transformative. the bipartisan participation by republicans and democrats alike was truly something to behold, especially given the hyperpartisanship of washington. it was something to see us gather together in selma, alabama, to honor the sacrifices of the foot soldiers who dared to fight for voter equality 50 years ago. i tried not to have any expectation from this bipartisan showing, but i must admit my hope was that all of us would be motivated by the experience of traveling with john lewis, in his footsteps with him, to honestly look at modern-day threats to voting rights today. now that the spotlight is no longer on selma, we must move beyond the bridge and see that there is still a need to fight to ensure that all americans can participate equally in the political process. new barriers to voting rights have been legitimized in state legislatures across this country. photo id laws and efforts nationwide to get rid of early voting or weekend voting are modern-day efforts that have had the profound effect of restricting access to voting. any effort that restricts or decreases the likelihood of citizens to vote is a threat to the voting rights of all americans. there is no denying that modern-day laws imposed to ostensibly prevent voter fraud has had the ``unintended consequence'' of making it much harder for certain sectors of the population to vote. my father is a perfect example of an individual who has found it harder to vote because of these modern-day laws. prior to the state of alabama imposing a photo id law to vote, my father, andrew, a stroke victim who has been wheelchair bound for the last 10 years, had been voting by using his federally issued social security card, which does not have a photo; but once the law was imposed, my father--who no longer drives, who no longer works, is retired--had no way of getting a photo id. after the alabama law changed, my mother and i made sure that my father would get a photo id to vote. the effort was tremendous. we transported my father in a special wheelchair access van and got him into the old dallas county courthouse, which was grandfathered in from having ada laws and, therefore, no wheelchair ramp. once inside the courthouse, the elevator to the registrar's office was being serviced, and we had to wait an hour in order to use it. once we finally got to the office of the board of registrars, there was only one person waiting on 25 people in line. my mother and father persevered. they persevered to make sure that my father got a photo id that day because he was resolved in voting because his daughter was on the ballot for reelection. {time} 1945 just think of all of the seniors or disabled citizens who do not have a relative or a person to take them to get a photo id. this photo requirement definitely reduces the number of and the ability of certain segments of the society to exercise their right to vote. in the supreme court ruling which invalidated the preclearance provisions of the vra, the court said that the formula used by congress to determine the covered states was outdated, and it implied that there was no need for the voting rights act today since, after all, there was an african american elected as president. oh, how shortsighted the supreme court was. as long as there are vulnerable communities that face barriers to voting, there is still a need for federal protection. just last year, after the supreme court ruling, the city of evergreen, alabama, came under federal scrutiny for unfairly excluding african americans from the voting rolls and for attempting to further dilute their voting power with a redistricting plan that would pack its majority black population into only two of the five municipal districts. incidences like this in evergreen, alabama, remind us that progress is always illusive and that the injustice suffered on the edmund pettus bridge 50 years ago has not been fully vindicated. mr. speaker, beyond the bridge, there are still laws that explicitly or unintentionally limit the access of americans to vote. now that we have commemorated the movement that led to the passage of the voting rights act of 1965, what are we going to do to protect the progress that has been made and to expand access to the sacred right to vote? on march 7, 2015, while en route to selma, president obama signed h.r. 431, the bill that awarded a congressional gold medal to the foot soldiers of the selma to montgomery march of 1965. finally, this nation is acknowledging the bravery of these foot soldiers, who dared to make this nation live up to its ideals of justice and equality for all. while a great honor, a medal is not adequate repayment for their sacrifice. mr. speaker, the greatest tribute that we as members of congress can give is to work honestly and earnestly on a bipartisan bill to restore federal voting protections to vulnerable communities under the voting rights act. while i applaud bipartisan efforts made in the voting rights amendment act of 2015, which creates a new formula that would determine which jurisdictions require federal preclearance, this new formula that is in the current vra amendment act omits key states, key states like north carolina, south [[page h1656]] carolina, and alabama. i can't imagine, mr. speaker, that the very state--alabama--that prompted the voting rights act that was signed into law 50 years ago would now not be afforded the protection of federal oversight. the fight for voting rights was born in alabama, and on my watch, it will not die there. voting rights advocates and everyday citizens must remain vigilant and do all that they can to safeguard against efforts to constrict democracy in state and local governments. our democracy requires it. we can all pay a debt of gratitude to those foot soldiers by voting in every election--local, state, and federal. we all have our part to play, and we in congress can play a vital role. to echo the president's call to action, president obama said on that day: selma shows us that america is not the project of any one person. the single most powerful word in our democracy is the word ``we.'' we the people are tasked with strengthening and safeguarding our democracy. we the people are responsible for ensuring our nation lives up to its very principles. on the 50th anniversary of the voting rights act and the historic march from selma to montgomery, i urge my colleagues--democrats and republicans alike--to recommit ourselves to the work that was done by our predecessors, to work together to restore the voting rights act for all americans. that is the least we can do on this, the 50th anniversary. i look forward to this august body taking up a voting rights amendment act that fully restores federal protection to all vulnerable communities so that all americans can definitely exercise that sacred right to vote. ms. kelly of illinois. thank you to the gentlewoman from alabama. thank you for sharing the challenges citizens like your dad can have in complying with the new voting rights act law. thank you for standing up. at this time, i would like to introduce the fierce and gentle woman from the district of columbia, eleanor holmes norton. ms. norton. i thank my good friend, representative robin kelly from illinois, for her leadership on this night, this first night back. for members back from selma, i appreciate that our chair of the congressional black caucus has been here to give us very important background and history. i particularly appreciate that we have just heard from a member from alabama, itself, representative terri sewell, and all of that seems to me to be the appropriate prelude for what we are doing here tonight. mr. speaker, yes, this is the first day we are back from this historic trip and are back from the 50th anniversary of the voting rights act. there is no place for the almost 100 members who went to selma to be but on this floor this evening. i want to thank attorney general holder for taking the crippled voting rights act and continuing to enforce it. the trip to selma essentially set the stage for members to come back and to regard our trip as a call to action and get down to work to revitalize the 1965 voting rights act. my thanks to representative jim sensenbrenner and to representative john conyers for cosponsoring a revised version of the act. my thanks to john lewis, who has kept selma and the voting rights act alive by his annual trips with members and others to selma. i am appreciative of the almost 100 members from both parties who went to selma on the 6th and 7th. what was the purpose of going? it could not have been a celebration. you can celebrate the 1964 civil rights act. it has not been dismembered. you can celebrate the 1968 fair housing law. it still is on the books. but you go to selma to try to bring back to its full glory the voting rights act of 1965, where setback with section 5 has rendered the act virtually obsolete for most of its original purposes. i stress that the supreme court did not invalidate the 1965 voting rights act. it invited the 100 members who went to selma and the others in this body to modernize the act. we may differ on how to do that. i do not think there can be any doubt that it has to be revised and that we have to meet the challenge that the supreme court has given us. after all, the voting rights act has prevented, literally, hundreds of discriminatory voting practices, and there were countless practices that it simply deterred. i must say that i was disappointed that, early on in this session, the chairman of the judiciary committee, representative goodlatte, indicated that he did not believe that the act was necessary, and he talked about the 11 southern states that had been under the act. the fact is that the preclearance voting rights act requirements went far beyond those states. at the time of the supreme court decision in 2013, arizona and alaska were covered. parts of california, new york, south dakota, and michigan were covered. in the past, parts of hawaii, colorado, new hampshire, idaho, connecticut, massachusetts, wyoming, maine, new mexico, and oklahoma have been covered. it is true that at the heart of the coverage were the 11 southern states, but that is where the heart of the violations were, in fact, tracked. that is where the poll taxes were. that is where the violations were. there has been a compromise bill that has been put forward by mr. sensenbrenner and mr. conyers. in the very act of going to selma, there was put upon us an obligation to come back and respond to that trip. the bill before us has tried to meet some of the objections that were raised. there is a rolling preclearance formula, for example, that does not require congressional reauthorization. there is a bail-in section of the act to reach those who had not been covered. there are a minimum number of violations over a period of time that have to be recorded in order for a state to come under the act. as my good friend from alabama, terri sewell, says, the act is not what all of us wanted, but it does mean that in the spirit of compromise and because of the necessity of this act, this act which democratized the south and is necessary now--perhaps not as necessary as it was 50 years ago--but no one can doubt, as a supreme court justice himself said when he said he didn't doubt that there was still discrimination in voting practices, but he said it was up to the congress to modernize the bill. i don't see how almost 100 republican and democratic members can have gone to selma on the 50th anniversary without coming back to revise the act. we went emptyhanded. we went without a bill. i hope that what we got in selma was the gumption to come back and to put forward a bill. yes, the act has been dismembered by the supreme court, but the court asked us to reshape it. it asked us to restore it. it was one thing to go without a bill. it is quite another to come back and do nothing about a bill. the president did not hesitate to say where the responsibility, in fact, lies, and i am quoting from his speech in selma: one hundred members of congress have come here today to honor people who were willing to die for the right it protects. if we want to honor this day, let these 100 go back to washington and gather 400 more and, together, pledge to make it their mission to restore the law this year. that is our mission. the trip to selma, where we went in the name of the entire congress, demands that we act before the end of this congress. ms. kelly of illinois. thank you so much to the gentlewoman from washington, d.c. at this time, i would like to introduce the gentleman from south carolina, our leader, james clyburn. (mr. clyburn asked and was given permission to revise and extend his remarks.) mr. clyburn. mr. speaker, i often refer to this hall as america's classroom. i do that because i do believe that, as we conduct ourselves here on this floor, it is to set an example for all citizens, especially our young citizens, who look in on our proceedings and get some idea about how they ought to conduct themselves as americans going forward. one of those things, i think, that we ought to be very careful of is how we address the rights and responsibilities that we all have as citizens. {time} 2000 we teach our children in our classrooms and in our homes that the right to vote is basic to this democracy of ours. i know that all of us are aware that in our past it is a right that has not always been practiced, but in its [[page h1657]] wisdom this body, acting collectively, decided back in 1965 that it would do something about making right the wrongs that have been heaped upon citizens for decades when it comes to voting. and so we did. a formula was adopted that was based upon the 1964 results of the presidential election. we have renewed time and time again that law, always updating under that formula; but several months ago the united states supreme court looked at the formula and decided that the formula had outlived its usefulness, but the voting rights act was still needed. they invited the congress to take a look at the formula and update it, as the chair said, and to make it more contemporary. we have worked for months. i want to thank mr. sensenbrenner of wisconsin and mr. conyers of michigan for the work they have done to put together some amendments that would update that formula. this time we decided to look back just a few years and to see, within the last 10 or 12 years, what jurisdictions have still continued to violate people's rights and who have been found guilty of doing so. rather than apply the formula to everybody, what we will do is come up with a series of wrongs, put some numerical qualification on it, and make a new formula. now, that formula is not going to cover south carolina today, but under the formula, any jurisdiction, any state that permits these kinds of atrocities and is found to have done so, they will be brought under the formula. so the formula applies to every jurisdiction in the country. i think that it is time for us to be honest that everybody will not do right, but we should have something in place so when a jurisdiction fails to do right, we will have a mechanism to address those ills. now, let me hasten to add--and i want all that are listening in to understand--this part of the voting rights act is a preventive measure. it says that it allows for the justice department to move to prevent any kind of implementation of a change in the voting laws so that we won't have expensive litigation if something in it is not quite right. i believe that it is incumbent upon us to do what we can to employ methods that will not require citizens and the jurisdiction, their states, their cities and counties, to go to the expense of litigation when we can have an administrative procedure in place to take a look at what has been done and make a decision as to whether or not there is any possibility that someone's voting rights could be taken away. that is all this formula does. that is all section 5 is about. i would hope that those of us who traveled to selma last week to renew our commitment to making this country of ours a more perfect union will sit down in the near future, and before we get to the 50th anniversary of the signing of that 1965 voting rights act, which comes on august 6 of this year, sometime between now and august 6, let's put in place the kind of amendments that would allow the voting rights act to maintain the life that it has given to so many communities for so many years. i want to thank ms. kelly for putting together this special order. let me close by saying: the longer i live, the more i get in touch with those old adages that we grew up with, one of which was ``an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure.'' i believe that these amendments that we are proposing are preventive measures, and it is much more valuable than for us to come back looking for a cure that could be very, very expensive. ms. kelly of illinois. thank you to the gentleman from south carolina (mr. clyburn) for your important insight and your important comments. now it is my honor to introduce the gentlelady from texas, congresswoman sheila jackson lee. ms. jackson lee. let me thank my colleagues and thank congresswoman kelly and chairman butterfield for the opportunity to carry forward the spirit of the 50th commemoration of the march over the edmund pettus bridge. let me also begin by thanking our colleague congresswoman terri sewell and all of the alabama delegation for their hospitality and their spirit of unity. in fact, mr. speaker, i am so moved by that experience that i frankly believe that now is the time to move the bill that is bipartisan that is a response to the united states supreme court to the floor of the house, to the committee on the judiciary and to the floor of the house. leader clyburn was very apt in describing a very significant point that really answers the question of the supreme court. if i had my way, coming from the state of texas, i frankly believe that the reauthorization that we did through the committee on the judiciary, of which i am a member, and which i was very much engaged in in 2006 and 2007, was a thorough expose of the value of the voting rights act. we did 15,000 pages of testimony, and witness after witness from different perspectives indicated that the formula that we were using at that time on the preclearance was an effective formula. of course, the supreme court challenged the data, and i would only argue that it is appropriate to update the data. i welcome that. but we have gone even further. as has been articulated by the bill that has just been introduced by a number of us, we have crafted a formula that says it is an even playing field, an even playing field for a state to opt in because they have voting rights abuses for all people or to opt out because they have a smooth, evenhanded process for citizens in their state to vote. so i believe it is important that the message get out of what the voting rights act stands for and what it meant for those foot soldiers to cross that bridge. they crossed that bridge, and they were willing-- and were bloodied, frankly--to do something nonviolent, and that is to petition their leaders at the voting box. i can't imagine that there is any member here in this place, in this august congress, that would not want to go to their constituents, whether they live in south dakota or utah or mississippi or new york or texas, as i do, that there is an unfettered right to vote. i will soon be introducing a voting rights act that establishes the date that we signed the voting rights act by the president that came from texas, lyndon baines johnson, with the leaders of martin luther king and john lewis and many others standing at his side, to introduce that as being voting rights act day, to reinforce the value to americans of the importance of voting. who would want to oppose the idea that voting is not important? so i am looking forward to having members join on the simple premise that it is important to vote in america and that it is important to commemorate the signing of the voting rights act and make it voting rights day. that inspiration came as we saw the thousands that were marching across the edmund pettus bridge. let me just clarify for a moment, under section 5, the submitting jurisdiction under the voting rights act of 1965 and h.r. 885, voting rights amendment act of 2015, has to prove that the proposed changes are not retrogressive, that they do not have the purpose and will not have the effect of denying or abridging the right to vote on account of race or color. we have expanded that, again, to go by acts, by occurrences that would keep someone from voting. so i believed that this past weekend, or the weekend of bloody sunday, was a moving moment that would draw us together, that would allow us to understand h.r. 885. and might i say this: i know that many of us will be willing to have teach-ins to ensure that our colleagues understand the importance of this legislation and that we do it in a bipartisan manner. let me conclude my remarks by saying, earlier today i stood on the floor and asked for a bipartisan approach to the approval of the attorney general nominee by the other body. i say that from the spirit of recognition of the three branches of government. a president has nominated a very well-qualified, distinguished member of the bar, loretta lynch, to be the next attorney general of the united states of america. we understand differences of opinion with legislation. i have no quarrel with those differences. i happen to support the human trafficking bill and recognize that there is a disagreement on language that i agree with the disagreement, but that disagreement can [[page h1658]] be worked out through ongoing talks and however they want to approach it or a vote on the floor. but loretta lynch, the attorney general nominee, should not be held up captive to disagreements on legislation and moving toward a constitutional crisis. all of this, mr. speaker, is wrapped up together. the department of justice enforces the voting rights act, enforces the voting rights of americans. as we look to the future, as we formulate the understanding of the three branches of government, to avoid a constitutional crisis of not having the leadership that is timely for the work that has to be done, i would hope the senate would move forward, and i would hope that all of us would honor the voting rights act and the message of selma that we stand together under this wonderful flag and stand for voting rights for all. since its passage in 1965, and through four reauthorizations signed by republican presidents (1970, 1975, 1982, 2006), more americans, especially those in the communities we represent, have been empowered by the voting rights act of 1965 than any other single piece of legislation. section 5 of the act requires covered jurisdictions to submit proposed changes to any voting law or procedure to the department of justice or the u.s. district court in washington, d.c. for pre- approval, hence the term ``pre-clearance.'' under section 5, the submitting jurisdiction has the burden of proving that the proposed change(s) are not retrogressive, i.e. that they do not have the purpose and will not have the effect of denying or abridging the right to vote on account of race or color. in announcing his support for the 1982 extension of the voting rights act, president reagan said, ``the right to vote is the crown jewel of american liberties.'' and section is the ``crown jewel'' of the voting rights act. but a terrible blow was dealt to the voting rights act on june 25, 2013, when the supreme court handed down the decision in shelby county v. holder, 537 u.s. 193 (2013), which invalidated section 4(b), the provision of the law determining which jurisdictions would be subject to section 5 ``pre-clearance.'' facts of shelby county v. holder in 2006, the city of calera, which lies within shelby county, enacted a discriminatory redistricting plan without complying with section 5, leading to the loss of the city's sole african-american councilman, ernest montgomery. in compliance with section 5, however, calera was required to draw a nondiscriminatory redistricting plan and conduct another election in which mr. montgomery regained his seat. according to the supreme court majority, the reason for striking down section 4(b): ``times change.'' now, the court was right; times have changed. but what the court did not fully appreciate is that the positive changes it cited are due almost entirely to the existence and vigorous enforcement of the voting rights act. and that is why the voting rights act is still needed. let me put it this way: in the same way that the vaccine invented by dr. jonas salk in 1953 eradicated the crippling effects but did not eliminate the cause of polio, the voting rights act succeeded in stymying the practices that resulted in the wholesale disenfranchisement of african americans and language minorities but did eliminate them entirely. before the voting rights act was passed in 1965, the right to vote did not exist in practice for most african americans. and until 1975, most american citizens who were not proficient in english faced significant obstacles to voting, because they could not understand the ballot. asian americans and asian immigrants also suffered systematic exclusion from the political process. in 1964, the year before the voting rights act became law, there were approximately 300 african-americans in public office, including just three in congress. few, if any, black elected officials were elected anywhere in the south. because of the voting rights act, there are now more than 9,100 black elected officials, including 43 members of congress, the largest number ever. the voting rights act opened the political process for many of the approximately 6,000 latino public officials that have been elected and appointed nationwide, including 263 at the state or federal level, 27 of whom serve in congress. now to be sure, the supreme court did not invalidate the preclearance provisions of section 5; it only invalidated section 4(b). but that is like leaving the car undamaged but destroying the key that unlocks the doors and starts the engine. according to the court, the coverage formula in section 4(b) had to be struck down because the data upon which it was based--registration rates and turn-out gaps--was too old and outdated. but my colleagues in congress and i refuse to let the voting rights act die. and so we went to work, crafting and drafting the legislation that would repair the damage done to the voting rights act by the supreme court decision and capable of winning majorities in the house and senate and the signature of the president. after months of hard work, consultation, negotiation, and collaboration, we produced and have reintroduced in the 114th congress, a bill, h.r. 885, ``voting rights amendments act of 2015'' that can achieve these goals. to be sure, this legislation is not perfect, no bill ever is. but--and this is important--the bill represents an important step forward because it: 1. is responsive to the concern expressed by the supreme court; and 2. establishes a new coverage formula that is carefully tailored but sufficiently potent to protect the voting rights of all americans. first, h.r. 885 specifies a new coverage formula that is based on current problems in voting and therefore directly responds to the court's concern that the previous formula was outdated. the importance of this feature is hard to overestimate. legislators and litigators understand that the likelihood of the court upholding an amended statute that fails to correct the provision previously found to be defective is very low and indeed. h.r. 885 replaces the old ``static'' coverage formula with a new dynamic coverage formula, or ``rolling trigger,'' which works as follows: 1. for states, it requires at least one finding of discrimination at the state level and at least four adverse findings by its sub-jurisdictions within the previous 15 years; 2. for political subdivisions, it requires at least three adverse findings within the previous 15 years; but 3. political subdivisions with ``persistent and extremely low minority voter turnout,'' can also be covered if they have a single adverse finding of discrimination. the effect of the ``rolling trigger'' mechanism effectively gives the legislation nationwide reach because any state and any jurisdiction in any state potentially is subject to being covered if the requisite number of violations are found to have been committed. prior to shelby county v. holder, the voting rights act covered 16 states in whole or in part, including most of the states in the deep south. the rolling trigger contained in h.r. 885, unfortunately, does not; at least not initially. the only states that would be covered initially under the new bill are: 1. texas 2. north carolina 3. louisiana 4. florida 5. south carolina. to compensate for the fact that fewer jurisdictions are covered, our bill also includes several key provisions that are consistent with the needs created by a narrower section 5 trigger. for example, h.r. 885: 1. expands judicial ``bail-in'' authority under section 3 so that it applies to voting changes that result in discrimination (not just intentional discrimination); 2. requires nationwide transparency of ``late breaking'' voting changes; allocation of poll place resources; and changes within the boundaries of voting districts; 3. clarifies and expands the ability of plaintiffs to seek a preliminary injunction against voting discrimination; and 4. clarifies and expands attorney general's authority to send election observers to protect against voting discrimination. the voting rights act of 1965 is no ordinary piece of legislation. for millions of americans, and many of us in congress, the voting rights act of 1965 is a sacred treasure, earned by the sweat and toil and tears and blood of ordinary americans who showed the world it was possible to accomplish extraordinary things. about texas naacp v. berry (texas photo id case; consolidated with veasey v. perry) 1. the suit alleges that the state of texas' photo id requirement for in-person voting, enacted in 2011, was adopted for discriminatory reasons, in violation of the fourteenth and fifteenth amendments and section 2 of the voting rights act, and has a discriminatory ``result'' in violation of section 2. the case is consolidated with similar suits filed by the united states and other private plaintiffs. 2. trial was held from september 2 to september 11, 2014, and closing arguments were presented on september 22, 2014. 3. on october 9, 2014, u.s. district judge nelva gonzales ramos issued a 147-page opinion in which she ruled that the texas photo id requirement violates both the u.s. constitution and section 2 of the voting rights act. 4. judge ramos found that the law was enacted for the purpose of discriminating against african-american and latino voters, and that it denies minority voters an equal opportunity to participate in the political process in violation of the section 2 results standard. [[page h1659]] 5. judge ramos also found that the photo id law unconstitutionally burdens the right to vote, and functions as an unconstitutional poll tax. 6. on october 14, 2014, the u.s. court of appeals for the fifth circuit granted texas' motion to stay the district court's permanent injunction until texas' appeal is briefed, argued and decided. 7. on october 15, 2014, the lawyers' committee and co-counsel filed an emergency application with the supreme court to reinstate the district court's injunction. 8. on october 18, 2014, the supreme court denied the application to vacate the stay; justice ginsburg filed a dissent, joined by justices sotomayor and kagan. 9. oral argument before the 5th circuit is scheduled to take place during the last week in april. 10. previously, in a lawsuit litigated under section 5 of the voting rights act, a three-judge district court in texas v. holder, 888 f. supp. 2d 113 (d.d.c. 2012), ruled that texas' photo id law did not satisfy the nondiscrimination requirements of section 5. 11. however, the district court ruling was vacated by the supreme court, 133 s. ct. 2886 (2013), following the court's decision in shelby county v. holder, 133 s. ct. 2612 (2013), that the geographic coverage formula for section 5 is unconstitutional. ms. kelly of illinois. i thank the gentlelady from texas for her remarks. now it is my honor to yield to the gentlelady from milwaukee, wisconsin, congresswoman gwen moore. ms. moore. mr. speaker, i was privileged just recently to stand hand in hand and shoulder to shoulder in selma, alabama, with 100 members of congress, with civil rights leaders, friends of the movement of all races from every state in the united states, with civil rights luminaries such as mrs. abernathy, dorothy cotton, amelia boynton--113 years old--doris crenshaw, and, of course, our very own colleague, john lewis, who helped lead a march for a better life and more equality for all of america. but it was very, very hard to celebrate. there was a very sober mood in the crowd as we realized that the voting rights of americans, particularly african americans, were under threat 50 years after the voting rights act was signed. as the president said in his remarks: right now, in 2015, 50 years after selma, there are laws across the country designed to make it harder for people to vote. {time} 2015 as we speak, more of such laws are being proposed. meanwhile, the voting rights act, the culmination of so much blood, so much sweat and tears, the product of so much sacrifice in the face of wanton violence, the voting rights act stands weakened, its future subject to political rancor. as we think of those martyrs like viola liuzzo, james earl chaney, andy goodman, and michael schwerner, it is very, very difficult to deal with the reality that states such as the one that i hail from, wisconsin, is one of the states who has joined the map of shame and passed one of the strictest voter id laws in the country. in the following years since 2011, wisconsin has been a battleground in fighting this pernicious law. in 2014, a federal judge ruled that our voter id law was unconstitutional and violated section 2 of the voting rights act and the equal protection clause of the 14th amendment. it found that 300,000 wisconsinites lacked the proper id needed under the law and that the law would have a disparate impact on blacks and latinos. despite that powerful finding, the federal district court was recklessly overturned by a three-judge panel in the seventh circuit. right before our 2014 election, the united states supreme court stepped in and enjoined this law in an emergency stay to prevent them from implementing the voter id law only 6 weeks before the 2014 election. recently, members of the congressional black caucus have sent an amicus brief, and i am optimistic that justice will prevail. i know that there have been many african americans and people of other races who have marched across that edmund pettus bridge. as a woman, i know that the brave suffragettes fought equal treatment for over 70 years while they faced humiliation and shame from society. history has made it so very, very clear that voting rights are so fundamental. the 14th amendment to the constitution protects voting rights; the 15th amendment provided that males, even former slaves and males of any race, could vote; women's suffrage; with the 24th amendment, poll taxes supposedly were eliminated, and the 26th amendment allowed 18-year-olds to vote. of course, we have the voting rights act of 1965. i think it is very, very clear, when you look at the history of this protection, that it is one of the most constitutionally protected rights that there is. i would urge my colleagues here in this body to do more than hold hands and sing, ``we shall overcome,'' but to really pass laws to strengthen the voting rights act. we have all heard the adage that history repeats itself, and we have seen a race across the country for republican legislatures and governors to pass these voter id laws, but i think we also have the power to shape our future by drawing from the lessons of the past: our civil rights movement, our march in selma, where we stood hand in hand, arm in arm, and fought back against this tide of oppression. ms. kelly of illinois. i thank the gentlewoman from wisconsin. thank you for sharing your thoughts. now, it is my honor to yield to the gentlewoman from florida, frederica wilson. ms. wilson of florida. in miami-dade county, i have a program called the 5000 role models of excellence project. it is a program of black and hispanic boys who are trying to grow up into good men. the friday before bloody sunday, over 500 12th graders--graduating seniors--from that program went to a movie to watch a private screening of the movie ``selma.'' i want to give a special shout-out to nancy sewell, who is the mother of terri sewell. as i watched the two of them on c-span, msnbc, and cnn, i was so proud of them. these boys were prepared by men who experienced the civil rights battles and know the bitter history and violent battles we had to endure. i wish i had the resources to take all 500 of them to selma. during the movie, we planned a twitter war. thousands participated all across the nation. movie stars, rappers, sports legends, and the white house joined in the twitter war. these boys will never be the same. they were visibly moved; and their applause, tears, hugs, and tweets proved their transformation. the next day, on that saturday, when the president spoke, the twitter war continued. it was based at my home. so many of them watched and marveled at representative john lewis, a card-carrying, sworn-in member of the 5000 role models of excellence project. they watched so proudly as he introduced the first black president of the united states. in fact, he is the only president that they know. they are beyond proud. why did i do this? i wanted as many students as possible to experience the importance of voting, and i am not finished. all 8,000 of them will see the movie as soon as it is released for distribution. this generation of children needs to know the importance of voting. they need to know what their forefathers had to endure so that they could vote. when i was on the miami-dade county school board in 1996, we set up a process in partnership with the department of elections. every eligible student is registered to vote in the 11th grade, and when they graduate and turn 18, their voter registration card is mailed to their homes. this is a policy that all school districts all across america should adopt. while they repair the damage to the voting rights act through legislation, graduating seniors in miami-dade public schools--black, white, and hispanic--will still have the opportunity to vote. every single one of them will vote. i hope that other school districts will adopt this policy so that children will know and understand the importance of voting. it is their voice. god of our weary years, god of our silent tears, let us as a people march on until victory is won. ms. kelly of illinois. thank you to the gentlewoman from florida. thank you for sharing your success stories. hopefully, those can be duplicated. at this time, i yield to the gentlewoman from north carolina, congresswoman alma adams. ms. adams. thank you, congresswoman kelly, for your leadership. i [[page h1660]] appreciate what you are doing very much. certainly, it is something that we need to do, and we must do. mr. speaker, i rise today to stress the importance of equal voting rights for everyone. just over a week ago, i traveled to selma with several of my colleagues to retrace the steps of those who shed blood as they tried, again, to gain equal access to the ballot box. as a professor for 40 years at bennett college in north carolina, i made sure that the students that passed through my classroom and our campus knew just how important it was to have their voices heard, and to this day, students know: ``bennett belles are voting belles.'' in 2013, the supreme court struck down a major provision of the voting rights act limiting federal oversight over state voting laws. sadly, my home state of north carolina quickly implemented voting laws that disenfranchise voters by making cuts to early voting, reenforcing strict id requirements, and ending some preregistration programs which did not allow young high school students to be able to register to vote. as i think about those who risked their lives in order to exercise their right to vote, i cannot believe that 50 years later, in 2015, that simple freedom given to us in the constitution is still under attack. it is time for all of us, mr. speaker, to come together to restore the voting rights act, to ensure that every voter--no matter their race, no matter their class or creed--can make their voice heard and elect the leaders of their choice. ms. kelly of illinois. i thank the gentlewoman from north carolina, again, for her insight and comments. here we are, 50 years removed from selma, 50 years after americans-- young and old, black, white, asian, hispanic, native american, jewish-- made a decision to stand up for what they knew was right. they stood up for democracy and demanded fair and unobstructed access to the ballot. as you have heard this hour, the evolution to the america we are today has been a long and challenging journey. the voting rights act has done much to make our union more perfect, but the strength of the voting rights act has been diminished. with new, discriminatory laws on the books, this congress must act. this congress can pass a bipartisan bill that extends section 5 of the voting rights act. as was the case in selma, the law is not equal for all. we must unite, as we did then. i urge my colleagues to take up this important issue and strengthen the voting rights act. i would like to take this time to thank the gentleman from north carolina (mr. butterfield) and all my colleagues who took the time to speak to us this evening. i yield back the balance of my time. ms. fudge. mr. speaker, i want to thank my colleagues congressmen payne and kelly for leading the congressional black caucus special order hour. mr. speaker, fifty years ago 600 men and women began a peaceful march in selma, alabama to demand their full and equal right to participate in our democracy. their quest for equal voting rights was met with physical violence and racial hatred on what has become known as ``bloody sunday.'' the marchers were turned back that day, but they remained steadfast. with unwavering determination, residents of selma, civil rights activists, and inspired people from across the nation completed the march from selma to montgomery. their heroism was instrumental in the passage of the voting rights act of 1965; a watershed bipartisan action of the u.s. congress. fifty years later, on the anniversary of bloody sunday, i stood with president obama and my house and senate colleagues to honor the legacy of those brave foot soldiers for justice. but unfortunately, the battle wages on. there is still much to be done to ensure the sacrifice of those marchers was not in vain. the supreme court's decision in shelby county v. holder to strike down section 4 of the voting rights act left many americans more vulnerable to voting discrimination. in the absence of this historic safeguard, numerous states have attempted to suppress voting through restrictive voter id laws and limits on early voting. my home state of ohio is one of them. congress must act to restore section 4 of the voting rights act and update critical voter protections. in 2015, no eligible citizen should be disenfranchised. no eligible citizen should be denied full participation in our democracy. let us recommit to rejecting intolerance and injustice in all forms, and continue the fight for equal voting rights for all americans. ____________________",57065

Madam President, Confucius said, ``Life is very simple, but we insist on making it complicated.'' That is true. Right now, the Republican Senate leadership is insisting on making a good piece of legislation far more complicated than it should be. This human trafficking and child pornography bill before the Senate has wide bipartisan support. Unfortunately, it also includes a previously unreported abortion provision that has brought us to a screeching halt in this legislation. But there is a quick and very easy solution to this dilemma: Take the abortion language out of the bill. The Republican leadership doesn't seem to be interested in a solution. The Senate Republican leadership is anxious to shut down debate without fixing the problem. We can stand here all week and question how the abortion language got in the legislation. Many believe it was by sleight of hand, but it doesn't matter. It is a fact that Republicans included abortion language in this bill that is completely unrelated to human trafficking, and by doing so Republicans turned a bipartisan bill into a political fight. Republican Congressman Erik Paulsen of Minnesota drafted the House version of the same human trafficking bill. He wrote the bill. It passed the House. Even he believes that inclusion of the abortion provision in the Senate bill is not appropriate. Here is what he said: There is no reason it should be included in these bills. This issue is far too important to tie it up with an unrelated fight with politics as usual. This is his bill, and he says we should take that language out. He is a Republican. The path forward is clear: Take the abortion language out of the bill and we can pass it right now. That is it. But if hijacking the human trafficking bill with an unrelated abortion provision wasn't already bad enough--listen to this--the majority leader is now holding Loretta Lynch's nomination hostage too. It is hard to comprehend, but that is what is happening. Just last Tuesday, the Republican leader gave his word that he would bring up a vote this week on President Obama's Attorney General nominee. President Obama's Attorney General is well qualified and no one questions her qualifications. Now Senator McConnell is saying the Senate will not confirm Loretta Lynch until we pass the trafficking bill--abortion language and all. Loretta Lynch was nominated by the President 128 days ago. Since that time, Senate Republicans have found reason after reason after reason to delay her confirmation. First, it was just wait until the next Congress. In fact, the Republican leader said last year: Ms. Lynch will receive fair consideration by the Senate. And her nomination should be considered in the new Congress through regular order. But when this Congress got underway, her nomination had to wait until after the Keystone legislation. Everyone will remember it was a bill to construct a massive pipeline to import foreign oil, only to turn around and export it to other countries. Then Ms. Lynch's nomination had to wait until after a new Defense Secretary was confirmed. Then Republicans on the Judiciary Committee needed more time and said just one more week. Then she had to wait until after the February recess. As I said, it has been delay after delay after delay, and now we are here in the middle of March and Loretta Lynch has yet to get a vote on the Senate floor. Why can't we get this incredibly qualified woman confirmed? She has waited 128 days. That is the longest any Attorney General has ever waited in the last four decades. As I have said, a vote on the Lynch nomination has nothing to do with the trafficking bill and it certainly has nothing to do with abortion. The majority leader can choose to keep the Senate stuck on this abortion provision, but he does so at the detriment of so many other bills that require the Senate's attention. The majority leader gave his word that we [[Page S1512]] would consider the Lynch nomination through regular order, and that has not happened. He gave his word that we would vote on confirmation this week, but now he is hedging on that. There is no reason my friend, the majority leader, cannot live up to his numerous commitments. Loretta Lynch's nomination is on the Executive Calendar, meaning the Senate can consider her nomination and then immediately move back to the trafficking bill. Any attempt to hold her nomination hostage because of the abortion provision is a sham. This Congress is barely 2 months old. Yet this is just the latest on a growing list of examples proving Republicans simply cannot govern. The American people need a human trafficking bill, and the American people need an Attorney General. Let's confirm Loretta Lynch as soon as possible.

she has waited 128 days. that is the longest any attorney general has ever waited in the last four decades. as i have said, a vote on the lynch nomination has nothing to do with the trafficking bill and it certainly has nothing to do with abortion. the majority leader can choose to keep the senate stuck on this abortion provision, but he does so at the detriment of so many other bills that require the senate's attention. the majority leader gave his word that we [[page s1512]] would consider the lynch nomination through regular order, and that has not happened. he gave his word that we would vote on confirmation this week, but now he is hedging on that. there is no reason my friend, the majority leader, cannot live up to his numerous commitments. loretta lynch's nomination is on the executive calendar, meaning the senate can consider her nomination and then immediately move back to the trafficking bill. any attempt to hold her nomination hostage because of the abortion provision is a sham. this congress is barely 2 months old. yet this is just the latest on a growing list of examples proving republicans simply cannot govern. the american people need a human trafficking bill, and the american people need an attorney general. let's confirm loretta lynch as soon as possible. madam president, what is the business of the day?

Madam President, tomorrow morning the Senate will be casting a very important vote. We will be voting on a piece of legislation called the Justice for Victims of Trafficking Act, which currently has 12 Democratic cosponsors and virtually an equal number of Republican cosponsors. In other words, this is generally bipartisan legislation. As further evidence of its bipartisan support, this bill passed unanimously out of the Senate Judiciary Committee in February, and it enjoys the support of more than 200 victims' rights and law enforcement organizations. But as everyone in this Chamber knows, Senate Democrats have said they will filibuster this bipartisan legislation that is designed to provide justice for victims of trafficking because it contains a particular provision they have voted for on a number of occasions and, indeed, have chosen to cosponsor. It is unconscionable and shameful and more than that it is just simply baffling to me. The reason it is so shameful is because there are children waiting for our help. The average victim of human trafficking in the United States is a young girl between the age of 12 and 14 years of age. Children are being abused and literally sexually assaulted while apparently some of our colleagues on the other side of the aisle have decided to try to make a political point. It is baffling because my colleagues have voted for essentially this very same provision in one form or another time and time and time again. Apparently, the Democratic leader, who is pressuring Members of his caucus to filibuster this bill is--well, he says we need to take out the language they object to, but I was standing on the floor just a few days ago when--I guess it was Thursday afternoon--the majority leader, Senator McConnell, offered them an opportunity to have an up-or-down vote to strip that language out of the bill and they objected to it. So it is getting harder and harder to believe the sincerity of their protests, and it is appearing more and more likely that what they want to do is have the Senate return to the same dysfunctional nature it was under for the last 4 years by the previous majority. I wish to pose several questions to our colleagues who insist on filibustering this bipartisan piece of legislation. The first question I have is: Isn't it the case that only 3 months ago 50 Democrats voted for the 2015 Defense authorization bill? Isn't that a bill a piece of authorizing legislation much like the underlying justice for victims of trafficking bill? If 50 Democrats voted for similar language with regard to the limitations on the use of funding just a few months ago, how in the world can they filibuster this bill for including the same language they voted for, more or less, just a few short months ago? In fact, it is true that in 2009 all of the Senate Democrats--in a partisan vote--voted to include this similar language as part of ObamaCare. Groups such as NARAL, the National Abortion Rights Action League, protested that the language ``went far beyond even the Hyde Amendment.'' Yet 60 Democrats, including the then-majority leader--now minority leader--voted for that in the wee hours of Christmas Eve 2009. Again, I ask our friends who are filibustering this bipartisan piece of legislation designed to help the victims of human trafficking: Isn't it true that in 2009, 58 Senate Democrats voted to reauthorize the Children's Health Insurance Program, which like Medicaid is subject to the Hyde Amendment? To each of those questions, the record would demonstrate they should be answered with a resounding yes. So time and time again, our colleagues on the other side of the aisle, who now find themselves in the inexplicable position of filibustering a bill they are cosponsoring or which they have already voted for in the Judiciary Committee and which contains very similar restrictions on the use of the funding--how in the world have they decided to make the stand, here and now, denying even the opportunity they have been given by the majority leader to have an up-or-down vote to strip the language out that they object to? Well, despite the hypocrisy of their position, the question this really boils down to is this. This is the question, the only question that really matters: To our colleagues who are filibustering this legislation, Are you prepared to turn your back on the thousands of people living every day in bondage and who are desperately clinging to the hope that someone--someone--will lend them a helping hand? Are you prepared to abandon these children and these other victims of human trafficking who deserve a roof over their head, someone to lean on, and somehow, some way to get a fresh start in life? Do our colleagues who are filibustering this legislation really want to play politics with such a sensitive and vulnerable part of our population over an issue that some advocates have called a phantom problem? The reason why some advocates who support this legislation have called the objection of the Democratic leader a phantom problem is because not only have they voted for similar provisions over and over and over again, this essentially has been the settled law of the land for 39 years--since 1976. Just in case our colleagues think that the examples I mentioned are exclusive, there are a number of other provisions--32 Democrats voted for the so-called CR omnibus, the continuing resolution omnibus, in December. Thirty-two Democrats voted for that which contained very similar language. And I mentioned several others. I want to conclude with the Washington Post editorial for today. I do not always find myself in agreement with the Washington Post editorial board, but this morning I think they encapsulated the Democratic filibuster of the bipartisan antitrafficking bill perfectly. In urging the Senate to pass this legislation, they wrote: ``[T]his week the question will be whether Senators can put the interests of scared, abused children ahead of the chance to score political points.'' I could not agree more. So tomorrow morning, an hour after we convene, we will have a vote that will decide whether this legislation goes on to final passage. We need six brave Democrats--six brave Democrats--to join all the Republicans on this side to keep hope alive for these victims of human trafficking. We need six Democrats who are willing to break away from the tyranny of their party's own leadership here in the Senate and do what they know is the right thing to do. They know it in their heart, and they know it in their mind, and they know they have supported similar language in legislation time and time again. We need six Democrats willing to break away from the mindless, heartless filibuster of this legislation. I hope they will examine their conscience. I [[Page S1513]] hope they will ask themselves, Isn't this exactly the kind of vote that I came here to the U.S. Senate to cast? I hope they will pray on it, and I hope they will think long and hard before saying no to the abused children and the victims of human trafficking. That is what this is all about. It is not based on any Hyde amendment language in this legislation. It is based on a determination to render this institution dysfunctional, not because of any principal policy disagreement, because, as I point out, our colleagues on the other side have voted for similar language time and time and time again. Our colleagues on the other side realize that on November 4, the voters rejected the then-majority and gave this side of the aisle the opportunity to serve in the majority because, frankly, they were sick and tired of the way that Washington operates and the dysfunction that prevailed here for so long. I had higher hopes that after the election we would all learn something from what the voters were telling us on November 4 and thereafter and that we would take advantage of the opportunity to try to work together to find areas where we could agree, in a bipartisan way, to actually move the ball forward and help people who need our help. If we cannot do that on an antihuman trafficking bill, what can we possibly work together on? This whole phony issue of the Hyde amendment provision in this bill is a joke. It is a sick, sad joke, after time and time again voting for similar provisions in other legislation. As I pointed out, you have 12 Democratic cosponsors of the legislation. Do you think they did not read the legislation? That is ridiculous. Do you think their staff did not tell them what was in the legislation? Do you think before the Judiciary Committee voted unanimously to pass it out people did not know what they were voting on? I do not believe that for a minute. I have too much respect for our colleagues and their professionalism to think they missed it. Our colleagues have an important choice to make tomorrow morning. I hope they will say yes to these victims of human trafficking and no to the kind of political gamesmanship that gives this institution a bad name. The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator from Illinois. ____________________",package_114_109.csv,9316,9316,9383,"[congressional record volume 161, number 44 (monday, march 16, 2015)] [senate] [pages s1512-s1513] from the congressional record online through the government publishing office [ www.gpo.gov ] human trafficking legislation mr. cornyn. madam president, tomorrow morning the senate will be casting a very important vote. we will be voting on a piece of legislation called the justice for victims of trafficking act, which currently has 12 democratic cosponsors and virtually an equal number of republican cosponsors. in other words, this is generally bipartisan legislation. as further evidence of its bipartisan support, this bill passed unanimously out of the senate judiciary committee in february, and it enjoys the support of more than 200 victims' rights and law enforcement organizations. but as everyone in this chamber knows, senate democrats have said they will filibuster this bipartisan legislation that is designed to provide justice for victims of trafficking because it contains a particular provision they have voted for on a number of occasions and, indeed, have chosen to cosponsor. it is unconscionable and shameful and more than that it is just simply baffling to me. the reason it is so shameful is because there are children waiting for our help. the average victim of human trafficking in the united states is a young girl between the age of 12 and 14 years of age. children are being abused and literally sexually assaulted while apparently some of our colleagues on the other side of the aisle have decided to try to make a political point. it is baffling because my colleagues have voted for essentially this very same provision in one form or another time and time and time again. apparently, the democratic leader, who is pressuring members of his caucus to filibuster this bill is--well, he says we need to take out the language they object to, but i was standing on the floor just a few days ago when--i guess it was thursday afternoon--the majority leader, senator mcconnell, offered them an opportunity to have an up-or-down vote to strip that language out of the bill and they objected to it. so it is getting harder and harder to believe the sincerity of their protests, and it is appearing more and more likely that what they want to do is have the senate return to the same dysfunctional nature it was under for the last 4 years by the previous majority. i wish to pose several questions to our colleagues who insist on filibustering this bipartisan piece of legislation. the first question i have is: isn't it the case that only 3 months ago 50 democrats voted for the 2015 defense authorization bill? isn't that a bill a piece of authorizing legislation much like the underlying justice for victims of trafficking bill? if 50 democrats voted for similar language with regard to the limitations on the use of funding just a few months ago, how in the world can they filibuster this bill for including the same language they voted for, more or less, just a few short months ago? in fact, it is true that in 2009 all of the senate democrats--in a partisan vote--voted to include this similar language as part of obamacare. groups such as naral, the national abortion rights action league, protested that the language ``went far beyond even the hyde amendment.'' yet 60 democrats, including the then-majority leader--now minority leader--voted for that in the wee hours of christmas eve 2009. again, i ask our friends who are filibustering this bipartisan piece of legislation designed to help the victims of human trafficking: isn't it true that in 2009, 58 senate democrats voted to reauthorize the children's health insurance program, which like medicaid is subject to the hyde amendment? to each of those questions, the record would demonstrate they should be answered with a resounding yes. so time and time again, our colleagues on the other side of the aisle, who now find themselves in the inexplicable position of filibustering a bill they are cosponsoring or which they have already voted for in the judiciary committee and which contains very similar restrictions on the use of the funding--how in the world have they decided to make the stand, here and now, denying even the opportunity they have been given by the majority leader to have an up-or-down vote to strip the language out that they object to? well, despite the hypocrisy of their position, the question this really boils down to is this. this is the question, the only question that really matters: to our colleagues who are filibustering this legislation, are you prepared to turn your back on the thousands of people living every day in bondage and who are desperately clinging to the hope that someone--someone--will lend them a helping hand? are you prepared to abandon these children and these other victims of human trafficking who deserve a roof over their head, someone to lean on, and somehow, some way to get a fresh start in life? do our colleagues who are filibustering this legislation really want to play politics with such a sensitive and vulnerable part of our population over an issue that some advocates have called a phantom problem? the reason why some advocates who support this legislation have called the objection of the democratic leader a phantom problem is because not only have they voted for similar provisions over and over and over again, this essentially has been the settled law of the land for 39 years--since 1976. just in case our colleagues think that the examples i mentioned are exclusive, there are a number of other provisions--32 democrats voted for the so-called cr omnibus, the continuing resolution omnibus, in december. thirty-two democrats voted for that which contained very similar language. and i mentioned several others. i want to conclude with the washington post editorial for today. i do not always find myself in agreement with the washington post editorial board, but this morning i think they encapsulated the democratic filibuster of the bipartisan antitrafficking bill perfectly. in urging the senate to pass this legislation, they wrote: ``[t]his week the question will be whether senators can put the interests of scared, abused children ahead of the chance to score political points.'' i could not agree more. so tomorrow morning, an hour after we convene, we will have a vote that will decide whether this legislation goes on to final passage. we need six brave democrats--six brave democrats--to join all the republicans on this side to keep hope alive for these victims of human trafficking. we need six democrats who are willing to break away from the tyranny of their party's own leadership here in the senate and do what they know is the right thing to do. they know it in their heart, and they know it in their mind, and they know they have supported similar language in legislation time and time again. we need six democrats willing to break away from the mindless, heartless filibuster of this legislation. i hope they will examine their conscience. i [[page s1513]] hope they will ask themselves, isn't this exactly the kind of vote that i came here to the u.s. senate to cast? i hope they will pray on it, and i hope they will think long and hard before saying no to the abused children and the victims of human trafficking. that is what this is all about. it is not based on any hyde amendment language in this legislation. it is based on a determination to render this institution dysfunctional, not because of any principal policy disagreement, because, as i point out, our colleagues on the other side have voted for similar language time and time and time again. our colleagues on the other side realize that on november 4, the voters rejected the then-majority and gave this side of the aisle the opportunity to serve in the majority because, frankly, they were sick and tired of the way that washington operates and the dysfunction that prevailed here for so long. i had higher hopes that after the election we would all learn something from what the voters were telling us on november 4 and thereafter and that we would take advantage of the opportunity to try to work together to find areas where we could agree, in a bipartisan way, to actually move the ball forward and help people who need our help. if we cannot do that on an antihuman trafficking bill, what can we possibly work together on? this whole phony issue of the hyde amendment provision in this bill is a joke. it is a sick, sad joke, after time and time again voting for similar provisions in other legislation. as i pointed out, you have 12 democratic cosponsors of the legislation. do you think they did not read the legislation? that is ridiculous. do you think their staff did not tell them what was in the legislation? do you think before the judiciary committee voted unanimously to pass it out people did not know what they were voting on? i do not believe that for a minute. i have too much respect for our colleagues and their professionalism to think they missed it. our colleagues have an important choice to make tomorrow morning. i hope they will say yes to these victims of human trafficking and no to the kind of political gamesmanship that gives this institution a bad name. the presiding officer. the senator from illinois. ____________________",9316
CREC-2015-03-16-pt1-PgS1514,CREC-2015-03-16,114,HUMAN TRAFFICKING LEGISLATION,"[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 44 (Monday, March 16, 2015)] [Senate] [Pages S1514-S1515] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] HUMAN TRAFFICKING LEGISLATION Mr. HATCH. Madam President, today we will again resume consideration of the Justice for Victims of Trafficking Act. This is an important bill to me. I have been working on it for many years. Without a doubt, this legislation is incredibly important. Right now in this country there are thousands of human beings--mainly young people--living as slaves. Women and children are stolen from their homes, stripped of their God-given rights, and robbed of their human dignity. These individuals live among us. They live in our neighborhoods and in our suburbs, our biggest cities and our smallest towns. They live in a world of silence, fear, hopelessness, and unspeakable suffering. The State Department estimates that up to 17,500 individuals are trafficked to the United States every year. The majority of these are women and children. Some of them are forced into a life of unpaid servitude, many others into sex work. Worldwide, the International Labor Organization estimates that 4.5 million people are currently enslaved through sex trafficking. These numbers are staggering, but they only illustrate the scope of the problem. The suffering of each individual victim should not be lost in a sea of statistics. For victims of human trafficking, the surreal horror of their lives bears testimony to the gravity of the crime. A number of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle have worked tirelessly to update our legal framework for fighting this scourge. I wish to commend them for their efforts, especially the senior Senator from Texas, the senior Senator from Minnesota, and the chairman of the Judiciary Committee. Their efforts represent exactly the sort of work that should be the mission of this body: working across the aisle to produce workable solutions to the most pressing problems facing our Nation. The majority leader also merits praise for his decision to take up this bill and his unwavering support for it. Far too often, his predecessor focused the Senate's time and efforts on taking partisan messaging votes and abusing the rules to score political points. By prioritizing the consideration of important bipartisan legislation such as this--and by restoring this body's traditions of fulsome debate, an open amendment process, and regular order through the committee system--our new majority is putting the Senate back to work for the American people. While the sailing has not always been totally smooth-- it rarely is--the progress we have seen in restoring this institution to its proper role as a productive legislative body is both real and meaningful. Given the progress we have made thus far, the logjam that is currently impeding our progress on this important legislation is extremely disappointing. My colleagues on the other side of the aisle have claimed that we somehow supposedly snuck a controversial abortion provision into an otherwise uncontroversial bill. This claim is unequivocally ridiculous. First, the language in question was by no means snuck into the bill. It was in the bill when it was introduced at the beginning of this Congress. It was in the bill when those of us on the Judiciary Committee took part in an extensive markup of the bill. It was in the bill when it passed unanimously out of committee. It was in the bill when we undertook its consideration here on the floor. In fact, there were Democratic cosponsors of this bill. Moreover, not only was this language in the bill from the beginning, but it has also been the law of the land for nearly four decades. Democrats in this body have supported countless other bills with similar language, including even ObamaCare. Abortion is obviously a divisive and sensitive issue. While I am strongly pro-life, I recognize that many of my friends passionately disagree with me on this issue. As Members of this institution, it is incumbent upon us to respect the sincere beliefs of our colleagues with whom we disagree and to work toward responsible governing arrangements. The Hyde amendment represents such a sensible and appropriate arrangement. It is predicated on the commonsense notion that while we may vigorously disagree on whether life should be protected before birth, we can broadly agree that taxpayer money should not be used-- should not be [[Page S1515]] used--to fund a procedure that many Americans--in fact a majority, according to a number of polls--consider to be murder. The responsible way for each of us to approach this bill, regardless of our view on abortion, is to embrace this long-standing, commonsense compromise on abortion funding and focus on passing the underlying measure--a bill that is so critical to our efforts to fight human trafficking and help alleviate the suffering of victims. To hold up the passage of this bill to pick a fight over the Hyde amendment represents an unambiguous dereliction of Senators' individual duties to responsibly legislate. Unfortunately, that is exactly what my colleagues on the other side of the aisle have done. They are now threatening a filibuster unless we agree to their extreme pro-abortion position on this issue. There ought to be six of them who will stand up and vote with us and get this bill passed. In response, the majority leader offered an eminently reasonable compromise--an up-or-down vote on an amendment to strip out the language to which they are suddenly objecting. But the minority leader objected, demanding a guarantee that the provision be removed. By doing so, the minority leader is once again resorting to outrageous ``my way or the highway'' tactics that are the antithesis of how the Senate should work. It is a move out of the same playbook that he used to give us a calendar full of messaging votes last year meant to produce political theater rather than meaningful legislation. This ploy plainly demonstrates the desire of the minority leadership to muck up the majority's efforts to exercise reliable leadership, no matter the cost to the victims of human trafficking. By resorting to this sort of obstruction, they have demonstrated how desperately they want to derail our efforts to legislate responsibly and instead resort to their tired and discredited war-on-women rhetoric to win cheap political points. Let me repeat a point I have repeatedly made about this impasse-- words that the minority leader has tried to manipulate to support his shameful gambit. For all of my colleagues who are tempted by this irresponsible strategy: It would be pathetic to hold up this bill. This bill is absolutely critical to our families and our children. I cannot believe the Senate has become so political that my colleagues would raise this issue--this tangential, long-settled issue at this time--after the same transparently clear language passed unanimously out of the Judiciary Committee. For my colleagues to hold up this bill in an effort to impose their extreme policy, to overturn the law of the land that has long enjoyed bipartisan support, to pick a false fight over abortion, or to try to embarrass the majority is itself embarrassing. I urge my colleagues in the minority in the strongest possible terms to reconsider their position and allow the Senate, once again, to do the people's business. Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. COATS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 44 (Monday, March 16, 2015)] [Senate] [Pages S1514-S1515] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] HUMAN TRAFFICKING LEGISLATION Mr. HATCH.

he used to give us a calendar full of messaging votes last year meant to produce political theater rather than meaningful legislation. this ploy plainly demonstrates the desire of the minority leadership to muck up the majority's efforts to exercise reliable leadership, no matter the cost to the victims of human trafficking. by resorting to this sort of obstruction, they have demonstrated how desperately they want to derail our efforts to legislate responsibly and instead resort to their tired and discredited war-on-women rhetoric to win cheap political points. let me repeat a point i have repeatedly made about this impasse-- words that the minority leader has tried to manipulate to support his shameful gambit. for all of my colleagues who are tempted by this irresponsible strategy: it would be pathetic to hold up this bill. this bill is absolutely critical to our families and our children. i cannot believe the senate has become so political that my colleagues would raise this issue--this tangential, long-settled issue at this time--after the same transparently clear language passed unanimously out of the judiciary committee. for my colleagues to hold up this bill in an effort to impose their extreme policy, to overturn the law of the land that has long enjoyed bipartisan support, to pick a false fight over abortion, or to try to embarrass the majority is itself embarrassing. i urge my colleagues in the minority in the strongest possible terms to reconsider their position and allow the senate, once again, to do the people's business. madam president, i suggest the absence of a quorum. the presiding officer. the clerk will call the roll. the legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. mr. coats. madam president, i ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. the presiding officer. without objection, it is so ordered. ____________________",7774
CREC-2015-03-16-pt1-PgS1513,CREC-2015-03-16,114,SENATE AGENDA AND NEGOTIATIONS WITH IRAN,"[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 44 (Monday, March 16, 2015)] [Senate] [Pages S1513-S1514] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] SENATE AGENDA AND NEGOTIATIONS WITH IRAN Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I listened to the impassioned speech by my colleague from Texas on the issue of human trafficking. There is no dispute here. This legislation is bipartisan. Democrats and Republicans are prepared to support the bill that has been offered on human trafficking by Republican Senator Cornyn and Democratic Senator Klobuchar. There are amendments pending I think which improve the bill--one by Senator Leahy about runaway children. In fact, we are so prepared to do this that we have put together a comprehensive substitute amendment to what has just been described which could be quickly passed on the floor. I do not believe there would be more than a handful of Senators voting no. I certainly would support the passage of the Leahy version. What is the difference? Senator Cornyn has injected into this important issue a side issue, but not an inconsequential one, on the Hyde amendment. Henry Hyde was a Congressman from Illinois who served in the House of Representatives with me for a period of time. He authored the Hyde amendment that said no Federal funds shall be used to pay for abortion procedures except in very limited circumstances--rape, incest, and the life of the mother. That has been put in appropriations bills every year since--without question, without challenge. What Senator Cornyn is trying to do is to make this permanent law, and make it part of a human trafficking bill. I do not doubt this is an important issue. I know it is because I have served in the House and the Senate. But I do question whether we should make every bill that comes along a vehicle or carrier for debating abortion or other really controversial issues. This question of passing a human trafficking bill to protect the scores--thousands--of victims of human trafficking is one which would pass in a heartbeat in the Senate if the Senator from Texas would remove this controversial section. Senator Leahy has offered that substitute. I hope we will have an opportunity to vote on it, and vote on it soon. As to whether this is a reflection of a dysfunctional Congress, well, most of the people back in Illinois and Chicago whom I run into-- particularly this weekend--have raised that issue from time to time, and I can see where the argument could be made. We now have a Congress controlled by Republicans--the House and the Senate--and the White House, obviously, with a Democratic President. It is a tough political terrain under the best of circumstances, and we certainly have not been facing the best of circumstances for a long time. There are just a lot of differences between the House and the Senate and the President and the White House, and many of those are manifest. What was the first bill the Republican majority in the Senate called--No. 1, Senate bill 1? The Keystone Pipeline--a bill to authorize the construction of a pipeline owned by a Canadian company in the United States. That was the highest priority for the Senate Republicans. The President said at the outset: Do not try to preempt my authority as President. I will veto it. But they insisted. We went through several weeks--2 or 3 weeks--of amendments, and we cooperated on the Democratic side. I think there might have been 30 or more amendments offered during that period of time. In the end, the bill passed with six or eight Democratic votes, was sent to the President, and was vetoed. So the first 3 weeks were spent on this politically controversial issue, for which, at the end of the day, the President's veto was sustained, and it was wiped off the slate. Then we went into a rather bizarre chapter here where the House Republicans insisted that before--before--they would fund the Department of Homeland Security--you know, the folks at the airport, the people who are guarding our borders--before they would fund the Department of Homeland Security to guard us against terrorism, we had to vote on five separate riders relative to the President's immigration Executive orders. They held up this appropriation--giving partial funding to it week after week after week--until we finally said: Enough is enough. Fund this agency that keeps us safe. Stop playing political games with this issue. It went back and forth and back and forth. Another 3 weeks were wasted on this issue before finally--finally--on a bipartisan basis we passed this measure funding the Department of Homeland Security and said to the House of Representatives: Please, stop putting extraneous issues on important matters like funding our government. I thought perhaps we turned the corner and moved in a more positive way, but we are mired now over this one, small provision in this bill which Senator Cornyn could remove in a heartbeat. Then last week came a blockbuster issue. I did not realize a week ago today that still a week later I would be going on Chicago television being questioned about a letter signed by 47 Republican Senators which was sent to the Ayatollah of Iran, a letter sent by 47 Republican Senators to the Ayatollah of Iran telling him and his government not to negotiate with the President of the United States in an effort to stop Iran from developing nuclear weapons. The author of this letter, Senator Cotton of Arkansas, and those who signed it, went to great lengths describing how they would, in fact, have the last word on anything negotiated by this President and that they planned on being around for a long, long time, urging the Ayatollah to not enter into negotiations with the President of the United States of America. There is no historic precedent for what just occurred--none. We have never had 47 Senators of any party send a letter to a head of state and say: Stop negotiating with the United States of America. And they did it. The press reaction across the United States has been overwhelmingly negative to this action that was taken by these 47 Senators. I could go through the long list here of what newspapers across America have said about that letter. [[Page S1514]] The Detroit Free Press said: ``A blot on the 114th U.S. Senate.'' The Pittsburgh Post-Gazette: ``The senators who signed the letter should be ashamed.'' The Salt Lake Tribune: ``Cringe-worthy buffoonery on the global stage'' is how they described that letter. The Courier-Journal in Louisville, KY, asked the question: ``Has Congress gone crazy?'' when they reflected on this letter. The Courier- Journal went on to call those who signed it: ``Senate Saboteurs.'' Those are their words, not mine. The Salt Lake Tribune said: ``. . . the foolish, dangerous and arguably felonious attempt by the Obama Derangement Caucus of the Senate. . . .'' The Kansas City Star said: ``Was Iran letter traitorous or just treacherous for GOP [Senators]. . . .'' The Los Angeles Times called it ``insulting.'' They said: ``The Republican senators' meddling in that responsibility is outrageous.'' It goes on and on. I won't read them all. It doesn't get any better. It gets worse. And to think that 47 Republican Senators would try to preempt any President of the United States. Today in Geneva, Switzerland, former Senator and current Secretary of State John Kerry sits down at a negotiating table across from Iran. On our side of the table are major allies trying to stop the development of a nuclear weapon in Iran. They will struggle. Maybe they will never reach an agreement. But what the 47 Senators said in a letter to the Ayatollah of Iran will not help. What is the alternative? If these negotiations fail, the alternative is Iran develops a nuclear weapon and endangers not only Israel but the Middle East and far beyond, and triggers an arms race in the Middle East for nuclear weapons. That is an outrageous, unacceptable outcome. Or, military action. Military action by Israel, perhaps, as Prime Minister Netanyahu suggested 2 weeks ago; military action by the United States. Is it worth our time to be negotiating to try to find a peaceful resolution, to try to find a way for Iran to stop developing nuclear weapons with verifiable inspections? We won't take them at their word. There have to be inspections. Or is it better, as these 47 Republican Senators insisted, to walk away from the table? I think it is far better to continue these negotiations. I don't know if they will end up with a good agreement, but don't we owe it to our President, our Secretary of State, our government, our country, to at least see these negotiations through and then to read the agreement before 47 Senators send a letter condemning it and rejecting it? It was a sad day. But now let's turn the corner. The first thing we should do this week--the absolute first thing we should do--is approve the President's nominee to be Attorney General. Loretta Lynch appeared before our Judiciary Committee. Senator Hatch was there, and I think he may even concede what I am about to say: No one laid a glove on this magnificent lady--a prosecutor with a spotless record; an African American with a life story about witnessing the civil rights movement as it unfolded in this country in the 1960s; an extraordinarily good person--good family, good background, impeccable credentials. There wasn't a single thing said about her that would stop anyone voting for her. Now her nomination has been sitting for 128 days since it was announced. They are trying to set a record on the Republican side: No nominee for Attorney General has languished that long in the last 30 years. If they have a complaint about this lady, let them say so. Their complaint: She was chosen by President Barack Obama. That is not good enough. This week, let us rise above the politics which have dominated the Senate since this session began. Let us do something constructive-- approve this Attorney General, take this offensive section out of this bill, and move it for passage. We can get it done in a matter of hours. I yield the floor.

the keystone pipeline--a bill to authorize the construction of a pipeline owned by a canadian company in the united states. that was the highest priority for the senate republicans. the president said at the outset: do not try to preempt my authority as president. i will veto it. but they insisted. we went through several weeks--2 or 3 weeks--of amendments, and we cooperated on the democratic side. i think there might have been 30 or more amendments offered during that period of time. in the end, the bill passed with six or eight democratic votes, was sent to the president, and was vetoed. so the first 3 weeks were spent on this politically controversial issue, for which, at the end of the day, the president's veto was sustained, and it was wiped off the slate. then we went into a rather bizarre chapter here where the house republicans insisted that before--before--they would fund the department of homeland security--you know, the folks at the airport, the people who are guarding our borders--before they would fund the department of homeland security to guard us against terrorism, we had to vote on five separate riders relative to the president's immigration executive orders. they held up this appropriation--giving partial funding to it week after week after week--until we finally said: enough is enough. fund this agency that keeps us safe. stop playing political games with this issue. it went back and forth and back and forth. another 3 weeks were wasted on this issue before finally--finally--on a bipartisan basis we passed this measure funding the department of homeland security and said to the house of representatives: please, stop putting extraneous issues on important matters like funding our government. i thought perhaps we turned the corner and moved in a more positive way, but we are mired now over this one, small provision in this bill which senator cornyn could remove in a heartbeat. then last week came a blockbuster issue. i did not realize a week ago today that still a week later i would be going on chicago television being questioned about a letter signed by 47 republican senators which was sent to the ayatollah of iran, a letter sent by 47 republican senators to the ayatollah of iran telling him and his government not to negotiate with the president of the united states in an effort to stop iran from developing nuclear weapons. the author of this letter, senator cotton of arkansas, and those who signed it, went to great lengths describing how they would, in fact, have the last word on anything negotiated by this president and that they planned on being around for a long, long time, urging the ayatollah to not enter into negotiations with the president of the united states of america. there is no historic precedent for what just occurred--none. we have never had 47 senators of any party send a letter to a head of state and say: stop negotiating with the united states of america. and they did it. the press reaction across the united states has been overwhelmingly negative to this action that was taken by these 47 senators. i could go through the long list here of what newspapers across america have said about that letter. [[page s1514]] the detroit free press said: ``a blot on the 114th u.s. senate.'' the pittsburgh post-gazette: ``the senators who signed the letter should be ashamed.'' the salt lake tribune: ``cringe-worthy buffoonery on the global stage'' is how they described that letter. the courier-journal in louisville, ky, asked the question: ``has congress gone crazy?'' when they reflected on this letter. the courier- journal went on to call those who signed it: ``senate saboteurs.'' those are their words, not mine. the salt lake tribune said: ``. . . the foolish, dangerous and arguably felonious attempt by the obama derangement caucus of the senate. . . .'' the kansas city star said: ``was iran letter traitorous or just treacherous for gop [senators]. . . .'' the los angeles times called it ``insulting.'' they said: ``the republican senators' meddling in that responsibility is outrageous.'' it goes on and on. i won't read them all. it doesn't get any better. it gets worse. and to think that 47 republican senators would try to preempt any president of the united states. today in geneva, switzerland, former senator and current secretary of state john kerry sits down at a negotiating table across from iran. on our side of the table are major allies trying to stop the development of a nuclear weapon in iran. they will struggle. maybe they will never reach an agreement. but what the 47 senators said in a letter to the ayatollah of iran will not help. what is the alternative? if these negotiations fail, the alternative is iran develops a nuclear weapon and endangers not only israel but the middle east and far beyond, and triggers an arms race in the middle east for nuclear weapons. that is an outrageous, unacceptable outcome. or, military action. military action by israel, perhaps, as prime minister netanyahu suggested 2 weeks ago; military action by the united states. is it worth our time to be negotiating to try to find a peaceful resolution, to try to find a way for iran to stop developing nuclear weapons with verifiable inspections? we won't take them at their word. there have to be inspections. or is it better, as these 47 republican senators insisted, to walk away from the table? i think it is far better to continue these negotiations. i don't know if they will end up with a good agreement, but don't we owe it to our president, our secretary of state, our government, our country, to at least see these negotiations through and then to read the agreement before 47 senators send a letter condemning it and rejecting it? it was a sad day. but now let's turn the corner. the first thing we should do this week--the absolute first thing we should do--is approve the president's nominee to be attorney general. loretta lynch appeared before our judiciary committee. senator hatch was there, and i think he may even concede what i am about to say: no one laid a glove on this magnificent lady--a prosecutor with a spotless record; an african american with a life story about witnessing the civil rights movement as it unfolded in this country in the 1960s; an extraordinarily good person--good family, good background, impeccable credentials. there wasn't a single thing said about her that would stop anyone voting for her. now her nomination has been sitting for 128 days since it was announced. they are trying to set a record on the republican side: no nominee for attorney general has languished that long in the last 30 years. if they have a complaint about this lady, let them say so. their complaint: she was chosen by president barack obama. that is not good enough. this week, let us rise above the politics which have dominated the senate since this session began. let us do something constructive-- approve this attorney general, take this offensive section out of this bill, and move it for passage. we can get it done in a matter of hours. i yield the floor. the presiding officer. the senator from utah. ____________________",10194
CREC-2015-03-16-pt1-PgS1515,CREC-2015-03-16,114,A NUCLEAR IRAN,"[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 44 (Monday, March 16, 2015)] [Senate] [Pages S1515-S1516] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] A NUCLEAR IRAN Mr. COATS. Madam President, I rise to discuss what many believe is the most dangerous threat to our national security, and that is a nuclear Iran. Over the past few weeks, there have been a lot of discussions about the Obama administration's ongoing negotiations with Iran and what the role of Congress should be. I believe the debate this past week in Congress over how to best address this issue has distracted us from what I believe are the two key objectives in our effort to prevent Iran from achieving nuclear weapons capability. First, Iran must be prevented from getting the bomb, and second, we in the Senate must decide the best way to guarantee that result. For the past 10 years, I have been working hard to find the most acceptable and best way to prevent Iran from developing nuclear weapons capability. Note that word ``capability.'' For me, it has long been not enough to just announce that we must not allow Iran to get a nuclear weapon. I am determined that Iran must not get the technical capability to manufacture such a weapon because a nuclear weapons-capable Iran is as dangerous as a nuclear-armed Iran because it throws up a cloud of ambiguity about its formal intentions. There are many in the policy communities who find some mistaken sense of comfort from the intelligence agencies' current view that Iran has not yet made a formal decision to develop a nuclear weapon. This is a delusion. Iran's industrial-strength uranium enrichment enterprise has gone from 600 centrifuges 6 years ago when the international community first expressed alarm to 19,000 today. We know the Ayatollah is on a quest for 190,000 centrifuges as soon as international constraints are removed. Let's state the obvious: The Iranian pursuit of uranium enrichment is not being created to manufacture medical isotopes and reactor fuel for producing electricity; its purpose is to produce nuclear bombs. Throughout my many years of involvement on this issue--as cochair of the task force at the Bipartisan Policy Center along with former Senator Chuck Robb and a distinguished panel of experts and in the last 4 years here in the Senate--I have called for using the full range of tools to prevent Iran from reaching its nuclear goal. These include negotiations coupled with ever-increasing sanctions pressure and a credible threat of the use of military force if the negotiations and sanctions fail to lead to Iran's commitment to cease its pursuit of nuclear weapons capability. This continues to be my view. I do believe in diplomacy. I would very much like to see effective negotiations take place, led by insightful diplomats, focused on the right results. I would like to see that lead to a settlement that brings security and confidence. But we have every reason to fear this is not now happening. I don't want to destroy the negotiations track, but I do want to refocus it with the firm backing it requires to achieve the goal we need to reach. I don't want to demand everything from the Iranians, but I do want to require enough to guarantee they give up on their nuclear weapons ambitions. I don't want to torpedo the administration's diplomatic efforts, but I do want to require that Congress have the final say on whether the results of negotiations are acceptable and achieve the goals of preventing Iran's nuclear weapons capability. For me and I trust for the Senate, this is our most important task of the moment--to force the President to accept a congressional role. He has said repeatedly that he will deny us that role when it comes to approving any agreement. We must not let that happen. The reason I did not sign the open letter to Iran is not because I disagreed with the goals of the letter. All Senate Republicans and, I believe, many Senate Democrats, are in agreement on the overall objective of avoiding a bad deal with Iran. But the strategy we need to accomplish this essential goal is now in question, and we are divided now in a way that makes this goal harder to achieve. There are two bills pending that would require the President to present any Iran deal to us for review and action, and this is the course I believe we should take. One, which I cosponsored, has been introduced by both Senators Kirk and Menendez--a bipartisan effort. The other, coauthored by Senators Corker and Menendez--also bipartisan--I also support. The latter bill, which would require Congress to approve any deal with Iran, is very close to achieving the support of 67 or more Senators needed to overturn President Obama's promised veto of any legislation on this topic. Lack of bipartisan consensus at this moment on this issue is likely to lead to a fatally flawed deal that destroys more than a decade of effort to bring Iran to cease its goal of nuclear weapons capability. We all know now that the Obama administration abandoned the core objectives at the very outset, even before these talks began. Four U.N. Security [[Page S1516]] Council resolutions; frequent and constant demands coming from this Chamber; four Presidents--two Republicans and two Democrats--saying a nuclear-capable Iran is unacceptable; the firm position of AIPAC and other friends of Israel--all stated the necessity that Iran give up and shut down all its uranium-enriching centrifuges. Yet this goal was jettisoned before the talks even started. The Obama administration spokesmen, including Secretary Kerry himself, have explained repeatedly that it was just too hard to achieve. We must be more realistic, we are told. The Iranians, we are told, can never be expected to agree to the demands laid down years ago by the Security Council. That was then, they said. This is now. Everything has changed. We have to set that goal aside, and we have to reach some reasonable agreement with a reasonable process with a reasonable country. The word we need to question there is ``reasonable.'' Madam President, it appears my time is running out, but I notice that no other Member is here to speak, so I ask unanimous consent to speak for just 3 more minutes. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. COATS. Madam President, I thank the Chair. But even leaving that shocking capitulation aside, we can never expect that the Iranians would negotiate under those conditions. We can now focus on the key fatal flaw of this agreement. It has been simmering for months, but it is now boiling over onto the front pages of our national attention thanks to the presentation by the Prime Minister of Israel, and that is the sunset clause. We now see that even if Iran is constrained by this agreement and even if in the most unlikely of worlds Iran fully complies with the agreement, at the end of a decade or so, Iran will be fully liberated to pursue nuclear capabilities with no limitations or constraints whatsoever--a free hand, a blank check to go forward, an Iran that will have wealth, the technical expertise, industrial infrastructure, the will, and, if given a sunset provision, the international acquiescence to do whatever they like to pursue their goal without any ability of us to stop it. They can do whatever they like. Ten years--oh, that is a long time out. Ten years is tomorrow afternoon. It is a blink of the eye. Such a sunset clause makes this entire enterprise unacceptable. Any agreement that contains a sunset clause must be rejected, and any agreement with Iran that does not impose permanent restraints on their nuclear ambitions is no agreement at all. We in the Senate have it within our ability and mandate to guarantee that happens, but to do so, we need to reach consensus across the aisle. We need to work together as Republicans and Democrats for the future security of our Nation, and for that matter, all nations. There are a number of issues on which we don't agree. There are a number of things on which we have different thoughts about how to proceed. But this is an issue of such historic consequence and such potential harm that we must find a way to work together to ensure our ability to undo what looks like is coming our way. So I plead with and I urge my colleagues--all my colleagues, Republicans and Democrats--to rise above any political considerations and work together to ensure that this Senate can prevent Iran from getting the bomb. History and future generations and our children and our grandchildren will judge what we do here now, and may that judgment be the right judgment for not just the future of our Nation but for the future of the world. Madam President, with that, I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 44 (Monday, March 16, 2015)] [Senate] [Pages S1515-S1516] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] A NUCLEAR IRAN Mr. COATS.

its purpose is to produce nuclear bombs. throughout my many years of involvement on this issue--as cochair of the task force at the bipartisan policy center along with former senator chuck robb and a distinguished panel of experts and in the last 4 years here in the senate--i have called for using the full range of tools to prevent iran from reaching its nuclear goal. these include negotiations coupled with ever-increasing sanctions pressure and a credible threat of the use of military force if the negotiations and sanctions fail to lead to iran's commitment to cease its pursuit of nuclear weapons capability. this continues to be my view. i do believe in diplomacy. i would very much like to see effective negotiations take place, led by insightful diplomats, focused on the right results. i would like to see that lead to a settlement that brings security and confidence. but we have every reason to fear this is not now happening. i don't want to destroy the negotiations track, but i do want to refocus it with the firm backing it requires to achieve the goal we need to reach. i don't want to demand everything from the iranians, but i do want to require enough to guarantee they give up on their nuclear weapons ambitions. i don't want to torpedo the administration's diplomatic efforts, but i do want to require that congress have the final say on whether the results of negotiations are acceptable and achieve the goals of preventing iran's nuclear weapons capability. for me and i trust for the senate, this is our most important task of the moment--to force the president to accept a congressional role. he has said repeatedly that he will deny us that role when it comes to approving any agreement. we must not let that happen. the reason i did not sign the open letter to iran is not because i disagreed with the goals of the letter. all senate republicans and, i believe, many senate democrats, are in agreement on the overall objective of avoiding a bad deal with iran. but the strategy we need to accomplish this essential goal is now in question, and we are divided now in a way that makes this goal harder to achieve. there are two bills pending that would require the president to present any iran deal to us for review and action, and this is the course i believe we should take. one, which i cosponsored, has been introduced by both senators kirk and menendez--a bipartisan effort. the other, coauthored by senators corker and menendez--also bipartisan--i also support. the latter bill, which would require congress to approve any deal with iran, is very close to achieving the support of 67 or more senators needed to overturn president obama's promised veto of any legislation on this topic. lack of bipartisan consensus at this moment on this issue is likely to lead to a fatally flawed deal that destroys more than a decade of effort to bring iran to cease its goal of nuclear weapons capability. we all know now that the obama administration abandoned the core objectives at the very outset, even before these talks began. four u.n. security [[page s1516]] council resolutions; frequent and constant demands coming from this chamber; four presidents--two republicans and two democrats--saying a nuclear-capable iran is unacceptable; the firm position of aipac and other friends of israel--all stated the necessity that iran give up and shut down all its uranium-enriching centrifuges. yet this goal was jettisoned before the talks even started. the obama administration spokesmen, including secretary kerry himself, have explained repeatedly that it was just too hard to achieve. we must be more realistic, we are told. the iranians, we are told, can never be expected to agree to the demands laid down years ago by the security council. that was then, they said. this is now. everything has changed. we have to set that goal aside, and we have to reach some reasonable agreement with a reasonable process with a reasonable country. the word we need to question there is ``reasonable.'' madam president, it appears my time is running out, but i notice that no other member is here to speak, so i ask unanimous consent to speak for just 3 more minutes. the presiding officer. without objection, it is so ordered. mr. coats. madam president, i thank the chair. but even leaving that shocking capitulation aside, we can never expect that the iranians would negotiate under those conditions. we can now focus on the key fatal flaw of this agreement. it has been simmering for months, but it is now boiling over onto the front pages of our national attention thanks to the presentation by the prime minister of israel, and that is the sunset clause. we now see that even if iran is constrained by this agreement and even if in the most unlikely of worlds iran fully complies with the agreement, at the end of a decade or so, iran will be fully liberated to pursue nuclear capabilities with no limitations or constraints whatsoever--a free hand, a blank check to go forward, an iran that will have wealth, the technical expertise, industrial infrastructure, the will, and, if given a sunset provision, the international acquiescence to do whatever they like to pursue their goal without any ability of us to stop it. they can do whatever they like. ten years--oh, that is a long time out. ten years is tomorrow afternoon. it is a blink of the eye. such a sunset clause makes this entire enterprise unacceptable. any agreement that contains a sunset clause must be rejected, and any agreement with iran that does not impose permanent restraints on their nuclear ambitions is no agreement at all. we in the senate have it within our ability and mandate to guarantee that happens, but to do so, we need to reach consensus across the aisle. we need to work together as republicans and democrats for the future security of our nation, and for that matter, all nations. there are a number of issues on which we don't agree. there are a number of things on which we have different thoughts about how to proceed. but this is an issue of such historic consequence and such potential harm that we must find a way to work together to ensure our ability to undo what looks like is coming our way. so i plead with and i urge my colleagues--all my colleagues, republicans and democrats--to rise above any political considerations and work together to ensure that this senate can prevent iran from getting the bomb. history and future generations and our children and our grandchildren will judge what we do here now, and may that judgment be the right judgment for not just the future of our nation but for the future of the world. madam president, with that, i yield the floor. i suggest the absence of a quorum. the presiding officer. the clerk will call the roll. the bill clerk proceeded to call the roll. mr. leahy. madam president, i ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. the presiding officer. without objection, it is so ordered. ____________________",9074
CREC-2015-03-16-pt1-PgS1516,CREC-2015-03-16,114,LYNCH NOMINATION,"[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 44 (Monday, March 16, 2015)] [Senate] [Pages S1516-S1517] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] LYNCH NOMINATION Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, last week the majority leader announced that he would finally schedule a vote for this week on the nomination of Loretta Lynch to be our next Attorney General. But as of today no date has been set. The Senate majority leader is now threatening to further delay a vote on this highly qualified nominee until after the Senate has concluded its debate on the human trafficking bill. Now, there is really no good reason for Senate Republicans to continue dragging their feet on scheduling a vote on Ms. Lynch's nomination. I have been here long enough to know we can debate legislation and vote on nominations at the same time, and to say otherwise is a hollow excuse. In fact, last Thursday we voted on four other executive nominations while we were on the human trafficking bill. We are actually going to vote on two more executive nominations this evening while we are on the human trafficking bill. All Senators who agree on the importance of ending human trafficking also know it is important to confirm Loretta Lynch as our Nation's top law enforcement officer. She has a proven track record of prosecuting human trafficking and child rape crimes. This is not just somebody who just talks about it and says how much they are opposed to human trafficking, as though anybody were in favor of human trafficking. This not just someone who says she is opposed to child rape cases, as though anybody here were going to say they are in favor of it. She has actually prosecuted them. Over the course of the last decade, the U.S. attorney's office that Ms. Lynch leads has indicted over 55 defendants in sex trafficking cases and rescued over 110 victims of sex trafficking. We stand here on the floor talking about these issues. She actually does it. So I think she and the American people have waited long enough. President Obama announced the nomination of Ms. Lynch 4 months ago. The Judiciary Committee reported her nomination with bipartisan support 18 days ago. By tomorrow--we talk about whether we move fast or not. By tomorrow, her nomination will have been pending on the Senate floor longer than all of the past five attorneys general combined. Take a look at this. Here is Loretta Lynch. She has been pending on the floor now for 18 days. This is, of course, with the months she had to wait before that. Now, Attorneys General Holder, Mukasey, Gonzales, Ashcroft, and Reno had to wait a total of 18 days pending after their nominations came out--so five of them, one of her. She has had to wait as long as five of them had to wait. We also pointed out the amount of time--I look at the amount of time it took--for the four men who preceded her. All four of those men went through so much faster than she has. We happened to have a vote out of committee. Janet Reno took 1 day. John Ashcroft, who I helped get through the committee, although I did not support him, took 2 days. Alberto Gonzales took 8 days; Michael Mukasey, 2 days, and Eric Holder, 5 days. This delay is an embarrassment to the Senate. Her qualifications are beyond reproach. But the Senate Republican leadership continues to delay a vote on her confirmation despite her impeccable credentials. Now, when she is confirmed, we know that Loretta Lynch will be the first African-American woman to serve our country as Attorney General. But instead of moving forward with this historic nomination, Senate Republicans appear intent on making history for all of the wrong reasons. As David Hawkings wrote in a Roll Call article dated March 12: Lynch is on a course to be confirmed this month after the longest wait ever for a nominee to be attorney general--and very likely by the closest vote ever to put a new person in charge of the Justice Department. We want to send the signal that we are tough on crime. We want to send the signal that we want to get these traffickers. We want to send a signal that people who commit crimes, whether they are Republicans or Democrats, should go to jail. Yet we refuse to confirm the person who has actually done all of those things. It appears that some want to simply refuse to allow a vote on her nomination, effectively shirking the constitutional duty of the Senate to provide advice and consent. One Republican Senator even tweeted on the weekend about the need to [[Page S1517]] block her historic nomination. Then, in case you overlooked why he was doing that, he included a link to a political fundraising Web site. We have always kept law enforcement--the FBI Director, the Attorney General, anybody in law enforcement--out of politics. For a Senator to tweet that we have to block this person, and oh, by the way, here is where you can contribute to a political campaign--that is wrong. It seems likely the Senate will have to file a cloture motion to vote to overcome the filibuster of her nomination. That is unprecedented; it is unwarranted. No other Attorney General nomination in our history has ever been met with a filibuster. We have never needed to have a cloture vote on an Attorney General nomination. Yet it seems Republican leadership wants to make history for all the wrong reasons. I mention this to give us an idea. President George Bush in the last 2 years of his term--now a lameduck President--nominated Michael Mukasey for Attorney General. Michael Mukasey was being sent because the last Attorney General had done a disastrous job--even though he had been voted for by, I think, all Republicans--people will accept the fact now that he politicized the prosecutors' offices and everything else, and finally the Bush administration had to get rid of him. I had just become chairman again, as Democrats had taken back the Senate. I moved Attorney General Mukasey through even though I did not support him. I felt the President should have a vote on his Attorney General. I moved him through in record time. She has waited so much more time, multiple times longer than Mukasey. This is especially troubling and unfair because Ms. Lynch's qualifications for the job are so extraordinary. And her life story is equally extraordinary. Born in Greensboro and raised in Durham, NC, Loretta Lynch is the daughter of a fourth-generation Baptist preacher and a school librarian. They instilled in her the American values of fairness and equality, even when those around them were not living up to those values. Ms. Lynch has spoken about riding on her father's shoulders to their church where students organized peaceful protests against racial segregation. The freedom songs and the church music that went hand-in-hand with those protests undoubtedly made up the soundtrack of her childhood. The Judiciary Committee was honored to have her father, Rev. Lorenzo Lynch, with us not only at both days of her historic hearing in January but also with us when the committee considered his daughter's nomination in February. When Loretta Lynch was a young child, Reverend Lynch bravely opened his church's basement to the students and others who organized lunch counter sit-ins in North Carolina. He taught his only daughter that ``ideals are wonderful things, but unless you can share them with others and make this world a better place, they're just words.'' The fact that she has dedicated the majority of her career to public service reaffirms that she has lived those ideals of justice in the service of others. And yet, Senate Republicans appear intent on preventing her from continuing her service--service that we should be honored to have. Two weekends ago, Ms. Lynch traveled to Selma to honor the 50th anniversary of the historic march across the Edmund Pettus Bridge, where scores of courageous Americans were beaten and trampled on Bloody Sunday because they refused to be silent about the need for equal protection under the law. It was a weekend when both Democrats and Republicans came together. President Obama stood there with President George W. Bush beside him, who had signed the last Voting Rights Act. They honored the civil rights activists of 50 years ago. But I also felt it was a time to reaffirm our shared commitment to Americans, as Americans, and the ideals of justice and equality that so many of our predecessors have fought and bled for, from our Founding Fathers to the foot soldiers for justice on that bridge in Selma. Loretta Lynch embodies these ideals. She has devoted her career to making them a reality. It is time for Republicans and Democrats to come together to confirm this outstanding woman to be the next Attorney General. It is time to stop delaying and making excuses for how she is being treated. It is time to vote. This is reflecting badly on all law enforcement. I hear from so many in law enforcement saying: Why are you politicizing this nomination? Republicans and Democrats have usually kept law enforcement out of politics. Why is this? The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired. Senators are limited to 10 minutes each. Mr. LEAHY. Are we on the trafficking act? The PRESIDING OFFICER. No, we are in morning business. Mr. LEAHY. When do we go on the trafficking act? The PRESIDING OFFICER. Morning business has expired. Mr. LEAHY.

michael mukasey, 2 days, and eric holder, 5 days. this delay is an embarrassment to the senate. her qualifications are beyond reproach. but the senate republican leadership continues to delay a vote on her confirmation despite her impeccable credentials. now, when she is confirmed, we know that loretta lynch will be the first african-american woman to serve our country as attorney general. but instead of moving forward with this historic nomination, senate republicans appear intent on making history for all of the wrong reasons. as david hawkings wrote in a roll call article dated march 12: lynch is on a course to be confirmed this month after the longest wait ever for a nominee to be attorney general--and very likely by the closest vote ever to put a new person in charge of the justice department. we want to send the signal that we are tough on crime. we want to send the signal that we want to get these traffickers. we want to send a signal that people who commit crimes, whether they are republicans or democrats, should go to jail. yet we refuse to confirm the person who has actually done all of those things. it appears that some want to simply refuse to allow a vote on her nomination, effectively shirking the constitutional duty of the senate to provide advice and consent. one republican senator even tweeted on the weekend about the need to [[page s1517]] block her historic nomination. then, in case you overlooked why he was doing that, he included a link to a political fundraising web site. we have always kept law enforcement--the fbi director, the attorney general, anybody in law enforcement--out of politics. for a senator to tweet that we have to block this person, and oh, by the way, here is where you can contribute to a political campaign--that is wrong. it seems likely the senate will have to file a cloture motion to vote to overcome the filibuster of her nomination. that is unprecedented; it is unwarranted. no other attorney general nomination in our history has ever been met with a filibuster. we have never needed to have a cloture vote on an attorney general nomination. yet it seems republican leadership wants to make history for all the wrong reasons. i mention this to give us an idea. president george bush in the last 2 years of his term--now a lameduck president--nominated michael mukasey for attorney general. michael mukasey was being sent because the last attorney general had done a disastrous job--even though he had been voted for by, i think, all republicans--people will accept the fact now that he politicized the prosecutors' offices and everything else, and finally the bush administration had to get rid of him. i had just become chairman again, as democrats had taken back the senate. i moved attorney general mukasey through even though i did not support him. i felt the president should have a vote on his attorney general. i moved him through in record time. she has waited so much more time, multiple times longer than mukasey. this is especially troubling and unfair because ms. lynch's qualifications for the job are so extraordinary. and her life story is equally extraordinary. born in greensboro and raised in durham, nc, loretta lynch is the daughter of a fourth-generation baptist preacher and a school librarian. they instilled in her the american values of fairness and equality, even when those around them were not living up to those values. ms. lynch has spoken about riding on her father's shoulders to their church where students organized peaceful protests against racial segregation. the freedom songs and the church music that went hand-in-hand with those protests undoubtedly made up the soundtrack of her childhood. the judiciary committee was honored to have her father, rev. lorenzo lynch, with us not only at both days of her historic hearing in january but also with us when the committee considered his daughter's nomination in february. when loretta lynch was a young child, reverend lynch bravely opened his church's basement to the students and others who organized lunch counter sit-ins in north carolina. he taught his only daughter that ``ideals are wonderful things, but unless you can share them with others and make this world a better place, they're just words.'' the fact that she has dedicated the majority of her career to public service reaffirms that she has lived those ideals of justice in the service of others. and yet, senate republicans appear intent on preventing her from continuing her service--service that we should be honored to have. two weekends ago, ms. lynch traveled to selma to honor the 50th anniversary of the historic march across the edmund pettus bridge, where scores of courageous americans were beaten and trampled on bloody sunday because they refused to be silent about the need for equal protection under the law. it was a weekend when both democrats and republicans came together. president obama stood there with president george w. bush beside him, who had signed the last voting rights act. they honored the civil rights activists of 50 years ago. but i also felt it was a time to reaffirm our shared commitment to americans, as americans, and the ideals of justice and equality that so many of our predecessors have fought and bled for, from our founding fathers to the foot soldiers for justice on that bridge in selma. loretta lynch embodies these ideals. she has devoted her career to making them a reality. it is time for republicans and democrats to come together to confirm this outstanding woman to be the next attorney general. it is time to stop delaying and making excuses for how she is being treated. it is time to vote. this is reflecting badly on all law enforcement. i hear from so many in law enforcement saying: why are you politicizing this nomination? republicans and democrats have usually kept law enforcement out of politics. why is this? the presiding officer. the time of the senator has expired. senators are limited to 10 minutes each. mr. leahy. are we on the trafficking act? the presiding officer. no, we are in morning business. mr. leahy. when do we go on the trafficking act? the presiding officer. morning business has expired. mr. leahy. i seek recognition. ____________________",9407

CREC-2015-03-16-pt1-PgS1517-2,CREC-2015-03-16,114,JUSTICE FOR VICTIMS OF TRAFFICKING ACT OF 2015,"[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 44 (Monday, March 16, 2015)] [Senate] [Pages S1517-S1522] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] JUSTICE FOR VICTIMS OF TRAFFICKING ACT OF 2015 The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senate will resume consideration of S. 178, which the clerk will report. The senior assistant legislative clerk read as follows: A bill (S. 178) to provide justice for the victims of trafficking. Pending: Portman amendment No. 270, to amend the Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act to enable State child protective services systems to improve the identification and assessment of child victims of sex trafficking. Portman amendment No. 271, to amend the definition of ``homeless person'' under the McKinney-Vento Homeless Assistance Act to include certain homeless children and youth. Vitter amendment No. 284 (to amendment No. 271), to amend section 301 of the Immigration and Nationality Act to clarify those classes of individuals born in the United States who are nationals and citizens of the United States at birth. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont. Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, earlier this month, two Florida men were charged with human trafficking. They drugged a runaway 16-year-old girl. Then they forced her to have sex with up to 10 men a day. They sold her to men in a gas station bathroom. They sold her on the street and they sold her in the back of a car. She was 16 years old. She had run away from home. She was terribly vulnerable. They promised her food, then they beat her, drugged her, and sold her. When she escaped, they tracked her down, beat her, and sold her again. All of us--I think we should have an agreement that Democrats and Republicans alike must remember the many other survivors of this heinous crime. We have been working for almost 1 year on bipartisan proposals to protect these vulnerable children, count the survivors, and then punish those who put them through this hell. This effort had strong bipartisan support until partisan politics was injected into the debate. The fight against human trafficking should not be made into a partisan issue to score political points. That is unfortunately where we are today. Everyone expected this legislation to move smoothly through the Senate, I know I did, just as it did through the House. Instead, Senate Republicans have turned away from a comprehensive solution that can garner broad support. I am deeply saddened by this partisan fight. It is both destructive and unnecessary. It is destructive because it threatens to derail important legislation that would make a difference in the lives of survivors--such as the 16-year-old girl in Florida. This partisan fight is unnecessary because abortion politics have no place in this debate. Congress has a long history of passing legislation to address human trafficking. We have consistently done so without abortion politics being injected into the discussion. I know we have passed the Violence Against Women Act. We included a trafficking amendment of mine in that. While I was disappointed that a number of my Republicans colleagues voted against the Violence Against Women Act, which had the sex trafficking [[Page S1518]] amendment in it, we still passed it by a bipartisan majority, as did the House of Representatives, and the President signed it into law. So I was pleased we were able to get that significant piece of legislation passed, even though many in this body who say why aren't we passing this voted against the Violence Against Women Act with the sexual trafficking amendment. But I wish to make clear to everyone that this partisan provision that has now popped up is not something that survivors of human trafficking are asking for. It is not something experts in the field who work with them every day are asking for. We should look at these experts who know what is going on and ask them what it is they want. They do not want this. In fact, those who are closest to the damage wreaked by this terrible crime are asking all of us, Senate Republicans and Democrats, to take out this provision. They are asking us to put politics aside and to focus on the needs of those who have lived through a hell we will never understand. Holly Austin Smith, a survivor, was a girl who ran away at the age of 14 and was bought and sold for sex. She put it this way when she testified before our committee: Politics should not govern the options available to victims of sex trafficking--especially when such victims often have had their basic human rights taken away by criminals who had only their own agendas in mind. So I think we have to stand with these human trafficking survivors. We have to put aside our agendas. They are asking us to take out this unnecessary provision and move the bill forward to address their urgent needs. I support the rest of Senator Cornyn's bill, and that is why I included it in the comprehensive substitute amendment I filed last week. Also included in my substitute is a vital component to prevent human trafficking by focusing on runaway and homeless youth. If we are serious about helping to end this heinous crime, we should be talking about all the good ideas to expand the protections of trafficking victims. Don't try to score partisan points. We should all come together to protect these vulnerable kids. That is why we are here. I am confident that if we remember these children, Republicans and Democrats, we can move forward and return to the bipartisan path we have always walked on this issue. One of the reasons I have that amendment--talking about preventing is one thing and we should prosecute those people who do this--but wouldn't it be that much better for the victims if we could prevent it from happening in the first place? I have spoken before of the nightmares I still have from some of the cases I prosecuted when I was 26 years old and the chief prosecutor for one-quarter of my State. I looked at these victims and the ages of my own children, and all I wanted to do was to get--and did--the people who perpetrated these crimes, prosecute them, and convict them. We should prosecute people who do this, but I also thought how much better it would have been if we had programs that would have given these people somewhere they could turn to before they became victims, some way to protect them so we wouldn't see it afterward. I said on the floor the other night that in preparing for these trials, the people I prosecuted, I wouldn't bring paperwork home in the evening to do it. I stayed in my office and prepared it. One, I didn't want to take the chance that one of my then-young children might see some of the photographs I was going to introduce into evidence--but I also didn't want them to see their father crying and wonder why, because I always tried to tell them the truth. I was not about to tell these young children the truth of what I was seeing. Instead, I would tell the truth to the jury and the jury would convict, but even the jury wishes it had never happened in the first place. The National Network for Youth sent a letter saying: The National Network for Youth is writing this letter with the hope that the U.S. Senate will remove the partisan piece of the Justice for Victims of Trafficking Act. This legislation is desperately needed and we cannot let this moment pass us by because of the addition of partisan and divisive provisions. The National Network for Youth is saying: Let's go back to why both Republicans and Democrats wanted this legislation--to stop trafficking, to help the victims of trafficking, and not to score political points. Just as the majority of this body voted for the Leahy-Crapo bill, the Violence Against Women Act, which had a provision on sexual trafficking, a majority voted for it, Republicans and Democrats--I wish that others--I wish everybody in this body voted for it. I understand that some who now strongly support the partisan part of the trafficking bill voted against the Violence Against Women Act. Each Senator has the right to vote as he or she wants. But I find it strange that they say: Let's go forward with this partisan provision, when only 1 year ago or so those same Senators who are now saying we should go forward with this voted against the Violence Against Women Act. The very same Senators voted against it. Let's get out of politics. That was a good act. It had a very strong sex trafficking provision, which fortunately also was accepted by the House of Representatives and signed into law by the President. Senator Crapo and I set aside politics so we could pass that bill. That is what we should do today. I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. SESSIONS. I appreciate the work my colleagues have done on this trafficking bill. It is an important issue that deserves debate and a vote. Lynch Nomination Madam President, I will say why I believe the Lynch nomination should not go forward. I think it is for a very important reason and, unfortunately, it is one that I think Congress has to address. In their wisdom, our Founders gave Congress certain powers as a coequal branch of government, and one of those powers was the power to confirm or not confirm nominees. Long before Ms. Lynch's nomination was announced, I said I could not vote to confirm any candidate for Attorney General who supported the President's unlawful Executive amnesty. That Executive amnesty presents big constitutional issues that we have to talk about and understand, and it relates directly to the powers of the executive branch versus the legislative branch. The Attorney General is the top law enforcement officer in this country, and anyone who occupies that office, must have fidelity to the laws of the United States duly passed, and to the Constitution of the United States. It is that simple. The Senate cannot confirm any individual, must never confirm an individual to such an office as this--the one most responsible for maintaining fidelity to law--who would support and advance a scheme that violates our Constitution and eviscerates congressional authority. No person should be confirmed who would do that. Congress makes the laws, not the President, and Congress has repeatedly rejected legislation to provide amnesty, work permits, and benefits to those who have entered our country unlawfully. If you want to receive benefits in the United States, you should wait your turn and come lawfully. We rejected such proposals in 2006, 2007, 2010, 2013, and 2014. President Obama's unlawful and unconstitutional Executive actions nullify the immigration laws we do have that are on the books--the Immigration and Nationality Act--and replaces them with the very measures Congress refused to enact. That is where we are. Even King George III lacked the power to legislate without Parliament. President Obama's Executive action provides illegal immigrants--those who come into our country contrary to the immigration laws of the United States, which are generous indeed, allowing a million people a year to come to our country--with work authorization, photo IDs, trillions in Social Security [[Page S1519]] and Medicare benefits, and tax credits of up to $35,000 a year, according to the Congressional Research Service. I think the IRS Commissioner has admitted that as well. The President's action has even made chain migration and citizenship a possibility, which he said repeatedly he couldn't do and wouldn't do. Despite those assurances, his action opens up these possibilities as well, it appears. And, again, all of these measures were rejected by Congress. I discussed these issues with Ms. Lynch. I asked her plainly whether she supported the President's unilateral decision to make his own immigration rules and laws. Here is the relevant portion of that hearing transcript, because I wanted to be clear about it. This was during the Judiciary Committee hearing when she was there as part of her confirmation process. Mr. Sessions: I have to have a clear answer to this question: Ms. Lynch, do you believe the Executive action announced by President Obama on November 20th is legal and constitutional? Yes or no? Ms. Lynch: As I've read the [Office of Legal Counsel] opinion, I do believe it is, Senator. Well, first, we need to understand something. I served 5 years as a Federal prosecutor in the Department of Justice, and this is the way it works. The Office of Legal Counsel is a part of the Department of Justice. The Office of Legal Counsel is the one that has been credited with writing this pathetic memorandum that justified the President's actions. But the Office of Legal Counsel works directly for the Attorney General. The Attorney General is really the one responsible for forwarding to the President a memorandum that says the President can do what he wanted to do. The President said on over 20 different occasions over a period of years, ``I am not an emperor,'' ``I do not have the power to do this,'' ``this would be unconstitutional.'' He made similar statements over 20 different times. Then he changed his mind as we got close to an election, for reasons that I don't fully intend to speculate about at this time, and then he asked that he be given the power to do this. This puts great pressure on the Office of Legal Counsel, but that is one of the historic roles they fulfill--to analyze these things. They take an oath to the Constitution, and they are required to say no if the President is asking for something he is not entitled to do. They are supposed to say no, and the Attorney General is supposed to say no. The Attorney General could review the opinion of the Office of Legal Counsel and take it upon himself or herself to write their own opinion and submit it as the position of the Department of Justice and say the President can do this if he so desires. So that is the way the system works. But what I want to say, colleagues, is the Attorney General played a key role in this Presidential overreach. It was the Attorney General's office that approved this overreach. And this nominee says she believes this is correct. She indicated her approval, and I am sure will defend it in every court around the country and advocate for it. Some say: Well, she works for the President. No, she works for the people of the United States of America. Her salary comes from the taxpayers of this country. Her duty, on occasion, is to say no to the President; to try to help him accomplish his goals, like a good corporate lawyer would, but at some point you have to say: Mr. Corporate CEO, Mr. President of the United States, this goes too far. You can't do this. But Ms. Lynch has indicated she is unwilling to do that. One of the most stunning features of the President's actions is the mass grant of work permits for up to 5 million illegal immigrants. These immigrants will take jobs directly from American citizens and directly from legal immigrants who have come into the country. U.S. Civil Rights Commission member Peter Kirsanow has discussed this issue and written at length about how allowing illegal immigrants to take jobs undermines the rights of U.S. workers--the legal rights of U.S. workers--especially African-American workers and Hispanic workers suffering from high unemployment today. At her confirmation hearing, I, therefore, asked Ms. Lynch about what she might do to protect the lawful rights of U.S. workers. Here is the simple question I placed to the person who would be the next top law enforcement officer for America. And in my preamble to the question, I noted Attorney General Holder had said that people who came to our country unlawfully and who are in our country unlawfully today have a civil right and a human right to citizenship in America, contrary to all law. So I asked her what she thought about this. Mr. Sessions: Who has more right to a job in this country; a lawful immigrant who's here or [a] citizen or a person who entered the country unlawfully? Ms. Lynch: I believe that the right and the obligation to work is one that's shared by everyone in this country regardless of how they came here. And certainly, if someone is here regardless of status, I would prefer they would be participating in the workplace than not participating in the workplace. What a stunning and breathtaking statement that is for the top law enforcement officer in America--to say that a person has a right to work in this country regardless of how they came here. So people who enter don't have to follow the steps that are required? They do not have to establish that they have lawful justification to enter the United States and work in the United States anymore? If you can just get into the country unlawfully, then you have a right to work? And our current Attorney General Holder says they have a civil right to citizenship. This is not law. I don't know what this is, but it is so far from law I don't know how to express my concern about it effectively. It is unprecedented for someone who is seeking the highest law enforcement office in America to declare that someone who is in this country illegally has a right to a job. Make no mistake, we are at a dangerous time in our Nation's history, particularly for our Republic's legal system and our Constitution. I would like to quote now from Prof. Jonathan Turley, a Shapiro Professor of Public Interest Law at George Washington University Law School, a nationally recognized constitutional scholar, and a self- described supporter of President Obama and most of his policies. He has been called as an expert witness on various issues by Senator Leahy and other Democrats over the years. He described the current state of affairs as ``a constitutional tipping point.'' He is referring to the Presidential overreach. I would like to take a moment to read from the testimony he delivered before the House of Representatives in February of last year--9 months before the President even announced this amnesty, but after the first DACA amnesty. This is what he said: The current passivity of Congress represents a crisis of faith for members willing to see a president assume legislative powers in exchange for insular policy gains. The short-term insular victories achieved by this President will come at a prohibitive cost if the current imbalance is not corrected. Constitutional authority is easy to lose in the transient shifts of politics. It is far more difficult to regain. If a passion for the Constitution does not motivate members, perhaps a sense of self-preservation will be enough to unify members. President Obama will not be our last president. However, these acquired powers will be passed to his successors. When that occurs, members may loathe the day that they remained silent as the power of government shifted so radically to the Chief Executive. The powerful personality that engendered this loyalty will be gone, but the powers will remain. We are now at the constitutional tipping point for our system. If balance is to be reestablished, it must begin before this President leaves office and that will likely require every possible means to reassert legislative authority. Now that is Professor Turley, a supporter of President Obama, and a fine constitutional scholar, who is warning the U.S. Congress of the dangers to its powers that have been eroded in the recent months. To stop it, he says that will require Congress to use ``every possible means to reassert its legislative authority.'' So stopping an Attorney General nominee--not voting to confirm an individual as Attorney General--is that a legitimate power of Congress? Well, of course it is. Should we feel obligated and required to confirm someone who has announced they intend to pursue and advance legally through the powers of their office an unconstitutional overreach, because the President nominates that person? Is that our duty? Doesn't Congress have a right to say: Oh no, Mr. President, we understand how this system works. You get to nominate, but you have overreached [[Page S1520]] here and we are not going to ratify. We are not going to consent or approve someone who is going to continue to promote these kinds of unlawful activities. One glaring result of Congress's passivity is that executive branch nominees no longer feel the need to be responsive to congressional oversight. We are not getting sufficient answers from them. That is for sure. I think Congress has too often been quiet and slept on its watch. In the past, Members could perform their constitutional duty of advice and consent, for example, by withholding consent until a nominee provided information to which Congress was entitled. That is how coequal branches of government are supposed to function. Congress has a duty to demand accurate information from the executive branch before providing funds to that branch, and they have a right to insist on it. They don't have to fund any branch of government they believe is unworthy. When Ms. Lynch came before the committee, it quickly became apparent that she had no intention of being frank and providing real answers. That is a problem I think we have to confront. I think the most telling example of this concern was illustrated by an answer I was given to a straightforward question I asked, which goes to the very core of this debate that we are having in America about the President's powers and what we should do about establishing a lawful system of immigration--one that we could be proud of, one that is systemically and fairly applied day after day. The question I asked her was simply this: Do you believe that President Obama has exceeded his executive authority in any way? If so, how? She answered: As United States Attorney for the Eastern District of New York, I have not been charged with determining when and whether the President has exceeded his executive authority. But that was really not a good-faith answer or an attempt to answer the question. I will wrap up and just say, in conclusion, that we are dealing with huge constitutional issues. I wish it weren't so. It is not anything personal that causes me to complain about this nominee. But in truth, we need to use the means this Congress has to defend its legitimate constitutional rights, the power it has been given to legislate. And the President's duties, as the chief law and executive officer of the country, are to execute the laws passed by Congress. One of the key players on his team is the Attorney General, and the Attorney General in this situation has taken a position contrary to the fundamental principles of the Constitution, as Professor Turley has delineated with force and clarity. That being the case, I think Congress has a duty to this institution, to the laws and Constitution of this country, and to the American people not to confirm someone who is not committed to those principles and, indeed, has asserted boldly that she would continue in violation of them. Madam President, I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida. Death Master File Mr. NELSON. Madam President, I am going to defer to my colleague from Connecticut, since at 5 p.m. we will be discussing the nominees which I will speak to. But before we do, I just want to point out two things to the Senate. First of all, the lead story of ``60 Minutes'' last night was about the death master file which is put out by Social Security. Interestingly, the story was from the extraordinary standpoint that a number of people are told they are dead when in fact they are very much alive and all of the horror they go through in trying to correct somebody's having made a mistake--a clerical error--that in fact they were dead by the alteration of one number or a name or just sheer overlook. But there is another problem with the death master file, and we have tried and tried to get that from Social Security. Unless you have an immediate use--a legitimate use for the death master file to be made public, such as a life insurance company--they would have a legitimate use to know who had died so they could stop the payments. Something else the ``60 Minutes'' program pointed out was that Medicare did not catch a lot of payments going out. But unless you have a legitimate use, by suddenly putting on line the death master file, it opens up all of these Social Security numbers for criminals to come in and create a new identity, file a tax return, and get a refund on a fictitious tax return. I want to continue to encourage the Social Security Administration. They claim they don't have the legal authority until we can give them the legal authority they are looking for. We think they have it administratively in their power not to put it out there. That is the right thing to do. Negotiations With Iran As I yield to the very distinguished Senator from Connecticut, a tremendous member of our commerce committee, I want to say I was sad last week--and am still sad this week--that nearly half of the Senators of the Senate sought to inject themselves by writing to the Ayatollah, trying to derail the negotiations that are ongoing on matters of life and death. If they don't think Iran having a nuclear weapon is a matter of life and death, they have another thing coming. Trying to derail the negotiations, while in fact the negotiations are going on at the very hour of the writing of that letter, and still are--and we won't know until the 24th of this month if in fact they are successful. I will come back when we get into the executive session about the nominees. I look forward to hearing from the Senator from Connecticut. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut. Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Madam President, I am proud to follow the distinguished Senator from Florida, and I join him in his observations of the ``60 Minutes'' show, but equally, if not more importantly, in his views on the letter that was sent to the rulers of Iran and its divisive and destructive impact on a matter that should be above partisan politics. To inject a partisan political issue into, literally, a matter of life and death, in my view, is unfortunate, inappropriate, and truly regrettable. Lynch Nomination Equally unfortunate, regrettable, and inappropriate is to inject politics into law enforcement. The nomination of the chief law enforcement officer in our Nation, the Attorney General--that position truly ought to be above politics. In fact, as we know from the structure of our government, it is generally regarded to be above politics. The President of the United States has his or her legal counsel to provide advice to the President, but the Attorney General of the United States enforces laws for this Nation--not for one party, not for one official, not on one issue, but on all issues for all people in the United States. When my colleagues have said on the floor that the President deserves his nominee, really it is the Nation that deserves a nominee to be confirmed. This nominee has been delayed longer than any in recent history. As my colleagues have observed and as this chart illustrates, 129 days have passed since Loretta Lynch's nomination. From announcement to confirmation, her nomination has been delayed longer than any in recent history--in fact, longer than any in modern history, putting aside the Meese nomination, which was delayed because of an ongoing investigation into alleged improprieties. There is no investigation here. There is no question of impropriety. There has been no hint of any reason to reject the Loretta Lynch nomination. The American people could be forgiven for thinking that some of the Members of this body are simply looking for an excuse to delay or deny her nomination. First, it was in our hearing questions about her capacity and qualifications. Those reasons or potential excuses for delaying or denying her nomination were quickly extinguished. Then it was the immigration issue. That too, as an excuse for delaying or denying this nomination, has been dispensed. Now it is the antitrafficking bill. No reason for delay could be more inappropriate, because the fact of the matter is the threat to delay again her nomination is antithetical to the very goal of stopping human trafficking. If my colleagues really want to end sex exploitation and human trafficking, [[Page S1521]] they should confirm the chief law enforcement official who is responsible for fighting it. They should confirm the nominee who has indicated an anathema to this kind of abuse, who has shown her determination to fight it and to use all of the laws and potentially this new law in the war against human trafficking. The Senate is perfectly capable of filling this crucial position--the top law enforcement job in the Nation--even as it debates antitrafficking legislation. In fact, it has shown itself capable of doing so just last week when two nominees to Department of Transportation positions--important transportation positions, as I can say personally, because they involve the safety and reliability of our system--even as it continued to debate the antitrafficking legislation. Holding the Lynch nomination hostage--which is what is happening here--is a disservice to the Department of Justice but even more so to our system of justice. It undermines the integrity and trust in the nonpolitical nature of justice in this Nation. It does so at a time when vigorous and effective leadership is more important and necessary than ever. The Nation could be forgiven for assuming, as increasingly appears to be so, that the Lynch nomination is being held hostage or is simply a cynical excuse to prevent her from getting to work on protecting the American public from human trafficking, which is so important. There are legitimate points of debate between our sides on this issue. Those points of debate and differences need to be resolved, and I hope they will be. I trust they will be. I believe that they are resolvable and that extraneous or irrelevant provisions now in the bill can be removed so that we can focus on stopping modern-day slavery, which is what the-- The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired. Mr. BLUMENTHAL. If I may have another minute to finish. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Which is what we should be doing here, and I believe we will do it. Loretta Lynch has a stellar record. She served with incredible distinction during her time as U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of New York. I suggest to my colleagues that the best way to serve the purpose of stopping trafficking is to confirm her so she can get to work on enforcing that new law. Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, we have had competing claims about who is really at fault. I think the answer to that question is becoming unquestionably undeniable to any fair observer. Actions speak louder than words and there is no denying the actions of the minority party, which, before this Congress, was the majority party in the Senate for 8 years. Even in the minority, they are up to their old tricks of blocking amendments and grinding the Senate to a halt. Given the distortion of the Senate rules during those 8 years, it is no wonder the American public, and perhaps even some Senators, are confused about how the Senate rules are supposed to work. So I wish to take a few moments to talk about a procedure in the Senate called the cloture motion. With cloture, the Senate is actually voting on the question: Is it the sense of the Senate that the debate shall be brought to a close? The proper use of cloture is when the Senate has had time for debate and consideration of amendments and it seems as though the Senate is getting bogged down. If a cloture vote fails, then that means the Senate has decided, as a body, to keep on considering a particular piece of legislation. This is a crucial point and one that was routinely distorted under the previous majority, and they did it for partisan ends. A vote against cloture is a vote to continue considering a bill until at least 60 Senators are satisfied they have had their say and are ready to vote a bill up or down, yea or nay. It is not always clear when the Senate has reached that point, so the bill can sometimes require several cloture votes. Under the previous majority leadership--and now that group happens to be the Senate minority--we saw unprecedented abuses of Senate rules to block Senators from participating in the deliberative process. This included the repeated abuse of the cloture rule. In order to shield his Members from having to take tough votes, the previous majority leader routinely moved to shut down all consideration of a bill even before any debate took place and even before any amendments could be considered. As I stated, cloture is supposed to be used after the Senate has considered a measure for a period of time and a preponderance of the Senate thinks it has deliberated enough, and not do it to end consideration of a bill before it has begun, as the previous majority leadership did for several years prior to this year. Let's contrast how our majority leader, Senator McConnell, has been running the Senate. He has not tried to block minority amendments, as was done to us when we were in the minority. In fact, we have already had more than twice as many amendment votes as all of last year. As the manager of this bill, I have been running an open amendment process, and I am not afraid to have votes on amendments of all kinds. In fact, if you are fortunate enough to be elected to represent your State as a U.S. Senator, it seems to me you have an obligation to the people of your State to offer amendments on issues that are important to your State. The American people saw that we were serious about restoring the Senate tradition of having an open amendment process with the very first major bill we took up in this new Congress. Supporters of the Keystone Pipeline bill had the 60 votes to end debate, but we didn't try to ram through the bill without consideration of amendments. We had a full, open amendment process as we are supposed to have in the U.S. Senate, because it is a deliberative and amending body. There were more than a few ``gotcha'' types of amendments from the other side, but that is OK because that is how the Senate is supposed to operate. There was also an opportunity, for the first time in a very long time, for Senators to get votes on substantive issues that are important to the people of their individual States. That should be a big deal for every Senator, but it was not a very big deal the way the Senate was run previous to this year. When Senators are blocked from participating in the legislative process, the people they represent are disenfranchised. We were not elected to serve our party leadership, but to represent our State, and that is why it was so disappointing under the previous majority to see Senators repeatedly voting in lockstep with their party leadership to block amendments and end debate before it started. I think it is pretty clear from the last election that that strategy backfired in a very major way. Yet the same leaders, now in the minority, are up to their old tricks. The previous Senate leadership routinely used a tactic called filling the tree, where a former majority leader used his right of first recognition to call up his amendments and thus block out amendments from other Senators of both political parties. When the Senate is considering a number of amendments at once, it then requires unanimous consent to set aside the pending amendment in order to call up a new amendment, and that is a way to prevent other Senators from then offering their amendments. If you don't get unanimous consent to take down an amendment to make room for your amendment, you don't get the chance to offer your amendment, and usually that was blocked, and that is why there were only 18 rollcall votes on amendments all last year, compared to this year. The last time I counted, so far this year we had 43 votes. Elections are supposed to have consequences, and the consequences of the last election are that the new majority decided the Senate ought to operate as a deliberative and amending body where every Senator can participate, so Majority Leader McConnell has not filled the amendment tree. We have substantive amendments pending as we speak. Nevertheless, the minority leadership has been objecting to even setting aside the pending amendment or proceeding to a vote on pending amendments just as when they used the procedure of filling the amendment tree. After reporting the human trafficking bill out of the Senate Judiciary Committee unanimously, they have decided there is one provision they don't [[Page S1522]] like, so after 3 days of consideration last week the bill has not moved forward. It looks as though the same trick is going on right now. Since there is an open amendment process--and that is the way Senator McConnell runs the Senate--we have naturally suggested that they offer an amendment if they don't like something in this bill. They have refused to do so, and instead are holding up the entire bill from being amended and finally passed. So after opening the bill up to amendments and having considered the bill for a week, the majority leader has now filed cloture. I want to be clear what this means. Again, a vote against cloture is a vote to continue debate and consider amendments. I have voted against ending debate many times in recent years out of principle when Senators were being denied their right to offer amendments. No one can say this is the case right now on this human trafficking bill. We have had a week of debate, and it is the minority party that is blocking amendments. Remember that many Members of the now minority party, when they were in the majority, were adamant that a vote against cloture is a filibuster and that it is illegitimate to filibuster. I say to my colleagues, if they truly believe filibusters are wrong and it was not just cynical political posturing, then you had better vote for cloture tomorrow. I will also note that a couple of Senators sent out a ``Dear Colleague'' letter at the beginning of this Congress calling again for what they term the ``talking filibuster.'' By this, those Senators mean that if you vote against ending debate, you should be prepared to talk nonstop on the Senate floor. Under their proposal, as soon as there are no Senators talking on the Senate floor, the Senate would move to a final vote. The problem with this idea under the previous leadership was that amendments were routinely blocked so it meant Senators would have to talk nonstop to preserve their right to offer an amendment with no guarantee they would ever get the chance. That is not the issue this time. We have allowed an open amendment process, and it is the minority party that is blocking amendments. So I would say to all the advocates of the so-called talking filibuster, if you do vote against cloture, you are saying you want to debate this bill more before a vote is taken. In that case, you better put your money where your mouth is. To all of my colleagues who support this so-called filibuster and vote against this cloture motion, I expect to see you come down to the Senate floor and talk nonstop. You can use the time to explain to the American people why you object to moving forward with this very important bipartisan legislation to combat sex trafficking. Then when you are ready to move forward with the vote, let us know. I yield the floor. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 44 (Monday, March 16, 2015)] [Senate] [Pages S1517-S1522] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] JUSTICE FOR VICTIMS OF TRAFFICKING ACT OF 2015 The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senate will resume consideration of S. 178, which the clerk will report. The senior assistant legislative clerk read as follows: A bill (S. 178) to provide justice for the victims of trafficking. Pending: Portman amendment No. 270, to amend the Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act to enable State child protective services systems to improve the identification and assessment of child victims of sex trafficking. Portman amendment No. 271, to amend the definition of ``homeless person'' under the McKinney-Vento Homeless Assistance Act to include certain homeless children and youth. Vitter amendment No. 284 (to amendment No. 271), to amend section 301 of the Immigration and Nationality Act to clarify those classes of individuals born in the United States who are nationals and citizens of the United States at birth. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont. Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, earlier this month, two Florida men were charged with human trafficking. They drugged a runaway 16-year-old girl. Then they forced her to have sex with up to 10 men a day. They sold her to men in a gas station bathroom. They sold her on the street and they sold her in the back of a car. She was 16 years old. She had run away from home. She was terribly vulnerable. They promised her food, then they beat her, drugged her, and sold her. When she escaped, they tracked her down, beat her, and sold her again. All of us--I think we should have an agreement that Democrats and Republicans alike must remember the many other survivors of this heinous crime. We have been working for almost 1 year on bipartisan proposals to protect these vulnerable children, count the survivors, and then punish those who put them through this hell. This effort had strong bipartisan support until partisan politics was injected into the debate. The fight against human trafficking should not be made into a partisan issue to score political points. That is unfortunately where we are today. Everyone expected this legislation to move smoothly through the Senate, I know I did, just as it did through the House. Instead, Senate Republicans have turned away from a comprehensive solution that can garner broad support. I am deeply saddened by this partisan fight. It is both destructive and unnecessary. It is destructive because it threatens to derail important legislation that would make a difference in the lives of survivors--such as the 16-year-old girl in Florida. This partisan fight is unnecessary because abortion politics have no place in this debate. Congress has a long history of passing legislation to address human trafficking. We have consistently done so without abortion politics being injected into the discussion. I know we have passed the Violence Against Women Act. We included a trafficking amendment of mine in that. While I was disappointed that a number of my Republicans colleagues voted against the Violence Against Women Act, which had the sex trafficking [[Page S1518]] amendment in it, we still passed it by a bipartisan majority, as did the House of Representatives, and the President signed it into law. So I was pleased we were able to get that significant piece of legislation passed, even though many in this body who say why aren't we passing this voted against the Violence Against Women Act with the sexual trafficking amendment. But I wish to make clear to everyone that this partisan provision that has now popped up is not something that survivors of human trafficking are asking for. It is not something experts in the field who work with them every day are asking for. We should look at these experts who know what is going on and ask them what it is they want. They do not want this. In fact, those who are closest to the damage wreaked by this terrible crime are asking all of us, Senate Republicans and Democrats, to take out this provision. They are asking us to put politics aside and to focus on the needs of those who have lived through a hell we will never understand. Holly Austin Smith, a survivor, was a girl who ran away at the age of 14 and was bought and sold for sex. She put it this way when she testified before our committee: Politics should not govern the options available to victims of sex trafficking--especially when such victims often have had their basic human rights taken away by criminals who had only their own agendas in mind. So I think we have to stand with these human trafficking survivors. We have to put aside our agendas. They are asking us to take out this unnecessary provision and move the bill forward to address their urgent needs. I support the rest of Senator Cornyn's bill, and that is why I included it in the comprehensive substitute amendment I filed last week. Also included in my substitute is a vital component to prevent human trafficking by focusing on runaway and homeless youth. If we are serious about helping to end this heinous crime, we should be talking about all the good ideas to expand the protections of trafficking victims. Don't try to score partisan points. We should all come together to protect these vulnerable kids. That is why we are here. I am confident that if we remember these children, Republicans and Democrats, we can move forward and return to the bipartisan path we have always walked on this issue. One of the reasons I have that amendment--talking about preventing is one thing and we should prosecute those people who do this--but wouldn't it be that much better for the victims if we could prevent it from happening in the first place? I have spoken before of the nightmares I still have from some of the cases I prosecuted when I was 26 years old and the chief prosecutor for one-quarter of my State. I looked at these victims and the ages of my own children, and all I wanted to do was to get--and did--the people who perpetrated these crimes, prosecute them, and convict them. We should prosecute people who do this, but I also thought how much better it would have been if we had programs that would have given these people somewhere they could turn to before they became victims, some way to protect them so we wouldn't see it afterward. I said on the floor the other night that in preparing for these trials, the people I prosecuted, I wouldn't bring paperwork home in the evening to do it. I stayed in my office and prepared it. One, I didn't want to take the chance that one of my then-young children might see some of the photographs I was going to introduce into evidence--but I also didn't want them to see their father crying and wonder why, because I always tried to tell them the truth. I was not about to tell these young children the truth of what I was seeing. Instead, I would tell the truth to the jury and the jury would convict, but even the jury wishes it had never happened in the first place. The National Network for Youth sent a letter saying: The National Network for Youth is writing this letter with the hope that the U.S. Senate will remove the partisan piece of the Justice for Victims of Trafficking Act. This legislation is desperately needed and we cannot let this moment pass us by because of the addition of partisan and divisive provisions. The National Network for Youth is saying: Let's go back to why both Republicans and Democrats wanted this legislation--to stop trafficking, to help the victims of trafficking, and not to score political points. Just as the majority of this body voted for the Leahy-Crapo bill, the Violence Against Women Act, which had a provision on sexual trafficking, a majority voted for it, Republicans and Democrats--I wish that others--I wish everybody in this body voted for it. I understand that some who now strongly support the partisan part of the trafficking bill voted against the Violence Against Women Act. Each Senator has the right to vote as he or she wants. But I find it strange that they say: Let's go forward with this partisan provision, when only 1 year ago or so those same Senators who are now saying we should go forward with this voted against the Violence Against Women Act. The very same Senators voted against it. Let's get out of politics. That was a good act. It had a very strong sex trafficking provision, which fortunately also was accepted by the House of Representatives and signed into law by the President. Senator Crapo and I set aside politics so we could pass that bill. That is what we should do today. I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. SESSIONS. I appreciate the work my colleagues have done on this trafficking bill. It is an important issue that deserves debate and a vote. Lynch Nomination Madam President, I will say why I believe the Lynch nomination should not go forward. I think it is for a very important reason and, unfortunately, it is one that I think Congress has to address. In their wisdom, our Founders gave Congress certain powers as a coequal branch of government, and one of those powers was the power to confirm or not confirm nominees. Long before Ms. Lynch's nomination was announced, I said I could not vote to confirm any candidate for Attorney General who supported the President's unlawful Executive amnesty. That Executive amnesty presents big constitutional issues that we have to talk about and understand, and it relates directly to the powers of the executive branch versus the legislative branch. The Attorney General is the top law enforcement officer in this country, and anyone who occupies that office, must have fidelity to the laws of the United States duly passed, and to the Constitution of the United States. It is that simple. The Senate cannot confirm any individual, must never confirm an individual to such an office as this--the one most responsible for maintaining fidelity to law--who would support and advance a scheme that violates our Constitution and eviscerates congressional authority. No person should be confirmed who would do that. Congress makes the laws, not the President, and Congress has repeatedly rejected legislation to provide amnesty, work permits, and benefits to those who have entered our country unlawfully. If you want to receive benefits in the United States, you should wait your turn and come lawfully. We rejected such proposals in 2006, 2007, 2010, 2013, and 2014. President Obama's unlawful and unconstitutional Executive actions nullify the immigration laws we do have that are on the books--the Immigration and Nationality Act--and replaces them with the very measures Congress refused to enact. That is where we are. Even King George III lacked the power to legislate without Parliament. President Obama's Executive action provides illegal immigrants--those who come into our country contrary to the immigration laws of the United States, which are generous indeed, allowing a million people a year to come to our country--with work authorization, photo IDs, trillions in Social Security [[Page S1519]] and Medicare benefits, and tax credits of up to $35,000 a year, according to the Congressional Research Service. I think the IRS Commissioner has admitted that as well. The President's action has even made chain migration and citizenship a possibility, which he said repeatedly he couldn't do and wouldn't do. Despite those assurances, his action opens up these possibilities as well, it appears. And, again, all of these measures were rejected by Congress. I discussed these issues with Ms. Lynch. I asked her plainly whether she supported the President's unilateral decision to make his own immigration rules and laws. Here is the relevant portion of that hearing transcript, because I wanted to be clear about it. This was during the Judiciary Committee hearing when she was there as part of her confirmation process. Mr. Sessions: I have to have a clear answer to this question: Ms. Lynch, do you believe the Executive action announced by President Obama on November 20th is legal and constitutional? Yes or no? Ms. Lynch: As I've read the [Office of Legal Counsel] opinion, I do believe it is, Senator. Well, first, we need to understand something. I served 5 years as a Federal prosecutor in the Department of Justice, and this is the way it works. The Office of Legal Counsel is a part of the Department of Justice. The Office of Legal Counsel is the one that has been credited with writing this pathetic memorandum that justified the President's actions. But the Office of Legal Counsel works directly for the Attorney General. The Attorney General is really the one responsible for forwarding to the President a memorandum that says the President can do what he wanted to do. The President said on over 20 different occasions over a period of years, ``I am not an emperor,'' ``I do not have the power to do this,'' ``this would be unconstitutional.'' He made similar statements over 20 different times. Then he changed his mind as we got close to an election, for reasons that I don't fully intend to speculate about at this time, and then he asked that he be given the power to do this. This puts great pressure on the Office of Legal Counsel, but that is one of the historic roles they fulfill--to analyze these things. They take an oath to the Constitution, and they are required to say no if the President is asking for something he is not entitled to do. They are supposed to say no, and the Attorney General is supposed to say no. The Attorney General could review the opinion of the Office of Legal Counsel and take it upon himself or herself to write their own opinion and submit it as the position of the Department of Justice and say the President can do this if he so desires. So that is the way the system works. But what I want to say, colleagues, is the Attorney General played a key role in this Presidential overreach. It was the Attorney General's office that approved this overreach. And this nominee says she believes this is correct. She indicated her approval, and I am sure will defend it in every court around the country and advocate for it. Some say: Well, she works for the President. No, she works for the people of the United States of America. Her salary comes from the taxpayers of this country. Her duty, on occasion, is to say no to the President; to try to help him accomplish his goals, like a good corporate lawyer would, but at some point you have to say: Mr. Corporate CEO, Mr. President of the United States, this goes too far. You can't do this. But Ms. Lynch has indicated she is unwilling to do that. One of the most stunning features of the President's actions is the mass grant of work permits for up to 5 million illegal immigrants. These immigrants will take jobs directly from American citizens and directly from legal immigrants who have come into the country. U.S. Civil Rights Commission member Peter Kirsanow has discussed this issue and written at length about how allowing illegal immigrants to take jobs undermines the rights of U.S. workers--the legal rights of U.S. workers--especially African-American workers and Hispanic workers suffering from high unemployment today. At her confirmation hearing, I, therefore, asked Ms. Lynch about what she might do to protect the lawful rights of U.S. workers. Here is the simple question I placed to the person who would be the next top law enforcement officer for America. And in my preamble to the question, I noted Attorney General Holder had said that people who came to our country unlawfully and who are in our country unlawfully today have a civil right and a human right to citizenship in America, contrary to all law. So I asked her what she thought about this. Mr. Sessions: Who has more right to a job in this country; a lawful immigrant who's here or [a] citizen or a person who entered the country unlawfully? Ms. Lynch: I believe that the right and the obligation to work is one that's shared by everyone in this country regardless of how they came here. And certainly, if someone is here regardless of status, I would prefer they would be participating in the workplace than not participating in the workplace. What a stunning and breathtaking statement that is for the top law enforcement officer in America--to say that a person has a right to work in this country regardless of how they came here. So people who enter don't have to follow the steps that are required? They do not have to establish that they have lawful justification to enter the United States and work in the United States anymore? If you can just get into the country unlawfully, then you have a right to work? And our current Attorney General Holder says they have a civil right to citizenship. This is not law. I don't know what this is, but it is so far from law I don't know how to express my concern about it effectively. It is unprecedented for someone who is seeking the highest law enforcement office in America to declare that someone who is in this country illegally has a right to a job. Make no mistake, we are at a dangerous time in our Nation's history, particularly for our Republic's legal system and our Constitution. I would like to quote now from Prof. Jonathan Turley, a Shapiro Professor of Public Interest Law at George Washington University Law School, a nationally recognized constitutional scholar, and a self- described supporter of President Obama and most of his policies. He has been called as an expert witness on various issues by Senator Leahy and other Democrats over the years. He described the current state of affairs as ``a constitutional tipping point.'' He is referring to the Presidential overreach. I would like to take a moment to read from the testimony he delivered before the House of Representatives in February of last year--9 months before the President even announced this amnesty, but after the first DACA amnesty. This is what he said: The current passivity of Congress represents a crisis of faith for members willing to see a president assume legislative powers in exchange for insular policy gains. The short-term insular victories achieved by this President will come at a prohibitive cost if the current imbalance is not corrected. Constitutional authority is easy to lose in the transient shifts of politics. It is far more difficult to regain. If a passion for the Constitution does not motivate members, perhaps a sense of self-preservation will be enough to unify members. President Obama will not be our last president. However, these acquired powers will be passed to his successors. When that occurs, members may loathe the day that they remained silent as the power of government shifted so radically to the Chief Executive. The powerful personality that engendered this loyalty will be gone, but the powers will remain. We are now at the constitutional tipping point for our system. If balance is to be reestablished, it must begin before this President leaves office and that will likely require every possible means to reassert legislative authority. Now that is Professor Turley, a supporter of President Obama, and a fine constitutional scholar, who is warning the U.S. Congress of the dangers to its powers that have been eroded in the recent months. To stop it, he says that will require Congress to use ``every possible means to reassert its legislative authority.'' So stopping an Attorney General nominee--not voting to confirm an individual as Attorney General--is that a legitimate power of Congress? Well, of course it is. Should we feel obligated and required to confirm someone who has announced they intend to pursue and advance legally through the powers of their office an unconstitutional overreach, because the President nominates that person? Is that our duty? Doesn't Congress have a right to say: Oh no, Mr. President, we understand how this system works. You get to nominate, but you have overreached [[Page S1520]] here and we are not going to ratify. We are not going to consent or approve someone who is going to continue to promote these kinds of unlawful activities. One glaring result of Congress's passivity is that executive branch nominees no longer feel the need to be responsive to congressional oversight. We are not getting sufficient answers from them. That is for sure. I think Congress has too often been quiet and slept on its watch. In the past, Members could perform their constitutional duty of advice and consent, for example, by withholding consent until a nominee provided information to which Congress was entitled. That is how coequal branches of government are supposed to function. Congress has a duty to demand accurate information from the executive branch before providing funds to that branch, and they have a right to insist on it. They don't have to fund any branch of government they believe is unworthy. When Ms. Lynch came before the committee, it quickly became apparent that she had no intention of being frank and providing real answers. That is a problem I think we have to confront. I think the most telling example of this concern was illustrated by an answer I was given to a straightforward question I asked, which goes to the very core of this debate that we are having in America about the President's powers and what we should do about establishing a lawful system of immigration--one that we could be proud of, one that is systemically and fairly applied day after day. The question I asked her was simply this: Do you believe that President Obama has exceeded his executive authority in any way? If so, how? She answered: As United States Attorney for the Eastern District of New York, I have not been charged with determining when and whether the President has exceeded his executive authority. But that was really not a good-faith answer or an attempt to answer the question. I will wrap up and just say, in conclusion, that we are dealing with huge constitutional issues. I wish it weren't so. It is not anything personal that causes me to complain about this nominee. But in truth, we need to use the means this Congress has to defend its legitimate constitutional rights, the power it has been given to legislate. And the President's duties, as the chief law and executive officer of the country, are to execute the laws passed by Congress. One of the key players on his team is the Attorney General, and the Attorney General in this situation has taken a position contrary to the fundamental principles of the Constitution, as Professor Turley has delineated with force and clarity. That being the case, I think Congress has a duty to this institution, to the laws and Constitution of this country, and to the American people not to confirm someone who is not committed to those principles and, indeed, has asserted boldly that she would continue in violation of them. Madam President, I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida. Death Master File Mr. NELSON. Madam President, I am going to defer to my colleague from Connecticut, since at 5 p.m. we will be discussing the nominees which I will speak to. But before we do, I just want to point out two things to the Senate. First of all, the lead story of ``60 Minutes'' last night was about the death master file which is put out by Social Security. Interestingly, the story was from the extraordinary standpoint that a number of people are told they are dead when in fact they are very much alive and all of the horror they go through in trying to correct somebody's having made a mistake--a clerical error--that in fact they were dead by the alteration of one number or a name or just sheer overlook. But there is another problem with the death master file, and we have tried and tried to get that from Social Security. Unless you have an immediate use--a legitimate use for the death master file to be made public, such as a life insurance company--they would have a legitimate use to know who had died so they could stop the payments. Something else the ``60 Minutes'' program pointed out was that Medicare did not catch a lot of payments going out. But unless you have a legitimate use, by suddenly putting on line the death master file, it opens up all of these Social Security numbers for criminals to come in and create a new identity, file a tax return, and get a refund on a fictitious tax return. I want to continue to encourage the Social Security Administration. They claim they don't have the legal authority until we can give them the legal authority they are looking for. We think they have it administratively in their power not to put it out there. That is the right thing to do. Negotiations With Iran As I yield to the very distinguished Senator from Connecticut, a tremendous member of our commerce committee, I want to say I was sad last week--and am still sad this week--that nearly half of the Senators of the Senate sought to inject themselves by writing to the Ayatollah, trying to derail the negotiations that are ongoing on matters of life and death. If they don't think Iran having a nuclear weapon is a matter of life and death, they have another thing coming. Trying to derail the negotiations, while in fact the negotiations are going on at the very hour of the writing of that letter, and still are--and we won't know until the 24th of this month if in fact they are successful. I will come back when we get into the executive session about the nominees. I look forward to hearing from the Senator from Connecticut. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut. Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Madam President, I am proud to follow the distinguished Senator from Florida, and I join him in his observations of the ``60 Minutes'' show, but equally, if not more importantly, in his views on the letter that was sent to the rulers of Iran and its divisive and destructive impact on a matter that should be above partisan politics. To inject a partisan political issue into, literally, a matter of life and death, in my view, is unfortunate, inappropriate, and truly regrettable. Lynch Nomination Equally unfortunate, regrettable, and inappropriate is to inject politics into law enforcement. The nomination of the chief law enforcement officer in our Nation, the Attorney General--that position truly ought to be above politics. In fact, as we know from the structure of our government, it is generally regarded to be above politics. The President of the United States has his or her legal counsel to provide advice to the President, but the Attorney General of the United States enforces laws for this Nation--not for one party, not for one official, not on one issue, but on all issues for all people in the United States. When my colleagues have said on the floor that the President deserves his nominee, really it is the Nation that deserves a nominee to be confirmed. This nominee has been delayed longer than any in recent history. As my colleagues have observed and as this chart illustrates, 129 days have passed since Loretta Lynch's nomination. From announcement to confirmation, her nomination has been delayed longer than any in recent history--in fact, longer than any in modern history, putting aside the Meese nomination, which was delayed because of an ongoing investigation into alleged improprieties. There is no investigation here. There is no question of impropriety. There has been no hint of any reason to reject the Loretta Lynch nomination. The American people could be forgiven for thinking that some of the Members of this body are simply looking for an excuse to delay or deny her nomination. First, it was in our hearing questions about her capacity and qualifications. Those reasons or potential excuses for delaying or denying her nomination were quickly extinguished. Then it was the immigration issue. That too, as an excuse for delaying or denying this nomination, has been dispensed. Now it is the antitrafficking bill. No reason for delay could be more inappropriate, because the fact of the matter is the threat to delay again her nomination is antithetical to the very goal of stopping human trafficking. If my colleagues really want to end sex exploitation and human trafficking, [[Page S1521]] they should confirm the chief law enforcement official who is responsible for fighting it. They should confirm the nominee who has indicated an anathema to this kind of abuse, who has shown her determination to fight it and to use all of the laws and potentially this new law in the war against human trafficking. The Senate is perfectly capable of filling this crucial position--the top law enforcement job in the Nation--even as it debates antitrafficking legislation. In fact, it has shown itself capable of doing so just last week when two nominees to Department of Transportation positions--important transportation positions, as I can say personally, because they involve the safety and reliability of our system--even as it continued to debate the antitrafficking legislation. Holding the Lynch nomination hostage--which is what is happening here--is a disservice to the Department of Justice but even more so to our system of justice. It undermines the integrity and trust in the nonpolitical nature of justice in this Nation. It does so at a time when vigorous and effective leadership is more important and necessary than ever. The Nation could be forgiven for assuming, as increasingly appears to be so, that the Lynch nomination is being held hostage or is simply a cynical excuse to prevent her from getting to work on protecting the American public from human trafficking, which is so important. There are legitimate points of debate between our sides on this issue. Those points of debate and differences need to be resolved, and I hope they will be. I trust they will be. I believe that they are resolvable and that extraneous or irrelevant provisions now in the bill can be removed so that we can focus on stopping modern-day slavery, which is what the-- The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired. Mr. BLUMENTHAL. If I may have another minute to finish. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Which is what we should be doing here, and I believe we will do it. Loretta Lynch has a stellar record. She served with incredible distinction during her time as U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of New York. I suggest to my colleagues that the best way to serve the purpose of stopping trafficking is to confirm her so she can get to work on enforcing that new law. Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, we have had competing claims about who is really at fault. I think the answer to that question is becoming unquestionably undeniable to any fair observer. Actions speak louder than words and there is no denying the actions of the minority party, which, before this Congress, was the majority party in the Senate for 8 years. Even in the minority, they are up to their old tricks of blocking amendments and grinding the Senate to a halt. Given the distortion of the Senate rules during those 8 years, it is no wonder the American public, and perhaps even some Senators, are confused about how the Senate rules are supposed to work. So I wish to take a few moments to talk about a procedure in the Senate called the cloture motion. With cloture, the Senate is actually voting on the question: Is it the sense of the Senate that the debate shall be brought to a close? The proper use of cloture is when the Senate has had time for debate and consideration of amendments and it seems as though the Senate is getting bogged down. If a cloture vote fails, then that means the Senate has decided, as a body, to keep on considering a particular piece of legislation. This is a crucial point and one that was routinely distorted under the previous majority, and they did it for partisan ends. A vote against cloture is a vote to continue considering a bill until at least 60 Senators are satisfied they have had their say and are ready to vote a bill up or down, yea or nay. It is not always clear when the Senate has reached that point, so the bill can sometimes require several cloture votes. Under the previous majority leadership--and now that group happens to be the Senate minority--we saw unprecedented abuses of Senate rules to block Senators from participating in the deliberative process. This included the repeated abuse of the cloture rule. In order to shield his Members from having to take tough votes, the previous majority leader routinely moved to shut down all consideration of a bill even before any debate took place and even before any amendments could be considered. As I stated, cloture is supposed to be used after the Senate has considered a measure for a period of time and a preponderance of the Senate thinks it has deliberated enough, and not do it to end consideration of a bill before it has begun, as the previous majority leadership did for several years prior to this year. Let's contrast how our majority leader, Senator McConnell, has been running the Senate. He has not tried to block minority amendments, as was done to us when we were in the minority. In fact, we have already had more than twice as many amendment votes as all of last year. As the manager of this bill, I have been running an open amendment process, and I am not afraid to have votes on amendments of all kinds. In fact, if you are fortunate enough to be elected to represent your State as a U.S. Senator, it seems to me you have an obligation to the people of your State to offer amendments on issues that are important to your State. The American people saw that we were serious about restoring the Senate tradition of having an open amendment process with the very first major bill we took up in this new Congress. Supporters of the Keystone Pipeline bill had the 60 votes to end debate, but we didn't try to ram through the bill without consideration of amendments. We had a full, open amendment process as we are supposed to have in the U.S. Senate, because it is a deliberative and amending body. There were more than a few ``gotcha'' types of amendments from the other side, but that is OK because that is how the Senate is supposed to operate. There was also an opportunity, for the first time in a very long time, for Senators to get votes on substantive issues that are important to the people of their individual States. That should be a big deal for every Senator, but it was not a very big deal the way the Senate was run previous to this year. When Senators are blocked from participating in the legislative process, the people they represent are disenfranchised. We were not elected to serve our party leadership, but to represent our State, and that is why it was so disappointing under the previous majority to see Senators repeatedly voting in lockstep with their party leadership to block amendments and end debate before it started. I think it is pretty clear from the last election that that strategy backfired in a very major way. Yet the same leaders, now in the minority, are up to their old tricks. The previous Senate leadership routinely used a tactic called filling the tree, where a former majority leader used his right of first recognition to call up his amendments and thus block out amendments from other Senators of both political parties. When the Senate is considering a number of amendments at once, it then requires unanimous consent to set aside the pending amendment in order to call up a new amendment, and that is a way to prevent other Senators from then offering their amendments. If you don't get unanimous consent to take down an amendment to make room for your amendment, you don't get the chance to offer your amendment, and usually that was blocked, and that is why there were only 18 rollcall votes on amendments all last year, compared to this year. The last time I counted, so far this year we had 43 votes. Elections are supposed to have consequences, and the consequences of the last election are that the new majority decided the Senate ought to operate as a deliberative and amending body where every Senator can participate, so Majority Leader McConnell has not filled the amendment tree. We have substantive amendments pending as we speak. Nevertheless, the minority leadership has been objecting to even setting aside the pending amendment or proceeding to a vote on pending amendments just as when they used the procedure of filling the amendment tree. After reporting the human trafficking bill out of the Senate Judiciary Committee unanimously, they have decided there is one provision they don't [[Page S1522]] like, so after 3 days of consideration last week the bill has not moved forward. It looks as though the same trick is going on right now. Since there is an open amendment process--and that is the way Senator McConnell runs the Senate--we have naturally suggested that they offer an amendment if they don't like something in this bill. They have refused to do so, and instead are holding up the entire bill from being amended and finally passed. So after opening the bill up to amendments and having considered the bill for a week, the majority leader has now filed cloture. I want to be clear what this means. Again, a vote against cloture is a vote to continue debate and consider amendments. I have voted against ending debate many times in recent years out of principle when Senators were being denied their right to offer amendments. No one can say this is the case right now on this human trafficking bill. We have had a week of debate, and it is the minority party that is blocking amendments. Remember that many Members of the now minority party, when they were in the majority, were adamant that a vote against cloture is a filibuster and that it is illegitimate to filibuster. I say to my colleagues, if they truly believe filibusters are wrong and it was not just cynical political posturing, then you had better vote for cloture tomorrow. I will also note that a couple of Senators sent out a ``Dear Colleague'' letter at the beginning of this Congress calling again for what they term the ``talking filibuster.'' By this, those Senators mean that if you vote against ending debate, you should be prepared to talk nonstop on the Senate floor. Under their proposal, as soon as there are no Senators talking on the Senate floor, the Senate would move to a final vote. The problem with this idea under the previous leadership was that amendments were routinely blocked so it meant Senators would have to talk nonstop to preserve their right to offer an amendment with no guarantee they would ever get the chance. That is not the issue this time. We have allowed an open amendment process, and it is the minority party that is blocking amendments. So I would say to all the advocates of the so-called talking filibuster, if you do vote against cloture, you are saying you want to debate this bill more before a vote is taken. In that case, you better put your money where your mouth is. To all of my colleagues who support this so-called filibuster and vote against this cloture motion, I expect to see you come down to the Senate floor and talk nonstop. You can use the time to explain to the American people why you object to moving forward with this very important bipartisan legislation to combat sex trafficking. Then when you are ready to move forward with the vote, let us know. I yield the floor. ____________________","Congressional Record, Volume 161 Issue 44 (Monday, March 16, 2015) [Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 44 (Monday, March 16, 2015)] [Senate] [Pages S1517-S1522] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] JUSTICE FOR VICTIMS OF TRAFFICKING ACT OF 2015 The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senate will resume consideration of S. 178, which the clerk will report. The senior assistant legislative clerk read as follows: A bill (S. 178) to provide justice for the victims of trafficking. Pending: Portman amendment No. 270, to amend the Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act to enable State child protective services systems to improve the identification and assessment of child victims of sex trafficking. Portman amendment No. 271, to amend the definition of ``homeless person'' under the McKinney-Vento Homeless Assistance Act to include certain homeless children and youth. Vitter amendment No. 284 (to amendment No. 271), to amend section 301 of the Immigration and Nationality Act to clarify those classes of individuals born in the United States who are nationals and citizens of the United States at birth. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont. Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, earlier this month, two Florida men were charged with human trafficking. They drugged a runaway 16-year-old girl. Then they forced her to have sex with up to 10 men a day. They sold her to men in a gas station bathroom. They sold her on the street and they sold her in the back of a car. She was 16 years old. She had run away from home. She was terribly vulnerable. They promised her food, then they beat her, drugged her, and sold her. When she escaped, they tracked her down, beat her, and sold her again. All of us--I think we should have an agreement that Democrats and Republicans alike must remember the many other survivors of this heinous crime. We have been working for almost 1 year on bipartisan proposals to protect these vulnerable children, count the survivors, and then punish those who put them through this hell. This effort had strong bipartisan support until partisan politics was injected into the debate. The fight against human trafficking should not be made into a partisan issue to score political points. That is unfortunately where we are today. Everyone expected this legislation to move smoothly through the Senate, I know I did, just as it did through the House. Instead, Senate Republicans have turned away from a comprehensive solution that can garner broad support. I am deeply saddened by this partisan fight. It is both destructive and unnecessary. It is destructive because it threatens to derail important legislation that would make a difference in the lives of survivors--such as the 16-year-old girl in Florida. This partisan fight is unnecessary because abortion politics have no place in this debate. Congress has a long history of passing legislation to address human trafficking. We have consistently done so without abortion politics being injected into the discussion. I know we have passed the Violence Against Women Act. We included a trafficking amendment of mine in that. While I was disappointed that a number of my Republicans colleagues voted against the Violence Against Women Act, which had the sex trafficking [[Page S1518]] amendment in it, we still passed it by a bipartisan majority, as did the House of Representatives, and the President signed it into law. So I was pleased we were able to get that significant piece of legislation passed, even though many in this body who say why aren't we passing this voted against the Violence Against Women Act with the sexual trafficking amendment. But I wish to make clear to everyone that this partisan provision that has now popped up is not something that survivors of human trafficking are asking for. It is not something experts in the field who work with them every day are asking for. We should look at these experts who know what is going on and ask them what it is they want. They do not want this. In fact, those who are closest to the damage wreaked by this terrible crime are asking all of us, Senate Republicans and Democrats, to take out this provision. They are asking us to put politics aside and to focus on the needs of those who have lived through a hell we will never understand. Holly Austin Smith, a survivor, was a girl who ran away at the age of 14 and was bought and sold for sex. She put it this way when she testified before our committee: Politics should not govern the options available to victims of sex trafficking--especially when such victims often have had their basic human rights taken away by criminals who had only their own agendas in mind. So I think we have to stand with these human trafficking survivors. We have to put aside our agendas. They are asking us to take out this unnecessary provision and move the bill forward to address their urgent needs. I support the rest of Senator Cornyn's bill, and that is why I included it in the comprehensive substitute amendment I filed last week. Also included in my substitute is a vital component to prevent human trafficking by focusing on runaway and homeless youth. If we are serious about helping to end this heinous crime, we should be talking about all the good ideas to expand the protections of trafficking victims. Don't try to score partisan points. We should all come together to protect these vulnerable kids. That is why we are here. I am confident that if we remember these children, Republicans and Democrats, we can move forward and return to the bipartisan path we have always walked on this issue. One of the reasons I have that amendment--talking about preventing is one thing and we should prosecute those people who do this--but wouldn't it be that much better for the victims if we could prevent it from happening in the first place? I have spoken before of the nightmares I still have from some of the cases I prosecuted when I was 26 years old and the chief prosecutor for one-quarter of my State. I looked at these victims and the ages of my own children, and all I wanted to do was to get--and did--the people who perpetrated these crimes, prosecute them, and convict them. We should prosecute people who do this, but I also thought how much better it would have been if we had programs that would have given these people somewhere they could turn to before they became victims, some way to protect them so we wouldn't see it afterward. I said on the floor the other night that in preparing for these trials, the people I prosecuted, I wouldn't bring paperwork home in the evening to do it. I stayed in my office and prepared it. One, I didn't want to take the chance that one of my then-young children might see some of the photographs I was going to introduce into evidence--but I also didn't want them to see their father crying and wonder why, because I always tried to tell them the truth. I was not about to tell these young children the truth of what I was seeing. Instead, I would tell the truth to the jury and the jury would convict, but even the jury wishes it had never happened in the first place. The National Network for Youth sent a letter saying: The National Network for Youth is writing this letter with the hope that the U.S. Senate will remove the partisan piece of the Justice for Victims of Trafficking Act. This legislation is desperately needed and we cannot let this moment pass us by because of the addition of partisan and divisive provisions. The National Network for Youth is saying: Let's go back to why both Republicans and Democrats wanted this legislation--to stop trafficking, to help the victims of trafficking, and not to score political points. Just as the majority of this body voted for the Leahy-Crapo bill, the Violence Against Women Act, which had a provision on sexual trafficking, a majority voted for it, Republicans and Democrats--I wish that others--I wish everybody in this body voted for it. I understand that some who now strongly support the partisan part of the trafficking bill voted against the Violence Against Women Act. Each Senator has the right to vote as he or she wants. But I find it strange that they say: Let's go forward with this partisan provision, when only 1 year ago or so those same Senators who are now saying we should go forward with this voted against the Violence Against Women Act. The very same Senators voted against it. Let's get out of politics. That was a good act. It had a very strong sex trafficking provision, which fortunately also was accepted by the House of Representatives and signed into law by the President. Senator Crapo and I set aside politics so we could pass that bill. That is what we should do today. I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. SESSIONS. I appreciate the work my colleagues have done on this trafficking bill. It is an important issue that deserves debate and a vote. Lynch Nomination Madam President, I will say why I believe the Lynch nomination should not go forward. I think it is for a very important reason and, unfortunately, it is one that I think Congress has to address. In their wisdom, our Founders gave Congress certain powers as a coequal branch of government, and one of those powers was the power to confirm or not confirm nominees. Long before Ms. Lynch's nomination was announced, I said I could not vote to confirm any candidate for Attorney General who supported the President's unlawful Executive amnesty. That Executive amnesty presents big constitutional issues that we have to talk about and understand, and it relates directly to the powers of the executive branch versus the legislative branch. The Attorney General is the top law enforcement officer in this country, and anyone who occupies that office, must have fidelity to the laws of the United States duly passed, and to the Constitution of the United States. It is that simple. The Senate cannot confirm any individual, must never confirm an individual to such an office as this--the one most responsible for maintaining fidelity to law--who would support and advance a scheme that violates our Constitution and eviscerates congressional authority. No person should be confirmed who would do that. Congress makes the laws, not the President, and Congress has repeatedly rejected legislation to provide amnesty, work permits, and benefits to those who have entered our country unlawfully. If you want to receive benefits in the United States, you should wait your turn and come lawfully. We rejected such proposals in 2006, 2007, 2010, 2013, and 2014. President Obama's unlawful and unconstitutional Executive actions nullify the immigration laws we do have that are on the books--the Immigration and Nationality Act--and replaces them with the very measures Congress refused to enact. That is where we are. Even King George III lacked the power to legislate without Parliament. President Obama's Executive action provides illegal immigrants--those who come into our country contrary to the immigration laws of the United States, which are generous indeed, allowing a million people a year to come to our country--with work authorization, photo IDs, trillions in Social Security [[Page S1519]] and Medicare benefits, and tax credits of up to $35,000 a year, according to the Congressional Research Service. I think the IRS Commissioner has admitted that as well. The President's action has even made chain migration and citizenship a possibility, which he said repeatedly he couldn't do and wouldn't do. Despite those assurances, his action opens up these possibilities as well, it appears. And, again, all of these measures were rejected by Congress. I discussed these issues with Ms. Lynch. I asked her plainly whether she supported the President's unilateral decision to make his own immigration rules and laws. Here is the relevant portion of that hearing transcript, because I wanted to be clear about it. This was during the Judiciary Committee hearing when she was there as part of her confirmation process. Mr. Sessions: I have to have a clear answer to this question: Ms. Lynch, do you believe the Executive action announced by President Obama on November 20th is legal and constitutional? Yes or no? Ms. Lynch: As I've read the [Office of Legal Counsel] opinion, I do believe it is, Senator. Well, first, we need to understand something. I served 5 years as a Federal prosecutor in the Department of Justice, and this is the way it works. The Office of Legal Counsel is a part of the Department of Justice. The Office of Legal Counsel is the one that has been credited with writing this pathetic memorandum that justified the President's actions. But the Office of Legal Counsel works directly for the Attorney General. The Attorney General is really the one responsible for forwarding to the President a memorandum that says the President can do what he wanted to do. The President said on over 20 different occasions over a period of years, ``I am not an emperor,'' ``I do not have the power to do this,'' ``this would be unconstitutional.'' He made similar statements over 20 different times. Then he changed his mind as we got close to an election, for reasons that I don't fully intend to speculate about at this time, and then he asked that he be given the power to do this. This puts great pressure on the Office of Legal Counsel, but that is one of the historic roles they fulfill--to analyze these things. They take an oath to the Constitution, and they are required to say no if the President is asking for something he is not entitled to do. They are supposed to say no, and the Attorney General is supposed to say no. The Attorney General could review the opinion of the Office of Legal Counsel and take it upon himself or herself to write their own opinion and submit it as the position of the Department of Justice and say the President can do this if he so desires. So that is the way the system works. But what I want to say, colleagues, is the Attorney General played a key role in this Presidential overreach. It was the Attorney General's office that approved this overreach. And this nominee says she believes this is correct. She indicated her approval, and I am sure will defend it in every court around the country and advocate for it. Some say: Well, she works for the President. No, she works for the people of the United States of America. Her salary comes from the taxpayers of this country. Her duty, on occasion, is to say no to the President; to try to help him accomplish his goals, like a good corporate lawyer would, but at some point you have to say: Mr. Corporate CEO, Mr. President of the United States, this goes too far. You can't do this. But Ms. Lynch has indicated she is unwilling to do that. One of the most stunning features of the President's actions is the mass grant of work permits for up to 5 million illegal immigrants. These immigrants will take jobs directly from American citizens and directly from legal immigrants who have come into the country. U.S. Civil Rights Commission member Peter Kirsanow has discussed this issue and written at length about how allowing illegal immigrants to take jobs undermines the rights of U.S. workers--the legal rights of U.S. workers--especially African-American workers and Hispanic workers suffering from high unemployment today. At her confirmation hearing, I, therefore, asked Ms. Lynch about what she might do to protect the lawful rights of U.S. workers. Here is the simple question I placed to the person who would be the next top law enforcement officer for America. And in my preamble to the question, I noted Attorney General Holder had said that people who came to our country unlawfully and who are in our country unlawfully today have a civil right and a human right to citizenship in America, contrary to all law. So I asked her what she thought about this. Mr. Sessions: Who has more right to a job in this country; a lawful immigrant who's here or [a] citizen or a person who entered the country unlawfully? Ms. Lynch: I believe that the right and the obligation to work is one that's shared by everyone in this country regardless of how they came here. And certainly, if someone is here regardless of status, I would prefer they would be participating in the workplace than not participating in the workplace. What a stunning and breathtaking statement that is for the top law enforcement officer in America--to say that a person has a right to work in this country regardless of how they came here. So people who enter don't have to follow the steps that are required? They do not have to establish that they have lawful justification to enter the United States and work in the United States anymore? If you can just get into the country unlawfully, then you have a right to work? And our current Attorney General Holder says they have a civil right to citizenship. This is not law. I don't know what this is, but it is so far from law I don't know how to express my concern about it effectively. It is unprecedented for someone who is seeking the highest law enforcement office in America to declare that someone who is in this country illegally has a right to a job. Make no mistake, we are at a dangerous time in our Nation's history, particularly for our Republic's legal system and our Constitution. I would like to quote now from Prof. Jonathan Turley, a Shapiro Professor of Public Interest Law at George Washington University Law School, a nationally recognized constitutional scholar, and a self- described supporter of President Obama and most of his policies. He has been called as an expert witness on various issues by Senator Leahy and other Democrats over the years. He described the current state of affairs as ``a constitutional tipping point.'' He is referring to the Presidential overreach. I would like to take a moment to read from the testimony he delivered before the House of Representatives in February of last year--9 months before the President even announced this amnesty, but after the first DACA amnesty. This is what he said: The current passivity of Congress represents a crisis of faith for members willing to see a president assume legislative powers in exchange for insular policy gains. The short-term insular victories achieved by this President will come at a prohibitive cost if the current imbalance is not corrected. Constitutional authority is easy to lose in the transient shifts of politics. It is far more difficult to regain. If a passion for the Constitution does not motivate members, perhaps a sense of self-preservation will be enough to unify members. President Obama will not be our last president. However, these acquired powers will be passed to his successors. When that occurs, members may loathe the day that they remained silent as the power of government shifted so radically to the Chief Executive. The powerful personality that engendered this loyalty will be gone, but the powers will remain. We are now at the constitutional tipping point for our system. If balance is to be reestablished, it must begin before this President leaves office and that will likely require every possible means to reassert legislative authority. Now that is Professor Turley, a supporter of President Obama, and a fine constitutional scholar, who is warning the U.S. Congress of the dangers to its powers that have been eroded in the recent months. To stop it, he says that will require Congress to use ``every possible means to reassert its legislative authority.'' So stopping an Attorney General nominee--not voting to confirm an individual as Attorney General--is that a legitimate power of Congress? Well, of course it is. Should we feel obligated and required to confirm someone who has announced they intend to pursue and advance legally through the powers of their office an unconstitutional overreach, because the President nominates that person? Is that our duty? Doesn't Congress have a right to say: Oh no, Mr. President, we understand how this system works. You get to nominate, but you have overreached [[Page S1520]] here and we are not going to ratify. We are not going to consent or approve someone who is going to continue to promote these kinds of unlawful activities. One glaring result of Congress's passivity is that executive branch nominees no longer feel the need to be responsive to congressional oversight. We are not getting sufficient answers from them. That is for sure. I think Congress has too often been quiet and slept on its watch. In the past, Members could perform their constitutional duty of advice and consent, for example, by withholding consent until a nominee provided information to which Congress was entitled. That is how coequal branches of government are supposed to function. Congress has a duty to demand accurate information from the executive branch before providing funds to that branch, and they have a right to insist on it. They don't have to fund any branch of government they believe is unworthy. When Ms. Lynch came before the committee, it quickly became apparent that she had no intention of being frank and providing real answers. That is a problem I think we have to confront. I think the most telling example of this concern was illustrated by an answer I was given to a straightforward question I asked, which goes to the very core of this debate that we are having in America about the President's powers and what we should do about establishing a lawful system of immigration--one that we could be proud of, one that is systemically and fairly applied day after day. The question I asked her was simply this: Do you believe that President Obama has exceeded his executive authority in any way? If so, how? She answered: As United States Attorney for the Eastern District of New York, I have not been charged with determining when and whether the President has exceeded his executive authority. But that was really not a good-faith answer or an attempt to answer the question. I will wrap up and just say, in conclusion, that we are dealing with huge constitutional issues. I wish it weren't so. It is not anything personal that causes me to complain about this nominee. But in truth, we need to use the means this Congress has to defend its legitimate constitutional rights, the power it has been given to legislate. And the President's duties, as the chief law and executive officer of the country, are to execute the laws passed by Congress. One of the key players on his team is the Attorney General, and the Attorney General in this situation has taken a position contrary to the fundamental principles of the Constitution, as Professor Turley has delineated with force and clarity. That being the case, I think Congress has a duty to this institution, to the laws and Constitution of this country, and to the American people not to confirm someone who is not committed to those principles and, indeed, has asserted boldly that she would continue in violation of them. Madam President, I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida. Death Master File Mr. NELSON. Madam President, I am going to defer to my colleague from Connecticut, since at 5 p.m. we will be discussing the nominees which I will speak to. But before we do, I just want to point out two things to the Senate. First of all, the lead story of ``60 Minutes'' last night was about the death master file which is put out by Social Security. Interestingly, the story was from the extraordinary standpoint that a number of people are told they are dead when in fact they are very much alive and all of the horror they go through in trying to correct somebody's having made a mistake--a clerical error--that in fact they were dead by the alteration of one number or a name or just sheer overlook. But there is another problem with the death master file, and we have tried and tried to get that from Social Security. Unless you have an immediate use--a legitimate use for the death master file to be made public, such as a life insurance company--they would have a legitimate use to know who had died so they could stop the payments. Something else the ``60 Minutes'' program pointed out was that Medicare did not catch a lot of payments going out. But unless you have a legitimate use, by suddenly putting on line the death master file, it opens up all of these Social Security numbers for criminals to come in and create a new identity, file a tax return, and get a refund on a fictitious tax return. I want to continue to encourage the Social Security Administration. They claim they don't have the legal authority until we can give them the legal authority they are looking for. We think they have it administratively in their power not to put it out there. That is the right thing to do. Negotiations With Iran As I yield to the very distinguished Senator from Connecticut, a tremendous member of our commerce committee, I want to say I was sad last week--and am still sad this week--that nearly half of the Senators of the Senate sought to inject themselves by writing to the Ayatollah, trying to derail the negotiations that are ongoing on matters of life and death. If they don't think Iran having a nuclear weapon is a matter of life and death, they have another thing coming. Trying to derail the negotiations, while in fact the negotiations are going on at the very hour of the writing of that letter, and still are--and we won't know until the 24th of this month if in fact they are successful. I will come back when we get into the executive session about the nominees. I look forward to hearing from the Senator from Connecticut. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut. Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Madam President, I am proud to follow the distinguished Senator from Florida, and I join him in his observations of the ``60 Minutes'' show, but equally, if not more importantly, in his views on the letter that was sent to the rulers of Iran and its divisive and destructive impact on a matter that should be above partisan politics. To inject a partisan political issue into, literally, a matter of life and death, in my view, is unfortunate, inappropriate, and truly regrettable. Lynch Nomination Equally unfortunate, regrettable, and inappropriate is to inject politics into law enforcement. The nomination of the chief law enforcement officer in our Nation, the Attorney General--that position truly ought to be above politics. In fact, as we know from the structure of our government, it is generally regarded to be above politics. The President of the United States has his or her legal counsel to provide advice to the President, but the Attorney General of the United States enforces laws for this Nation--not for one party, not for one official, not on one issue, but on all issues for all people in the United States. When my colleagues have said on the floor that the President deserves his nominee, really it is the Nation that deserves a nominee to be confirmed. This nominee has been delayed longer than any in recent history. As my colleagues have observed and as this chart illustrates, 129 days have passed since Loretta Lynch's nomination. From announcement to confirmation, her nomination has been delayed longer than any in recent history--in fact, longer than any in modern history, putting aside the Meese nomination, which was delayed because of an ongoing investigation into alleged improprieties. There is no investigation here. There is no question of impropriety. There has been no hint of any reason to reject the Loretta Lynch nomination. The American people could be forgiven for thinking that some of the Members of this body are simply looking for an excuse to delay or deny her nomination. First, it was in our hearing questions about her capacity and qualifications. Those reasons or potential excuses for delaying or denying her nomination were quickly extinguished. Then it was the immigration issue. That too, as an excuse for delaying or denying this nomination, has been dispensed. Now it is the antitrafficking bill. No reason for delay could be more inappropriate, because the fact of the matter is the threat to delay again her nomination is antithetical to the very goal of stopping human trafficking. If my colleagues really want to end sex exploitation and human trafficking, [[Page S1521]] they should confirm the chief law enforcement official who is responsible for fighting it. They should confirm the nominee who has indicated an anathema to this kind of abuse, who has shown her determination to fight it and to use all of the laws and potentially this new law in the war against human trafficking. The Senate is perfectly capable of filling this crucial position--the top law enforcement job in the Nation--even as it debates antitrafficking legislation. In fact, it has shown itself capable of doing so just last week when two nominees to Department of Transportation positions--important transportation positions, as I can say personally, because they involve the safety and reliability of our system--even as it continued to debate the antitrafficking legislation. Holding the Lynch nomination hostage--which is what is happening here--is a disservice to the Department of Justice but even more so to our system of justice. It undermines the integrity and trust in the nonpolitical nature of justice in this Nation. It does so at a time when vigorous and effective leadership is more important and necessary than ever. The Nation could be forgiven for assuming, as increasingly appears to be so, that the Lynch nomination is being held hostage or is simply a cynical excuse to prevent her from getting to work on protecting the American public from human trafficking, which is so important. There are legitimate points of debate between our sides on this issue. Those points of debate and differences need to be resolved, and I hope they will be. I trust they will be. I believe that they are resolvable and that extraneous or irrelevant provisions now in the bill can be removed so that we can focus on stopping modern-day slavery, which is what the-- The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired. Mr. BLUMENTHAL. If I may have another minute to finish. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Which is what we should be doing here, and I believe we will do it. Loretta Lynch has a stellar record. She served with incredible distinction during her time as U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of New York. I suggest to my colleagues that the best way to serve the purpose of stopping trafficking is to confirm her so she can get to work on enforcing that new law. Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, we have had competing claims about who is really at fault. I think the answer to that question is becoming unquestionably undeniable to any fair observer. Actions speak louder than words and there is no denying the actions of the minority party, which, before this Congress, was the majority party in the Senate for 8 years. Even in the minority, they are up to their old tricks of blocking amendments and grinding the Senate to a halt. Given the distortion of the Senate rules during those 8 years, it is no wonder the American public, and perhaps even some Senators, are confused about how the Senate rules are supposed to work. So I wish to take a few moments to talk about a procedure in the Senate called the cloture motion. With cloture, the Senate is actually voting on the question: Is it the sense of the Senate that the debate shall be brought to a close? The proper use of cloture is when the Senate has had time for debate and consideration of amendments and it seems as though the Senate is getting bogged down. If a cloture vote fails, then that means the Senate has decided, as a body, to keep on considering a particular piece of legislation. This is a crucial point and one that was routinely distorted under the previous majority, and they did it for partisan ends. A vote against cloture is a vote to continue considering a bill until at least 60 Senators are satisfied they have had their say and are ready to vote a bill up or down, yea or nay. It is not always clear when the Senate has reached that point, so the bill can sometimes require several cloture votes. Under the previous majority leadership--and now that group happens to be the Senate minority--we saw unprecedented abuses of Senate rules to block Senators from participating in the deliberative process. This included the repeated abuse of the cloture rule. In order to shield his Members from having to take tough votes, the previous majority leader routinely moved to shut down all consideration of a bill even before any debate took place and even before any amendments could be considered. As I stated, cloture is supposed to be used after the Senate has considered a measure for a period of time and a preponderance of the Senate thinks it has deliberated enough, and not do it to end consideration of a bill before it has begun, as the previous majority leadership did for several years prior to this year. Let's contrast how our majority leader, Senator McConnell, has been running the Senate. He has not tried to block minority amendments, as was done to us when we were in the minority. In fact, we have already had more than twice as many amendment votes as all of last year. As the manager of this bill, I have been running an open amendment process, and I am not afraid to have votes on amendments of all kinds. In fact, if you are fortunate enough to be elected to represent your State as a U.S. Senator, it seems to me you have an obligation to the people of your State to offer amendments on issues that are important to your State. The American people saw that we were serious about restoring the Senate tradition of having an open amendment process with the very first major bill we took up in this new Congress. Supporters of the Keystone Pipeline bill had the 60 votes to end debate, but we didn't try to ram through the bill without consideration of amendments. We had a full, open amendment process as we are supposed to have in the U.S. Senate, because it is a deliberative and amending body. There were more than a few ``gotcha'' types of amendments from the other side, but that is OK because that is how the Senate is supposed to operate. There was also an opportunity, for the first time in a very long time, for Senators to get votes on substantive issues that are important to the people of their individual States. That should be a big deal for every Senator, but it was not a very big deal the way the Senate was run previous to this year. When Senators are blocked from participating in the legislative process, the people they represent are disenfranchised. We were not elected to serve our party leadership, but to represent our State, and that is why it was so disappointing under the previous majority to see Senators repeatedly voting in lockstep with their party leadership to block amendments and end debate before it started. I think it is pretty clear from the last election that that strategy backfired in a very major way. Yet the same leaders, now in the minority, are up to their old tricks. The previous Senate leadership routinely used a tactic called filling the tree, where a former majority leader used his right of first recognition to call up his amendments and thus block out amendments from other Senators of both political parties. When the Senate is considering a number of amendments at once, it then requires unanimous consent to set aside the pending amendment in order to call up a new amendment, and that is a way to prevent other Senators from then offering their amendments. If you don't get unanimous consent to take down an amendment to make room for your amendment, you don't get the chance to offer your amendment, and usually that was blocked, and that is why there were only 18 rollcall votes on amendments all last year, compared to this year. The last time I counted, so far this year we had 43 votes. Elections are supposed to have consequences, and the consequences of the last election are that the new majority decided the Senate ought to operate as a deliberative and amending body where every Senator can participate, so Majority Leader McConnell has not filled the amendment tree. We have substantive amendments pending as we speak. Nevertheless, the minority leadership has been objecting to even setting aside the pending amendment or proceeding to a vote on pending amendments just as when they used the procedure of filling the amendment tree. After reporting the human trafficking bill out of the Senate Judiciary Committee unanimously, they have decided there is one provision they don't [[Page S1522]] like, so after 3 days of consideration last week the bill has not moved forward. It looks as though the same trick is going on right now. Since there is an open amendment process--and that is the way Senator McConnell runs the Senate--we have naturally suggested that they offer an amendment if they don't like something in this bill. They have refused to do so, and instead are holding up the entire bill from being amended and finally passed. So after opening the bill up to amendments and having considered the bill for a week, the majority leader has now filed cloture. I want to be clear what this means. Again, a vote against cloture is a vote to continue debate and consider amendments. I have voted against ending debate many times in recent years out of principle when Senators were being denied their right to offer amendments. No one can say this is the case right now on this human trafficking bill. We have had a week of debate, and it is the minority party that is blocking amendments. Remember that many Members of the now minority party, when they were in the majority, were adamant that a vote against cloture is a filibuster and that it is illegitimate to filibuster. I say to my colleagues, if they truly believe filibusters are wrong and it was not just cynical political posturing, then you had better vote for cloture tomorrow. I will also note that a couple of Senators sent out a ``Dear Colleague'' letter at the beginning of this Congress calling again for what they term the ``talking filibuster.'' By this, those Senators mean that if you vote against ending debate, you should be prepared to talk nonstop on the Senate floor. Under their proposal, as soon as there are no Senators talking on the Senate floor, the Senate would move to a final vote. The problem with this idea under the previous leadership was that amendments were routinely blocked so it meant Senators would have to talk nonstop to preserve their right to offer an amendment with no guarantee they would ever get the chance. That is not the issue this time. We have allowed an open amendment process, and it is the minority party that is blocking amendments. So I would say to all the advocates of the so-called talking filibuster, if you do vote against cloture, you are saying you want to debate this bill more before a vote is taken. In that case, you better put your money where your mouth is. To all of my colleagues who support this so-called filibuster and vote against this cloture motion, I expect to see you come down to the Senate floor and talk nonstop. You can use the time to explain to the American people why you object to moving forward with this very important bipartisan legislation to combat sex trafficking. Then when you are ready to move forward with the vote, let us know. I yield the floor. ____________________",package_114_109.csv,39935,39935,40002,"[congressional record volume 161, number 44 (monday, march 16, 2015)] [senate] [pages s1517-s1522] from the congressional record online through the government publishing office [ www.gpo.gov ] justice for victims of trafficking act of 2015 the presiding officer. under the previous order, the senate will resume consideration of s. 178, which the clerk will report. the senior assistant legislative clerk read as follows: a bill (s. 178) to provide justice for the victims of trafficking. pending: portman amendment no. 270, to amend the child abuse prevention and treatment act to enable state child protective services systems to improve the identification and assessment of child victims of sex trafficking. portman amendment no. 271, to amend the definition of ``homeless person'' under the mckinney-vento homeless assistance act to include certain homeless children and youth. vitter amendment no. 284 (to amendment no. 271), to amend section 301 of the immigration and nationality act to clarify those classes of individuals born in the united states who are nationals and citizens of the united states at birth. the presiding officer. the senator from vermont. mr. leahy. madam president, earlier this month, two florida men were charged with human trafficking. they drugged a runaway 16-year-old girl. then they forced her to have sex with up to 10 men a day. they sold her to men in a gas station bathroom. they sold her on the street and they sold her in the back of a car. she was 16 years old. she had run away from home. she was terribly vulnerable. they promised her food, then they beat her, drugged her, and sold her. when she escaped, they tracked her down, beat her, and sold her again. all of us--i think we should have an agreement that democrats and republicans alike must remember the many other survivors of this heinous crime. we have been working for almost 1 year on bipartisan proposals to protect these vulnerable children, count the survivors, and then punish those who put them through this hell. this effort had strong bipartisan support until partisan politics was injected into the debate. the fight against human trafficking should not be made into a partisan issue to score political points. that is unfortunately where we are today. everyone expected this legislation to move smoothly through the senate, i know i did, just as it did through the house. instead, senate republicans have turned away from a comprehensive solution that can garner broad support. i am deeply saddened by this partisan fight. it is both destructive and unnecessary. it is destructive because it threatens to derail important legislation that would make a difference in the lives of survivors--such as the 16-year-old girl in florida. this partisan fight is unnecessary because abortion politics have no place in this debate. congress has a long history of passing legislation to address human trafficking. we have consistently done so without abortion politics being injected into the discussion. i know we have passed the violence against women act. we included a trafficking amendment of mine in that. while i was disappointed that a number of my republicans colleagues voted against the violence against women act, which had the sex trafficking [[page s1518]] amendment in it, we still passed it by a bipartisan majority, as did the house of representatives, and the president signed it into law. so i was pleased we were able to get that significant piece of legislation passed, even though many in this body who say why aren't we passing this voted against the violence against women act with the sexual trafficking amendment. but i wish to make clear to everyone that this partisan provision that has now popped up is not something that survivors of human trafficking are asking for. it is not something experts in the field who work with them every day are asking for. we should look at these experts who know what is going on and ask them what it is they want. they do not want this. in fact, those who are closest to the damage wreaked by this terrible crime are asking all of us, senate republicans and democrats, to take out this provision. they are asking us to put politics aside and to focus on the needs of those who have lived through a hell we will never understand. holly austin smith, a survivor, was a girl who ran away at the age of 14 and was bought and sold for sex. she put it this way when she testified before our committee: politics should not govern the options available to victims of sex trafficking--especially when such victims often have had their basic human rights taken away by criminals who had only their own agendas in mind. so i think we have to stand with these human trafficking survivors. we have to put aside our agendas. they are asking us to take out this unnecessary provision and move the bill forward to address their urgent needs. i support the rest of senator cornyn's bill, and that is why i included it in the comprehensive substitute amendment i filed last week. also included in my substitute is a vital component to prevent human trafficking by focusing on runaway and homeless youth. if we are serious about helping to end this heinous crime, we should be talking about all the good ideas to expand the protections of trafficking victims. don't try to score partisan points. we should all come together to protect these vulnerable kids. that is why we are here. i am confident that if we remember these children, republicans and democrats, we can move forward and return to the bipartisan path we have always walked on this issue. one of the reasons i have that amendment--talking about preventing is one thing and we should prosecute those people who do this--but wouldn't it be that much better for the victims if we could prevent it from happening in the first place? i have spoken before of the nightmares i still have from some of the cases i prosecuted when i was 26 years old and the chief prosecutor for one-quarter of my state. i looked at these victims and the ages of my own children, and all i wanted to do was to get--and did--the people who perpetrated these crimes, prosecute them, and convict them. we should prosecute people who do this, but i also thought how much better it would have been if we had programs that would have given these people somewhere they could turn to before they became victims, some way to protect them so we wouldn't see it afterward. i said on the floor the other night that in preparing for these trials, the people i prosecuted, i wouldn't bring paperwork home in the evening to do it. i stayed in my office and prepared it. one, i didn't want to take the chance that one of my then-young children might see some of the photographs i was going to introduce into evidence--but i also didn't want them to see their father crying and wonder why, because i always tried to tell them the truth. i was not about to tell these young children the truth of what i was seeing. instead, i would tell the truth to the jury and the jury would convict, but even the jury wishes it had never happened in the first place. the national network for youth sent a letter saying: the national network for youth is writing this letter with the hope that the u.s. senate will remove the partisan piece of the justice for victims of trafficking act. this legislation is desperately needed and we cannot let this moment pass us by because of the addition of partisan and divisive provisions. the national network for youth is saying: let's go back to why both republicans and democrats wanted this legislation--to stop trafficking, to help the victims of trafficking, and not to score political points. just as the majority of this body voted for the leahy-crapo bill, the violence against women act, which had a provision on sexual trafficking, a majority voted for it, republicans and democrats--i wish that others--i wish everybody in this body voted for it. i understand that some who now strongly support the partisan part of the trafficking bill voted against the violence against women act. each senator has the right to vote as he or she wants. but i find it strange that they say: let's go forward with this partisan provision, when only 1 year ago or so those same senators who are now saying we should go forward with this voted against the violence against women act. the very same senators voted against it. let's get out of politics. that was a good act. it had a very strong sex trafficking provision, which fortunately also was accepted by the house of representatives and signed into law by the president. senator crapo and i set aside politics so we could pass that bill. that is what we should do today. i yield the floor. i suggest the absence of a quorum. the presiding officer. the clerk will call the roll. the senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. mr. sessions. madam president, i ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. the presiding officer. without objection, it is so ordered. mr. sessions. i appreciate the work my colleagues have done on this trafficking bill. it is an important issue that deserves debate and a vote. lynch nomination madam president, i will say why i believe the lynch nomination should not go forward. i think it is for a very important reason and, unfortunately, it is one that i think congress has to address. in their wisdom, our founders gave congress certain powers as a coequal branch of government, and one of those powers was the power to confirm or not confirm nominees. long before ms. lynch's nomination was announced, i said i could not vote to confirm any candidate for attorney general who supported the president's unlawful executive amnesty. that executive amnesty presents big constitutional issues that we have to talk about and understand, and it relates directly to the powers of the executive branch versus the legislative branch. the attorney general is the top law enforcement officer in this country, and anyone who occupies that office, must have fidelity to the laws of the united states duly passed, and to the constitution of the united states. it is that simple. the senate cannot confirm any individual, must never confirm an individual to such an office as this--the one most responsible for maintaining fidelity to law--who would support and advance a scheme that violates our constitution and eviscerates congressional authority. no person should be confirmed who would do that. congress makes the laws, not the president, and congress has repeatedly rejected legislation to provide amnesty, work permits, and benefits to those who have entered our country unlawfully. if you want to receive benefits in the united states, you should wait your turn and come lawfully. we rejected such proposals in 2006, 2007, 2010, 2013, and 2014. president obama's unlawful and unconstitutional executive actions nullify the immigration laws we do have that are on the books--the immigration and nationality act--and replaces them with the very measures congress refused to enact. that is where we are. even king george iii lacked the power to legislate without parliament. president obama's executive action provides illegal immigrants--those who come into our country contrary to the immigration laws of the united states, which are generous indeed, allowing a million people a year to come to our country--with work authorization, photo ids, trillions in social security [[page s1519]] and medicare benefits, and tax credits of up to $35,000 a year, according to the congressional research service. i think the irs commissioner has admitted that as well. the president's action has even made chain migration and citizenship a possibility, which he said repeatedly he couldn't do and wouldn't do. despite those assurances, his action opens up these possibilities as well, it appears. and, again, all of these measures were rejected by congress. i discussed these issues with ms. lynch. i asked her plainly whether she supported the president's unilateral decision to make his own immigration rules and laws. here is the relevant portion of that hearing transcript, because i wanted to be clear about it. this was during the judiciary committee hearing when she was there as part of her confirmation process. mr. sessions: i have to have a clear answer to this question: ms. lynch, do you believe the executive action announced by president obama on november 20th is legal and constitutional? yes or no? ms. lynch: as i've read the [office of legal counsel] opinion, i do believe it is, senator. well, first, we need to understand something. i served 5 years as a federal prosecutor in the department of justice, and this is the way it works. the office of legal counsel is a part of the department of justice. the office of legal counsel is the one that has been credited with writing this pathetic memorandum that justified the president's actions. but the office of legal counsel works directly for the attorney general. the attorney general is really the one responsible for forwarding to the president a memorandum that says the president can do what he wanted to do. the president said on over 20 different occasions over a period of years, ``i am not an emperor,'' ``i do not have the power to do this,'' ``this would be unconstitutional.'' he made similar statements over 20 different times. then he changed his mind as we got close to an election, for reasons that i don't fully intend to speculate about at this time, and then he asked that he be given the power to do this. this puts great pressure on the office of legal counsel, but that is one of the historic roles they fulfill--to analyze these things. they take an oath to the constitution, and they are required to say no if the president is asking for something he is not entitled to do. they are supposed to say no, and the attorney general is supposed to say no. the attorney general could review the opinion of the office of legal counsel and take it upon himself or herself to write their own opinion and submit it as the position of the department of justice and say the president can do this if he so desires. so that is the way the system works. but what i want to say, colleagues, is the attorney general played a key role in this presidential overreach. it was the attorney general's office that approved this overreach. and this nominee says she believes this is correct. she indicated her approval, and i am sure will defend it in every court around the country and advocate for it. some say: well, she works for the president. no, she works for the people of the united states of america. her salary comes from the taxpayers of this country. her duty, on occasion, is to say no to the president; to try to help him accomplish his goals, like a good corporate lawyer would, but at some point you have to say: mr. corporate ceo, mr. president of the united states, this goes too far. you can't do this. but ms. lynch has indicated she is unwilling to do that. one of the most stunning features of the president's actions is the mass grant of work permits for up to 5 million illegal immigrants. these immigrants will take jobs directly from american citizens and directly from legal immigrants who have come into the country. u.s. civil rights commission member peter kirsanow has discussed this issue and written at length about how allowing illegal immigrants to take jobs undermines the rights of u.s. workers--the legal rights of u.s. workers--especially african-american workers and hispanic workers suffering from high unemployment today. at her confirmation hearing, i, therefore, asked ms. lynch about what she might do to protect the lawful rights of u.s. workers. here is the simple question i placed to the person who would be the next top law enforcement officer for america. and in my preamble to the question, i noted attorney general holder had said that people who came to our country unlawfully and who are in our country unlawfully today have a civil right and a human right to citizenship in america, contrary to all law. so i asked her what she thought about this. mr. sessions: who has more right to a job in this country; a lawful immigrant who's here or [a] citizen or a person who entered the country unlawfully? ms. lynch: i believe that the right and the obligation to work is one that's shared by everyone in this country regardless of how they came here. and certainly, if someone is here regardless of status, i would prefer they would be participating in the workplace than not participating in the workplace. what a stunning and breathtaking statement that is for the top law enforcement officer in america--to say that a person has a right to work in this country regardless of how they came here. so people who enter don't have to follow the steps that are required? they do not have to establish that they have lawful justification to enter the united states and work in the united states anymore? if you can just get into the country unlawfully, then you have a right to work? and our current attorney general holder says they have a civil right to citizenship. this is not law. i don't know what this is, but it is so far from law i don't know how to express my concern about it effectively. it is unprecedented for someone who is seeking the highest law enforcement office in america to declare that someone who is in this country illegally has a right to a job. make no mistake, we are at a dangerous time in our nation's history, particularly for our republic's legal system and our constitution. i would like to quote now from prof. jonathan turley, a shapiro professor of public interest law at george washington university law school, a nationally recognized constitutional scholar, and a self- described supporter of president obama and most of his policies. he has been called as an expert witness on various issues by senator leahy and other democrats over the years. he described the current state of affairs as ``a constitutional tipping point.'' he is referring to the presidential overreach. i would like to take a moment to read from the testimony he delivered before the house of representatives in february of last year--9 months before the president even announced this amnesty, but after the first daca amnesty. this is what he said: the current passivity of congress represents a crisis of faith for members willing to see a president assume legislative powers in exchange for insular policy gains. the short-term insular victories achieved by this president will come at a prohibitive cost if the current imbalance is not corrected. constitutional authority is easy to lose in the transient shifts of politics. it is far more difficult to regain. if a passion for the constitution does not motivate members, perhaps a sense of self-preservation will be enough to unify members. president obama will not be our last president. however, these acquired powers will be passed to his successors. when that occurs, members may loathe the day that they remained silent as the power of government shifted so radically to the chief executive. the powerful personality that engendered this loyalty will be gone, but the powers will remain. we are now at the constitutional tipping point for our system. if balance is to be reestablished, it must begin before this president leaves office and that will likely require every possible means to reassert legislative authority. now that is professor turley, a supporter of president obama, and a fine constitutional scholar, who is warning the u.s. congress of the dangers to its powers that have been eroded in the recent months. to stop it, he says that will require congress to use ``every possible means to reassert its legislative authority.'' so stopping an attorney general nominee--not voting to confirm an individual as attorney general--is that a legitimate power of congress? well, of course it is. should we feel obligated and required to confirm someone who has announced they intend to pursue and advance legally through the powers of their office an unconstitutional overreach, because the president nominates that person? is that our duty? doesn't congress have a right to say: oh no, mr. president, we understand how this system works. you get to nominate, but you have overreached [[page s1520]] here and we are not going to ratify. we are not going to consent or approve someone who is going to continue to promote these kinds of unlawful activities. one glaring result of congress's passivity is that executive branch nominees no longer feel the need to be responsive to congressional oversight. we are not getting sufficient answers from them. that is for sure. i think congress has too often been quiet and slept on its watch. in the past, members could perform their constitutional duty of advice and consent, for example, by withholding consent until a nominee provided information to which congress was entitled. that is how coequal branches of government are supposed to function. congress has a duty to demand accurate information from the executive branch before providing funds to that branch, and they have a right to insist on it. they don't have to fund any branch of government they believe is unworthy. when ms. lynch came before the committee, it quickly became apparent that she had no intention of being frank and providing real answers. that is a problem i think we have to confront. i think the most telling example of this concern was illustrated by an answer i was given to a straightforward question i asked, which goes to the very core of this debate that we are having in america about the president's powers and what we should do about establishing a lawful system of immigration--one that we could be proud of, one that is systemically and fairly applied day after day. the question i asked her was simply this: do you believe that president obama has exceeded his executive authority in any way? if so, how? she answered: as united states attorney for the eastern district of new york, i have not been charged with determining when and whether the president has exceeded his executive authority. but that was really not a good-faith answer or an attempt to answer the question. i will wrap up and just say, in conclusion, that we are dealing with huge constitutional issues. i wish it weren't so. it is not anything personal that causes me to complain about this nominee. but in truth, we need to use the means this congress has to defend its legitimate constitutional rights, the power it has been given to legislate. and the president's duties, as the chief law and executive officer of the country, are to execute the laws passed by congress. one of the key players on his team is the attorney general, and the attorney general in this situation has taken a position contrary to the fundamental principles of the constitution, as professor turley has delineated with force and clarity. that being the case, i think congress has a duty to this institution, to the laws and constitution of this country, and to the american people not to confirm someone who is not committed to those principles and, indeed, has asserted boldly that she would continue in violation of them. madam president, i yield the floor. the presiding officer. the senator from florida. death master file mr. nelson. madam president, i am going to defer to my colleague from connecticut, since at 5 p.m. we will be discussing the nominees which i will speak to. but before we do, i just want to point out two things to the senate. first of all, the lead story of ``60 minutes'' last night was about the death master file which is put out by social security. interestingly, the story was from the extraordinary standpoint that a number of people are told they are dead when in fact they are very much alive and all of the horror they go through in trying to correct somebody's having made a mistake--a clerical error--that in fact they were dead by the alteration of one number or a name or just sheer overlook. but there is another problem with the death master file, and we have tried and tried to get that from social security. unless you have an immediate use--a legitimate use for the death master file to be made public, such as a life insurance company--they would have a legitimate use to know who had died so they could stop the payments. something else the ``60 minutes'' program pointed out was that medicare did not catch a lot of payments going out. but unless you have a legitimate use, by suddenly putting on line the death master file, it opens up all of these social security numbers for criminals to come in and create a new identity, file a tax return, and get a refund on a fictitious tax return. i want to continue to encourage the social security administration. they claim they don't have the legal authority until we can give them the legal authority they are looking for. we think they have it administratively in their power not to put it out there. that is the right thing to do. negotiations with iran as i yield to the very distinguished senator from connecticut, a tremendous member of our commerce committee, i want to say i was sad last week--and am still sad this week--that nearly half of the senators of the senate sought to inject themselves by writing to the ayatollah, trying to derail the negotiations that are ongoing on matters of life and death. if they don't think iran having a nuclear weapon is a matter of life and death, they have another thing coming. trying to derail the negotiations, while in fact the negotiations are going on at the very hour of the writing of that letter, and still are--and we won't know until the 24th of this month if in fact they are successful. i will come back when we get into the executive session about the nominees. i look forward to hearing from the senator from connecticut. the presiding officer. the senator from connecticut. mr. blumenthal. madam president, i am proud to follow the distinguished senator from florida, and i join him in his observations of the ``60 minutes'' show, but equally, if not more importantly, in his views on the letter that was sent to the rulers of iran and its divisive and destructive impact on a matter that should be above partisan politics. to inject a partisan political issue into, literally, a matter of life and death, in my view, is unfortunate, inappropriate, and truly regrettable. lynch nomination equally unfortunate, regrettable, and inappropriate is to inject politics into law enforcement. the nomination of the chief law enforcement officer in our nation, the attorney general--that position truly ought to be above politics. in fact, as we know from the structure of our government, it is generally regarded to be above politics. the president of the united states has his or her legal counsel to provide advice to the president, but the attorney general of the united states enforces laws for this nation--not for one party, not for one official, not on one issue, but on all issues for all people in the united states. when my colleagues have said on the floor that the president deserves his nominee, really it is the nation that deserves a nominee to be confirmed. this nominee has been delayed longer than any in recent history. as my colleagues have observed and as this chart illustrates, 129 days have passed since loretta lynch's nomination. from announcement to confirmation, her nomination has been delayed longer than any in recent history--in fact, longer than any in modern history, putting aside the meese nomination, which was delayed because of an ongoing investigation into alleged improprieties. there is no investigation here. there is no question of impropriety. there has been no hint of any reason to reject the loretta lynch nomination. the american people could be forgiven for thinking that some of the members of this body are simply looking for an excuse to delay or deny her nomination. first, it was in our hearing questions about her capacity and qualifications. those reasons or potential excuses for delaying or denying her nomination were quickly extinguished. then it was the immigration issue. that too, as an excuse for delaying or denying this nomination, has been dispensed. now it is the antitrafficking bill. no reason for delay could be more inappropriate, because the fact of the matter is the threat to delay again her nomination is antithetical to the very goal of stopping human trafficking. if my colleagues really want to end sex exploitation and human trafficking, [[page s1521]] they should confirm the chief law enforcement official who is responsible for fighting it. they should confirm the nominee who has indicated an anathema to this kind of abuse, who has shown her determination to fight it and to use all of the laws and potentially this new law in the war against human trafficking. the senate is perfectly capable of filling this crucial position--the top law enforcement job in the nation--even as it debates antitrafficking legislation. in fact, it has shown itself capable of doing so just last week when two nominees to department of transportation positions--important transportation positions, as i can say personally, because they involve the safety and reliability of our system--even as it continued to debate the antitrafficking legislation. holding the lynch nomination hostage--which is what is happening here--is a disservice to the department of justice but even more so to our system of justice. it undermines the integrity and trust in the nonpolitical nature of justice in this nation. it does so at a time when vigorous and effective leadership is more important and necessary than ever. the nation could be forgiven for assuming, as increasingly appears to be so, that the lynch nomination is being held hostage or is simply a cynical excuse to prevent her from getting to work on protecting the american public from human trafficking, which is so important. there are legitimate points of debate between our sides on this issue. those points of debate and differences need to be resolved, and i hope they will be. i trust they will be. i believe that they are resolvable and that extraneous or irrelevant provisions now in the bill can be removed so that we can focus on stopping modern-day slavery, which is what the-- the presiding officer. the senator's time has expired. mr. blumenthal. if i may have another minute to finish. the presiding officer. without objection, it is so ordered. mr. blumenthal. which is what we should be doing here, and i believe we will do it. loretta lynch has a stellar record. she served with incredible distinction during her time as u.s. attorney for the eastern district of new york. i suggest to my colleagues that the best way to serve the purpose of stopping trafficking is to confirm her so she can get to work on enforcing that new law. mr. grassley. madam president, we have had competing claims about who is really at fault. i think the answer to that question is becoming unquestionably undeniable to any fair observer. actions speak louder than words and there is no denying the actions of the minority party, which, before this congress, was the majority party in the senate for 8 years. even in the minority, they are up to their old tricks of blocking amendments and grinding the senate to a halt. given the distortion of the senate rules during those 8 years, it is no wonder the american public, and perhaps even some senators, are confused about how the senate rules are supposed to work. so i wish to take a few moments to talk about a procedure in the senate called the cloture motion. with cloture, the senate is actually voting on the question: is it the sense of the senate that the debate shall be brought to a close? the proper use of cloture is when the senate has had time for debate and consideration of amendments and it seems as though the senate is getting bogged down. if a cloture vote fails, then that means the senate has decided, as a body, to keep on considering a particular piece of legislation. this is a crucial point and one that was routinely distorted under the previous majority, and they did it for partisan ends. a vote against cloture is a vote to continue considering a bill until at least 60 senators are satisfied they have had their say and are ready to vote a bill up or down, yea or nay. it is not always clear when the senate has reached that point, so the bill can sometimes require several cloture votes. under the previous majority leadership--and now that group happens to be the senate minority--we saw unprecedented abuses of senate rules to block senators from participating in the deliberative process. this included the repeated abuse of the cloture rule. in order to shield his members from having to take tough votes, the previous majority leader routinely moved to shut down all consideration of a bill even before any debate took place and even before any amendments could be considered. as i stated, cloture is supposed to be used after the senate has considered a measure for a period of time and a preponderance of the senate thinks it has deliberated enough, and not do it to end consideration of a bill before it has begun, as the previous majority leadership did for several years prior to this year. let's contrast how our majority leader, senator mcconnell, has been running the senate. he has not tried to block minority amendments, as was done to us when we were in the minority. in fact, we have already had more than twice as many amendment votes as all of last year. as the manager of this bill, i have been running an open amendment process, and i am not afraid to have votes on amendments of all kinds. in fact, if you are fortunate enough to be elected to represent your state as a u.s. senator, it seems to me you have an obligation to the people of your state to offer amendments on issues that are important to your state. the american people saw that we were serious about restoring the senate tradition of having an open amendment process with the very first major bill we took up in this new congress. supporters of the keystone pipeline bill had the 60 votes to end debate, but we didn't try to ram through the bill without consideration of amendments. we had a full, open amendment process as we are supposed to have in the u.s. senate, because it is a deliberative and amending body. there were more than a few ``gotcha'' types of amendments from the other side, but that is ok because that is how the senate is supposed to operate. there was also an opportunity, for the first time in a very long time, for senators to get votes on substantive issues that are important to the people of their individual states. that should be a big deal for every senator, but it was not a very big deal the way the senate was run previous to this year. when senators are blocked from participating in the legislative process, the people they represent are disenfranchised. we were not elected to serve our party leadership, but to represent our state, and that is why it was so disappointing under the previous majority to see senators repeatedly voting in lockstep with their party leadership to block amendments and end debate before it started. i think it is pretty clear from the last election that that strategy backfired in a very major way. yet the same leaders, now in the minority, are up to their old tricks. the previous senate leadership routinely used a tactic called filling the tree, where a former majority leader used his right of first recognition to call up his amendments and thus block out amendments from other senators of both political parties. when the senate is considering a number of amendments at once, it then requires unanimous consent to set aside the pending amendment in order to call up a new amendment, and that is a way to prevent other senators from then offering their amendments. if you don't get unanimous consent to take down an amendment to make room for your amendment, you don't get the chance to offer your amendment, and usually that was blocked, and that is why there were only 18 rollcall votes on amendments all last year, compared to this year. the last time i counted, so far this year we had 43 votes. elections are supposed to have consequences, and the consequences of the last election are that the new majority decided the senate ought to operate as a deliberative and amending body where every senator can participate, so majority leader mcconnell has not filled the amendment tree. we have substantive amendments pending as we speak. nevertheless, the minority leadership has been objecting to even setting aside the pending amendment or proceeding to a vote on pending amendments just as when they used the procedure of filling the amendment tree. after reporting the human trafficking bill out of the senate judiciary committee unanimously, they have decided there is one provision they don't [[page s1522]] like, so after 3 days of consideration last week the bill has not moved forward. it looks as though the same trick is going on right now. since there is an open amendment process--and that is the way senator mcconnell runs the senate--we have naturally suggested that they offer an amendment if they don't like something in this bill. they have refused to do so, and instead are holding up the entire bill from being amended and finally passed. so after opening the bill up to amendments and having considered the bill for a week, the majority leader has now filed cloture. i want to be clear what this means. again, a vote against cloture is a vote to continue debate and consider amendments. i have voted against ending debate many times in recent years out of principle when senators were being denied their right to offer amendments. no one can say this is the case right now on this human trafficking bill. we have had a week of debate, and it is the minority party that is blocking amendments. remember that many members of the now minority party, when they were in the majority, were adamant that a vote against cloture is a filibuster and that it is illegitimate to filibuster. i say to my colleagues, if they truly believe filibusters are wrong and it was not just cynical political posturing, then you had better vote for cloture tomorrow. i will also note that a couple of senators sent out a ``dear colleague'' letter at the beginning of this congress calling again for what they term the ``talking filibuster.'' by this, those senators mean that if you vote against ending debate, you should be prepared to talk nonstop on the senate floor. under their proposal, as soon as there are no senators talking on the senate floor, the senate would move to a final vote. the problem with this idea under the previous leadership was that amendments were routinely blocked so it meant senators would have to talk nonstop to preserve their right to offer an amendment with no guarantee they would ever get the chance. that is not the issue this time. we have allowed an open amendment process, and it is the minority party that is blocking amendments. so i would say to all the advocates of the so-called talking filibuster, if you do vote against cloture, you are saying you want to debate this bill more before a vote is taken. in that case, you better put your money where your mouth is. to all of my colleagues who support this so-called filibuster and vote against this cloture motion, i expect to see you come down to the senate floor and talk nonstop. you can use the time to explain to the american people why you object to moving forward with this very important bipartisan legislation to combat sex trafficking. then when you are ready to move forward with the vote, let us know. i yield the floor. ____________________",39935

CREC-2015-03-16-pt1-PgS1522-5,CREC-2015-03-16,114,TRIBUTE TO DR. MICHAEL COLEGROVE,"[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 44 (Monday, March 16, 2015)] [Senate] [Pages S1522-S1524] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] TRIBUTE TO DR. MICHAEL COLEGROVE Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I rise to recognize a great Kentuckian who has recently received a great honor. Dr. Michael Colegrove, who has been employed with the University of the Cumberlands in various capacities over the last 40 years and is currently the vice president for student services and the director of leadership studies, recently received the Tri-County 2015 Leader of the Year award from the Leadership Tri-County organization in Kentucky. Leadership Tri-County focuses on civic, business, and community leadership in Laurel, Knox, and Whitley Counties in southeastern Kentucky. A nonprofit organization founded in 1987, it identifies potential, emerging, and current leaders from the three counties and nurtures their continued development. Dr. Colegrove graduated from Cumberland College, currently known as the University of the Cumberlands, in 1971. In addition to working for the school for 40 years, he spent 30 years in the U.S. Army Reserve and retired with the rank of colonel in 2003. Dr. Colegrove earned a master of arts from Eastern Kentucky University and a doctor of philosophy from Vanderbilt University. He is also a graduate of the U.S. War College. [[Page S1524]] Dr. Colegrove is the author of six books. His first book, ``Climbing the Pyramid: The How To's of Leadership,'' was published in 2004. It came about because of the need for a textbook for a leadership seminar conducted by the University of the Cumberlands. He has also volunteered with the American Red Cross and the Kiwanis Club. Dr. Colegrove and his wife Donna live in Williamsburg, KY, and have a daughter Kimberly who resides in Indiana with her husband Matthew and their two sons Jackson and William. I am sure Dr. Colegrove's family members are very proud of him and all that he has accomplished. I know my colleagues join me in congratulating Dr. Michael Colegrove on his receipt of the Tri-County 2015 Leader of the Year award. An area newspaper, the Times Tribune, published an article about Dr. Colegrove receiving his award. I ask unanimous consent that a portion of said article be printed in the Record. There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows: [From the Sentinel Echo, Feb. 25, 2015] U of C's Colegrove honored at LTC (By Nita Johnson) The influence he has made on his colleagues was evident-- first with the University of the Cumberlands' marching band's Honor Guard presenting the flags, and then by the two tables of students and co-workers seated at the Corbin Technology Center on Monday evening. His dedication is the quality that earned University of the Cumberlands' Dr. Michael Colegrove the 2015 Leader of the Year award from the Leadership Tri-County organization during their yearly awards banquet. Colegrove can be described with many words: author, Sunday School teacher, deacon, military veteran, and long-time employee at the Williamsburg college that focuses on helping students achieve success through faith and discipline. Hon. Eugene Siler Jr., a Williamsburg native who serves as the Sixth Judicial Circuit Judge for the U.S. Court of Appeals, introduced Colegrove and described him as ``as organized as anybody you'll ever see.'' As a personal friend and member of the Sunday School class that Colegrove teaches, Siler said Colegrove had achieved success through his faith and dedication to family, his job, and his role as a Christian. ``He's a great person,'' Siler said. Colegrove's record speaks for itself. He earned a bachelor's degree from then-Cumberland College, his master of arts degree from Eastern Kentucky University and his doctor of philosophy from Vanderbilt University. He also graduated from the United States Army War College and served in the Army Reserves for 30 years, retiring with the rank of colonel. He has been involved with a number of civic organizations ranging from the American Red Cross to serving as lieutenant governor for the Kiwanis Club for the Kentucky-Tennessee Region 6. But Colegrove's humility has remained intact throughout his many achievements. ``I am a man most blessed,'' he told the crowd. ``I had the opportunity at the University of the Cumberlands to teach faith with discipline with my colleagues and co-workers. I had the opportunity to serve the students, and I have two mentors.'' His mentors were the past two presidents of the Williamsburg institution--Drs. Jim Taylor and Jim Boswell. Both men saw extensive growth of the college over their tenure as president, which Colegrove credited to their vision for the future. His involvement with Leadership Tri-County, he said, has also taught him lessons--one being a book about leadership and the other being one of life's simplest but sometimes most difficult qualities--the art of listening. The book, Colegrove said, had five major areas to consider. ``Challenge the process,'' he said, ``then inspire and share the vision. You have to have a vision. Enable others to act, and model the way you want.'' The last aspect of that, he added, was to ``encourage the heart.'' Listening, he said, came not from his years of experience in the military or the collegiate arena, but more so from his own family. ``I don't know if Kimberly (Colegrove's only child) remembers this or not, but she was talking to me and I guess I drifted off in my own thoughts,'' he said. ``She squared me up--which in the Army is when you take someone's face in your hands. She turned my head so I was looking her straight in the eyes and she kept on talking. She showed me that I needed to listen to her.'' Oddly enough, Colegrove's second lesson came from Kimberly's son, William. ``William Joyce made this in a Sunday School class,'' Colegrove explained while he took out a handmade set of ears. ``It's a paper plate cut in two with a piece of pipe cleaner connecting it. The paper plate has two ears drawn on it and I guess the pipe cleaner is to do this.'' Putting the piece across his head, Colegrove demonstrated how the ``listening ears'' worked. Amid the laughter of the crowd, he reminded everyone that ``listening is an empowering ability.'' ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 44 (Monday, March 16, 2015)] [Senate] [Pages S1522-S1524] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] TRIBUTE TO DR.

BARROW,"[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 44 (Monday, March 16, 2015)] [Senate] [Pages S1524-S1525] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] REMEMBERING REVEREND WILLIE T. BARROW Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, last week Chicago--and America--lost a civil rights leader and an icon. Rev. Willie T. Barrow passed away at the age of 90. Known as the ``Little Warrior,'' Reverend Barrow stood up to anyone who would deny equality. In 1936, 10 years before the Montgomery bus boycott, 12-year-old Willie Barrow challenged the segregated Texas school system that refused to bus African-American kids to school. In a recent interview, Reverend Barrow described it this way. One day, Barrow had enough and confronted the bus driver and school officials. ``You got plenty room,'' Barrow said she told the bus driver and school officials. ``Why you want me to get off? Because I'm black? We got to change that.'' She was right. And from that moment, she dedicated her life to fighting [[Page S1525]] for social justice and standing up for the most vulnerable in our society. In 1945, she came to Chicago and worked as a youth minister and a field organizer with Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. At the height of the civil rights movement, she followed Dr. King to Atlanta, where she organized meetings, rallies and transportation for volunteers who came to participate in the marches and sit-ins. She also helped organize the 1963 march on Washington. Reverend Barrow didn't just fight for racial equality, she fought for women's rights, labor rights and gay rights too. While she helped Rev. Jesse Jackson start Operation Breadbasket on the South Side of Chicago, she was fighting sexism within the civil rights movement. During meetings, some even asked Reverend Jackson why he brought his secretary. But as Operation Breadbasket evolved into the Rainbow/PUSH Coalition, Reverend Barrow became the first woman to lead the organization. As the chairman of the board and CEO, Reverend Barrow brought women together from the Chicago Network--an organization comprised of Chicago's most distinguished professional women--to talk about their leadership roles and the underrepresentation of women on corporate boards. Around Chicago, she was known as ``godmother'' for the work she did with many young community activists--including Barack Obama. She took on causes ranging from AIDS awareness to traveling on missions of peace to Vietnam, Russia, Nicaragua, Cuba and South Africa when Nelson Mandela was released from prison. Last Sunday, 70,000 people gathered in Selma, AL, to remember and celebrate the civil rights leaders who marched 50 years ago. Sadly, Reverend Barrow couldn't be there. But 50 years ago, Reverend Barrow was on the front lines, marching alongside Dr. King and future Congressman John Lewis. Years ago, I made the trip to Selma and stood on the Edmund Pettus Bridge where Reverend Barrow marched and John Lewis was beaten unconscious and nearly killed by Alabama State troopers. It was profoundly moving to see the places where leaders like these risked their lives to redeem the promises of America for all of us. And it's because of civil rights leaders like Reverend Barrow that our Nation has made progress in the pursuit of social justice. But we know that bridges run both ways. We can move ahead, or we can turn back. Without the courage, the leadership, and the determination of Rev. Willie T. Barrow, the fight to move forward just got a little harder. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 44 (Monday, March 16, 2015)] [Senate] [Pages S1524-S1525] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] REMEMBERING REVEREND WILLIE T.

In 1945, she came to Chicago and worked as a youth minister and a field organizer with Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. At the height of the civil rights movement, she followed Dr. King to Atlanta, where she organized meetings, rallies and transportation for volunteers who came to participate in the marches and sit-ins. She also helped organize the 1963 march on Washington. Reverend Barrow didn't just fight for racial equality, she fought for women's rights, labor rights and gay rights too. While she helped Rev. Jesse Jackson start Operation Breadbasket on the South Side of Chicago, she was fighting sexism within the civil rights movement. During meetings, some even asked Reverend Jackson why he brought his secretary. But as Operation Breadbasket evolved into the Rainbow/PUSH Coalition, Reverend Barrow became the first woman to lead the organization. As the chairman of the board and CEO, Reverend Barrow brought women together from the Chicago Network--an organization comprised of Chicago's most distinguished professional women--to talk about their leadership roles and the underrepresentation of women on corporate boards. Around Chicago, she was known as ``godmother'' for the work she did with many young community activists--including Barack Obama. She took on causes ranging from AIDS awareness to traveling on missions of peace to Vietnam, Russia, Nicaragua, Cuba and South Africa when Nelson Mandela was released from prison. Last Sunday, 70,000 people gathered in Selma, AL, to remember and celebrate the civil rights leaders who marched 50 years ago. Sadly, Reverend Barrow couldn't be there. But 50 years ago, Reverend Barrow was on the front lines, marching alongside Dr. King and future Congressman John Lewis. Years ago, I made the trip to Selma and stood on the Edmund Pettus Bridge where Reverend Barrow marched and John Lewis was beaten unconscious and nearly killed by Alabama State troopers. It was profoundly moving to see the places where leaders like these risked their lives to redeem the promises of America for all of us. And it's because of civil rights leaders like Reverend Barrow that our Nation has made progress in the pursuit of social justice. But we know that bridges run both ways. We can move ahead, or we can turn back. Without the courage, the leadership, and the determination of Rev. Willie T. Barrow, the fight to move forward just got a little harder. ____________________",package_114_109.csv,3536,3536,3603,"[congressional record volume 161, number 44 (monday, march 16, 2015)] [senate] [pages s1524-s1525] from the congressional record online through the government publishing office [ www.gpo.gov ] remembering reverend willie t. barrow mr. durbin. mr. president, last week chicago--and america--lost a civil rights leader and an icon. rev. willie t. barrow passed away at the age of 90. known as the ``little warrior,'' reverend barrow stood up to anyone who would deny equality. in 1936, 10 years before the montgomery bus boycott, 12-year-old willie barrow challenged the segregated texas school system that refused to bus african-american kids to school. in a recent interview, reverend barrow described it this way. one day, barrow had enough and confronted the bus driver and school officials. ``you got plenty room,'' barrow said she told the bus driver and school officials. ``why you want me to get off? because i'm black? we got to change that.'' she was right. and from that moment, she dedicated her life to fighting [[page s1525]] for social justice and standing up for the most vulnerable in our society. in 1945, she came to chicago and worked as a youth minister and a field organizer with dr. martin luther king, jr. at the height of the civil rights movement, she followed dr. king to atlanta, where she organized meetings, rallies and transportation for volunteers who came to participate in the marches and sit-ins. she also helped organize the 1963 march on washington. reverend barrow didn't just fight for racial equality, she fought for women's rights, labor rights and gay rights too. while she helped rev. jesse jackson start operation breadbasket on the south side of chicago, she was fighting sexism within the civil rights movement. during meetings, some even asked reverend jackson why he brought his secretary. but as operation breadbasket evolved into the rainbow/push coalition, reverend barrow became the first woman to lead the organization. as the chairman of the board and ceo, reverend barrow brought women together from the chicago network--an organization comprised of chicago's most distinguished professional women--to talk about their leadership roles and the underrepresentation of women on corporate boards. around chicago, she was known as ``godmother'' for the work she did with many young community activists--including barack obama. she took on causes ranging from aids awareness to traveling on missions of peace to vietnam, russia, nicaragua, cuba and south africa when nelson mandela was released from prison. last sunday, 70,000 people gathered in selma, al, to remember and celebrate the civil rights leaders who marched 50 years ago. sadly, reverend barrow couldn't be there. but 50 years ago, reverend barrow was on the front lines, marching alongside dr. king and future congressman john lewis. years ago, i made the trip to selma and stood on the edmund pettus bridge where reverend barrow marched and john lewis was beaten unconscious and nearly killed by alabama state troopers. it was profoundly moving to see the places where leaders like these risked their lives to redeem the promises of america for all of us. and it's because of civil rights leaders like reverend barrow that our nation has made progress in the pursuit of social justice. but we know that bridges run both ways. we can move ahead, or we can turn back. without the courage, the leadership, and the determination of rev. willie t. barrow, the fight to move forward just got a little harder. ____________________",3536

Mr. President, I rise to recognize and congratulate the Aviation Museum of Kentucky, the official aviation museum of the Commonwealth, on the occasion of its 20th anniversary. The museum, located at 4316 Hangar Drive at the Blue Grass Airport in Lexington, KY, first opened its doors on April 15, 1995. The Aviation Museum of Kentucky has welcomed guests from all 50 States and from over 80 foreign countries. It serves as an educational and cultural resource for my State and for the Nation, focusing on aviation history and the important roles many Kentuckians have played in it. The museum's exhibits attract approximately 10,000 students each year to learn about the science of flight. Through the study of aviation, students learn about math, physics, geography, and more. They also learn about the history of aviation. The museum educates young people about potential careers in aviation and the importance of the aviation industry, which supports thousands of jobs in Kentucky. Pilots, mechanics, engineers, flight controllers, meteorologists, and more are all spotlighted. The Aviation Museum of Kentucky holds summer camps to give 10- to 15- year-old Kentuckians a hands-on introduction to flight. To date, they have engaged with over 5,000 youth to help them explore aviation, aerospace, and the possibility of productive and fulfilling careers in the field. Students learn from professional educators and go aloft with licensed instructors. And thanks to the museum's scholarship program, nearly one-third of all campers attend at no charge. In 1996, the Aviation Museum established the Kentucky Aviation Hall of Fame to recognize famous Kentuckians in aviation. To date, 45 Kentuckians have been honored. The Hall of Fame pays homage to Kentuckians like Matthew Sellers of Carter County, who gave us retractable landing gear; Solomon Van Meter of Lexington, who gave us the lifesaving pack parachute; and Noel Parrish of Versailles, who flew with the legendary Tuskegee Airmen. The museum also hosts historic aviation events, giving the public the chance to see in person restored and vintage aircraft. Thousands each year come to view them. And the museum hosts quarterly lectures with speakers from around the world who come to share their stories. The Aviation Museum of Kentucky was founded by the Kentucky Aviation Roundtable, a group of aviation enthusiasts that was first organized in 1978 in Lexington. The group worked for nearly two decades to see the dream of an aviation museum become reality, and now the Aviation Museum of Kentucky is a great asset to the State, to the industry, and to the Nation. So I ask my colleagues to join me in congratulating the Aviation Museum of Kentucky and the many fine Kentuckians who run and support it. I am proud of all they have achieved in 20 years, and I look forward to many more years of excellence from this unique Kentucky institution. I wish the Aviation Museum of Kentucky many more years of continued success. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 44 (Monday, March 16, 2015)] [Senate] [Page S1524] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] RECOGNIZING THE AVIATION MUSEUM OF KENTUCKY Mr. McCONNELL.

Mr. President, I have spoken many times on the Senate floor in defense of press freedom because it is a fundamental cornerstone of a democratic society. Today I want to briefly draw the Senate's attention to the situation in Turkey, one of the many countries in the world where this basic right is under threat by officials in the government who seek to silence their critics. Recently, in the latest assault on press freedom, Turkish police arrested and detained nearly two dozen members of the news media, including Ekrem Dumanli and Hidayet Karaca, two prominent journalists who are well known to be affiliated with Fethullah Gulen, a vocal critic of President Erdogan. The sweeping charges levied against them were not only intended to stop their criticism, but to intimidate anyone who is critical of the Turkish Government. While Mr. Dumanli has since been released, Mr. Karaca remains in prison. This case reflects a broader pattern of repression in Turkey, where targeted reprisals against outspoken critics have become a common practice for that government. In fact, Reporters Without Borders ranked Turkey 154 out of 180 nations for press freedom in its 2014 World Press Freedom Index, and Turkey has consistently been among the top jailers of journalists, along with China and Iran. This latest censorship continues the abuse of the Turkish penal code and further erodes what remains of press freedom in Turkey. Not only are these actions inconsistent with the norms and values expected of Turkey, a NATO ally; they violate Turkey's own commitments under international law, foment further dissent, and serve to affirm the allegations being made against the Erdogan administration. I am disappointed with the backsliding from democracy that we have seen in Turkey, and I am concerned that it will weaken our important strategic partnership in the region. I join the many government officials, advocates, journalists and others who have called for a prompt resolution of these cases, and an end to the Turkish Government's jailing of people for exercising their right to free expression. The international community and people of good will everywhere expect better from the government of that great nation. The people of Turkey deserve better. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 44 (Monday, March 16, 2015)] [Senate] [Page S1525] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] ASSAULT ON PRESS FREEDOM IN TURKEY Mr. LEAHY.

CREC-2015-03-16-pt1-PgS1525-2,CREC-2015-03-16,114,"150TH ANNIVERSARY OF BURLINGTON, VERMONT POLICE DEPARTMENT","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 44 (Monday, March 16, 2015)] [Senate] [Pages S1525-S1526] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] 150TH ANNIVERSARY OF BURLINGTON, VERMONT POLICE DEPARTMENT Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, next week I will join many Vermonters to celebrate the 150th anniversary of the Burlington Police Department, which was established in early 1865 with the appointment of the city's first constable, Luman A. Drew. For the sake of historical perspective: Mr. Drew was chosen for this high post after his service in the pursuit and capture of a group of Confederate cavalrymen who had raided nearby St. Albans, robbing its banks and burning its buildings before fleeing toward Canada. For many months now, Burlington Detective Jeffrey Beerworth has been compiling that bit of history and other stories in his research of the department's history, and his vignettes are both entertaining and informative. They are particularly interesting to me, as I reflect on my work as a prosecutor with law enforcement agencies in Burlington and other communities as State's attorney for Chittenden County earlier in my career. Most importantly, they show us how the role of law enforcement officers has evolved over the years. I imagine that First Constable Drew could not have foreseen police wearing body cameras in 2015, nor would he recognize the challenges that heroin and other drugs pose to our society. Back in his day, First Constable Drew's main concerns were horse theft and public drunkenness. A visit to the Burlington Police Department website today offers a glimpse of the many investigative units, programs and community outreach services that fall under today's rubric of police work. I am proud of the efforts of Police Chief Michael Schirling and his team in connecting one-on-one with the residents of Burlington. Community policing is alive and well in Vermont's largest city, and other departments around the country could learn much from what Burlington has done. The Junior Community Police Academy creates relationships among police officers and the city's youths, who someday may become officers themselves. In partnering with the Howard Center, officers work with the Street Outreach Team to support those with psychiatric and substance abuse issues, or those who cope with homelessness or other behavioral challenges. These cases traditionally account for a large percentage of police calls, yet this innovative program allows for trained professionals to address social service needs and allow police officers to focus on public safety. The Daily Activity Log of the Burlington Police Department offers a glimpse of the range and volume of calls to which today's officers must respond. In a recent 2-day period, 223 records were logged, ranging from the minor to the tragic. Of course, there are many that are recorded simply as ``traffic stops,'' but we know that every traffic stop has the potential for the unknown. That is why I have worked hard over many years to support these officers by providing Federal funds for bulletproof vests. Officers need this protection and deserve nothing less. Chief Schirling has laid out a series of upcoming events to mark the department's 150 years of service. These will include a community barbecue and open house, along with his monthly ``Coffees with the Chief.'' This is all in keeping with his vision of community policing, and this celebration will be shared by all who benefit from the work of a highly professional and dedicated police force. [[Page S1526]] On this historic occasion, I thank Chief Schirling and the entire Burlington Police Department for their continued service and dedication, upholding a long and valued tradition. The Queen City is most fortunate for their service. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 44 (Monday, March 16, 2015)] [Senate] [Pages S1525-S1526] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] 150TH ANNIVERSARY OF BURLINGTON, VERMONT POLICE DEPARTMENT Mr. LEAHY.

Mr. President, next week I will join many Vermonters to celebrate the 150th anniversary of the Burlington Police Department, which was established in early 1865 with the appointment of the city's first constable, Luman A. Drew. For the sake of historical perspective: Mr. Drew was chosen for this high post after his service in the pursuit and capture of a group of Confederate cavalrymen who had raided nearby St. Albans, robbing its banks and burning its buildings before fleeing toward Canada. For many months now, Burlington Detective Jeffrey Beerworth has been compiling that bit of history and other stories in his research of the department's history, and his vignettes are both entertaining and informative. They are particularly interesting to me, as I reflect on my work as a prosecutor with law enforcement agencies in Burlington and other communities as State's attorney for Chittenden County earlier in my career. Most importantly, they show us how the role of law enforcement officers has evolved over the years. I imagine that First Constable Drew could not have foreseen police wearing body cameras in 2015, nor would he recognize the challenges that heroin and other drugs pose to our society. Back in his day, First Constable Drew's main concerns were horse theft and public drunkenness. A visit to the Burlington Police Department website today offers a glimpse of the many investigative units, programs and community outreach services that fall under today's rubric of police work. I am proud of the efforts of Police Chief Michael Schirling and his team in connecting one-on-one with the residents of Burlington. Community policing is alive and well in Vermont's largest city, and other departments around the country could learn much from what Burlington has done. The Junior Community Police Academy creates relationships among police officers and the city's youths, who someday may become officers themselves. In partnering with the Howard Center, officers work with the Street Outreach Team to support those with psychiatric and substance abuse issues, or those who cope with homelessness or other behavioral challenges. These cases traditionally account for a large percentage of police calls, yet this innovative program allows for trained professionals to address social service needs and allow police officers to focus on public safety. The Daily Activity Log of the Burlington Police Department offers a glimpse of the range and volume of calls to which today's officers must respond. In a recent 2-day period, 223 records were logged, ranging from the minor to the tragic. Of course, there are many that are recorded simply as ``traffic stops,'' but we know that every traffic stop has the potential for the unknown.

Mr. President, It is a great honor for me to pay tribute to a great Georgian and a great friend, Wayne Mason. It is Wayne's 75th birthday, and for a minute I want to share with the Senate the greatest example I know of how much difference one man can make. I would not be where I am today and Gwinnett County--one of America's most dynamic counties--would not be what it is today were it not for the support and leadership of Wayne Mason. Wayne is generous in giving back to his community and passionate in his love of country. A successful real estate developer, Wayne has said he lives for the deal and will die seeking his final one. Wayne began a life of hard work and deal-making as a boy by plowing his family's gardens with a one-eyed mule, and he honed his marketing skills by selling eggs and Christmas wreaths. A clever young man, Wayne understood what was needed in a budding community and he opened many of the entities needed to develop one--including a bonding company, ceramic tile store, funeral home, liquor store and a bank. Between 1959 and 1972, he built 1,800 homes in the growing community of Snellville, GA, and by that time, he was a millionaire. Wayne didn't stop building his community credentials there. He became chairman of the Gwinnett County Commission in 1977 and served in that capacity until 1981. Wayne's successful [[Page S1527]] development and investment projects in Gwinnett County include names and places all metro Atlantans know such as Discover Mills and The Villages at Global Forum. He also served as a member of the Atlanta Regional Commission, which is the regional planning and intergovernmental coordination agency for much of the metro Atlanta area. Another area he conquered in more recent years that is also essential for a thriving community is higher education. It has also become a particular passion and point of pride for Wayne in the form of Georgia Gwinnett College, which he helped to make a reality. In 1994, Gwinnett County was the largest county east of the Mississippi without a 4-year college. So Wayne and a group of leaders in Gwinnett County purchased 160 acres of land in Lawrenceville, GA, and designated it specifically for the development of a college campus. Georgia Gwinnett College opened its doors in 2006 as the first 4-year college founded in Georgia in more than 100 years, and the first 4-year, public college created in the U.S. in the 21st century. In less than 10 years, Georgia Gwinnett College's enrollment is approaching 11,000 students and Wayne still serves on the college foundation's board. Wayne Mason is the foundation upon which Gwinnett County's success is based. So I want to wish happy birthday to a great Georgian and friend. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 44 (Monday, March 16, 2015)] [Senate] [Pages S1526-S1527] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] TRIBUTE TO WAYNE MASON Mr. ISAKSON.

He also served as a member of the Atlanta Regional Commission, which is the regional planning and intergovernmental coordination agency for much of the metro Atlanta area. Another area he conquered in more recent years that is also essential for a thriving community is higher education. It has also become a particular passion and point of pride for Wayne in the form of Georgia Gwinnett College, which he helped to make a reality. In 1994, Gwinnett County was the largest county east of the Mississippi without a 4-year college. So Wayne and a group of leaders in Gwinnett County purchased 160 acres of land in Lawrenceville, GA, and designated it specifically for the development of a college campus. Georgia Gwinnett College opened its doors in 2006 as the first 4-year college founded in Georgia in more than 100 years, and the first 4-year, public college created in the U.S. in the 21st century. In less than 10 years, Georgia Gwinnett College's enrollment is approaching 11,000 students and Wayne still serves on the college foundation's board. Wayne Mason is the foundation upon which Gwinnett County's success is based. So I want to wish happy birthday to a great Georgian and friend. ____________________",package_114_109.csv,2972,2972,3039,"[congressional record volume 161, number 44 (monday, march 16, 2015)] [senate] [pages s1526-s1527] from the congressional record online through the government publishing office [ www.gpo.gov ] tribute to wayne mason mr. isakson. mr. president, it is a great honor for me to pay tribute to a great georgian and a great friend, wayne mason. it is wayne's 75th birthday, and for a minute i want to share with the senate the greatest example i know of how much difference one man can make. i would not be where i am today and gwinnett county--one of america's most dynamic counties--would not be what it is today were it not for the support and leadership of wayne mason. wayne is generous in giving back to his community and passionate in his love of country. a successful real estate developer, wayne has said he lives for the deal and will die seeking his final one. wayne began a life of hard work and deal-making as a boy by plowing his family's gardens with a one-eyed mule, and he honed his marketing skills by selling eggs and christmas wreaths. a clever young man, wayne understood what was needed in a budding community and he opened many of the entities needed to develop one--including a bonding company, ceramic tile store, funeral home, liquor store and a bank. between 1959 and 1972, he built 1,800 homes in the growing community of snellville, ga, and by that time, he was a millionaire. wayne didn't stop building his community credentials there. he became chairman of the gwinnett county commission in 1977 and served in that capacity until 1981. wayne's successful [[page s1527]] development and investment projects in gwinnett county include names and places all metro atlantans know such as discover mills and the villages at global forum. he also served as a member of the atlanta regional commission, which is the regional planning and intergovernmental coordination agency for much of the metro atlanta area. another area he conquered in more recent years that is also essential for a thriving community is higher education. it has also become a particular passion and point of pride for wayne in the form of georgia gwinnett college, which he helped to make a reality. in 1994, gwinnett county was the largest county east of the mississippi without a 4-year college. so wayne and a group of leaders in gwinnett county purchased 160 acres of land in lawrenceville, ga, and designated it specifically for the development of a college campus. georgia gwinnett college opened its doors in 2006 as the first 4-year college founded in georgia in more than 100 years, and the first 4-year, public college created in the u.s. in the 21st century. in less than 10 years, georgia gwinnett college's enrollment is approaching 11,000 students and wayne still serves on the college foundation's board. wayne mason is the foundation upon which gwinnett county's success is based. so i want to wish happy birthday to a great georgian and friend. ____________________",2972

Mr. President, it is with great admiration that I wish to recognize the laudable achievements of Protectors of Animals, a wonderful and innovative no-kill rescue and shelter organization based in East Hartford, CT. I am proud to highlight the occasion of their 40th Anniversary, and I wish to convey my deepest congratulations to them on this auspicious occasion. Protectors of Animals was founded in 1975 by a group of dedicated individuals brought together by their shared love for animals and commitment to animal welfare. Two of these individuals, Dru Harder and Phyllis Pavel, truly started off at the grassroots level, knocking on doors in their community in Portland, CT, in order to raise awareness and funds for their local pound. Over the years, Protectors of Animals' passion and tireless fight against animal cruelty has led them to great successes and enabled them to save countless abandoned and abused animals from being euthanized. They have also aided more than 14,000 cats and 7,000 dogs in finding caring homes across our State. The dedicated staff and volunteers at Protectors of Animals not only give animals shelter but help them to heal from past trauma and allow them to recreate caring relationships with humans that are built on trust. It is no surprise that this work has garnered deep and abiding support from animal lovers around Connecticut. This joint effort, backed by genuine values of humaneness and caring, has allowed them to meet the highest standards of accountability, as well as program and cost effectiveness. Protectors of Animals has been recognized by the Independent Charities of America with that organization's ``Best in America'' seal of approval, which is offered to a select few of the highest performing nonprofits in our Nation. Having personally supported Protectors of Animals over the years, I can attest to the devotion, commitment, and enthusiasm of everyone involved with their organization. I know how hard their founders, board of directors, staff, and volunteers have worked to support these goals. For its legacy of safeguarding animals and combating cruelty, I am proud to congratulate and celebrate Protectors of Animals on its 40th anniversary. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 44 (Monday, March 16, 2015)] [Senate] [Page S1526] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS ______ RECOGNIZING PROTECTORS OF ANIMALS Mr. BLUMENTHAL.

BARBARA WOODLEE,"[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 44 (Monday, March 16, 2015)] [Senate] [Page S1527] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] RECOGNIZING ELLEN GOLDEN AND DR. BARBARA WOODLEE Mr. KING. Mr. President, I wish to honor two remarkable women, Ellen Golden and Dr. Barbara Woodlee, who are new inductees to the Maine Women's Hall of Fame. Like all members of this prestigious group, Ellen and Barbara have had a tremendous impact on the lives of family and friends in their communities and on women throughout the State of Maine. Indeed, to be considered for the Maine Women's Hall of Fame, nominees' achievements must have had significant statewide impact, must have improved the lives of women in Maine, and must have made contributions with enduring value for women. I am pleased to say that Ellen and Barbara have not only met these criteria, they have far exceeded them. Ellen Golden, from Woolwich, ME, is the senior vice president and founder of the Women's Business Center at Coastal Enterprises, Inc., CEI. She has played a leading role in supporting women business owners and microenterprise growth through research, policy, and program development. She has also been at the forefront of expanding small business opportunities for minorities and immigrants in Maine. Ellen's efforts through CEI and a number of other boards and civic organizations have provided financial and career possibilities that would otherwise have been unavailable to many Mainers. Ellen's work truly embodies the spirit of American opportunity. Dr. Barbara Woodlee, from Vassalboro, ME, was the president of Kennebec Valley Community College in Fairfield, ME for nearly 30 years. A trailblazer in her field, she served as the first woman president within the Maine Community College System. Throughout her presidency, Barbara strove to increase educational opportunities for Maine women by developing programs, particularly in the health care field, that met the needs of the many women who used the college to launch their careers. Her efforts to open up opportunities for women to access higher education, and the well-paying jobs that come with it, are commendable. But it is not just women at the college who have benefited from her work; thanks to her, Maine community college students pay the lowest in-state tuition and fees in all of New England. She kept costs low while facing difficult budget challenges--a task with which we here in Congress can sympathize. Congratulations to both Ellen and Barbara for their induction into the Maine Women's Hall of Fame. With this well-deserved honor, they join the likes of Senator Margaret Chase Smith, who in 1950 courageously stood here, on the Senate floor, to denounce McCarthyism. I thank Ellen and Barbara for all that they have done for Maine women and for our State as a whole. Maine is fortunate to have such tireless advocates promoting education and fighting for economic opportunity. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 44 (Monday, March 16, 2015)] [Senate] [Page S1527] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] RECOGNIZING ELLEN GOLDEN AND DR.

Mr. President, I wish to congratulate the Wells National Estuarine Research Reserve and Laudholm Trust on the completion of the final stage of their solar energy project. On March 20, 2015, they will officially finish the project and be 100 percent energy self-sufficient. They are the first nonprofit organization in Maine to reach this milestone. The solar array project represents only the most recent environmental conservation landmark on the Wells Reserve. In fact, the land on which the Wells Reserve sits has been a key link between the community and the environment for not just decades but centuries. It was settled for farming in 1643 and was the largest saltwater farm in York County at one time, shipping its products to Boston weekly. By 1978, the farm was derelict, but devoted community members decided to join together to revitalize it. Laudholm Trust was soon born from that initiative. Officially established in 1982, the Laudholm Trust has been a vital supporter of stewardship, research, and education efforts surrounding Maine's coastal communities, enabling the success of the Wells Reserve. Due in part to the Trust's efforts, the 2,250 acres of farmland were designated a National Estuarine Research Reserve in 1984. The solar array project is an outstanding example of what can be accomplished when stakeholders at all levels work together. The $200,000 in funding to purchase the solar panels was made possible by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Association, NOAA, the Mattina R. Proctor Foundation, the Davis Conservation Foundation, the Town of Wells, Efficiency Maine, and, of course, Wells Reserve and Laudholm members. A Maine company, Revision Energy of Portland, ME, installed the array. Through the hard work of this community, the project was completed a full two years ahead of schedule. For such a significant project to be finished years ahead of schedule proves the dedication of the organizations and individuals involved with completing this venture. The local initiative and collaboration demonstrated on the Wells Reserve for this project represents the very best of Maine community moxie. On the occasion of the completion of the Wells Reserve and Laudholm Trust solar array, I extend my congratulations to the two leading organizations and all those involved in making the project possible. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 44 (Monday, March 16, 2015)] [Senate] [Page S1527] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] CONGRATULATING THE WELLS RESERVE AND LAUDHOLM TRUST Mr. KING.

CREC-2015-03-16-pt1-PgS1530-2,CREC-2015-03-16,114,Introductory Statement on S. 741,"[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 44 (Monday, March 16, 2015)] [Senate] [Pages S1530-S1531] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] By Mr. CARDIN (for himself, Mrs. Boxer, and Mr. Reid): S. 741. A bill to authorize the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency to establish a program of awarding grants to owners or operators of water systems to increase the resiliency or adaptability of the systems to any ongoing or forecasted changes to the hydrologic conditions of a region of the United States; to the Committee on Environment and Public Works. Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I come to the floor today to introduce the Water Infrastructure Resiliency and Sustainability Act with colleagues the Democratic Leader and the Ranking Member of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee. The condition of our water infrastructure is in a state of crisis that is only exacerbated by the effects of climate change. The longer we ignore the problem, the more it costs us. The truth is that we are in a crisis that can be averted. There is no need to lose revenue from disrupted business and flooded streets. Our water infrastructure may be buried and out of sight and out of mind; but today we must elevate these systems to the priority level they deserve. Each year within my home State of Maryland I witness stark reminders of what cities across the nation are facing. In July of last year, Prince George's County, Maryland, experienced a breakdown of its most essential public infrastructure when a water main serving 100,000 people began to fail. Mandatory water restrictions were instituted, limiting access to water for homes and businesses during an intense heat wave that saw the heat index repeatedly reach the triple digits. At the National Harbor, one hotel evacuated three thousand guests and was forced to cancel upcoming reservations. Included in the affected area is Joint Base Andrews, which publicized plans to shut down a long list of services, including appointments at its medical center. There are incidents like this happening across America. The reports are startling. They confirm what every water utility professional knows: we need massive reinvestment in our water infrastructure now and over the coming decades. The Nation's drinking water infrastructure-- especially the underground pipes that deliver safe drinking water to America's homes and businesses--is aging. Like many of the roads, bridges, and other public assets on which the country relies, most of our buried drinking water infrastructure was built 50 or more years ago, in the post-World War II era of rapid demographic change and economic growth. Some of our systems are even older; in Baltimore, where I live, many of the pipes were installed in the 1800s. Some of these ``pipes'' are wooden. We need investment to deal with changing population needs and changing hydrological conditions. We have no other choice but to elevate it to a public safety priority and to take action now. The Water Infrastructure Resiliency and Sustainability Act aims to help local communities meet the challenges of upgrading water infrastructure systems to meet the hydrological changes we are seeing today. The bill directs the EPA to establish a Water Infrastructure Resiliency and Sustainability program. Grants will be awarded to eligible water systems to make the necessary upgrades. Communities across the country will be able to compete for Federal matching funds, which in turn will help finance projects to help communities overcome these threats. Improving water conservation, adjustments to current infrastructure systems, and funding programs to stabilize communities' existing water supply are all projects WIRS grants will fund. WIRS will never grant more than 50 percent of any project's cost, ensuring cooperation between local communities and the federal government. The EPA will try to award funds that use new and innovative ideas as often as possible. It is estimated that by 2020, the forecasted deficit for sustaining water delivery and wastewater treatment infrastructure, will trigger a $206 billion increase in costs for businesses. In a worst case scenario, a lack of water infrastructure investment will cause the United States to lose nearly 700,000 jobs by 2020. A healthy water infrastructure system is as important to America's economy as paved roads and sturdy bridges. Water and wastewater investment has been shown to spur economic growth. The U.S. Conference of Mayors has found that for every dollar invested in water infrastructure, the Gross Domestic Product is increased to more than $6. The Department of Commerce has found that that same dollar yields close to $3 worth of economic output in other industries. Every job created in local water and sewer industries creates close to four jobs elsewhere in the national economy. We know that a reactive mode causes us to lose billions in revenue in the short-term. Let us instead take a proactive approach, making strategic investments in innovative projects designed to meet the current and future needs of our water systems. That is the purpose of the Water Infrastructure Resiliency and Sustainability Act. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record. There being no objection the text of the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows: S. 741 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, SECTION 1.

The truth is that we are in a crisis that can be averted. There is no need to lose revenue from disrupted business and flooded streets. Our water infrastructure may be buried and out of sight and out of mind; but today we must elevate these systems to the priority level they deserve. Each year within my home State of Maryland I witness stark reminders of what cities across the nation are facing. In July of last year, Prince George's County, Maryland, experienced a breakdown of its most essential public infrastructure when a water main serving 100,000 people began to fail. Mandatory water restrictions were instituted, limiting access to water for homes and businesses during an intense heat wave that saw the heat index repeatedly reach the triple digits. At the National Harbor, one hotel evacuated three thousand guests and was forced to cancel upcoming reservations. Included in the affected area is Joint Base Andrews, which publicized plans to shut down a long list of services, including appointments at its medical center. There are incidents like this happening across America. The reports are startling. They confirm what every water utility professional knows: we need massive reinvestment in our water infrastructure now and over the coming decades. The Nation's drinking water infrastructure-- especially the underground pipes that deliver safe drinking water to America's homes and businesses--is aging. Like many of the roads, bridges, and other public assets on which the country relies, most of our buried drinking water infrastructure was built 50 or more years ago, in the post-World War II era of rapid demographic change and economic growth. Some of our systems are even older; in Baltimore, where I live, many of the pipes were installed in the 1800s. Some of these ``pipes'' are wooden. We need investment to deal with changing population needs and changing hydrological conditions. We have no other choice but to elevate it to a public safety priority and to take action now. The Water Infrastructure Resiliency and Sustainability Act aims to help local communities meet the challenges of upgrading water infrastructure systems to meet the hydrological changes we are seeing today. The bill directs the EPA to establish a Water Infrastructure Resiliency and Sustainability program. Grants will be awarded to eligible water systems to make the necessary upgrades. Communities across the country will be able to compete for Federal matching funds, which in turn will help finance projects to help communities overcome these threats. Improving water conservation, adjustments to current infrastructure systems, and funding programs to stabilize communities' existing water supply are all projects WIRS grants will fund. WIRS will never grant more than 50 percent of any project's cost, ensuring cooperation between local communities and the federal government. The EPA will try to award funds that use new and innovative ideas as often as possible. It is estimated that by 2020, the forecasted deficit for sustaining water delivery and wastewater treatment infrastructure, will trigger a $206 billion increase in costs for businesses. In a worst case scenario, a lack of water infrastructure investment will cause the United States to lose nearly 700,000 jobs by 2020. A healthy water infrastructure system is as important to America's economy as paved roads and sturdy bridges. Water and wastewater investment has been shown to spur economic growth. The U.S. Conference of Mayors has found that for every dollar invested in water infrastructure, the Gross Domestic Product is increased to more than $6. The Department of Commerce has found that that same dollar yields close to $3 worth of economic output in other industries. Every job created in local water and sewer industries creates close to four jobs elsewhere in the national economy. We know that a reactive mode causes us to lose billions in revenue in the short-term. Let us instead take a proactive approach, making strategic investments in innovative projects designed to meet the current and future needs of our water systems. That is the purpose of the Water Infrastructure Resiliency and Sustainability Act. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record. There being no objection the text of the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows: S. 741 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, SECTION 1.

A bill to authorize the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency to establish a program of awarding grants to owners or operators of water systems to increase the resiliency or adaptability of the systems to any ongoing or forecasted changes to the hydrologic conditions of a region of the United States; to the Committee on Environment and Public Works. Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I come to the floor today to introduce the Water Infrastructure Resiliency and Sustainability Act with colleagues the Democratic Leader and the Ranking Member of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee. The condition of our water infrastructure is in a state of crisis that is only exacerbated by the effects of climate change. The longer we ignore the problem, the more it costs us. The truth is that we are in a crisis that can be averted. There is no need to lose revenue from disrupted business and flooded streets. Our water infrastructure may be buried and out of sight and out of mind; but today we must elevate these systems to the priority level they deserve. Each year within my home State of Maryland I witness stark reminders of what cities across the nation are facing. In July of last year, Prince George's County, Maryland, experienced a breakdown of its most essential public infrastructure when a water main serving 100,000 people began to fail. Mandatory water restrictions were instituted, limiting access to water for homes and businesses during an intense heat wave that saw the heat index repeatedly reach the triple digits. At the National Harbor, one hotel evacuated three thousand guests and was forced to cancel upcoming reservations. Included in the affected area is Joint Base Andrews, which publicized plans to shut down a long list of services, including appointments at its medical center. There are incidents like this happening across America. The reports are startling. They confirm what every water utility professional knows: we need massive reinvestment in our water infrastructure now and over the coming decades. The Nation's drinking water infrastructure-- especially the underground pipes that deliver safe drinking water to America's homes and businesses--is aging. Like many of the roads, bridges, and other public assets on which the country relies, most of our buried drinking water infrastructure was built 50 or more years ago, in the post-World War II era of rapid demographic change and economic growth. Some of our systems are even older; in Baltimore, where I live, many of the pipes were installed in the 1800s. Some of these ``pipes'' are wooden. We need investment to deal with changing population needs and changing hydrological conditions. We have no other choice but to elevate it to a public safety priority and to take action now. The Water Infrastructure Resiliency and Sustainability Act aims to help local communities meet the challenges of upgrading water infrastructure systems to meet the hydrological changes we are seeing today. The bill directs the EPA to establish a Water Infrastructure Resiliency and Sustainability program. Grants will be awarded to eligible water systems to make the necessary upgrades. Communities across the country will be able to compete for Federal matching funds, which in turn will help finance projects to help communities overcome these threats. Improving water conservation, adjustments to current infrastructure systems, and funding programs to stabilize communities' existing water supply are all projects WIRS grants will fund. WIRS will never grant more than 50 percent of any project's cost, ensuring cooperation between local communities and the federal government. The EPA will try to award funds that use new and innovative ideas as often as possible. It is estimated that by 2020, the forecasted deficit for sustaining water delivery and wastewater treatment infrastructure, will trigger a $206 billion increase in costs for businesses. In a worst case scenario, a lack of water infrastructure investment will cause the United States to lose nearly 700,000 jobs by 2020. A healthy water infrastructure system is as important to America's economy as paved roads and sturdy bridges. Water and wastewater investment has been shown to spur economic growth. The U.S. Conference of Mayors has found that for every dollar invested in water infrastructure, the Gross Domestic Product is increased to more than $6. The Department of Commerce has found that that same dollar yields close to $3 worth of economic output in other industries. Every job created in local water and sewer industries creates close to four jobs elsewhere in the national economy. We know that a reactive mode causes us to lose billions in revenue in the short-term. Let us instead take a proactive approach, making strategic investments in innovative projects designed to meet the current and future needs of our water systems. That is the purpose of the Water Infrastructure Resiliency and Sustainability Act. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record. There being no objection the text of the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows: S. 741 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, SECTION 1.

A bill to authorize the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency to establish a program of awarding grants to owners or operators of water systems to increase the resiliency or adaptability of the systems to any ongoing or forecasted changes to the hydrologic conditions of a region of the United States; to the Committee on Environment and Public Works. Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I come to the floor today to introduce the Water Infrastructure Resiliency and Sustainability Act with colleagues the Democratic Leader and the Ranking Member of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee. The condition of our water infrastructure is in a state of crisis that is only exacerbated by the effects of climate change. The longer we ignore the problem, the more it costs us. The truth is that we are in a crisis that can be averted. There is no need to lose revenue from disrupted business and flooded streets. Our water infrastructure may be buried and out of sight and out of mind; but today we must elevate these systems to the priority level they deserve. Each year within my home State of Maryland I witness stark reminders of what cities across the nation are facing. In July of last year, Prince George's County, Maryland, experienced a breakdown of its most essential public infrastructure when a water main serving 100,000 people began to fail. Mandatory water restrictions were instituted, limiting access to water for homes and businesses during an intense heat wave that saw the heat index repeatedly reach the triple digits. At the National Harbor, one hotel evacuated three thousand guests and was forced to cancel upcoming reservations. Included in the affected area is Joint Base Andrews, which publicized plans to shut down a long list of services, including appointments at its medical center. There are incidents like this happening across America. The reports are startling. They confirm what every water utility professional knows: we need massive reinvestment in our water infrastructure now and over the coming decades. The Nation's drinking water infrastructure-- especially the underground pipes that deliver safe drinking water to America's homes and businesses--is aging. Like many of the roads, bridges, and other public assets on which the country relies, most of our buried drinking water infrastructure was built 50 or more years ago, in the post-World War II era of rapid demographic change and economic growth. Some of our systems are even older; in Baltimore, where I live, many of the pipes were installed in the 1800s. Some of these ``pipes'' are wooden. We need investment to deal with changing population needs and changing hydrological conditions. We have no other choice but to elevate it to a public safety priority and to take action now. The Water Infrastructure Resiliency and Sustainability Act aims to help local communities meet the challenges of upgrading water infrastructure systems to meet the hydrological changes we are seeing today. The bill directs the EPA to establish a Water Infrastructure Resiliency and Sustainability program. Grants will be awarded to eligible water systems to make the necessary upgrades. Communities across the country will be able to compete for Federal matching funds, which in turn will help finance projects to help communities overcome these threats. Improving water conservation, adjustments to current infrastructure systems, and funding programs to stabilize communities' existing water supply are all projects WIRS grants will fund. WIRS will never grant more than 50 percent of any project's cost, ensuring cooperation between local communities and the federal government. The EPA will try to award funds that use new and innovative ideas as often as possible. It is estimated that by 2020, the forecasted deficit for sustaining water delivery and wastewater treatment infrastructure, will trigger a $206 billion increase in costs for businesses. In a worst case scenario, a lack of water infrastructure investment will cause the United States to lose nearly 700,000 jobs by 2020. A healthy water infrastructure system is as important to America's economy as paved roads and sturdy bridges. Water and wastewater investment has been shown to spur economic growth. The U.S. Conference of Mayors has found that for every dollar invested in water infrastructure, the Gross Domestic Product is increased to more than $6. The Department of Commerce has found that that same dollar yields close to $3 worth of economic output in other industries. Every job created in local water and sewer industries creates close to four jobs elsewhere in the national economy. We know that a reactive mode causes us to lose billions in revenue in the short-term. Let us instead take a proactive approach, making strategic investments in innovative projects designed to meet the current and future needs of our water systems. That is the purpose of the Water Infrastructure Resiliency and Sustainability Act. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record. There being no objection the text of the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows: S. 741 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, SECTION 1.

A bill to authorize the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency to establish a program of awarding grants to owners or operators of water systems to increase the resiliency or adaptability of the systems to any ongoing or forecasted changes to the hydrologic conditions of a region of the United States; to the Committee on Environment and Public Works. Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I come to the floor today to introduce the Water Infrastructure Resiliency and Sustainability Act with colleagues the Democratic Leader and the Ranking Member of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee. The condition of our water infrastructure is in a state of crisis that is only exacerbated by the effects of climate change. The longer we ignore the problem, the more it costs us. The truth is that we are in a crisis that can be averted. There is no need to lose revenue from disrupted business and flooded streets. Our water infrastructure may be buried and out of sight and out of mind; but today we must elevate these systems to the priority level they deserve. Each year within my home State of Maryland I witness stark reminders of what cities across the nation are facing. In July of last year, Prince George's County, Maryland, experienced a breakdown of its most essential public infrastructure when a water main serving 100,000 people began to fail. Mandatory water restrictions were instituted, limiting access to water for homes and businesses during an intense heat wave that saw the heat index repeatedly reach the triple digits. At the National Harbor, one hotel evacuated three thousand guests and was forced to cancel upcoming reservations. Included in the affected area is Joint Base Andrews, which publicized plans to shut down a long list of services, including appointments at its medical center. There are incidents like this happening across America. The reports are startling. They confirm what every water utility professional knows: we need massive reinvestment in our water infrastructure now and over the coming decades. The Nation's drinking water infrastructure-- especially the underground pipes that deliver safe drinking water to America's homes and businesses--is aging. Like many of the roads, bridges, and other public assets on which the country relies, most of our buried drinking water infrastructure was built 50 or more years ago, in the post-World War II era of rapid demographic change and economic growth. Some of our systems are even older; in Baltimore, where I live, many of the pipes were installed in the 1800s. Some of these ``pipes'' are wooden. We need investment to deal with changing population needs and changing hydrological conditions. We have no other choice but to elevate it to a public safety priority and to take action now. The Water Infrastructure Resiliency and Sustainability Act aims to help local communities meet the challenges of upgrading water infrastructure systems to meet the hydrological changes we are seeing today. The bill directs the EPA to establish a Water Infrastructure Resiliency and Sustainability program. Grants will be awarded to eligible water systems to make the necessary upgrades. Communities across the country will be able to compete for Federal matching funds, which in turn will help finance projects to help communities overcome these threats. Improving water conservation, adjustments to current infrastructure systems, and funding programs to stabilize communities' existing water supply are all projects WIRS grants will fund. WIRS will never grant more than 50 percent of any project's cost, ensuring cooperation between local communities and the federal government. The EPA will try to award funds that use new and innovative ideas as often as possible. It is estimated that by 2020, the forecasted deficit for sustaining water delivery and wastewater treatment infrastructure, will trigger a $206 billion increase in costs for businesses. In a worst case scenario, a lack of water infrastructure investment will cause the United States to lose nearly 700,000 jobs by 2020. A healthy water infrastructure system is as important to America's economy as paved roads and sturdy bridges. Water and wastewater investment has been shown to spur economic growth. The U.S. Conference of Mayors has found that for every dollar invested in water infrastructure, the Gross Domestic Product is increased to more than $6. The Department of Commerce has found that that same dollar yields close to $3 worth of economic output in other industries. Every job created in local water and sewer industries creates close to four jobs elsewhere in the national economy. We know that a reactive mode causes us to lose billions in revenue in the short-term. Let us instead take a proactive approach, making strategic investments in innovative projects designed to meet the current and future needs of our water systems. That is the purpose of the Water Infrastructure Resiliency and Sustainability Act. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record. There being no objection the text of the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows: S. 741 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, SECTION 1.

to the committee on environment and public works. mr. cardin. mr. president, i come to the floor today to introduce the water infrastructure resiliency and sustainability act with colleagues the democratic leader and the ranking member of the senate environment and public works committee. the condition of our water infrastructure is in a state of crisis that is only exacerbated by the effects of climate change. the longer we ignore the problem, the more it costs us. the truth is that we are in a crisis that can be averted. there is no need to lose revenue from disrupted business and flooded streets. our water infrastructure may be buried and out of sight and out of mind; but today we must elevate these systems to the priority level they deserve. each year within my home state of maryland i witness stark reminders of what cities across the nation are facing. in july of last year, prince george's county, maryland, experienced a breakdown of its most essential public infrastructure when a water main serving 100,000 people began to fail. mandatory water restrictions were instituted, limiting access to water for homes and businesses during an intense heat wave that saw the heat index repeatedly reach the triple digits. at the national harbor, one hotel evacuated three thousand guests and was forced to cancel upcoming reservations. included in the affected area is joint base andrews, which publicized plans to shut down a long list of services, including appointments at its medical center. there are incidents like this happening across america. the reports are startling. they confirm what every water utility professional knows: we need massive reinvestment in our water infrastructure now and over the coming decades. the nation's drinking water infrastructure-- especially the underground pipes that deliver safe drinking water to america's homes and businesses--is aging. like many of the roads, bridges, and other public assets on which the country relies, most of our buried drinking water infrastructure was built 50 or more years ago, in the post-world war ii era of rapid demographic change and economic growth. some of our systems are even older; in baltimore, where i live, many of the pipes were installed in the 1800s. some of these ``pipes'' are wooden. we need investment to deal with changing population needs and changing hydrological conditions. we have no other choice but to elevate it to a public safety priority and to take action now. the water infrastructure resiliency and sustainability act aims to help local communities meet the challenges of upgrading water infrastructure systems to meet the hydrological changes we are seeing today. the bill directs the epa to establish a water infrastructure resiliency and sustainability program. grants will be awarded to eligible water systems to make the necessary upgrades. communities across the country will be able to compete for federal matching funds, which in turn will help finance projects to help communities overcome these threats. improving water conservation, adjustments to current infrastructure systems, and funding programs to stabilize communities' existing water supply are all projects wirs grants will fund. wirs will never grant more than 50 percent of any project's cost, ensuring cooperation between local communities and the federal government. the epa will try to award funds that use new and innovative ideas as often as possible. it is estimated that by 2020, the forecasted deficit for sustaining water delivery and wastewater treatment infrastructure, will trigger a $206 billion increase in costs for businesses. in a worst case scenario, a lack of water infrastructure investment will cause the united states to lose nearly 700,000 jobs by 2020. a healthy water infrastructure system is as important to america's economy as paved roads and sturdy bridges. water and wastewater investment has been shown to spur economic growth. the u.s. conference of mayors has found that for every dollar invested in water infrastructure, the gross domestic product is increased to more than $6. the department of commerce has found that that same dollar yields close to $3 worth of economic output in other industries. every job created in local water and sewer industries creates close to four jobs elsewhere in the national economy. we know that a reactive mode causes us to lose billions in revenue in the short-term. let us instead take a proactive approach, making strategic investments in innovative projects designed to meet the current and future needs of our water systems. that is the purpose of the water infrastructure resiliency and sustainability act. mr. president, i ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the record. there being no objection the text of the bill was ordered to be printed in the record, as follows: s. 741 be it enacted by the senate and house of representatives of the united states of america in congress assembled, section 1. short title. this act may be cited as the ``water infrastructure resiliency and sustainability act of 2015''. sec. 2. definitions. in this act: (1) administrator.--the term ``administrator'' means the administrator of the environmental protection agency.

Mr. BROWN (for himself, Ms. Ayotte, Mrs. Shaheen, Mrs. Gillibrand, and Ms. Baldwin) submitted an amendment intended to be proposed by him to the bill S. 178, to provide justice for the victims of trafficking; which was ordered to lie on the table; as follows: At the appropriate place, insert the following: TITLE __--RAPE SURVIVOR CHILD CUSTODY SEC. __01. SHORT TITLE. This title may be cited as the ``Rape Survivor Child Custody Act''. SEC. __02. DEFINITIONS. In this title: (1) Covered formula grant.--The term ``covered formula grant'' means a grant under-- (A) part T of title I of the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968 (42 U.S.C. 3796gg et seq.) (commonly referred to as the ``STOP Violence Against Women Formula Grant Program''); or (B) section 41601 of the Violence Against Women Act of 1994 (42 U.S.C. 14043g) (commonly referred to as the ``Sexual Assault Services Program''). (2) Termination.-- (A) In general.--The term ``termination'' means, when used with respect to parental rights, a complete and final termination of the parent's right to custody of, guardianship of, visitation with, access to, and inheritance from a child. (B) Rule of construction.--Nothing in this paragraph shall be construed to require a State, in order to receive an increase in the amount provided to the State under the covered formula grants under this title, to have in place a law that terminates any obligation of a person who fathered a child through rape to support the child. SEC. __03. FINDINGS. Congress finds the following: (1) Men who father children through rape should be prohibited from visiting or having custody of those children. (2) Thousands of rape-related pregnancies occur annually in the United States. (3) A substantial number of women choose to raise their child conceived through rape and, as a result, may face custody battles with their rapists. (4) Rape is one of the most under-prosecuted serious crimes, with estimates of criminal conviction occurring in less than 5 percent of rapes. (5) The clear and convincing evidence standard is the most common standard for termination of parental rights among the 50 States, territories, and the District of Columbia. (6) The Supreme Court established that the clear and convincing evidence standard satisfies due process for allegations to terminate or restrict parental rights in Santosky v. Kramer (455 U.S. 745 (1982)). (7) Currently only 10 States have statutes allowing rape survivors to petition for the termination of parental rights of the rapist based on clear and convincing evidence that the child was conceived through rape. (8) A rapist pursuing parental or custody rights causes the survivor to have continued interaction with the rapist, which can have traumatic psychological effects on the survivor, and can make it more difficult for her to recover. (9) These traumatic effects on the mother can severely negatively impact her ability to raise a healthy child. [[Page S1550]] (10) Rapists may use the threat of pursuing custody or parental rights to coerce survivors into not prosecuting rape, or otherwise harass, intimidate, or manipulate them. SEC. __04. INCREASED FUNDING FOR FORMULA GRANTS AUTHORIZED. The Attorney General shall increase the amount provided to a State under the covered formula grants in accordance with this title if the State has in place a law that allows the mother of any child that was conceived through rape to seek court-ordered termination of the parental rights of her rapist with regard to that child, which the court is authorized to grant upon clear and convincing evidence of rape. SEC. __05. APPLICATION. A State seeking an increase in the amount provided to the State under the covered formula grants shall include in the application of the State for each covered formula grant such information as the Attorney General may reasonably require, including information about the law described in section __04. SEC. __06. GRANT INCREASE. The amount of the increase provided to a State under the covered formula grants under this title shall be equal to not more than 10 percent of the average of the total amount of funding provided to the State under the covered formula grants under the 3 most recent awards to the State. SEC. __07. PERIOD OF INCREASE. (a) In General.--The Attorney General shall provide an increase in the amount provided to a State under the covered formula grants under this title for a 2-year period. (b) Limit.--The Attorney General may not provide an increase in the amount provided to a State under the covered formula grants under this title more than 4 times. SEC. __08. ALLOCATION OF INCREASED FORMULA GRANT FUNDS.

(a) Findings.--Congress finds the following: (1) The illegal market for the production and distribution of child abuse imagery is a growing threat to children in the United States. International demand for this material creates a powerful incentive for the rape, abuse, and torture of children within the United States. (2) The targeting of United States children by international criminal networks is a threat to the homeland security of the United States. This threat must be fought with trained personnel and highly specialized counter-child- exploitation strategies and technologies. [[Page S1539]] (3) The United States Immigration and Customs Enforcement of the Department of Homeland Security serves a critical national security role in protecting the United States from the growing international threat of child exploitation and human trafficking. (4) The Cyber Crimes Center of the United States Immigration and Customs Enforcement is a vital national resource in the effort to combat international child exploitation, providing advanced expertise and assistance in investigations, computer forensics, and victim identification. (5) The returning military heroes of the United States possess unique and valuable skills that can assist law enforcement in combating global sexual and child exploitation, and the Department of Homeland Security should use this national resource to the maximum extent possible. (6) Through the Human Exploitation Rescue Operative (HERO) Child Rescue Corps program, the returning military heroes of the United States are trained and hired to investigate crimes of child exploitation in order to target predators and rescue children from sexual abuse and slavery.

(2) Thousands of rape-related pregnancies occur annually in the United States. (3) A substantial number of women choose to raise their child conceived through rape and, as a result, may face custody battles with their rapists. (4) Rape is one of the most under-prosecuted serious crimes, with estimates of criminal conviction occurring in less than 5 percent of rapes. (5) The clear and convincing evidence standard is the most common standard for termination of parental rights among the 50 States, territories, and the District of Columbia. (6) The Supreme Court established that the clear and convincing evidence standard satisfies due process for allegations to terminate or restrict parental rights in Santosky v. Kramer (455 U.S. 745 (1982)). (7) Currently only 10 States have statutes allowing rape survivors to petition for the termination of parental rights of the rapist based on clear and convincing evidence that the child was conceived through rape. (8) A rapist pursuing parental or custody rights causes the survivor to have continued interaction with the rapist, which can have traumatic psychological effects on the survivor, and can make it more difficult for her to recover. (9) These traumatic effects on the mother can severely negatively impact her ability to raise a healthy child. [[Page S1550]] (10) Rapists may use the threat of pursuing custody or parental rights to coerce survivors into not prosecuting rape, or otherwise harass, intimidate, or manipulate them. SEC. __04. INCREASED FUNDING FOR FORMULA GRANTS AUTHORIZED. The Attorney General shall increase the amount provided to a State under the covered formula grants in accordance with this title if the State has in place a law that allows the mother of any child that was conceived through rape to seek court-ordered termination of the parental rights of her rapist with regard to that child, which the court is authorized to grant upon clear and convincing evidence of rape. SEC. __05. APPLICATION. A State seeking an increase in the amount provided to the State under the covered formula grants shall include in the application of the State for each covered formula grant such information as the Attorney General may reasonably require, including information about the law described in section __04. SEC. __06. GRANT INCREASE. The amount of the increase provided to a State under the covered formula grants under this title shall be equal to not more than 10 percent of the average of the total amount of funding provided to the State under the covered formula grants under the 3 most recent awards to the State. SEC. __07. PERIOD OF INCREASE. (a) In General.--The Attorney General shall provide an increase in the amount provided to a State under the covered formula grants under this title for a 2-year period. (b) Limit.--The Attorney General may not provide an increase in the amount provided to a State under the covered formula grants under this title more than 4 times. SEC. __08. ALLOCATION OF INCREASED FORMULA GRANT FUNDS. The Attorney General shall allocate an increase in the amount provided to a State under the covered formula grants under this title such that-- (1) 25 percent the amount of the increase is provided under the program described in section __02(1)(A); and (2) 75 percent the amount of the increase is provided under the program described in section __02(1)(B). SEC. __09. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS. There is authorized to be appropriated to carry out this title $5,000,000 for each of fiscal years 2015 through 2019. ______ SA 312.

Mr. BROWN (for himself, Ms. Ayotte, Mrs. Shaheen, Mrs. Gillibrand, and Ms. Baldwin) submitted an amendment intended to be proposed by him to the bill S. 178, to provide justice for the victims of trafficking; which was ordered to lie on the table; as follows: At the appropriate place, insert the following: TITLE __--RAPE SURVIVOR CHILD CUSTODY SEC. __01. SHORT TITLE. This title may be cited as the ``Rape Survivor Child Custody Act''. SEC. __02. DEFINITIONS. In this title: (1) Covered formula grant.--The term ``covered formula grant'' means a grant under-- (A) part T of title I of the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968 (42 U.S.C. 3796gg et seq.) (commonly referred to as the ``STOP Violence Against Women Formula Grant Program''); or (B) section 41601 of the Violence Against Women Act of 1994 (42 U.S.C. 14043g) (commonly referred to as the ``Sexual Assault Services Program''). (2) Termination.-- (A) In general.--The term ``termination'' means, when used with respect to parental rights, a complete and final termination of the parent's right to custody of, guardianship of, visitation with, access to, and inheritance from a child. (B) Rule of construction.--Nothing in this paragraph shall be construed to require a State, in order to receive an increase in the amount provided to the State under the covered formula grants under this title, to have in place a law that terminates any obligation of a person who fathered a child through rape to support the child. SEC. __03. FINDINGS. Congress finds the following: (1) Men who father children through rape should be prohibited from visiting or having custody of those children. (2) Thousands of rape-related pregnancies occur annually in the United States. (3) A substantial number of women choose to raise their child conceived through rape and, as a result, may face custody battles with their rapists. (4) Rape is one of the most under-prosecuted serious crimes, with estimates of criminal conviction occurring in less than 5 percent of rapes. (5) The clear and convincing evidence standard is the most common standard for termination of parental rights among the 50 States, territories, and the District of Columbia. (6) The Supreme Court established that the clear and convincing evidence standard satisfies due process for allegations to terminate or restrict parental rights in Santosky v. Kramer (455 U.S. 745 (1982)). (7) Currently only 10 States have statutes allowing rape survivors to petition for the termination of parental rights of the rapist based on clear and convincing evidence that the child was conceived through rape. (8) A rapist pursuing parental or custody rights causes the survivor to have continued interaction with the rapist, which can have traumatic psychological effects on the survivor, and can make it more difficult for her to recover. (9) These traumatic effects on the mother can severely negatively impact her ability to raise a healthy child. [[Page S1550]] (10) Rapists may use the threat of pursuing custody or parental rights to coerce survivors into not prosecuting rape, or otherwise harass, intimidate, or manipulate them. SEC. __04. INCREASED FUNDING FOR FORMULA GRANTS AUTHORIZED. The Attorney General shall increase the amount provided to a State under the covered formula grants in accordance with this title if the State has in place a law that allows the mother of any child that was conceived through rape to seek court-ordered termination of the parental rights of her rapist with regard to that child, which the court is authorized to grant upon clear and convincing evidence of rape. SEC. __05. APPLICATION. A State seeking an increase in the amount provided to the State under the covered formula grants shall include in the application of the State for each covered formula grant such information as the Attorney General may reasonably require, including information about the law described in section __04. SEC. __06. GRANT INCREASE. The amount of the increase provided to a State under the covered formula grants under this title shall be equal to not more than 10 percent of the average of the total amount of funding provided to the State under the covered formula grants under the 3 most recent awards to the State. SEC. __07. PERIOD OF INCREASE. (a) In General.--The Attorney General shall provide an increase in the amount provided to a State under the covered formula grants under this title for a 2-year period. (b) Limit.--The Attorney General may not provide an increase in the amount provided to a State under the covered formula grants under this title more than 4 times. SEC. __08. ALLOCATION OF INCREASED FORMULA GRANT FUNDS. The Attorney General shall allocate an increase in the amount provided to a State under the covered formula grants under this title such that-- (1) 25 percent the amount of the increase is provided under the program described in section __02(1)(A); and (2) 75 percent the amount of the increase is provided under the program described in section __02(1)(B). SEC. __09. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS. There is authorized to be appropriated to carry out this title $5,000,000 for each of fiscal years 2015 through 2019. ______ SA 312.

(commonly referred to as the ``stop violence against women formula grant program''); or (b) section 41601 of the violence against women act of 1994 (42 u.s.c. 14043g) (commonly referred to as the ``sexual assault services program''). (2) termination.-- (a) in general.--the term ``termination'' means, when used with respect to parental rights, a complete and final termination of the parent's right to custody of, guardianship of, visitation with, access to, and inheritance from a child. (b) rule of construction.--nothing in this paragraph shall be construed to require a state, in order to receive an increase in the amount provided to the state under the covered formula grants under this title, to have in place a law that terminates any obligation of a person who fathered a child through rape to support the child. sec. __03. findings. congress finds the following: (1) men who father children through rape should be prohibited from visiting or having custody of those children. (2) thousands of rape-related pregnancies occur annually in the united states. (3) a substantial number of women choose to raise their child conceived through rape and, as a result, may face custody battles with their rapists. (4) rape is one of the most under-prosecuted serious crimes, with estimates of criminal conviction occurring in less than 5 percent of rapes. (5) the clear and convincing evidence standard is the most common standard for termination of parental rights among the 50 states, territories, and the district of columbia. (6) the supreme court established that the clear and convincing evidence standard satisfies due process for allegations to terminate or restrict parental rights in santosky v. kramer (455 u.s. 745 (1982)). (7) currently only 10 states have statutes allowing rape survivors to petition for the termination of parental rights of the rapist based on clear and convincing evidence that the child was conceived through rape. (8) a rapist pursuing parental or custody rights causes the survivor to have continued interaction with the rapist, which can have traumatic psychological effects on the survivor, and can make it more difficult for her to recover. (9) these traumatic effects on the mother can severely negatively impact her ability to raise a healthy child. [[page s1550]] (10) rapists may use the threat of pursuing custody or parental rights to coerce survivors into not prosecuting rape, or otherwise harass, intimidate, or manipulate them. sec. __04. increased funding for formula grants authorized. the attorney general shall increase the amount provided to a state under the covered formula grants in accordance with this title if the state has in place a law that allows the mother of any child that was conceived through rape to seek court-ordered termination of the parental rights of her rapist with regard to that child, which the court is authorized to grant upon clear and convincing evidence of rape. sec. __05. application. a state seeking an increase in the amount provided to the state under the covered formula grants shall include in the application of the state for each covered formula grant such information as the attorney general may reasonably require, including information about the law described in section __04. sec. __06. grant increase. the amount of the increase provided to a state under the covered formula grants under this title shall be equal to not more than 10 percent of the average of the total amount of funding provided to the state under the covered formula grants under the 3 most recent awards to the state. sec. __07. period of increase. (a) in general.--the attorney general shall provide an increase in the amount provided to a state under the covered formula grants under this title for a 2-year period. (b) limit.--the attorney general may not provide an increase in the amount provided to a state under the covered formula grants under this title more than 4 times. sec. __08. allocation of increased formula grant funds. the attorney general shall allocate an increase in the amount provided to a state under the covered formula grants under this title such that-- (1) 25 percent the amount of the increase is provided under the program described in section __02(1)(a); and (2) 75 percent the amount of the increase is provided under the program described in section __02(1)(b). sec. __09. authorization of appropriations. there is authorized to be appropriated to carry out this title $5,000,000 for each of fiscal years 2015 through 2019. ______ sa 312. mr. brown submitted an amendment intended to be proposed by him to the bill s. 178, to provide justice for the victims of trafficking; which was ordered to lie on the table; as follows: at the end of title ii, add the following: subtitle d--expanded training sec. 231. expanded training relating to trafficking in persons. section 105(c)(4) of the trafficking victims protection act of 2000 (22 u.s.c. 7105(c)(4)) is amended-- (1) by striking ``appropriate personnel'' and inserting the following: ``(a) in general.--appropriate personnel''; (2) in subparagraph (a), as redesignated, by inserting ``, including members of the service (as such term is defined in section 103 of the foreign service act of 1980 (22 u.s.c. 3903))'' after ``department of state''; and (3) by adding at the end the following: ``(b) training components.--training under this paragraph shall include-- ``(i) a distance learning course on trafficking-in-persons issues and the department of state's obligations under this act, which shall be designed for embassy reporting officers, regional bureaus' trafficking-in-persons coordinators, and their superiors; ``(ii) specific trafficking-in-persons briefings for all ambassadors and deputy chiefs of mission before such individuals depart for their posts; and ``(iii) at least annual reminders to all personnel referred to in clauses (i) and (ii), including appropriate personnel from other federal departments and agencies, at each diplomatic or consular post of the department of state located outside the united states of-- ``(i) key problems, threats, methods, and warning signs of trafficking in persons specific to the country or jurisdiction in which each such post is located; and ``(ii) appropriate procedures to report information that any such personnel may acquire about possible cases of trafficking in persons.''. ______ sa 313. mr. boozman submitted an amendment intended to be proposed by him to the bill s. 178, to provide justice for the victims of trafficking; which was ordered to lie on the table; as follows: at the end of title ii, add the following: subtitle d--prioritization within the department of state sec. 231. sense of congress. it is the sense of congress that-- (1) the office to monitor and combat trafficking of the department of state will be more effective in carrying out duties mandated by congress in the trafficking victims protection act of 2000 if the office status is changed to that of a bureau within the department hierarchy; (2) the change in status from office to monitor and combat trafficking to a bureau can be accomplished without increasing the number of personnel or the budget of the current office; (3) a bureau to monitor and combat trafficking would be more effective in carrying out duties mandated by congress in the trafficking victims protection act of 2000 if the bureau were headed by an assistant secretary with direct access to the secretary of state, rather than an ambassador-at-large; and (4) the secretary of state should review the current use of the 24 assistant secretary positions authorized by section 1(c)(1) of the state department basic authorities act of 1956 (22 u.s.c. 2651a(c)(1)) and make appropriate revisions, consolidations, and eliminations, to ensure that those positions reflect the highest departmental needs and foreign policy priorities of the united states, including efforts to combat trafficking in persons. sec. 232. bureau to combat trafficking in persons.

Mr. BROWN (for himself, Ms. Ayotte, Mrs. Shaheen, Mrs. Gillibrand, and Ms. Baldwin) submitted an amendment intended to be proposed by him to the bill S. 178, to provide justice for the victims of trafficking; which was ordered to lie on the table; as follows: At the appropriate place, insert the following: TITLE __--RAPE SURVIVOR CHILD CUSTODY SEC. __01. SHORT TITLE. This title may be cited as the ``Rape Survivor Child Custody Act''. SEC. __02. DEFINITIONS. In this title: (1) Covered formula grant.--The term ``covered formula grant'' means a grant under-- (A) part T of title I of the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968 (42 U.S.C. 3796gg et seq.) (commonly referred to as the ``STOP Violence Against Women Formula Grant Program''); or (B) section 41601 of the Violence Against Women Act of 1994 (42 U.S.C. 14043g) (commonly referred to as the ``Sexual Assault Services Program''). (2) Termination.-- (A) In general.--The term ``termination'' means, when used with respect to parental rights, a complete and final termination of the parent's right to custody of, guardianship of, visitation with, access to, and inheritance from a child. (B) Rule of construction.--Nothing in this paragraph shall be construed to require a State, in order to receive an increase in the amount provided to the State under the covered formula grants under this title, to have in place a law that terminates any obligation of a person who fathered a child through rape to support the child. SEC. __03. FINDINGS. Congress finds the following: (1) Men who father children through rape should be prohibited from visiting or having custody of those children. (2) Thousands of rape-related pregnancies occur annually in the United States. (3) A substantial number of women choose to raise their child conceived through rape and, as a result, may face custody battles with their rapists. (4) Rape is one of the most under-prosecuted serious crimes, with estimates of criminal conviction occurring in less than 5 percent of rapes. (5) The clear and convincing evidence standard is the most common standard for termination of parental rights among the 50 States, territories, and the District of Columbia. (6) The Supreme Court established that the clear and convincing evidence standard satisfies due process for allegations to terminate or restrict parental rights in Santosky v. Kramer (455 U.S. 745 (1982)). (7) Currently only 10 States have statutes allowing rape survivors to petition for the termination of parental rights of the rapist based on clear and convincing evidence that the child was conceived through rape. (8) A rapist pursuing parental or custody rights causes the survivor to have continued interaction with the rapist, which can have traumatic psychological effects on the survivor, and can make it more difficult for her to recover. (9) These traumatic effects on the mother can severely negatively impact her ability to raise a healthy child. [[Page S1550]] (10) Rapists may use the threat of pursuing custody or parental rights to coerce survivors into not prosecuting rape, or otherwise harass, intimidate, or manipulate them. SEC. __04. INCREASED FUNDING FOR FORMULA GRANTS AUTHORIZED. The Attorney General shall increase the amount provided to a State under the covered formula grants in accordance with this title if the State has in place a law that allows the mother of any child that was conceived through rape to seek court-ordered termination of the parental rights of her rapist with regard to that child, which the court is authorized to grant upon clear and convincing evidence of rape.

The amount of the increase provided to a State under the covered formula grants under this title shall be equal to not more than 10 percent of the average of the total amount of funding provided to the State under the covered formula grants under the 3 most recent awards to the State. SEC. __07. PERIOD OF INCREASE. (a) In General.--The Attorney General shall provide an increase in the amount provided to a State under the covered formula grants under this title for a 2-year period. (b) Limit.--The Attorney General may not provide an increase in the amount provided to a State under the covered formula grants under this title more than 4 times. SEC. __08.

The Attorney General shall allocate an increase in the amount provided to a State under the covered formula grants under this title such that-- (1) 25 percent the amount of the increase is provided under the program described in section __02(1)(A); and (2) 75 percent the amount of the increase is provided under the program described in section __02(1)(B).

CREC-2015-03-16-pt1-PgS1552-3,CREC-2015-03-16,114,AMERICA'S MILITARY STRENGTH,"[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 44 (Monday, March 16, 2015)] [Senate] [Pages S1552-S1555] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] AMERICA'S MILITARY STRENGTH Mr. COTTON. Mr. President, I speak for the first time from the Senate floor with a simple message: The world is growing ever more dangerous and our defense spending is wholly inadequate to confront the danger. To be exact: During the last four or five years the world has grown gravely darker. . . . We have steadily disarmed, partly with a sincere desire to give a lead to other countries, and partly through the severe financial pressure of the time. But a change must now be made. We must not continue longer on a course in which we alone are growing weaker while every other nation is growing stronger. I wish I could take credit for those eloquent and ominous words, but I cannot. Winston Churchill sounded that warning in 1933, as Adolph Hitler had taken power in Germany. Tragically, Great Britain and the West did not heed this warning when they might have strangled that monster in his crib. Rather than let the locusts continue to eat away at the common defense, the Axis Powers were stronger and the West weaker, conciliating with and appeasing them, hoping their appetite for conquest and death might be sated. As we all know, however, that appetite only grew until it launched the most terrible war in human history. Today, perhaps more tragically because we ought to benefit from those lessons of history, the United States is again engaged in something of a grand experiment of the kind we saw in the 1930s. As then, military strength is seen in many quarters as a cause of military adventurism. Strength and confidence in the defense of our interests, alliances, and liberties is not seen to deter aggression but to provoke it. Rather than confront our adversaries, our President apologizes for our supposed transgressions. The administration is harsh and unyielding to our friends, soothing and suffocating to our enemies. The President minimizes the threat we confront, in the face of territory seized, weapons of mass destruction used and proliferated, and innocents murdered. The concrete expression of this experiment is our collapsing defense budget. For years, we have systematically underfunded our military, marrying this philosophy of retreat with a misplaced understanding of our larger budgetary burdens. We have strained our fighting forces today to the breaking point, even as we have eaten away at our investments in future forces, creating our own ``locust years,'' as Churchill would have put it. Meanwhile, our long-term debt crisis looks hardly any better, even as we ask our troops to shoulder the burden of deficit reduction, rather than shoulder the arms necessary to keep the peace. The results of this experiment, it should come as no surprise, are little different from the results from the same experiment in the 1930s. American weakness and leading from behind have produced nothing but a more dangerous world. When we take stock of that world and our position in it, there can be no doubt a change must now be made. An alarm should be sounding in our ears. Our enemies, sensing weakness and hence opportunity, have become steadily more aggressive. Our allies, uncertain of our commitment and capability, have begun to conclude that they must look out for themselves, even where it is unhelpful to stability and order. Our military, suffering from years of neglect, has seen its relative strength decline to historic levels. Let's start with the enemy who attacked us on September 11: radical Islamists. During his last campaign, the President was fond of saying Al Qaeda was ``on the run.'' In a fashion, I suppose this was true. Al Qaeda was and is running wild around the world, now in control of more territory than ever before. This global network of Islamic jihadists continues to plot attacks against America and the West. They sow the seeds of conflict in failed states and maintain active affiliates throughout Africa, the Arabian Peninsula, the Greater Middle East, and South Asia. Further, Al Qaeda in Iraq was let off the mat when the President disregarded its commanders' best military judgment and withdrew all troops from Iraq in 2011. Given a chance to regroup, it morphed into the Islamic State, which now controls much of Syria and Iraq. The Islamic State cuts the heads off of Americans, burns alive hostages from allied countries, executes Christians, and enslaves women and girls. The Islamic State aspires and actively plots to attack us here at home, whether by foreign plots or by recruiting a lone wolf in our midst. The President's suggestions, in other words, that the war on terror is over or ending, are far from true. Indeed, the Director of National Intelligence recently testified that ``when the final accounting is done, 2014 will have been the most lethal year for global terrorism in the 45 years such data has been compiled.'' Yet the President will not even speak our enemy's name. The threat of radical Islamic terrorism brings us to Iran, the world's worst state sponsor of terrorism. My objections to the ongoing nuclear negotiations are well known and need not be rehearsed at length here. I will simply note that the deal foreshadowed by the President, allowing Iran to have uranium enrichment capabilities and accepting an expiration date on any agreement--to quote Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu--``doesn't block Iran's path to the bomb; it paves Iran's path to the bomb.'' If you think, as I do, the Islamic State is dangerous, a nuclear-armed Islamic Republic is even more so. Recall, after all, what Iran already does without the bomb. Iran is an outlaw regime that has been killing Americans for 35 years, from Lebanon to Saudi Arabia, to Iraq. Unsurprisingly, Iran is only growing bolder and more aggressive as America retreats from the Middle East. Ayatollah Khamenei continues to call for Israel's elimination. Iranian- backed Shiite militias now control much of Iraq, led by Qassem Suleimani, the commander of the Quds Force, a man with the blood of hundreds of American solders on his hands. Iran continues to prop up Bashar al-Assad's outlaw regime in Syria. Iranian-aligned Shiite militants recently seized Sana'a, the capital of Yemen. Hezbollah remains Iran's cat's paw in Lebanon. Put simply, Iran dominates or controls five capitals in its drive for regional hegemony. Moreover, Iran has rapidly increased the size and capability of its ballistic missile arsenal, recently launching new a satellite. Just 2 weeks ago, Iran blew up a mock U.S. aircraft carrier in naval exercises and publicized it with great fanfare. Iran does all of these things without the bomb. Just imagine what it will do with the bomb. Imagine the United States further down the road of appeasement, largely defenseless against this tyranny. You do not have to imagine much, though; simply look to North Korea. Because of a naive and failed nuclear agreement, that outlaw state acquired nuclear weapons. Now America is largely handcuffed, watching as this rogue regime builds more bombs and missiles capable of striking the U.S. homeland and endangering our allies. But perhaps an even more obvious result of this experiment with retreat is the resurgence or Russia. The President aspired for a reset with Russia and made one-sided concessions such as withdrawing ballistic missile defenses from Poland and the Czech Republic. [[Page S1553]] So Vladimir Putin saw these concessions as weakness and continues to violate the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty. The West refused to assist the new Ukranian President, so Putin invaded and stole Crimea. The Western response was modest sanctions. So Russian-supplied rebels shot a civilian airliner out of the sky in the heart of Europe. The President dithers in providing defensive weapons to Ukraine, so Putin reignites the war, takes Debaltseve, and stages outside Mariupol. When bombs and bullets were called for, blankets were rushed to the frontline. That is just in Ukraine. Putin is also testing NATO's resolve. Russia has tested a ballistic missile with multiple warheads, designed to threaten our European allies in direct violation of the INF treaty. Russian bombers recently flew over the English Channel, disrupting British civil aviation. Estonia asserts that Russia kidnapped an Estonian security officer on its Russian border. And Russia continues to intimidate and harass other NATO partners such as Sweden, Moldova, and Georgia. Finally, Russia's ability to continue its aggression will only grow because its defense spending has more than quadrupled over the last 15 years. Moreover, the Russian military today is qualitatively better than the old Soviet military, despite its smaller size, as Admiral Bill Gortney, Commander of NORAD testified just last week. Some say that falling oil prices will restrain Putin. In fact, Russia's Finance Minister recently announced 10 percent across-the- board budget cuts to all departments of their government--except defense. This should give us some insights into Putin's intentions and ambitions. Among major nation-state competitors, Russia's military buildup is exceeded only by China's. Over the same period of the last 15 years, China's military spending has increased by 600 percent. Moreover, the bulk of the spending is directed quite clearly against the United States as China pursues its anti-access and area denial strategy. This strategy is designed to keep American forces outside the so-called first island chain and give China regional hegemony from the Korean Peninsula to the Indonesian archipelago. Thus, China is on a spending spree for more submarines, aircraft carriers, antiship ballistic missiles, and other air and naval systems. The impact of China's rapid military expansion is clear. China has challenged Japan's control of the Senkaku Islands and purported to establish an exclusive air defense zone over the East China Sea. By expanding its activities in the Spratlys, China is precipitating a confrontation with the Philippines, Vietnam, Malaysia, and Taiwan. Further, China's repressive actions against protesters in Hong Kong only serve to undermine Taiwanese support of reunification, which itself could spark further Chinese aggression. All of this is to say nothing of China's cyber theft and economic espionage against American interests or its atrocious record on human rights. While America has retreated, not only have our enemies been on the march, our allies, anxious for years about American resolve, now worry increasingly about American capabilities. With the enemy on their borders, many have begun to conclude they have no choice but to take matters into their own hands, sometimes in ways unhelpful to our interests. Even our core NATO allies appear unsettled by our recent experiment with retreat. The French intervened in Mali to confront Islamic insurgents, but without adequate advance coordination, they quickly found themselves in need of emergency logistical support from our Air Force. Turkey just announced a new missile defense system that will not be interoperable with NATO systems. Greece has a new governing coalition that is hinting at greater cooperation with Russia. The picture is no better outside NATO. Japan has significantly increased its defense budget because of a rising China and may feel compelled to reinterpret its post-war constitutional ban on overseas ``collective self-defense.'' Saudi Arabia just entered a nuclear pact with South Korea, likely a response to Iran's nuclear program. Similarly, the Persian Gulf States have increased defense spending by 44 percent in the last 2 years. While we should encourage our partners to carry their share of the defense load, the Sunni states are building up their defenses, not to help us, but because they fear we won't help them against Iran. We should never take our allies for granted, but we also shouldn't take for granted the vast influence our security guarantees give us with our allies' behavior. Germany and Japan are not nuclear powers today because of our nuclear umbrella. Israel didn't retaliate against Hussein's Scud missile attacks in the gulf war, and thus we preserved the war coalition because we asked them for restraint and committed significant resources to hunting down Scud launchers. This kind of influence has been essential for American security throughout the postwar period, yet it has begun to wane as our allies doubt our commitment and our capabilities. Make no mistake, our military capabilities have declined. In recent years, we have dramatically underfunded our military to the detriment of our security. To fully understand the military aspect of our experiment with retreat, some historical perspective is needed. Defense spending reached its peak in 2008, when the base budget and wartime spending combined was $760 billion. Incredibly, the total defense budget plummeted by $200 billion in the last year. Today, defense spending is only 16 percent of all Federal spending, a historic low rivaled only by the post-Cold War period. To give some context, during the Cold War, defense spending regularly accounted for 60 percent of Federal spending. But if we don't end the experiment of retreat, this President will leave office with a mere 12 percent of all Federal dollars spent on defense. The picture is no prettier when cast in the light of our economy. In the early Cold War, defense spending was approximately 9 percent of gross domestic product. Today, it sits at a paltry 3.5 percent. But our defense budget isn't just about numbers and arithmetic. It is about our ability to accomplish the mission of defending our country from all threats. The consequences of these cuts are real, concrete, and immediate. As former Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta explained, these cuts to defense spending have put us on the path to the smallest Army since before World War II, the smallest Navy since World War, and the smallest Air Force ever. Let's look more closely at each service. Our Army has shrunk by nearly 100,000 troops. The Army has lost 13 combat brigades, and only a third of the remaining brigades are fully ready to meet America's threats. Further, investments in modernization have fallen by 25 percent. If we continue on the current path, the Army will lose another 70,000 soldiers, and every modernization program designed to preserve the Army's technological advantage will be eviscerated. The Navy, meanwhile, has had to cancel five ship deployments and significantly delay the deployment of a carrier strike group. The Navy's mission requires it to keep three carrier strike groups and amphibious readiness groups prepared to respond to a major crisis within 30 years, but the Navy can only fulfill a third of its mission because of cuts to maintenance and training. Similarly, the Air Force is less than one-third of its size 25 years ago. Moreover, the Air Force depends upon modernization to preserve its technological edge, perhaps more than any other service, but current funding levels could require cancellation of airborne-refueling tankers and surveillance aircraft, set back fighter and nuclear weapons modernization, and shorten the life of tactical airlift and weapons recovery programs. Nor are these impacts just immediate; they will be felt long into the future. Key programs, once divested, will be difficult to restart. Manufacturing competencies will be lost, the skilled-labor pool will shrink, and the defense manufacturing base will atrophy. Today's weapons systems and equipment will begin to age and break down. Our troops won't be able to train, and their weapons and equipment won't be ready to fight. In short, we will have a hollow force incapable of defending our national security. [[Page S1554]] What is to be done then? Our experiment with retreat must end. This Congress must again recognize that our national security is the first priority of this government. Our national security strategy must drive our military budget rather than the budget setting our strategy. The military budget must reflect the threats we face rather than the budget defining those threats. In the face of these threats and after years of improvident defense cuts, we must significantly increase our defense spending. After hundreds of billions of dollars of these cuts, the base defense budget next year is set to be only $498 billion. That is wholly inadequate. Secretary of Defense Ash Carter recently testified: ``I want to be clear about this--parts of our nation's defense strategy cannot be executed under sequestration.'' All four of the military service chiefs, in addition, have testified that these cuts put American lives at risk. The President has proposed a modest increase to $534 billion, which is better than nothing. Senators John McCain and Jack Reed have called for the full repeal of sequestration, which would raise the base defense budget to $577 billion. I applaud and thank these veterans of both the Senate and our military for this correct and clear-eyed recommendation. Yet I also want to highlight their support for the recommendation of the National Defense Panel, which estimated that base defense spending for fiscal year 2016 should be $611 billion at a minimum. The National Defense Panel was a bipartisan group of eminent national security experts convened by Congress to analyze the Quadrennial Defense Review. They unanimously concluded that then-Secretary of Defense Bob Gates' fiscal year 2012 budget was the proper starting point to analyze our current defense needs--for at least two reasons. First, Secretary Gates had already initiated significant defense cuts and reforms totaling $478 billion. It is hard to say, given those efforts, that his 2012 budget had left much fat in the Department of Defense. Second, Secretary Gates and the Department assembled and submitted this budget in late January 2010 and early 2011, or just months before the Budget Control Act with its draconian defense cuts became law. That budget, therefore, was the last time the Defense Department was able to submit a threat- and strategy-based budget, instead of the budget-based strategies we have seen over the last 4 years. This logic is compelling, even unassailable. Thus, I agree we should spend not merely $611 billion on the base defense budget next year but substantially more than that. After all, as we have seen earlier, and as the National Defense Panel has noted, the world has become much more dangerous since 2011. Islamic terrorism, Iranian aggression, Russian revisionism, and Chinese interventionism have all worsened--to say nothing of other challenges. The $611 billion is necessary, but it is not sufficient. What then should our defense budget be next year? I will readily admit we cannot be sure how much is needed above $611 billion. As the National Defense Panel explained, ``because of the highly constrained and unstable budget environment under which the Department has been working,'' the Quadrennial Review ``is not adequate as a comprehensive long-term planning document.'' Thus, the panel recommends that Congress ``should ask the Department for such a plan, which should be developed without undue emphasis on current budgetary restraints.'' I endorse this recommendation. In the meantime, though, even if we can't specify a precise dollar amount, we can identify the critical needs on which to spend the additional money. First, our military faces a readiness crisis from budget cuts and a decade of war. Our young soldiers, sailors, airmen, and marines are the greatest weapons systems our country could ever have, but they need training--live-fire exercises, flight time, and so forth. Their weapons, equipment, and vehicles need maintenance and reset. If we faced a major crisis today, our troops would no doubt suffer more casualties and greater likelihood of mission failure. Of course, they know all of this, and morale suffers because of it. Second and related, our military is shrinking rapidly to historically small levels. This decline must be reversed. Our Navy probably needs 350-plus ships, not a budget-dictated 260 ships. The Army needs to maintain its pre-9/11 end strength of 490,000 Active-Duty soldiers, as the Marine Corps needs 182,000 marines. The Air Force needs more aircraft of virtually every type--bomber, fighter, airlift, and surveillance. It is the deepest folly to reduce our military below its 1990s size as the world has grown considerably more dangerous since that quiet decade. Third, we should increase research, development, and procurement funds to ensure our military retains its historic technological advantage, particularly as our adversaries gain more access to advanced, low-cost technologies. This should start with the essential tools of command and control: cyber space, space, and intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance. The Air Force needs to modernize its bomber and mobility aircraft, in particular. The Navy needs to continue to improve its surface-ship and especially its submarine capabilities. These critical priorities will no doubt be expensive, probably tens of billions of dollars more than the $611 billion baseline suggested by the National Defense Panel. Because the massive cuts to our defense budget resulted in part from record deficits, the question arises, however: Can we afford all of this? The answer is yes--without question and without doubt, yes. The facts here, as we have seen, are indisputable. The defense budget has been slashed by hundreds of billions of dollars over the last 6 years. The defense budget is only 16 percent of all Federal spending, a historic low and heading much lower if we don't act. And using the broadest measure of affordability and national priorities, defense spending as a percentage of our economy, last year we spent only 3.5 percent of our national income on defense, which is approaching historic lows and may surpass them by 2019. Let us assume, for the sake of argument, that our military needs $700 billion in the coming year, an immediate increase of $200 billion. To some, that may sound staggering and unrealistic, yet it would still be barely 4 percent of our economy--a full 1 percent lower than the 5 percent from which President Reagan started his buildup. If we increased spending merely to that level--which both President Reagan and a Democratic House considered dangerously low--we would spend $885 billion on defense next year. Furthermore, trying to balance the budget through defense cuts is both counterproductive and impossible. First, the threats we face will eventually catch up with us, as they did on September 11, and we will have no choice but to increase our defense budget. When we do, it will cost more to achieve the same end state of readiness and modernization than it would have without the intervening cuts. This was the lesson we learned in the 1980s after the severe cuts to defense in the 1970s. Second, we need a healthy, growing economy to generate the government revenue necessary to fund our military and balance the budget. In our globalized world, our domestic prosperity depends heavily on the world economy, which, of course, requires stability and order. Who provides that stability and order? The U.S. military. Finally, in the short term, ephemeral gains in deficit reduction from defense cuts merely mask the genuine driver of our long-term debt crisis: retirement and health care programs. The Budget Control Act ultimately failed to control these programs--a failure not only of promises made to our citizens but also because the deficit-reduction default became annual discretionary funding, particularly the defense budget. In the 4 years since, relative deficits have declined, alleviating the imperative to reform these programs yet doing nothing to solve their long-term insolvency and our debt crisis. A better question to ask is: Can we afford to continue our experiment in retreat? I suggest we cannot. Imagine a world in which we continue our current trajectory, where America remains in retreat and our military loses even more of its edge. What would such a world look like? It is not a pretty picture. Russia might soon possess the entire north shore of the Black Sea. An emboldened [[Page S1555]] Putin, sensing Western weakness for what it is, could be tempted to replay his Ukrainian playbook in Estonia or Latvia, forcing NATO into war or obsolescence. China could escalate its island conflicts in the East and South China Seas. Without an adequate American response--or worse, with China denying American forces access to those seas--countries as diverse as South Korea, Japan, Taiwan, and the Philippines would feel compelled to conciliate or confront regional stability. While North Korea already possesses nuclear weapons, Iran appears to be on the path to a nuclear bomb, whether it breaks or upholds a potential nuclear agreement. Not only might Iran use its weapon, but its nuclear umbrella would also embolden its drive for regional hegemony. Moreover, Iran could provide its terrorist proxies with nuclear materials. And does anyone doubt that Saudi Arabia and other Sunni states will follow Iran down this path? Nuclear tripwires may soon ring the world's most volatile region, increasing the risk of nuclear war, as well as the possibility that Islamist insurgents might seize nuclear materials if they can topple the right government. Islamic terrorists, meanwhile, will continue to rampage throughout Syria and Iraq, aspiring always for more attacks in Europe and on American soil. Emboldened by America's retreat and by their own battlefield successes, they will continue to attract thousands of hateful fighters from around the world, all eager for the chance to kill Americans. All these are nightmare scenarios, but sadly not unrealistic ones. The alternative, however, is not war. No leader--whether a President, a general or platoon leader--wishes to put his troops in harm's way. War is an awful thing, and it takes an unimaginable toll on the men and women who fight it and their families. But the best way to avoid war is to be willing and prepared to fight a war in the first place. That is the alternative: military strength and moral confidence in the defense of America's national security. Our enemies and allies alike must know that aggressors will pay an unspeakable price for challenging the United States. The best way to impose that price is global military dominance. When it comes to war, narrow margins are not enough, for they are nothing more than an invitation to war. We must have such hegemonic strength that no sane adversary would ever imagine challenging the United States. ``Good enough'' is not and will never be good enough. We can look to a very recent historic example to prove this point. Just 25 years ago, a dominant American military ended the Cold War without firing a shot. If we return to the dominance of that era, aggressive despots such as Vladimir Putin, rising powers such as China, and state sponsors of terrorism such as Iran's Ayatollahs will think long and hard before crossing us. And while we may not deter terrorist groups such as the Islamic State, Al Qaeda, and Hezbollah, we will kill their adherents more effectively, while also sending a needed lesson to their sympathizers: Join and you too will die. Bringing about this future by being prepared for war will no doubt take a lot of money. But what could be a higher priority than a safe and prosperous America, leading a stable and orderly world? What better use of precious taxpayer dollars? What more lessons from history do we need? I began with Churchill's prescient words from 1933. Alas, the West did not take his advice, did not rearm and prepare to deter Nazi Germany. The predictable result was the German remilitarization of the Rhineland and the long march to war. Now let me close with his regretful words from 1936: The era of procrastination, of half-measures, of soothing and baffling expedients, of delays, is coming to its close. In its place we are entering a period of consequences. Churchill later called World War II the unnecessary war because it could have been stopped so easily with Western strength and confidence in the 1930s. I know many of you in this Chamber stand with me, and I humbly urge you all--Democrat and Republican alike--to join in rebuilding our common defense, so that we will not face our own unnecessary war, our own period of consequences. I will now yield the floor, but I will never yield in the defense of America's national security on any front or at any time. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 44 (Monday, March 16, 2015)] [Senate] [Pages S1552-S1555] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] AMERICA'S MILITARY STRENGTH Mr. COTTON. Mr. President, I speak for the first time from the Senate floor with a simple message: The world is growing ever more dangerous and our defense spending is wholly inadequate to confront the danger. To be exact: During the last four or five years the world has grown gravely darker. . . . We have steadily disarmed, partly with a sincere desire to give a lead to other countries, and partly through the severe financial pressure of the time. But a change must now be made. We must not continue longer on a course in which we alone are growing weaker while every other nation is growing stronger. I wish I could take credit for those eloquent and ominous words, but I cannot. Winston Churchill sounded that warning in 1933, as Adolph Hitler had taken power in Germany. Tragically, Great Britain and the West did not heed this warning when they might have strangled that monster in his crib. Rather than let the locusts continue to eat away at the common defense, the Axis Powers were stronger and the West weaker, conciliating with and appeasing them, hoping their appetite for conquest and death might be sated. As we all know, however, that appetite only grew until it launched the most terrible war in human history. Today, perhaps more tragically because we ought to benefit from those lessons of history, the United States is again engaged in something of a grand experiment of the kind we saw in the 1930s. As then, military strength is seen in many quarters as a cause of military adventurism. Strength and confidence in the defense of our interests, alliances, and liberties is not seen to deter aggression but to provoke it. Rather than confront our adversaries, our President apologizes for our supposed transgressions. The administration is harsh and unyielding to our friends, soothing and suffocating to our enemies. The President minimizes the threat we confront, in the face of territory seized, weapons of mass destruction used and proliferated, and innocents murdered. The concrete expression of this experiment is our collapsing defense budget. For years, we have systematically underfunded our military, marrying this philosophy of retreat with a misplaced understanding of our larger budgetary burdens. We have strained our fighting forces today to the breaking point, even as we have eaten away at our investments in future forces, creating our own ``locust years,'' as Churchill would have put it. Meanwhile, our long-term debt crisis looks hardly any better, even as we ask our troops to shoulder the burden of deficit reduction, rather than shoulder the arms necessary to keep the peace. The results of this experiment, it should come as no surprise, are little different from the results from the same experiment in the 1930s. American weakness and leading from behind have produced nothing but a more dangerous world. When we take stock of that world and our position in it, there can be no doubt a change must now be made. An alarm should be sounding in our ears. Our enemies, sensing weakness and hence opportunity, have become steadily more aggressive. Our allies, uncertain of our commitment and capability, have begun to conclude that they must look out for themselves, even where it is unhelpful to stability and order. Our military, suffering from years of neglect, has seen its relative strength decline to historic levels. Let's start with the enemy who attacked us on September 11: radical Islamists. During his last campaign, the President was fond of saying Al Qaeda was ``on the run.'' In a fashion, I suppose this was true. Al Qaeda was and is running wild around the world, now in control of more territory than ever before. This global network of Islamic jihadists continues to plot attacks against America and the West. They sow the seeds of conflict in failed states and maintain active affiliates throughout Africa, the Arabian Peninsula, the Greater Middle East, and South Asia. Further, Al Qaeda in Iraq was let off the mat when the President disregarded its commanders' best military judgment and withdrew all troops from Iraq in 2011. Given a chance to regroup, it morphed into the Islamic State, which now controls much of Syria and Iraq. The Islamic State cuts the heads off of Americans, burns alive hostages from allied countries, executes Christians, and enslaves women and girls. The Islamic State aspires and actively plots to attack us here at home, whether by foreign plots or by recruiting a lone wolf in our midst. The President's suggestions, in other words, that the war on terror is over or ending, are far from true. Indeed, the Director of National Intelligence recently testified that ``when the final accounting is done, 2014 will have been the most lethal year for global terrorism in the 45 years such data has been compiled.'' Yet the President will not even speak our enemy's name. The threat of radical Islamic terrorism brings us to Iran, the world's worst state sponsor of terrorism. My objections to the ongoing nuclear negotiations are well known and need not be rehearsed at length here. I will simply note that the deal foreshadowed by the President, allowing Iran to have uranium enrichment capabilities and accepting an expiration date on any agreement--to quote Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu--``doesn't block Iran's path to the bomb; it paves Iran's path to the bomb.'' If you think, as I do, the Islamic State is dangerous, a nuclear-armed Islamic Republic is even more so. Recall, after all, what Iran already does without the bomb. Iran is an outlaw regime that has been killing Americans for 35 years, from Lebanon to Saudi Arabia, to Iraq. Unsurprisingly, Iran is only growing bolder and more aggressive as America retreats from the Middle East. Ayatollah Khamenei continues to call for Israel's elimination. Iranian- backed Shiite militias now control much of Iraq, led by Qassem Suleimani, the commander of the Quds Force, a man with the blood of hundreds of American solders on his hands. Iran continues to prop up Bashar al-Assad's outlaw regime in Syria. Iranian-aligned Shiite militants recently seized Sana'a, the capital of Yemen. Hezbollah remains Iran's cat's paw in Lebanon. Put simply, Iran dominates or controls five capitals in its drive for regional hegemony. Moreover, Iran has rapidly increased the size and capability of its ballistic missile arsenal, recently launching new a satellite. Just 2 weeks ago, Iran blew up a mock U.S. aircraft carrier in naval exercises and publicized it with great fanfare. Iran does all of these things without the bomb. Just imagine what it will do with the bomb. Imagine the United States further down the road of appeasement, largely defenseless against this tyranny. You do not have to imagine much, though; simply look to North Korea. Because of a naive and failed nuclear agreement, that outlaw state acquired nuclear weapons. Now America is largely handcuffed, watching as this rogue regime builds more bombs and missiles capable of striking the U.S. homeland and endangering our allies. But perhaps an even more obvious result of this experiment with retreat is the resurgence or Russia. The President aspired for a reset with Russia and made one-sided concessions such as withdrawing ballistic missile defenses from Poland and the Czech Republic. [[Page S1553]] So Vladimir Putin saw these concessions as weakness and continues to violate the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty. The West refused to assist the new Ukranian President, so Putin invaded and stole Crimea. The Western response was modest sanctions. So Russian-supplied rebels shot a civilian airliner out of the sky in the heart of Europe. The President dithers in providing defensive weapons to Ukraine, so Putin reignites the war, takes Debaltseve, and stages outside Mariupol. When bombs and bullets were called for, blankets were rushed to the frontline. That is just in Ukraine. Putin is also testing NATO's resolve. Russia has tested a ballistic missile with multiple warheads, designed to threaten our European allies in direct violation of the INF treaty. Russian bombers recently flew over the English Channel, disrupting British civil aviation. Estonia asserts that Russia kidnapped an Estonian security officer on its Russian border. And Russia continues to intimidate and harass other NATO partners such as Sweden, Moldova, and Georgia. Finally, Russia's ability to continue its aggression will only grow because its defense spending has more than quadrupled over the last 15 years. Moreover, the Russian military today is qualitatively better than the old Soviet military, despite its smaller size, as Admiral Bill Gortney, Commander of NORAD testified just last week. Some say that falling oil prices will restrain Putin. In fact, Russia's Finance Minister recently announced 10 percent across-the- board budget cuts to all departments of their government--except defense. This should give us some insights into Putin's intentions and ambitions. Among major nation-state competitors, Russia's military buildup is exceeded only by China's. Over the same period of the last 15 years, China's military spending has increased by 600 percent. Moreover, the bulk of the spending is directed quite clearly against the United States as China pursues its anti-access and area denial strategy. This strategy is designed to keep American forces outside the so-called first island chain and give China regional hegemony from the Korean Peninsula to the Indonesian archipelago. Thus, China is on a spending spree for more submarines, aircraft carriers, antiship ballistic missiles, and other air and naval systems. The impact of China's rapid military expansion is clear. China has challenged Japan's control of the Senkaku Islands and purported to establish an exclusive air defense zone over the East China Sea. By expanding its activities in the Spratlys, China is precipitating a confrontation with the Philippines, Vietnam, Malaysia, and Taiwan. Further, China's repressive actions against protesters in Hong Kong only serve to undermine Taiwanese support of reunification, which itself could spark further Chinese aggression. All of this is to say nothing of China's cyber theft and economic espionage against American interests or its atrocious record on human rights. While America has retreated, not only have our enemies been on the march, our allies, anxious for years about American resolve, now worry increasingly about American capabilities. With the enemy on their borders, many have begun to conclude they have no choice but to take matters into their own hands, sometimes in ways unhelpful to our interests. Even our core NATO allies appear unsettled by our recent experiment with retreat. The French intervened in Mali to confront Islamic insurgents, but without adequate advance coordination, they quickly found themselves in need of emergency logistical support from our Air Force. Turkey just announced a new missile defense system that will not be interoperable with NATO systems. Greece has a new governing coalition that is hinting at greater cooperation with Russia. The picture is no better outside NATO. Japan has significantly increased its defense budget because of a rising China and may feel compelled to reinterpret its post-war constitutional ban on overseas ``collective self-defense.'' Saudi Arabia just entered a nuclear pact with South Korea, likely a response to Iran's nuclear program. Similarly, the Persian Gulf States have increased defense spending by 44 percent in the last 2 years. While we should encourage our partners to carry their share of the defense load, the Sunni states are building up their defenses, not to help us, but because they fear we won't help them against Iran. We should never take our allies for granted, but we also shouldn't take for granted the vast influence our security guarantees give us with our allies' behavior. Germany and Japan are not nuclear powers today because of our nuclear umbrella. Israel didn't retaliate against Hussein's Scud missile attacks in the gulf war, and thus we preserved the war coalition because we asked them for restraint and committed significant resources to hunting down Scud launchers. This kind of influence has been essential for American security throughout the postwar period, yet it has begun to wane as our allies doubt our commitment and our capabilities. Make no mistake, our military capabilities have declined. In recent years, we have dramatically underfunded our military to the detriment of our security. To fully understand the military aspect of our experiment with retreat, some historical perspective is needed. Defense spending reached its peak in 2008, when the base budget and wartime spending combined was $760 billion. Incredibly, the total defense budget plummeted by $200 billion in the last year. Today, defense spending is only 16 percent of all Federal spending, a historic low rivaled only by the post-Cold War period. To give some context, during the Cold War, defense spending regularly accounted for 60 percent of Federal spending. But if we don't end the experiment of retreat, this President will leave office with a mere 12 percent of all Federal dollars spent on defense. The picture is no prettier when cast in the light of our economy. In the early Cold War, defense spending was approximately 9 percent of gross domestic product. Today, it sits at a paltry 3.5 percent. But our defense budget isn't just about numbers and arithmetic. It is about our ability to accomplish the mission of defending our country from all threats. The consequences of these cuts are real, concrete, and immediate. As former Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta explained, these cuts to defense spending have put us on the path to the smallest Army since before World War II, the smallest Navy since World War, and the smallest Air Force ever. Let's look more closely at each service. Our Army has shrunk by nearly 100,000 troops. The Army has lost 13 combat brigades, and only a third of the remaining brigades are fully ready to meet America's threats. Further, investments in modernization have fallen by 25 percent. If we continue on the current path, the Army will lose another 70,000 soldiers, and every modernization program designed to preserve the Army's technological advantage will be eviscerated. The Navy, meanwhile, has had to cancel five ship deployments and significantly delay the deployment of a carrier strike group. The Navy's mission requires it to keep three carrier strike groups and amphibious readiness groups prepared to respond to a major crisis within 30 years, but the Navy can only fulfill a third of its mission because of cuts to maintenance and training. Similarly, the Air Force is less than one-third of its size 25 years ago. Moreover, the Air Force depends upon modernization to preserve its technological edge, perhaps more than any other service, but current funding levels could require cancellation of airborne-refueling tankers and surveillance aircraft, set back fighter and nuclear weapons modernization, and shorten the life of tactical airlift and weapons recovery programs. Nor are these impacts just immediate; they will be felt long into the future. Key programs, once divested, will be difficult to restart. Manufacturing competencies will be lost, the skilled-labor pool will shrink, and the defense manufacturing base will atrophy. Today's weapons systems and equipment will begin to age and break down. Our troops won't be able to train, and their weapons and equipment won't be ready to fight. In short, we will have a hollow force incapable of defending our national security. [[Page S1554]] What is to be done then? Our experiment with retreat must end. This Congress must again recognize that our national security is the first priority of this government. Our national security strategy must drive our military budget rather than the budget setting our strategy. The military budget must reflect the threats we face rather than the budget defining those threats. In the face of these threats and after years of improvident defense cuts, we must significantly increase our defense spending. After hundreds of billions of dollars of these cuts, the base defense budget next year is set to be only $498 billion. That is wholly inadequate. Secretary of Defense Ash Carter recently testified: ``I want to be clear about this--parts of our nation's defense strategy cannot be executed under sequestration.'' All four of the military service chiefs, in addition, have testified that these cuts put American lives at risk. The President has proposed a modest increase to $534 billion, which is better than nothing. Senators John McCain and Jack Reed have called for the full repeal of sequestration, which would raise the base defense budget to $577 billion. I applaud and thank these veterans of both the Senate and our military for this correct and clear-eyed recommendation. Yet I also want to highlight their support for the recommendation of the National Defense Panel, which estimated that base defense spending for fiscal year 2016 should be $611 billion at a minimum. The National Defense Panel was a bipartisan group of eminent national security experts convened by Congress to analyze the Quadrennial Defense Review. They unanimously concluded that then-Secretary of Defense Bob Gates' fiscal year 2012 budget was the proper starting point to analyze our current defense needs--for at least two reasons. First, Secretary Gates had already initiated significant defense cuts and reforms totaling $478 billion. It is hard to say, given those efforts, that his 2012 budget had left much fat in the Department of Defense. Second, Secretary Gates and the Department assembled and submitted this budget in late January 2010 and early 2011, or just months before the Budget Control Act with its draconian defense cuts became law. That budget, therefore, was the last time the Defense Department was able to submit a threat- and strategy-based budget, instead of the budget-based strategies we have seen over the last 4 years. This logic is compelling, even unassailable. Thus, I agree we should spend not merely $611 billion on the base defense budget next year but substantially more than that. After all, as we have seen earlier, and as the National Defense Panel has noted, the world has become much more dangerous since 2011. Islamic terrorism, Iranian aggression, Russian revisionism, and Chinese interventionism have all worsened--to say nothing of other challenges. The $611 billion is necessary, but it is not sufficient. What then should our defense budget be next year? I will readily admit we cannot be sure how much is needed above $611 billion. As the National Defense Panel explained, ``because of the highly constrained and unstable budget environment under which the Department has been working,'' the Quadrennial Review ``is not adequate as a comprehensive long-term planning document.'' Thus, the panel recommends that Congress ``should ask the Department for such a plan, which should be developed without undue emphasis on current budgetary restraints.'' I endorse this recommendation. In the meantime, though, even if we can't specify a precise dollar amount, we can identify the critical needs on which to spend the additional money. First, our military faces a readiness crisis from budget cuts and a decade of war. Our young soldiers, sailors, airmen, and marines are the greatest weapons systems our country could ever have, but they need training--live-fire exercises, flight time, and so forth. Their weapons, equipment, and vehicles need maintenance and reset. If we faced a major crisis today, our troops would no doubt suffer more casualties and greater likelihood of mission failure. Of course, they know all of this, and morale suffers because of it. Second and related, our military is shrinking rapidly to historically small levels. This decline must be reversed. Our Navy probably needs 350-plus ships, not a budget-dictated 260 ships. The Army needs to maintain its pre-9/11 end strength of 490,000 Active-Duty soldiers, as the Marine Corps needs 182,000 marines. The Air Force needs more aircraft of virtually every type--bomber, fighter, airlift, and surveillance. It is the deepest folly to reduce our military below its 1990s size as the world has grown considerably more dangerous since that quiet decade. Third, we should increase research, development, and procurement funds to ensure our military retains its historic technological advantage, particularly as our adversaries gain more access to advanced, low-cost technologies. This should start with the essential tools of command and control: cyber space, space, and intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance. The Air Force needs to modernize its bomber and mobility aircraft, in particular. The Navy needs to continue to improve its surface-ship and especially its submarine capabilities. These critical priorities will no doubt be expensive, probably tens of billions of dollars more than the $611 billion baseline suggested by the National Defense Panel. Because the massive cuts to our defense budget resulted in part from record deficits, the question arises, however: Can we afford all of this? The answer is yes--without question and without doubt, yes. The facts here, as we have seen, are indisputable.

Now let me close with his regretful words from 1936: The era of procrastination, of half-measures, of soothing and baffling expedients, of delays, is coming to its close. In its place we are entering a period of consequences. Churchill later called World War II the unnecessary war because it could have been stopped so easily with Western strength and confidence in the 1930s. I know many of you in this Chamber stand with me, and I humbly urge you all--Democrat and Republican alike--to join in rebuilding our common defense, so that we will not face our own unnecessary war, our own period of consequences. I will now yield the floor, but I will never yield in the defense of America's national security on any front or at any time. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader. ____________________","Congressional Record, Volume 161 Issue 44 (Monday, March 16, 2015) [Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 44 (Monday, March 16, 2015)] [Senate] [Pages S1552-S1555] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] AMERICA'S MILITARY STRENGTH Mr. COTTON. Mr. President, I speak for the first time from the Senate floor with a simple message: The world is growing ever more dangerous and our defense spending is wholly inadequate to confront the danger. To be exact: During the last four or five years the world has grown gravely darker. . . . We have steadily disarmed, partly with a sincere desire to give a lead to other countries, and partly through the severe financial pressure of the time. But a change must now be made. We must not continue longer on a course in which we alone are growing weaker while every other nation is growing stronger. I wish I could take credit for those eloquent and ominous words, but I cannot. Winston Churchill sounded that warning in 1933, as Adolph Hitler had taken power in Germany. Tragically, Great Britain and the West did not heed this warning when they might have strangled that monster in his crib. Rather than let the locusts continue to eat away at the common defense, the Axis Powers were stronger and the West weaker, conciliating with and appeasing them, hoping their appetite for conquest and death might be sated. As we all know, however, that appetite only grew until it launched the most terrible war in human history. Today, perhaps more tragically because we ought to benefit from those lessons of history, the United States is again engaged in something of a grand experiment of the kind we saw in the 1930s. As then, military strength is seen in many quarters as a cause of military adventurism. Strength and confidence in the defense of our interests, alliances, and liberties is not seen to deter aggression but to provoke it. Rather than confront our adversaries, our President apologizes for our supposed transgressions. The administration is harsh and unyielding to our friends, soothing and suffocating to our enemies. The President minimizes the threat we confront, in the face of territory seized, weapons of mass destruction used and proliferated, and innocents murdered. The concrete expression of this experiment is our collapsing defense budget. For years, we have systematically underfunded our military, marrying this philosophy of retreat with a misplaced understanding of our larger budgetary burdens. We have strained our fighting forces today to the breaking point, even as we have eaten away at our investments in future forces, creating our own ``locust years,'' as Churchill would have put it. Meanwhile, our long-term debt crisis looks hardly any better, even as we ask our troops to shoulder the burden of deficit reduction, rather than shoulder the arms necessary to keep the peace. The results of this experiment, it should come as no surprise, are little different from the results from the same experiment in the 1930s. American weakness and leading from behind have produced nothing but a more dangerous world. When we take stock of that world and our position in it, there can be no doubt a change must now be made. An alarm should be sounding in our ears. Our enemies, sensing weakness and hence opportunity, have become steadily more aggressive. Our allies, uncertain of our commitment and capability, have begun to conclude that they must look out for themselves, even where it is unhelpful to stability and order. Our military, suffering from years of neglect, has seen its relative strength decline to historic levels. Let's start with the enemy who attacked us on September 11: radical Islamists. During his last campaign, the President was fond of saying Al Qaeda was ``on the run.'' In a fashion, I suppose this was true. Al Qaeda was and is running wild around the world, now in control of more territory than ever before. This global network of Islamic jihadists continues to plot attacks against America and the West. They sow the seeds of conflict in failed states and maintain active affiliates throughout Africa, the Arabian Peninsula, the Greater Middle East, and South Asia. Further, Al Qaeda in Iraq was let off the mat when the President disregarded its commanders' best military judgment and withdrew all troops from Iraq in 2011. Given a chance to regroup, it morphed into the Islamic State, which now controls much of Syria and Iraq. The Islamic State cuts the heads off of Americans, burns alive hostages from allied countries, executes Christians, and enslaves women and girls. The Islamic State aspires and actively plots to attack us here at home, whether by foreign plots or by recruiting a lone wolf in our midst. The President's suggestions, in other words, that the war on terror is over or ending, are far from true. Indeed, the Director of National Intelligence recently testified that ``when the final accounting is done, 2014 will have been the most lethal year for global terrorism in the 45 years such data has been compiled.'' Yet the President will not even speak our enemy's name. The threat of radical Islamic terrorism brings us to Iran, the world's worst state sponsor of terrorism. My objections to the ongoing nuclear negotiations are well known and need not be rehearsed at length here. I will simply note that the deal foreshadowed by the President, allowing Iran to have uranium enrichment capabilities and accepting an expiration date on any agreement--to quote Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu--``doesn't block Iran's path to the bomb; it paves Iran's path to the bomb.'' If you think, as I do, the Islamic State is dangerous, a nuclear-armed Islamic Republic is even more so. Recall, after all, what Iran already does without the bomb. Iran is an outlaw regime that has been killing Americans for 35 years, from Lebanon to Saudi Arabia, to Iraq. Unsurprisingly, Iran is only growing bolder and more aggressive as America retreats from the Middle East. Ayatollah Khamenei continues to call for Israel's elimination. Iranian- backed Shiite militias now control much of Iraq, led by Qassem Suleimani, the commander of the Quds Force, a man with the blood of hundreds of American solders on his hands. Iran continues to prop up Bashar al-Assad's outlaw regime in Syria. Iranian-aligned Shiite militants recently seized Sana'a, the capital of Yemen. Hezbollah remains Iran's cat's paw in Lebanon. Put simply, Iran dominates or controls five capitals in its drive for regional hegemony. Moreover, Iran has rapidly increased the size and capability of its ballistic missile arsenal, recently launching new a satellite. Just 2 weeks ago, Iran blew up a mock U.S. aircraft carrier in naval exercises and publicized it with great fanfare. Iran does all of these things without the bomb. Just imagine what it will do with the bomb. Imagine the United States further down the road of appeasement, largely defenseless against this tyranny. You do not have to imagine much, though; simply look to North Korea. Because of a naive and failed nuclear agreement, that outlaw state acquired nuclear weapons. Now America is largely handcuffed, watching as this rogue regime builds more bombs and missiles capable of striking the U.S. homeland and endangering our allies. But perhaps an even more obvious result of this experiment with retreat is the resurgence or Russia. The President aspired for a reset with Russia and made one-sided concessions such as withdrawing ballistic missile defenses from Poland and the Czech Republic. [[Page S1553]] So Vladimir Putin saw these concessions as weakness and continues to violate the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty. The West refused to assist the new Ukranian President, so Putin invaded and stole Crimea. The Western response was modest sanctions. So Russian-supplied rebels shot a civilian airliner out of the sky in the heart of Europe. The President dithers in providing defensive weapons to Ukraine, so Putin reignites the war, takes Debaltseve, and stages outside Mariupol. When bombs and bullets were called for, blankets were rushed to the frontline. That is just in Ukraine. Putin is also testing NATO's resolve. Russia has tested a ballistic missile with multiple warheads, designed to threaten our European allies in direct violation of the INF treaty. Russian bombers recently flew over the English Channel, disrupting British civil aviation. Estonia asserts that Russia kidnapped an Estonian security officer on its Russian border. And Russia continues to intimidate and harass other NATO partners such as Sweden, Moldova, and Georgia. Finally, Russia's ability to continue its aggression will only grow because its defense spending has more than quadrupled over the last 15 years. Moreover, the Russian military today is qualitatively better than the old Soviet military, despite its smaller size, as Admiral Bill Gortney, Commander of NORAD testified just last week. Some say that falling oil prices will restrain Putin. In fact, Russia's Finance Minister recently announced 10 percent across-the- board budget cuts to all departments of their government--except defense. This should give us some insights into Putin's intentions and ambitions. Among major nation-state competitors, Russia's military buildup is exceeded only by China's. Over the same period of the last 15 years, China's military spending has increased by 600 percent. Moreover, the bulk of the spending is directed quite clearly against the United States as China pursues its anti-access and area denial strategy. This strategy is designed to keep American forces outside the so-called first island chain and give China regional hegemony from the Korean Peninsula to the Indonesian archipelago. Thus, China is on a spending spree for more submarines, aircraft carriers, antiship ballistic missiles, and other air and naval systems. The impact of China's rapid military expansion is clear. China has challenged Japan's control of the Senkaku Islands and purported to establish an exclusive air defense zone over the East China Sea. By expanding its activities in the Spratlys, China is precipitating a confrontation with the Philippines, Vietnam, Malaysia, and Taiwan. Further, China's repressive actions against protesters in Hong Kong only serve to undermine Taiwanese support of reunification, which itself could spark further Chinese aggression. All of this is to say nothing of China's cyber theft and economic espionage against American interests or its atrocious record on human rights. While America has retreated, not only have our enemies been on the march, our allies, anxious for years about American resolve, now worry increasingly about American capabilities. With the enemy on their borders, many have begun to conclude they have no choice but to take matters into their own hands, sometimes in ways unhelpful to our interests. Even our core NATO allies appear unsettled by our recent experiment with retreat. The French intervened in Mali to confront Islamic insurgents, but without adequate advance coordination, they quickly found themselves in need of emergency logistical support from our Air Force. Turkey just announced a new missile defense system that will not be interoperable with NATO systems. Greece has a new governing coalition that is hinting at greater cooperation with Russia. The picture is no better outside NATO. Japan has significantly increased its defense budget because of a rising China and may feel compelled to reinterpret its post-war constitutional ban on overseas ``collective self-defense.'' Saudi Arabia just entered a nuclear pact with South Korea, likely a response to Iran's nuclear program. Similarly, the Persian Gulf States have increased defense spending by 44 percent in the last 2 years. While we should encourage our partners to carry their share of the defense load, the Sunni states are building up their defenses, not to help us, but because they fear we won't help them against Iran. We should never take our allies for granted, but we also shouldn't take for granted the vast influence our security guarantees give us with our allies' behavior. Germany and Japan are not nuclear powers today because of our nuclear umbrella. Israel didn't retaliate against Hussein's Scud missile attacks in the gulf war, and thus we preserved the war coalition because we asked them for restraint and committed significant resources to hunting down Scud launchers. This kind of influence has been essential for American security throughout the postwar period, yet it has begun to wane as our allies doubt our commitment and our capabilities. Make no mistake, our military capabilities have declined. In recent years, we have dramatically underfunded our military to the detriment of our security. To fully understand the military aspect of our experiment with retreat, some historical perspective is needed. Defense spending reached its peak in 2008, when the base budget and wartime spending combined was $760 billion. Incredibly, the total defense budget plummeted by $200 billion in the last year. Today, defense spending is only 16 percent of all Federal spending, a historic low rivaled only by the post-Cold War period. To give some context, during the Cold War, defense spending regularly accounted for 60 percent of Federal spending. But if we don't end the experiment of retreat, this President will leave office with a mere 12 percent of all Federal dollars spent on defense. The picture is no prettier when cast in the light of our economy. In the early Cold War, defense spending was approximately 9 percent of gross domestic product. Today, it sits at a paltry 3.5 percent. But our defense budget isn't just about numbers and arithmetic. It is about our ability to accomplish the mission of defending our country from all threats. The consequences of these cuts are real, concrete, and immediate. As former Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta explained, these cuts to defense spending have put us on the path to the smallest Army since before World War II, the smallest Navy since World War, and the smallest Air Force ever. Let's look more closely at each service. Our Army has shrunk by nearly 100,000 troops. The Army has lost 13 combat brigades, and only a third of the remaining brigades are fully ready to meet America's threats. Further, investments in modernization have fallen by 25 percent. If we continue on the current path, the Army will lose another 70,000 soldiers, and every modernization program designed to preserve the Army's technological advantage will be eviscerated. The Navy, meanwhile, has had to cancel five ship deployments and significantly delay the deployment of a carrier strike group. The Navy's mission requires it to keep three carrier strike groups and amphibious readiness groups prepared to respond to a major crisis within 30 years, but the Navy can only fulfill a third of its mission because of cuts to maintenance and training. Similarly, the Air Force is less than one-third of its size 25 years ago. Moreover, the Air Force depends upon modernization to preserve its technological edge, perhaps more than any other service, but current funding levels could require cancellation of airborne-refueling tankers and surveillance aircraft, set back fighter and nuclear weapons modernization, and shorten the life of tactical airlift and weapons recovery programs. Nor are these impacts just immediate; they will be felt long into the future. Key programs, once divested, will be difficult to restart. Manufacturing competencies will be lost, the skilled-labor pool will shrink, and the defense manufacturing base will atrophy. Today's weapons systems and equipment will begin to age and break down. Our troops won't be able to train, and their weapons and equipment won't be ready to fight. In short, we will have a hollow force incapable of defending our national security. [[Page S1554]] What is to be done then? Our experiment with retreat must end. This Congress must again recognize that our national security is the first priority of this government. Our national security strategy must drive our military budget rather than the budget setting our strategy. The military budget must reflect the threats we face rather than the budget defining those threats. In the face of these threats and after years of improvident defense cuts, we must significantly increase our defense spending. After hundreds of billions of dollars of these cuts, the base defense budget next year is set to be only $498 billion. That is wholly inadequate. Secretary of Defense Ash Carter recently testified: ``I want to be clear about this--parts of our nation's defense strategy cannot be executed under sequestration.'' All four of the military service chiefs, in addition, have testified that these cuts put American lives at risk. The President has proposed a modest increase to $534 billion, which is better than nothing. Senators John McCain and Jack Reed have called for the full repeal of sequestration, which would raise the base defense budget to $577 billion. I applaud and thank these veterans of both the Senate and our military for this correct and clear-eyed recommendation. Yet I also want to highlight their support for the recommendation of the National Defense Panel, which estimated that base defense spending for fiscal year 2016 should be $611 billion at a minimum. The National Defense Panel was a bipartisan group of eminent national security experts convened by Congress to analyze the Quadrennial Defense Review. They unanimously concluded that then-Secretary of Defense Bob Gates' fiscal year 2012 budget was the proper starting point to analyze our current defense needs--for at least two reasons. First, Secretary Gates had already initiated significant defense cuts and reforms totaling $478 billion. It is hard to say, given those efforts, that his 2012 budget had left much fat in the Department of Defense. Second, Secretary Gates and the Department assembled and submitted this budget in late January 2010 and early 2011, or just months before the Budget Control Act with its draconian defense cuts became law. That budget, therefore, was the last time the Defense Department was able to submit a threat- and strategy-based budget, instead of the budget-based strategies we have seen over the last 4 years. This logic is compelling, even unassailable. Thus, I agree we should spend not merely $611 billion on the base defense budget next year but substantially more than that. After all, as we have seen earlier, and as the National Defense Panel has noted, the world has become much more dangerous since 2011. Islamic terrorism, Iranian aggression, Russian revisionism, and Chinese interventionism have all worsened--to say nothing of other challenges. The $611 billion is necessary, but it is not sufficient. What then should our defense budget be next year? I will readily admit we cannot be sure how much is needed above $611 billion. As the National Defense Panel explained, ``because of the highly constrained and unstable budget environment under which the Department has been working,'' the Quadrennial Review ``is not adequate as a comprehensive long-term planning document.'' Thus, the panel recommends that Congress ``should ask the Department for such a plan, which should be developed without undue emphasis on current budgetary restraints.'' I endorse this recommendation. In the meantime, though, even if we can't specify a precise dollar amount, we can identify the critical needs on which to spend the additional money. First, our military faces a readiness crisis from budget cuts and a decade of war. Our young soldiers, sailors, airmen, and marines are the greatest weapons systems our country could ever have, but they need training--live-fire exercises, flight time, and so forth. Their weapons, equipment, and vehicles need maintenance and reset. If we faced a major crisis today, our troops would no doubt suffer more casualties and greater likelihood of mission failure. Of course, they know all of this, and morale suffers because of it. Second and related, our military is shrinking rapidly to historically small levels. This decline must be reversed. Our Navy probably needs 350-plus ships, not a budget-dictated 260 ships. The Army needs to maintain its pre-9/11 end strength of 490,000 Active-Duty soldiers, as the Marine Corps needs 182,000 marines. The Air Force needs more aircraft of virtually every type--bomber, fighter, airlift, and surveillance. It is the deepest folly to reduce our military below its 1990s size as the world has grown considerably more dangerous since that quiet decade. Third, we should increase research, development, and procurement funds to ensure our military retains its historic technological advantage, particularly as our adversaries gain more access to advanced, low-cost technologies. This should start with the essential tools of command and control: cyber space, space, and intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance. The Air Force needs to modernize its bomber and mobility aircraft, in particular. The Navy needs to continue to improve its surface-ship and especially its submarine capabilities. These critical priorities will no doubt be expensive, probably tens of billions of dollars more than the $611 billion baseline suggested by the National Defense Panel. Because the massive cuts to our defense budget resulted in part from record deficits, the question arises, however: Can we afford all of this? The answer is yes--without question and without doubt, yes. The facts here, as we have seen, are indisputable. The defense budget has been slashed by hundreds of billions of dollars over the last 6 years. The defense budget is only 16 percent of all Federal spending, a historic low and heading much lower if we don't act. And using the broadest measure of affordability and national priorities, defense spending as a percentage of our economy, last year we spent only 3.5 percent of our national income on defense, which is approaching historic lows and may surpass them by 2019. Let us assume, for the sake of argument, that our military needs $700 billion in the coming year, an immediate increase of $200 billion. To some, that may sound staggering and unrealistic, yet it would still be barely 4 percent of our economy--a full 1 percent lower than the 5 percent from which President Reagan started his buildup. If we increased spending merely to that level--which both President Reagan and a Democratic House considered dangerously low--we would spend $885 billion on defense next year. Furthermore, trying to balance the budget through defense cuts is both counterproductive and impossible. First, the threats we face will eventually catch up with us, as they did on September 11, and we will have no choice but to increase our defense budget. When we do, it will cost more to achieve the same end state of readiness and modernization than it would have without the intervening cuts. This was the lesson we learned in the 1980s after the severe cuts to defense in the 1970s. Second, we need a healthy, growing economy to generate the government revenue necessary to fund our military and balance the budget. In our globalized world, our domestic prosperity depends heavily on the world economy, which, of course, requires stability and order. Who provides that stability and order? The U.S. military. Finally, in the short term, ephemeral gains in deficit reduction from defense cuts merely mask the genuine driver of our long-term debt crisis: retirement and health care programs. The Budget Control Act ultimately failed to control these programs--a failure not only of promises made to our citizens but also because the deficit-reduction default became annual discretionary funding, particularly the defense budget. In the 4 years since, relative deficits have declined, alleviating the imperative to reform these programs yet doing nothing to solve their long-term insolvency and our debt crisis. A better question to ask is: Can we afford to continue our experiment in retreat? I suggest we cannot. Imagine a world in which we continue our current trajectory, where America remains in retreat and our military loses even more of its edge. What would such a world look like? It is not a pretty picture. Russia might soon possess the entire north shore of the Black Sea. An emboldened [[Page S1555]] Putin, sensing Western weakness for what it is, could be tempted to replay his Ukrainian playbook in Estonia or Latvia, forcing NATO into war or obsolescence. China could escalate its island conflicts in the East and South China Seas. Without an adequate American response--or worse, with China denying American forces access to those seas--countries as diverse as South Korea, Japan, Taiwan, and the Philippines would feel compelled to conciliate or confront regional stability. While North Korea already possesses nuclear weapons, Iran appears to be on the path to a nuclear bomb, whether it breaks or upholds a potential nuclear agreement. Not only might Iran use its weapon, but its nuclear umbrella would also embolden its drive for regional hegemony. Moreover, Iran could provide its terrorist proxies with nuclear materials. And does anyone doubt that Saudi Arabia and other Sunni states will follow Iran down this path? Nuclear tripwires may soon ring the world's most volatile region, increasing the risk of nuclear war, as well as the possibility that Islamist insurgents might seize nuclear materials if they can topple the right government. Islamic terrorists, meanwhile, will continue to rampage throughout Syria and Iraq, aspiring always for more attacks in Europe and on American soil. Emboldened by America's retreat and by their own battlefield successes, they will continue to attract thousands of hateful fighters from around the world, all eager for the chance to kill Americans. All these are nightmare scenarios, but sadly not unrealistic ones. The alternative, however, is not war. No leader--whether a President, a general or platoon leader--wishes to put his troops in harm's way. War is an awful thing, and it takes an unimaginable toll on the men and women who fight it and their families. But the best way to avoid war is to be willing and prepared to fight a war in the first place. That is the alternative: military strength and moral confidence in the defense of America's national security. Our enemies and allies alike must know that aggressors will pay an unspeakable price for challenging the United States. The best way to impose that price is global military dominance. When it comes to war, narrow margins are not enough, for they are nothing more than an invitation to war. We must have such hegemonic strength that no sane adversary would ever imagine challenging the United States. ``Good enough'' is not and will never be good enough. We can look to a very recent historic example to prove this point. Just 25 years ago, a dominant American military ended the Cold War without firing a shot. If we return to the dominance of that era, aggressive despots such as Vladimir Putin, rising powers such as China, and state sponsors of terrorism such as Iran's Ayatollahs will think long and hard before crossing us. And while we may not deter terrorist groups such as the Islamic State, Al Qaeda, and Hezbollah, we will kill their adherents more effectively, while also sending a needed lesson to their sympathizers: Join and you too will die. Bringing about this future by being prepared for war will no doubt take a lot of money. But what could be a higher priority than a safe and prosperous America, leading a stable and orderly world? What better use of precious taxpayer dollars? What more lessons from history do we need? I began with Churchill's prescient words from 1933. Alas, the West did not take his advice, did not rearm and prepare to deter Nazi Germany. The predictable result was the German remilitarization of the Rhineland and the long march to war. Now let me close with his regretful words from 1936: The era of procrastination, of half-measures, of soothing and baffling expedients, of delays, is coming to its close. In its place we are entering a period of consequences. Churchill later called World War II the unnecessary war because it could have been stopped so easily with Western strength and confidence in the 1930s. I know many of you in this Chamber stand with me, and I humbly urge you all--Democrat and Republican alike--to join in rebuilding our common defense, so that we will not face our own unnecessary war, our own period of consequences. I will now yield the floor, but I will never yield in the defense of America's national security on any front or at any time. The PRESIDING OFFICER.

[[page s1553]] so vladimir putin saw these concessions as weakness and continues to violate the intermediate-range nuclear forces treaty. the west refused to assist the new ukranian president, so putin invaded and stole crimea. the western response was modest sanctions. so russian-supplied rebels shot a civilian airliner out of the sky in the heart of europe. the president dithers in providing defensive weapons to ukraine, so putin reignites the war, takes debaltseve, and stages outside mariupol. when bombs and bullets were called for, blankets were rushed to the frontline. that is just in ukraine. putin is also testing nato's resolve. russia has tested a ballistic missile with multiple warheads, designed to threaten our european allies in direct violation of the inf treaty. russian bombers recently flew over the english channel, disrupting british civil aviation. estonia asserts that russia kidnapped an estonian security officer on its russian border. and russia continues to intimidate and harass other nato partners such as sweden, moldova, and georgia. finally, russia's ability to continue its aggression will only grow because its defense spending has more than quadrupled over the last 15 years. moreover, the russian military today is qualitatively better than the old soviet military, despite its smaller size, as admiral bill gortney, commander of norad testified just last week. some say that falling oil prices will restrain putin. in fact, russia's finance minister recently announced 10 percent across-the- board budget cuts to all departments of their government--except defense. this should give us some insights into putin's intentions and ambitions. among major nation-state competitors, russia's military buildup is exceeded only by china's. over the same period of the last 15 years, china's military spending has increased by 600 percent. moreover, the bulk of the spending is directed quite clearly against the united states as china pursues its anti-access and area denial strategy. this strategy is designed to keep american forces outside the so-called first island chain and give china regional hegemony from the korean peninsula to the indonesian archipelago. thus, china is on a spending spree for more submarines, aircraft carriers, antiship ballistic missiles, and other air and naval systems. the impact of china's rapid military expansion is clear. china has challenged japan's control of the senkaku islands and purported to establish an exclusive air defense zone over the east china sea. by expanding its activities in the spratlys, china is precipitating a confrontation with the philippines, vietnam, malaysia, and taiwan. further, china's repressive actions against protesters in hong kong only serve to undermine taiwanese support of reunification, which itself could spark further chinese aggression. all of this is to say nothing of china's cyber theft and economic espionage against american interests or its atrocious record on human rights. while america has retreated, not only have our enemies been on the march, our allies, anxious for years about american resolve, now worry increasingly about american capabilities. with the enemy on their borders, many have begun to conclude they have no choice but to take matters into their own hands, sometimes in ways unhelpful to our interests. even our core nato allies appear unsettled by our recent experiment with retreat. the french intervened in mali to confront islamic insurgents, but without adequate advance coordination, they quickly found themselves in need of emergency logistical support from our air force. turkey just announced a new missile defense system that will not be interoperable with nato systems. greece has a new governing coalition that is hinting at greater cooperation with russia. the picture is no better outside nato. japan has significantly increased its defense budget because of a rising china and may feel compelled to reinterpret its post-war constitutional ban on overseas ``collective self-defense.'' saudi arabia just entered a nuclear pact with south korea, likely a response to iran's nuclear program. similarly, the persian gulf states have increased defense spending by 44 percent in the last 2 years. while we should encourage our partners to carry their share of the defense load, the sunni states are building up their defenses, not to help us, but because they fear we won't help them against iran. we should never take our allies for granted, but we also shouldn't take for granted the vast influence our security guarantees give us with our allies' behavior. germany and japan are not nuclear powers today because of our nuclear umbrella. israel didn't retaliate against hussein's scud missile attacks in the gulf war, and thus we preserved the war coalition because we asked them for restraint and committed significant resources to hunting down scud launchers. this kind of influence has been essential for american security throughout the postwar period, yet it has begun to wane as our allies doubt our commitment and our capabilities. make no mistake, our military capabilities have declined. in recent years, we have dramatically underfunded our military to the detriment of our security. to fully understand the military aspect of our experiment with retreat, some historical perspective is needed. defense spending reached its peak in 2008, when the base budget and wartime spending combined was $760 billion. incredibly, the total defense budget plummeted by $200 billion in the last year. today, defense spending is only 16 percent of all federal spending, a historic low rivaled only by the post-cold war period. to give some context, during the cold war, defense spending regularly accounted for 60 percent of federal spending. but if we don't end the experiment of retreat, this president will leave office with a mere 12 percent of all federal dollars spent on defense. the picture is no prettier when cast in the light of our economy. in the early cold war, defense spending was approximately 9 percent of gross domestic product. today, it sits at a paltry 3.5 percent. but our defense budget isn't just about numbers and arithmetic. it is about our ability to accomplish the mission of defending our country from all threats. the consequences of these cuts are real, concrete, and immediate. as former secretary of defense leon panetta explained, these cuts to defense spending have put us on the path to the smallest army since before world war ii, the smallest navy since world war, and the smallest air force ever. let's look more closely at each service. our army has shrunk by nearly 100,000 troops. the army has lost 13 combat brigades, and only a third of the remaining brigades are fully ready to meet america's threats. further, investments in modernization have fallen by 25 percent. if we continue on the current path, the army will lose another 70,000 soldiers, and every modernization program designed to preserve the army's technological advantage will be eviscerated. the navy, meanwhile, has had to cancel five ship deployments and significantly delay the deployment of a carrier strike group. the navy's mission requires it to keep three carrier strike groups and amphibious readiness groups prepared to respond to a major crisis within 30 years, but the navy can only fulfill a third of its mission because of cuts to maintenance and training. similarly, the air force is less than one-third of its size 25 years ago. moreover, the air force depends upon modernization to preserve its technological edge, perhaps more than any other service, but current funding levels could require cancellation of airborne-refueling tankers and surveillance aircraft, set back fighter and nuclear weapons modernization, and shorten the life of tactical airlift and weapons recovery programs. nor are these impacts just immediate; they will be felt long into the future. key programs, once divested, will be difficult to restart. manufacturing competencies will be lost, the skilled-labor pool will shrink, and the defense manufacturing base will atrophy. today's weapons systems and equipment will begin to age and break down. our troops won't be able to train, and their weapons and equipment won't be ready to fight. in short, we will have a hollow force incapable of defending our national security. [[page s1554]] what is to be done then? our experiment with retreat must end. this congress must again recognize that our national security is the first priority of this government. our national security strategy must drive our military budget rather than the budget setting our strategy. the military budget must reflect the threats we face rather than the budget defining those threats. in the face of these threats and after years of improvident defense cuts, we must significantly increase our defense spending. after hundreds of billions of dollars of these cuts, the base defense budget next year is set to be only $498 billion. that is wholly inadequate. secretary of defense ash carter recently testified: ``i want to be clear about this--parts of our nation's defense strategy cannot be executed under sequestration.'' all four of the military service chiefs, in addition, have testified that these cuts put american lives at risk. the president has proposed a modest increase to $534 billion, which is better than nothing. senators john mccain and jack reed have called for the full repeal of sequestration, which would raise the base defense budget to $577 billion. i applaud and thank these veterans of both the senate and our military for this correct and clear-eyed recommendation. yet i also want to highlight their support for the recommendation of the national defense panel, which estimated that base defense spending for fiscal year 2016 should be $611 billion at a minimum. the national defense panel was a bipartisan group of eminent national security experts convened by congress to analyze the quadrennial defense review. they unanimously concluded that then-secretary of defense bob gates' fiscal year 2012 budget was the proper starting point to analyze our current defense needs--for at least two reasons. first, secretary gates had already initiated significant defense cuts and reforms totaling $478 billion. it is hard to say, given those efforts, that his 2012 budget had left much fat in the department of defense. second, secretary gates and the department assembled and submitted this budget in late january 2010 and early 2011, or just months before the budget control act with its draconian defense cuts became law. that budget, therefore, was the last time the defense department was able to submit a threat- and strategy-based budget, instead of the budget-based strategies we have seen over the last 4 years. this logic is compelling, even unassailable. thus, i agree we should spend not merely $611 billion on the base defense budget next year but substantially more than that. after all, as we have seen earlier, and as the national defense panel has noted, the world has become much more dangerous since 2011. islamic terrorism, iranian aggression, russian revisionism, and chinese interventionism have all worsened--to say nothing of other challenges. the $611 billion is necessary, but it is not sufficient. what then should our defense budget be next year? i will readily admit we cannot be sure how much is needed above $611 billion. as the national defense panel explained, ``because of the highly constrained and unstable budget environment under which the department has been working,'' the quadrennial review ``is not adequate as a comprehensive long-term planning document.'' thus, the panel recommends that congress ``should ask the department for such a plan, which should be developed without undue emphasis on current budgetary restraints.'' i endorse this recommendation. in the meantime, though, even if we can't specify a precise dollar amount, we can identify the critical needs on which to spend the additional money. first, our military faces a readiness crisis from budget cuts and a decade of war. our young soldiers, sailors, airmen, and marines are the greatest weapons systems our country could ever have, but they need training--live-fire exercises, flight time, and so forth. their weapons, equipment, and vehicles need maintenance and reset. if we faced a major crisis today, our troops would no doubt suffer more casualties and greater likelihood of mission failure. of course, they know all of this, and morale suffers because of it. second and related, our military is shrinking rapidly to historically small levels. this decline must be reversed. our navy probably needs 350-plus ships, not a budget-dictated 260 ships. the army needs to maintain its pre-9/11 end strength of 490,000 active-duty soldiers, as the marine corps needs 182,000 marines. the air force needs more aircraft of virtually every type--bomber, fighter, airlift, and surveillance. it is the deepest folly to reduce our military below its 1990s size as the world has grown considerably more dangerous since that quiet decade. third, we should increase research, development, and procurement funds to ensure our military retains its historic technological advantage, particularly as our adversaries gain more access to advanced, low-cost technologies. this should start with the essential tools of command and control: cyber space, space, and intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance. the air force needs to modernize its bomber and mobility aircraft, in particular. the navy needs to continue to improve its surface-ship and especially its submarine capabilities. these critical priorities will no doubt be expensive, probably tens of billions of dollars more than the $611 billion baseline suggested by the national defense panel. because the massive cuts to our defense budget resulted in part from record deficits, the question arises, however: can we afford all of this? the answer is yes--without question and without doubt, yes. the facts here, as we have seen, are indisputable. the defense budget has been slashed by hundreds of billions of dollars over the last 6 years. the defense budget is only 16 percent of all federal spending, a historic low and heading much lower if we don't act. and using the broadest measure of affordability and national priorities, defense spending as a percentage of our economy, last year we spent only 3.5 percent of our national income on defense, which is approaching historic lows and may surpass them by 2019. let us assume, for the sake of argument, that our military needs $700 billion in the coming year, an immediate increase of $200 billion. to some, that may sound staggering and unrealistic, yet it would still be barely 4 percent of our economy--a full 1 percent lower than the 5 percent from which president reagan started his buildup. if we increased spending merely to that level--which both president reagan and a democratic house considered dangerously low--we would spend $885 billion on defense next year. furthermore, trying to balance the budget through defense cuts is both counterproductive and impossible. first, the threats we face will eventually catch up with us, as they did on september 11, and we will have no choice but to increase our defense budget. when we do, it will cost more to achieve the same end state of readiness and modernization than it would have without the intervening cuts. this was the lesson we learned in the 1980s after the severe cuts to defense in the 1970s. second, we need a healthy, growing economy to generate the government revenue necessary to fund our military and balance the budget. in our globalized world, our domestic prosperity depends heavily on the world economy, which, of course, requires stability and order. who provides that stability and order? the u.s. military. finally, in the short term, ephemeral gains in deficit reduction from defense cuts merely mask the genuine driver of our long-term debt crisis: retirement and health care programs. the budget control act ultimately failed to control these programs--a failure not only of promises made to our citizens but also because the deficit-reduction default became annual discretionary funding, particularly the defense budget. in the 4 years since, relative deficits have declined, alleviating the imperative to reform these programs yet doing nothing to solve their long-term insolvency and our debt crisis. a better question to ask is: can we afford to continue our experiment in retreat? i suggest we cannot. imagine a world in which we continue our current trajectory, where america remains in retreat and our military loses even more of its edge. what would such a world look like? it is not a pretty picture. russia might soon possess the entire north shore of the black sea. an emboldened [[page s1555]] putin, sensing western weakness for what it is, could be tempted to replay his ukrainian playbook in estonia or latvia, forcing nato into war or obsolescence. china could escalate its island conflicts in the east and south china seas. without an adequate american response--or worse, with china denying american forces access to those seas--countries as diverse as south korea, japan, taiwan, and the philippines would feel compelled to conciliate or confront regional stability. while north korea already possesses nuclear weapons, iran appears to be on the path to a nuclear bomb, whether it breaks or upholds a potential nuclear agreement. not only might iran use its weapon, but its nuclear umbrella would also embolden its drive for regional hegemony. moreover, iran could provide its terrorist proxies with nuclear materials. and does anyone doubt that saudi arabia and other sunni states will follow iran down this path? nuclear tripwires may soon ring the world's most volatile region, increasing the risk of nuclear war, as well as the possibility that islamist insurgents might seize nuclear materials if they can topple the right government. islamic terrorists, meanwhile, will continue to rampage throughout syria and iraq, aspiring always for more attacks in europe and on american soil. emboldened by america's retreat and by their own battlefield successes, they will continue to attract thousands of hateful fighters from around the world, all eager for the chance to kill americans. all these are nightmare scenarios, but sadly not unrealistic ones. the alternative, however, is not war. no leader--whether a president, a general or platoon leader--wishes to put his troops in harm's way. war is an awful thing, and it takes an unimaginable toll on the men and women who fight it and their families. but the best way to avoid war is to be willing and prepared to fight a war in the first place. that is the alternative: military strength and moral confidence in the defense of america's national security. our enemies and allies alike must know that aggressors will pay an unspeakable price for challenging the united states. the best way to impose that price is global military dominance. when it comes to war, narrow margins are not enough, for they are nothing more than an invitation to war. we must have such hegemonic strength that no sane adversary would ever imagine challenging the united states. ``good enough'' is not and will never be good enough. we can look to a very recent historic example to prove this point. just 25 years ago, a dominant american military ended the cold war without firing a shot. if we return to the dominance of that era, aggressive despots such as vladimir putin, rising powers such as china, and state sponsors of terrorism such as iran's ayatollahs will think long and hard before crossing us. and while we may not deter terrorist groups such as the islamic state, al qaeda, and hezbollah, we will kill their adherents more effectively, while also sending a needed lesson to their sympathizers: join and you too will die. bringing about this future by being prepared for war will no doubt take a lot of money. but what could be a higher priority than a safe and prosperous america, leading a stable and orderly world? what better use of precious taxpayer dollars? what more lessons from history do we need? i began with churchill's prescient words from 1933. alas, the west did not take his advice, did not rearm and prepare to deter nazi germany. the predictable result was the german remilitarization of the rhineland and the long march to war. now let me close with his regretful words from 1936: the era of procrastination, of half-measures, of soothing and baffling expedients, of delays, is coming to its close. in its place we are entering a period of consequences. churchill later called world war ii the unnecessary war because it could have been stopped so easily with western strength and confidence in the 1930s. i know many of you in this chamber stand with me, and i humbly urge you all--democrat and republican alike--to join in rebuilding our common defense, so that we will not face our own unnecessary war, our own period of consequences. i will now yield the floor, but i will never yield in the defense of america's national security on any front or at any time. the presiding officer. the majority leader. ____________________",28840

CREC-2015-03-16-pt1-PgS1555-2,CREC-2015-03-16,114,CHILDREN'S HEALTH INSURANCE PROGRAM,"[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 44 (Monday, March 16, 2015)] [Senate] [Pages S1555-S1557] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] CHILDREN'S HEALTH INSURANCE PROGRAM Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, time is running out for us to extend the Children's Health Insurance Program, a program that began almost 20 years ago in this body and the other body and that right now is taking care of 10 million children--the children of parents who in most cases have full-time jobs that don't offer insurance and full-time jobs that don't pay enough so these families can buy insurance for their children. We know that CHIP works. It works for parents, and it works for children. We know that if we don't act now, States will start rolling back the CHIP programs. Legislatures are adjourning almost as we speak. We need to provide States with certainty so they can budget for CHIP now and 4 years into the future. Unfortunately, the deal currently being floated in the House would not fund CHIP for a full 4 years. Instead, if reports are true, it would permanently repeal the sustainable growth rate--the so-called doctors fix--while failing to provide much needed certainty to children's health care. I want to take care of doctors. I want to make sure this is done right because it affects doctors. It affects doctors' ability to deliver care. It affects those patients whom doctors serve. But how do we leave here taking care of the doctors permanently and shortchanging children, only giving them 2 years of health insurance? It is past time we fix SGR. In 2001, when I was a member of the House, Congressman Bilirakis as the Republican chair of the Health Subcommittee of the Energy and Commerce Committee and I as the Democratic ranking member wrote the first SGR fix, so I have been fixing the SGR for a long time. But we shouldn't be focused in this body and that body on paying doctors at the cost of shortchanging our children. Our priority must be passing a full 4-year, clean extension of the current CHIP program, on which 130,000 children in my State depend--again, sons and daughters of working Oklahoma families and working Ohio families who are working in jobs where they simply don't get insurance and don't get paid enough that they can buy insurance. These 10 million children in our Nation depend on this. A 4-year extension of CHIP will provide Congress, the administration, and our States with the necessary time to collect relevant data and information to fully analyze and prepare for the future of kids covered. Doing only 2 years is not just shortchanging these children and creating anxiety in their families, it is also truncating our ability, compromising our ability to really understand how to fully integrate CHIP into a health care system overall in the future. We should be providing certainty and stability for these families, not the cliche of kicking the can down the road in favor of a short-term fix. A [[Page S1556]] 4-year extension provides that certainty and will make a difference into the next decade on how, in fact, we take care of low-income children. In Ohio alone, CHIP provides insurance to 130,000 children. Enrollment is expected to grow over the next couple of years. I have traveled across Ohio in the last few weeks and have met with parents and children, doctors and nurses, to discuss CHIP. I have been to Cincinnati Children's Hospital and Toledo Children's Hospital, Columbus's Nationwide Children's Hospital and Cleveland's Rainbow Children's Hospital. This morning, I was in Mahoning Valley in Boardman, a suburb of Youngstown, at the Akron Children's Hospital. More than 6,000 children in Mahoning Valley rely on CHIP for care. I met with Ericka Flaherty, a Youngstown parent whose children could lose comprehensive coverage if we don't extend CHIP now. Her son Chase was born prematurely, born at 27 weeks. He was immediately diagnosed with a number of chronic conditions, including a heart defect, chronic lung disease, and asthma. Chase spent more than 4 months in neonatal care, and, thanks to outstanding doctors at Akron Children's Hospital, he is alive and growing today. But he needs many routine medical visits--visits his family simply can't afford. His parents work, but they simply can't afford to treat his conditions, including visits to lung specialists, neurologists, an eye specialist, and the regular hospital checkup every 2 months. Without CHIP, Ericka would face significant financial hurdles in getting Chase the care he needs. I also met with Jessica Miller of Lisbon, a community just south of Mahoning County, during this roundtable. Her youngest son, Payton, was diagnosed with a serious respiratory condition. He had to be life- flighted to Akron Children's Hospital to receive care when he couldn't breathe. He has been diagnosed with type 1 juvenile diabetes. His grandmother joined us. Jessica told me that she is so thankful for CHIP, that she gets Payton all the care he needs to treat these conditions--care she and her husband Justin would have a hard time affording otherwise. Justin is working as a paramedic. He was called out and couldn't be at our meeting today. Justin is full time in nursing school. They are making something of their lives. I don't want them to be anxious about the health care of their children. Throughout Ohio, I hear the same thing: Providing health insurance to children like Chase and Payton isn't just the right thing to do, it is the smart thing to do. It means children do better in school. They feel better when they are in school. They miss fewer days in school because they get preventive care because their health care needs are taken care of. CHIP has been around 18, almost 20 years. It has always been bipartisan. If we follow these children later in life, we see they have higher rates of going to college and higher earnings than non-CHIP kids who don't have insurance. By all kinds of very quantifiable measurements, CHIP is not just good for those families, it is not just the right thing to do to continue to fund CHIP over 4 years, it is also the smart thing to do for our country. Together with more than 40 of my colleagues, I introduced the Protecting & Retaining Our Children's Health Insurance Program--PRO- CHIP--Act, which is a clean 4-year extension of funding for CHIP. PRO- CHIP would protect the Pediatric Quality Measures Program and provide funding to sustain this program through 2019. It would also extend the Performance Incentive Program, which provides bonus payments to States that help increase Medicaid enrollment among children, because if we provide insurance for low- income children, they are going to do better, and society is going to do better. They are less likely to end up in the emergency room for something much more serious. For instance, for a child without insurance who has an earache, the mother and father think that it is going to cost a lot of money to go to the doctor and that maybe it will just get better, they wait a week. Into the second week, the pain is worse. The child can't sleep. The child cries. They eventually go to the emergency room, which costs a lot more money than going to the doctor's office, with the possibility that the child has had hearing loss. That is just one example of why we want to provide insurance and get them into the doctor early rather than waiting until later. PRO-CHIP has been endorsed by every children's hospital in Ohio, the Association of Children's Hospitals, virtually every children's hospital, I believe, in the country, and other national groups--the March of Dimes, the American Academy of Pediatrics, the Children's Hospital Association, and Families USA, all of which want a clean CHIP. All of them want a 4-year extension for all the reasons we talked about. More than 1,500 organizations from across the country--including more than 75 groups from Ohio and a number from Oklahoma, the Presiding Officer's State--have written to Congress asking us to ``take action as soon as possible to provide a four-year funding extension for CHIP.'' Groups, including the Urban Institute, the Medicaid and CHIP Payment and Access Commission, and the Bipartisan Policy Center, have all noted the importance of the current CHIP program. The Urban Institute estimated that an additional 1.1 million children will become uninsured if separate CHIP coverage were eliminated. Again, these are sons and daughters of parents who have jobs--jobs that don't provide insurance and jobs that don't pay enough that they can afford insurance. This would be a 40-percent increase, if this were to happen, in the number of uninsured children in the United States relative to the number projected under the ACA with the continuation of CHIP. The Bipartisan Policy Center has called for extending CHIP for more than just the 2 years, but note what they say when calling for a CHIP extension: ``Two years does not provide sufficient time for state and federal elected officials and agencies to address major programmatic changes sought by policymakers on both sides of the aisle and at both levels of government.'' Support for CHIP has always been bipartisan. Senator Hatch, Republican from Utah; Senator Kennedy, Democrat from Massachusetts; a number of us on the Energy and Commerce Committee in the House of Representatives back in 1997, Republicans and Democrats alike; and Chairman Bilirakis and I and others helped to write this legislation which has been successful at bringing the uninsured rate for children down by more than 50 percent. I am encouraged that Members of both parties have shown a willingness to come together. Senate Democrats will have a hard time supporting any plan that doesn't extend CHIP for a full 4 years. I want to support the sustainable growth rate. I helped write the original one. I have supported it for 20 years. We shouldn't be doing it like this on a temporary 1- or 2-year basis. This is finally going to get done right, but we don't do that and then leave out the children by only providing 2 years. Parents like Ericka and Jessica face enough uncertainty with their children's health. Most of us in this body are parents, and a number of us are grandparents. Most of us, because we dress like this and we are Senators and have good insurance provided by taxpayers--we may have anxiety about our children and our grandchildren's health, but we don't have anxiety about their insurance and their ability to go to hospitals and doctors and specialists to get care. Certainly, we are anxious about our children and all the things that could happen, but our anxiety doesn't reach into the whole sphere of worrying about how to provide insurance for children. Ericka and Jessica can't be anything but anxious when they hear that CHIP could end, and they understand that it should be 4 years. CHIP gives parents like them peace of mind that they will be able to get their children the care they need without bankrupting those families. We need to make sure these parents continue to have that peace of mind with a 4-year extension. The PRO-CHIP legislation we have introduced in the Senate with almost four dozen cosponsors makes sure those kids don't lose critical coverage by saying no to any deal that doesn't fund CHIP for the full 4 years.

Mr. President, time is running out for us to extend the Children's Health Insurance Program, a program that began almost 20 years ago in this body and the other body and that right now is taking care of 10 million children--the children of parents who in most cases have full-time jobs that don't offer insurance and full-time jobs that don't pay enough so these families can buy insurance for their children. We know that CHIP works. It works for parents, and it works for children. We know that if we don't act now, States will start rolling back the CHIP programs. Legislatures are adjourning almost as we speak. We need to provide States with certainty so they can budget for CHIP now and 4 years into the future. Unfortunately, the deal currently being floated in the House would not fund CHIP for a full 4 years. Instead, if reports are true, it would permanently repeal the sustainable growth rate--the so-called doctors fix--while failing to provide much needed certainty to children's health care. I want to take care of doctors. I want to make sure this is done right because it affects doctors. It affects doctors' ability to deliver care. It affects those patients whom doctors serve. But how do we leave here taking care of the doctors permanently and shortchanging children, only giving them 2 years of health insurance? It is past time we fix SGR. In 2001, when I was a member of the House, Congressman Bilirakis as the Republican chair of the Health Subcommittee of the Energy and Commerce Committee and I as the Democratic ranking member wrote the first SGR fix, so I have been fixing the SGR for a long time. But we shouldn't be focused in this body and that body on paying doctors at the cost of shortchanging our children. Our priority must be passing a full 4-year, clean extension of the current CHIP program, on which 130,000 children in my State depend--again, sons and daughters of working Oklahoma families and working Ohio families who are working in jobs where they simply don't get insurance and don't get paid enough that they can buy insurance. These 10 million children in our Nation depend on this. A 4-year extension of CHIP will provide Congress, the administration, and our States with the necessary time to collect relevant data and information to fully analyze and prepare for the future of kids covered. Doing only 2 years is not just shortchanging these children and creating anxiety in their families, it is also truncating our ability, compromising our ability to really understand how to fully integrate CHIP into a health care system overall in the future. We should be providing certainty and stability for these families, not the cliche of kicking the can down the road in favor of a short-term fix. A [[Page S1556]] 4-year extension provides that certainty and will make a difference into the next decade on how, in fact, we take care of low-income children. In Ohio alone, CHIP provides insurance to 130,000 children. Enrollment is expected to grow over the next couple of years. I have traveled across Ohio in the last few weeks and have met with parents and children, doctors and nurses, to discuss CHIP. I have been to Cincinnati Children's Hospital and Toledo Children's Hospital, Columbus's Nationwide Children's Hospital and Cleveland's Rainbow Children's Hospital. This morning, I was in Mahoning Valley in Boardman, a suburb of Youngstown, at the Akron Children's Hospital. More than 6,000 children in Mahoning Valley rely on CHIP for care. I met with Ericka Flaherty, a Youngstown parent whose children could lose comprehensive coverage if we don't extend CHIP now. Her son Chase was born prematurely, born at 27 weeks. He was immediately diagnosed with a number of chronic conditions, including a heart defect, chronic lung disease, and asthma. Chase spent more than 4 months in neonatal care, and, thanks to outstanding doctors at Akron Children's Hospital, he is alive and growing today. But he needs many routine medical visits--visits his family simply can't afford. His parents work, but they simply can't afford to treat his conditions, including visits to lung specialists, neurologists, an eye specialist, and the regular hospital checkup every 2 months. Without CHIP, Ericka would face significant financial hurdles in getting Chase the care he needs. I also met with Jessica Miller of Lisbon, a community just south of Mahoning County, during this roundtable. Her youngest son, Payton, was diagnosed with a serious respiratory condition. He had to be life- flighted to Akron Children's Hospital to receive care when he couldn't breathe. He has been diagnosed with type 1 juvenile diabetes. His grandmother joined us. Jessica told me that she is so thankful for CHIP, that she gets Payton all the care he needs to treat these conditions--care she and her husband Justin would have a hard time affording otherwise. Justin is working as a paramedic. He was called out and couldn't be at our meeting today. Justin is full time in nursing school. They are making something of their lives. I don't want them to be anxious about the health care of their children. Throughout Ohio, I hear the same thing: Providing health insurance to children like Chase and Payton isn't just the right thing to do, it is the smart thing to do. It means children do better in school. They feel better when they are in school. They miss fewer days in school because they get preventive care because their health care needs are taken care of. CHIP has been around 18, almost 20 years. It has always been bipartisan. If we follow these children later in life, we see they have higher rates of going to college and higher earnings than non-CHIP kids who don't have insurance. By all kinds of very quantifiable measurements, CHIP is not just good for those families, it is not just the right thing to do to continue to fund CHIP over 4 years, it is also the smart thing to do for our country. Together with more than 40 of my colleagues, I introduced the Protecting & Retaining Our Children's Health Insurance Program--PRO- CHIP--Act, which is a clean 4-year extension of funding for CHIP. PRO- CHIP would protect the Pediatric Quality Measures Program and provide funding to sustain this program through 2019. It would also extend the Performance Incentive Program, which provides bonus payments to States that help increase Medicaid enrollment among children, because if we provide insurance for low- income children, they are going to do better, and society is going to do better. They are less likely to end up in the emergency room for something much more serious. For instance, for a child without insurance who has an earache, the mother and father think that it is going to cost a lot of money to go to the doctor and that maybe it will just get better, they wait a week. Into the second week, the pain is worse. The child can't sleep. The child cries. They eventually go to the emergency room, which costs a lot more money than going to the doctor's office, with the possibility that the child has had hearing loss. That is just one example of why we want to provide insurance and get them into the doctor early rather than waiting until later. PRO-CHIP has been endorsed by every children's hospital in Ohio, the Association of Children's Hospitals, virtually every children's hospital, I believe, in the country, and other national groups--the March of Dimes, the American Academy of Pediatrics, the Children's Hospital Association, and Families USA, all of which want a clean CHIP. All of them want a 4-year extension for all the reasons we talked about. More than 1,500 organizations from across the country--including more than 75 groups from Ohio and a number from Oklahoma, the Presiding Officer's State--have written to Congress asking us to ``take action as soon as possible to provide a four-year funding extension for CHIP.''

sustainable growth rate. i helped write the original one. i have supported it for 20 years. we shouldn't be doing it like this on a temporary 1- or 2-year basis. this is finally going to get done right, but we don't do that and then leave out the children by only providing 2 years. parents like ericka and jessica face enough uncertainty with their children's health. most of us in this body are parents, and a number of us are grandparents. most of us, because we dress like this and we are senators and have good insurance provided by taxpayers--we may have anxiety about our children and our grandchildren's health, but we don't have anxiety about their insurance and their ability to go to hospitals and doctors and specialists to get care. certainly, we are anxious about our children and all the things that could happen, but our anxiety doesn't reach into the whole sphere of worrying about how to provide insurance for children. ericka and jessica can't be anything but anxious when they hear that chip could end, and they understand that it should be 4 years. chip gives parents like them peace of mind that they will be able to get their children the care they need without bankrupting those families. we need to make sure these parents continue to have that peace of mind with a 4-year extension. the pro-chip legislation we have introduced in the senate with almost four dozen cosponsors makes sure those kids don't lose critical coverage by saying no to any deal that doesn't fund chip for the full 4 years.

JEFF MILLER of florida in the house of representatives Monday, March 16, 2015 Mr. MILLER of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life of a good friend, Mr. Richard W. ``Dick'' Jones, Jr. I am saddened by his passing, but fortunate to have experienced his friendship, kind-hearted nature, selfless character, and unwavering loyalty. Dick was a native Northwest Floridian, born and raised on the beautiful Emerald Coast. He was born in Pensacola, Florida on May 7, 1930, to Richard W. Jones, Sr. and Agnes Curry Jones. Dick was a standout athlete, and, following his high school graduation, he attended the University of Florida, where he played on the school's varsity tennis team. Dick's passion for both tennis and the Florida Gators were constants throughout his life, and he was known as a top tennis player in Northwest Florida and an avid Gator fan. Dick was also a true patriot, who answered the call of duty and served our Nation with honor and distinction as a member of the United States Air Force. Following his Air Force service, Dick began a successful career in the petroleum industry, while he and his loving wife, Sally, raised their two children. Mr. Speaker, on behalf of the United States Congress, I am proud to recognize the life of Dick Jones. As with so many great Americans, Dick's impact cannot be truly captured in words. To all those who had the pleasure of knowing him, his legacy will forever live on in cherished memories, and he will long be remembered as a loving and devoted husband, father, grandfather, great-grandfather, and friend. My wife Vicki and I extend our prayers and deepest condolences to his wife, Sally; son, John R. (Rusty) Jones and wife Becky; son, Richard W. (Rick) Jones, III and wife Tonya; four grandchildren, Jessica Jones and husband Jonathan, Katherine Ann Jones, Grace Ellen Jones, and Richard W.

This past year, Wadsworth celebrated its bicentennial. It was an opportunity to reflect on how far our city has come and how much we can achieve in the years ahead. Founded in 1814, the city was named after Elijah Wadsworth, a Revolutionary War hero. Though he never lived in Wadsworth, he was an active member of his community and served as the postmaster, sheriff, and the commander of the 4th Division State Militia. He led by example and showed us just how important it is to give back to a community that has given you so much. Wadsworth is important to me not only because it's where I have called home for more than 30 years, it's also where I raised my three children. That is why over a span of 18 years I served the city in capacities as a volunteer firefighter, a member of the Board of Zoning appeals, a member of the Planning Commission, president of the city council, and as mayor. Now, as a member of the U.S. House of Representatives, I am working on behalf of the people of Wadsworth and Ohio's 16th District to encourage economic growth in our region and solutions that hold the promise of a brighter future. President Lincoln once said, ``The best way to predict the future is to create it.'' I came to Washington to fight to pass on a better America with more opportunities to our children and grandchildren, and each day I work toward that goal. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 44 (Monday, March 16, 2015)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E327] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] TRIBUTE TO WADSWORTH, OHIO ______ HON.

PETER J. VISCLOSKY of indiana in the house of representatives Monday, March 16, 2015 Mr. VISCLOSKY. Mr. Speaker, it is with great pleasure and admiration that I congratulate Christ Temple Church of Christ (Holiness) U.S.A. of Gary, Indiana, as its congregation and church leaders join together in celebration of the church's 90th anniversary. The congregation, along with the church's pastor, Bishop Dr. Dale L. Cudjoe, the Executive Board, and the Board of Deacons, commemorated this momentous occasion on Sunday, March 15, 2015, at the church. Christ Temple Church of Christ (Holiness) U.S.A. was organized by Sister Ella Bradley and Elder William A. Nolley when the two met and shared a common goal of starting a church in Gary, Indiana, that reflected the faith [[Page E328]] they had both known growing up in Mississippi and Missouri. Sister Bradley opened her home in Gary for the very first meeting, and the church was founded on November 25, 1925. Soon after, a lot of land was purchased on Pierce Street for the construction of the church building. Finally, in 1933, under the direction of Elder Johnny James Peterson, the first church was built. Years later, the church's pastor, Elder L. M. Relf, helped to ensure that remodeling work was completed on the church. Due to the growing congregation, a larger place of worship was needed and, in 1980, under the leadership of Elder James K. Mitchell Jr., a bigger church was purchased at its current location on Washington Street in Gary. Bishop O.W. McInnis became the interim pastor in 1988 and worked to pay off the church's mortgage. Bishop McInnis appointed Elder Dale L. Cudjoe as the next pastor of the church in 1989, and he became the full-time pastor in 1993. In 2010, Pastor Cudjoe was elected to the bishopric and became the presiding prelate of the Northern Diocese Church of Christ (Holiness) U.S.A., which includes Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Michigan, and Ohio. Led by Bishop Cudjoe, Christ Temple Church of Christ (Holiness) U.S.A. continues to be a source of hope and charity for the community of Gary. Every week, members of the church organize a clothing and toy giveaway for those in need within the community. Through the church's youth ministry, children of the community can participate in the Youth Choir, Sunday School, and the Gym Ministry. In addition, the Brotherhood Ministry and the Temple Music Ministry programs are successful in building a spirit of unity throughout the church and the community. Mr. Speaker, I ask that you and my other distinguished colleagues join me in honoring and congratulating Christ Temple Church of Christ (Holiness) U.S.A. in Gary, Indiana, on its 90th anniversary. For their commitment to service, and for touching the lives of countless individuals, the church leaders, parishioners, and board members are worthy of the blessings that have been bestowed upon them. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 44 (Monday, March 16, 2015)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Pages E327-E328] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] RECOGNIZING CHRIST TEMPLE CHURCH OF CHRIST (HOLINESS) ______ HON.

It is an honor to pay homage to outstanding women who are making a difference in my Congressional District. I would like to recognize a remarkable woman, Tracy Stone, of Elysian Valley, a unique neighborhood in Los Angeles, California. Tracy Stone received a Bachelor's Degree in Art History from Cornell University in New York, a Master's Degree in Architecture from The University of Texas at Austin, and in 1989, was licensed as an Architect by the State of California. In 1991, Ms. Stone opened her own firm, Tracy A. Stone Architect. The office has completed a variety of projects, including a `green' teahouse, an animal shelter and a children's dance studio. Ms. Stone and members of her firm created and organized the annual ``Frogtown Artwalk'' in Elysian Valley, which started in 2006, as a small event showcasing the artists and artisans inhabiting the small commercial/industrial buildings along the Los Angeles River in Elysian Valley. It has grown into a full-scale community event that engages musicians from the surrounding areas, community organizations, local residents, as well as artists and artisans. The event has also featured various activities geared to parents and youth. The Frogtown Artwalk has traditionally celebrated the relationship between the Elysian Valley and the adjacent Los Angeles River, helping to bring interest as well as attention to a long forgotten resource. In 2008, Tracy Stone and Allen Anderson established a non-profit organization, the Elysian Valley Arts Collective, which manages and funds the annual artwalk, and which has allowed the event to grow in complexity and size.

VERN BUCHANAN of florida in the house of representatives Monday, March 16, 2015 Mr. BUCHANAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize one of America's great ocean research pioneers, Dr. Eugenie Clark. ``Genie'' Clark--known as the ``Shark Lady''--founded Mote Marine Laboratory in Southwest Florida. She died at age 92 on Feb. 25 at her home in Sarasota. Genie visited the New York Aquarium in 1922 at age nine and was fascinated by the sharks and other fish of many shapes and colors. She began sharing what she learned about the fish with others. After carrying out a distinguished career spanning almost 75 years, raising four children and inspiring students and others, Clark will be remembered for her amazing discoveries. Her legacy is impressive: blazing trails for women in science; inspiring generations of people from ocean experts to school children; swimming with sharks to learn about them; and founding a world-class marine laboratory that turned 60 this year. Clark was a world authority on fish--particularly sharks and tropical sand fish. A courageous diver and explorer, Clark conducted 72 submersible dives as deep as 12,000 feet and led over 200 field research expeditions to the Red Sea and Gulf of Aqaba, Caribbean, Mexico, Japan, Palau, Papua New Guinea, the Solomon Islands, Thailand, Indonesia and Borneo to study sand fish, whale sharks, deep sea sharks and spotted oceanic triggerfish. She wrote three books and more than 175 articles, including research publications in leading peer-reviewed journals such as Science and a dozen popular stories in National Geographic magazine. In 1955, Clark started the one-room Cape Haze Marine Laboratory in Placida, Fla., with her fisherman assistant and with philanthropic support and encouragement from the Vanderbilt family. The Lab thrived in partnership with its community and became Mote Marine Laboratory in 1967 to honor major benefactor William R. Mote. Today the Lab is based on City Island, Sarasota, and it hosts 24 diverse marine research and conservation programs, education programs for all ages and a major public Aquarium. The Lab has six campuses in Florida and more than 200 staff, including scientists who work in oceans surrounding all seven continents. Clark joined the Zoology faculty at the University of Maryland in 1968, and she officially retired in 1992. She returned to Mote in 2000 as Senior Scientist and Director Emerita and later became a Trustee. There, she continued to build upon and champion the groundbreaking research that she started 60 years ago. Clark dove as recently as June 2014, when she brought a team of volunteer research divers to study deep water triggerfish in the Solomon Islands. The divers had been searching for nests and monitoring how the fish behaved. Clark is the recipient of three honorary degrees and numerous awards including The Explorers Club Medal; the Medal of Excellence from the American Society of Oceanographers; The NOGI award in Arts from Underwater Society of America; the Dugan Award in Aquatic Sciences from the American Littoral Society; a Gold Medal from the Society of Women Geographers; the Distinguished Fellow Award from the American Elasmobranch Society; and the Franklin L. Burr Award from the National Geographic Society. Several fish species have been named in her honor: Callogobius clarki (Goren), Sticharium clarkae (George and Springer), Enneapterygius clarkae (Holleman), and Atrobucca geniae (Ben-Tuvia and Trewavas). Clark is survived by her four children: Hera, Aya, Tak and Niki Konstantinou, and her grandson, Eli Weiss. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 44 (Monday, March 16, 2015)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E329] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] ``SHARK LADY'' OF MOTE PASSES AWAY AFTER NEARLY 75 YEARS OF MARINE RESEARCH ______ HON.

ELIOT L. ENGEL of new york in the house of representatives Monday, March 16, 2015 Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, it is always a pleasure to have local leaders in the business community who are civic-minded, and work hard to better the neighborhood. John Evans, the friendly face the community knows so well from Brown's Jewelers on Riverdale Avenue, has been one of those community-minded business leaders for many years. John was born and bred in the Bronx. The grandson of a Greenwich Village artisan jeweler, he and a partner started in the jewelry business in 1967, building a successful business in the East Bronx. At age 30, John was ready for a new challenge, and took his talents to Fuji Film. For 20 years John rose through the ranks of the company, becoming upper-level management in Fuji's bio-medical engineering division. As successful as his tenure at Fuji Film was, John decided to return to jewelry, this time at Brown's in Riverdale. For 18 years as owner, John has become a pillar of the Riverdale community.

ELIOT L. ENGEL of new york in the house of representatives Monday, March 16, 2015 Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, it is always a pleasure to have local leaders in the business community who are civic-minded, and work hard to better the neighborhood. John Evans, the friendly face the community knows so well from Brown's Jewelers on Riverdale Avenue, has been one of those community-minded business leaders for many years. John was born and bred in the Bronx. The grandson of a Greenwich Village artisan jeweler, he and a partner started in the jewelry business in 1967, building a successful business in the East Bronx. At age 30, John was ready for a new challenge, and took his talents to Fuji Film. For 20 years John rose through the ranks of the company, becoming upper-level management in Fuji's bio-medical engineering division. As successful as his tenure at Fuji Film was, John decided to return to jewelry, this time at Brown's in Riverdale. For 18 years as owner, John has become a pillar of the Riverdale community. He has selflessly provided both financial and moral support to organizations throughout the entire area, including the Riverdale Jewish Community Relations Council (RJCRC), the South Riverdale Little League, the children's basketball program at the Riverdale Y, Rising Stars program at the Riverdale Y, and the Conservative Synagogue Adath Israel of Riverdale.

Each year, we pay special tribute to the contributions and sacrifices made by our nation's women. It is an honor to pay homage to outstanding women who are making a difference in my Congressional District. I would like to recognize a remarkable woman, Cheryl Ortega of Echo Park, a unique neighborhood in Los Angeles, California. Born in Los Feliz and raised in the Echo Park area of Los Angeles, California, Ms. Ortega's father's family arrived in Echo Park from Massachusetts in 1917, hoping to be part of the early movie industry. Ms. Ortega attended Los Feliz Elementary School, Our Mother of Good Counsel School, Immaculate Heart High School and Immaculate Heart College. She holds a Bachelor of Arts in French and a Bilingual Teaching Credential in Spanish. Cheryl has been passionate about education from a very young age. She has been a teacher for nearly half a century, and has been teaching in Echo Park at Logan Span School for over two decades. Ms. Ortega's close association with the immigrant community has led her to actively advocate for people whose children she has taught in bilingual early education programs for almost 50 years. Along with her professional career, Cheryl is active and engaged in volunteering for the community and its schools. Currently, she serves on the Board of Directors of United Teachers Los Angeles, representing English Learner students and their teachers. She also serves as the Co-Chair of the Schools, Libraries, and Community Organizations of the Greater Echo Park Elysian Neighborhood Council, and has been a member of the Council through several different administrations. Cheryl and her husband, John, have three children, John, Kristina and Sara, and five grandchildren, Danny, Jake, Amanda, Ben and Caleb.

Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life of a great man in my district, Jim ``Libby'' Liberatore, who passed away this month at the age of 60. Mr. Liberatore was a former Burlington Township fire chief, and dedicated his life to emergency services and caring for his community. It is not often that we come across public servants who not only embody the spirit of service, but who approach that service with passion and excitement. Libby was truly one of those men--he began his career as a volunteer firefighter in 1971 and went on to fill countless positions and duties over the next 43 years. He spent six years as fire chief and received the State Firefighter of the Year Award in 1992. His friends and colleagues describe him as the key individual responsible for bringing people together. Mr. Liberatore organized educational trips to conventions, encouraged a spirit of healthy competition, and led fundraisers for the fire station. His devotion to those around him never went unnoticed, and the South Jersey community is greatly improved because of his life and work. It is my sincere hope that Libby will continue be an inspiration to those who knew him, and that we can all strive to reflect the same values of service, love, and dedication he personified. May he rest in peace. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 44 (Monday, March 16, 2015)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E331] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] REMEMBERING JIM ``LIBBY'' LIBERATORE ______ HON.

ADAM B. SCHIFF of california in the house of representatives Monday, March 16, 2015 Mr. SCHIFF. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in honor of Women's History Month. Each year, we pay special tribute to the contributions and sacrifices made by our nation's women. It is an honor to pay homage to outstanding women who are making a difference in my Congressional District. I would like to recognize a remarkable woman, Jean Maluccio of La Crescenta, California. Jean is a savvy businesswoman who helps oversee the Maluccio Company, a local investment firm, but is best known for her unparalleled volunteerism that benefits the entire Crescenta Valley. Jean served as the Executive Director of the Crescenta Valley Chamber of Commerce for more than 18 years, without pay, and continues to have an active role with the chamber as an advisor, and helps ensure the smooth operation of chamber events that include the Taste of the Foothills and Hometown Country Fair. She served as President of the Crescenta Valley Chamber of Commerce in 1994, 1995, 2009 and 2010. Jean was also one of the founders of the Crescenta Valley Fireworks Association, a nonprofit which organizes an annual 4th of July fireworks display, and works countless hours each year arranging for the carnival entertainment, handling site permits, working with security for the event and selling tickets. Ms. Maluccio has also been actively involved with Prom Plus, where she was on hand to secure donations of food and serve food to guests at the organization's 20th anniversary gala. She also gives of her time with Relay For Life, an annual 24-hour event held at Clark Magnet High School, where hundreds of people walk on the school field to raise funds to fight cancer. Jean not only obtains the donated food to feed the participants, but also stays for most of the 24 hours to ensure that the food is ready when needed. In addition, Jean also volunteers for the Glendale Police Department, working at the Montrose COPPS substation representing the department in many capacities and answering questions from the public. A strong supporter of our nation's military, Jean was a driving force in raising awareness and helped organize fundraisers for the refurbishment of the war memorial at Two Strike Park in La Crescenta. I ask all Members to join me in honoring an exceptional woman of California's 28th Congressional District, Jean Maluccio. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 44 (Monday, March 16, 2015)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E331] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] A TRIBUTE TO JEAN MALUCCIO--28TH CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICT WOMAN OF THE YEAR ______ HON.

ELIOT L. ENGEL of new york in the house of representatives Monday, March 16, 2015 Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, my district is blessed to have an incredible array of natural beauty, and community members that work to highlight and preserve this beauty do a wonderful service for the neighborhood. When it comes to Yael Levy, who founded Riverdale Riverfest, the commitment to highlighting the need for expanded access to our scenic Hudson waterway has turned a simple passion into a community calling. Yael founded Riverdale Riverfest in June, 2010 in hopes of advancing the timetable for construction of the Hudson River Greenway Link, a waterfront park that would connect the Manhattan Hudson River Greenway to the old Croton Aqueduct Trail in Westchester County. The festival has become an annual tradition for many, bringing people from all over the Northwest Bronx to the campus of the College of Mount Saint Vincent, which sits on the Hudson's shores. The festival is a great time for the entire family, and offers everything from stage performances and local vendors to boat rides. By giving the community a taste of how wonderful year round public access to the waterfront would be, the festival has gone a long way toward building the public support necessary to make the Greenway Link a reality. When Yael is not working to expand river access, she is serving as Deputy Chief of the Appeals Bureau at the Nassau County District Attorney's Office, and teaching New York Criminal Practice at St. John's University School of Law. A proud mother of three, Yael has loved raising her family in Riverdale, and hopes to someday be able to cycle with them along the Hudson without having to start by leaving the Bronx. This year, The Riverdale Jewish Community Relations Council is honoring Yael with the Community Builder Award at their annual Legislative Breakfast. I want to congratulate Yael on this wonderful honor, and thank her for all she has done to enhance and promote our beautiful community. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 44 (Monday, March 16, 2015)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E331] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] HONORING YAEL LEVY _____ HON.

FRANK PALLONE, JR. of new jersey in the house of representatives Monday, March 16, 2015 Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I am encouraged that today the House will consider two [[Page E332]] important public health bills that deal with traumatic injury. These two bills would reauthorize a number of important trauma programs to help equip states to deliver these critical medical services. Traumatic injury is the leading cause of death for children and adults under the age of 45. After an accident, the care received in the first hour presents the highest likelihood that the patient will survive rapid intervention after a traumatic injury. Without that immediate care, their survival rates decrease by 25 percent. Trauma systems not only provide rapid intervention at the time of injury but also include supporting equipment and personnel, and a continuum of care, including pre-hospital, hospital, and rehabilitation services The first bill, H.R. 648, the Trauma Systems and Regionalization of Emergency Care Reauthorization Act, which passed the House last year, allows for planning and implementing trauma care systems in the States. The bill would also establish pilot projects for innovative models of regionalized trauma care. The second bill, H.R. 647, the Access to Life-Saving Trauma Care for All Americans Act, reauthorizes two additional trauma programs that will increase the availability of trauma services. Trauma centers should be available for all victims of traumatic injury. Unfortunately, many trauma centers are at serious risk of closure and financial insolvency. In fact, nearly thirty trauma centers have closed in the past fifteen years. The programs included in this bill will provide critically needed federal funding to help cover uncompensated costs in trauma centers, support core mission trauma services, provide emergency finding to trauma centers, and address trauma center physician shortages in order to ensure the future availability of trauma care for all our citizens. Mr. Speaker, none of these programs have received funding during the appropriations process in recent years. I hope that our consideration of these measures signals the importance of these programs to Members of Congress. I would like to thank Mr. Green and Mr. Burgess, who are both leaders on trauma care, for their work on these bills. I urge Members to support H.R. 647 and H.R. 648. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 44 (Monday, March 16, 2015)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Pages E331-E332] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] H.R. 648, THE TRAUMA SYSTEMS AND REGIONALIZATION OF EMERGENCY CARE REAUTHORIZATION ACT AND H.R. 647, THE ACCESS TO LIFE-SAVING TRAUMA CARE FOR ALL AMERICANS ACT _____ HON.

MARC A. VEASEY of texas in the house of representatives Monday, March 16, 2015 Mr. VEASEY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Amelia Boynton Robinson, a woman who made vast contributions to the civil rights movement. Amelia Boynton was born on August 18, 1911 in Savannah, Georgia, and was first exposed to the fight for equal rights at the age of 9, when she joined her mother in the women's suffrage movement. She learned four principles of life that she still carries on today: daily praying, always helping and showing compassion for others, standing up for the morally right, and becoming economically independent. After graduating from Tuskegee University, she also studied at Tennessee State, Virginia State, and Temple University. She became a registered voter in 1932, and was one of the first people to pass tests used as a barrier to prevent Southern blacks from being able to vote. In 1930, Amelia met Dallas County extension agent Samuel Boynton. The two shared the desire to improve the lives of African-Americans in their community. As a result, the Boynton's became co-founders of the Dallas County Voters League in 1933. In 1936, Amelia and Samuel married and had two sons, Bill, Jr. and Bruce Carver. After losing her husband in 1963, Amelia was not deterred from her commitment to improve the lives of African Americans. On February 29, 1964, Amelia Boynton ran on the Democratic ticket for a seat in Congress representing the state of Alabama, becoming the first African-American woman to run as a Democratic candidate as well as the first woman to run in the state's history. On March 7, 1965, at the age of 53, Amelia joined fellow civil rights activist Martin Luther King, Jr. in organizing the marches from Selma to Montgomery, Alabama. On that fateful day, 600 peaceful protestors tried to cross the Edmund Pettus Bridge and were met with the violence known as ``Bloody Sunday.'' Forever immortalized by photograph, the nation saw Amelia Boynton beaten unconscious and left for dead on this tragic day. ``Bloody Sunday'' prompted swift action by Congress and resulted in President Lyndon B. Johnson signing the Voting Rights Act on August 6, 1965. President Johnson invited Amelia as a guest of honor during the signing of this important civil rights legislation. After the signing of the Voting Rights Act, Amelia continued her leadership across the nation as a writer, speaker, and social change ambassador. In 1990, Boynton was awarded the Martin Luther King, Jr. Medal of Freedom. She continued to tour the United States on behalf of the Schiller Institute, which continues to defend the human and moral rights of all. And on March 7, 2015, I was proud to have walked alongside Amelia Boynton during the 50th Anniversary of the March in Selma, Alabama. I ask my colleagues who also traced the very footsteps that Amelia took to pledge to go beyond just remembering those who sacrificed for us and resolve to carry on their legacy with action. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 44 (Monday, March 16, 2015)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E333] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] HONORING AMELIA BOYNTON ROBINSON _____ HON.

ADAM B. SCHIFF of california in the house of representatives Monday, March 16, 2015 Mr. SCHIFF. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in honor of Women's History Month. Each year, we pay special tribute to the contributions and sacrifices made by our nation's women. It is an honor to pay homage to outstanding women who are making a difference in my Congressional District. I would like to recognize a remarkable woman, Renae Plant of Los Feliz, a unique neighborhood in Los Angeles, California. Born in Eumundi, Queensland, Australia, Renae moved to the United States in 1994 with dreams of becoming an actor. After living in New York for six years, where she was a model and actor, she moved to Los Angeles in 2000, and established a management company, Nebula Management. Shortly after, she began a second business, a maternity tee shirt line. In 2007, Renae and her husband, Livinio, rescued the local preschool their daughter attended, Camelot Kids, located in the Silver Lake area of Los Angeles, which had been on the verge of permanent closure. After three months of meetings, the preschool was able to re- open its doors. Now eight years later, with Ms. Plant as the Director, the preschool is known for its warm, nurturing environment that encourages a natural love of learning, and is an award-winning school with a long waiting list. An accomplished organizer, Renae has recently given her time and talent to the Thomas Starr King Middle School, where her daughter, Ilan attends the Environmental Magnet program. In 2014, she joined the Executive Board as Treasurer of Friends of King, a parent support and fundraising group for the school, and that same year, was instrumental in raising substantial funds that will be used to paint the entire school. She launched the ``I Keep King Clean'' project with a group of parents who clean the school and carry out other beautification tasks, and was ultimately successful in obtaining a professional cleaning service for the school. In addition, Ms. Plant has been a key force with upcoming efforts to decorate the perimeter fences at the school, the ``Chain Link Art Gallery'' project, and the upcoming renovation of the library and the gym. Married for eleven years, Renae and her husband, Livinio, have three children, Ilan, Mateo and Deklan. I ask all Members to join me in honoring an exceptional woman of California's 28th Congressional District, Renae Plant. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 44 (Monday, March 16, 2015)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E334] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] A TRIBUTE TO RENAE PLANT--28TH CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICT WOMAN OF THE YEAR ______ HON.

ELIOT L. ENGEL of new york in the house of representatives Monday, March 16, 2015 Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, as the Congressional Representative for New York's 16th District, I am always amazed by some of the work our great civic organizations do to better the community. Part of the Solution, better known as POTS, is one of those fantastic organizations that has done so much for so very many throughout the Bronx. POTS is a 501(c)(3) organization that serves as a ``one-stop shop'' for individuals living in poverty. The goal of the organization is to help those in need on their journeys from crisis to stability and, ultimately, self-sufficiency. By nourishing the basic needs and hunger of those who come through their doors, the organization seeks to create a positive, loving, and caring community in the Bronx. POTS offers a wide variety of services that were designed to work in concert to address diverse and complex issues. From clothing and food pantry programs to comprehensive legal services, POTS does it all. Even in instances where POTS does not provide directly needed service, their staff will link incoming clients with other groups or organizations that can help them. Simply put, anyone who comes to POTS for help gets it. Since the very first meal in 1982, POTS has served hundreds of thousands of New Yorkers, and this year will help more than 20,000 individuals, including 6,000 children. They have been an absolute godsend to the Bronx and continue to do more and more every year to help those in trying times. The Riverdale Jewish Community Relations Council is honoring POTS with the Community Organization Award at their annual Legislative Breakfast. They have chosen a wonderful organization to honor. My sincere congratulations go out to the entire Board and staff of POTS on receiving this well deserved recognition and award. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 44 (Monday, March 16, 2015)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E334] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] HONORING POTS _____ HON.

In this extremely close game, the young men of Cherry Creek High School's football team proved that hard work, dedication, and a little courage is a recipe for greatness. These football players were led to the championship title through the tireless leadership of their head football coach, Dave Logan, and his commendable staff. Additionally, I recognize senior running back and star player, Milo Hall, for his superior performance in the game rushing 214 yards and scoring two touchdowns.

ELIOT L. ENGEL of new york in the house of representatives Monday, March 16, 2015 Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, there are few things more noble than a life dedicated to public service. The work my good friend Brad Silver has done as part of the Bronx Jewish Community Council (BJCC), an organization that represents the combined community relations and anti- poverty efforts of all the local Jewish community councils in the Bronx, has left an indelible mark on the lives of countless individuals in the area. Brad began his professional career in 1971 as an Outreach Worker for Teens at the Bronx House, a local Jewish community center. While serving as Teen Program Director and finally Co-op City Program Director at Bronx House, he somehow found time to pursue and receive his Masters Degree in Social Work at Yeshiva University. In 1978 Brad began working at the Hawthorne Cedar Knolls School, a residential treatment center for adolescents of the Jewish Board of Family and Children's Services. Following six successful years at Cedar Knolls, Brad moved onto the BJCC, where he began serving as the Director of Social Services in 1984. As his role and responsibilities grew, Brad began moving up the BJCC ladder, becoming the Executive Vice President of the Council in 1999. In his time with the BJCC, the organization has achieved a remarkable reputation as a pillar of community betterment. With a budget now exceeding $17 million annually, the BJCC serves over 10,000 people annually with everything from home attendant services to neighborhood resource centers. Their success is a tremendous testament to Brad's work. In addition to his professional accomplishments, Brad is also an accomplished family man. He continues to reside in the community he was raised in, the Amalgamated Houses in the Bronx, with his wife, and lives just a block away from his mother. This year the Riverdale Jewish Community Relations Council is honoring Brad with the Community Service Award at their Legislative Breakfast. In working with him personally, I know no one is more deserving of this honor. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 44 (Monday, March 16, 2015)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E336] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] HONORING BRAD SILVER _____ HON.

It is an honor to pay homage to outstanding women who are making a difference in my Congressional District.

Well-regarded as an enthusiastic and energetic community leader, Ms. Nakahara Wallett's past volunteer service includes eight years on Pasadena's Arts and Culture Commission, serving as an Ambassador for the Southern California Cherry Blossom Festival, and an Honorary Committee member and volunteer for the Latino Heritage Parade in Pasadena.

This award recognizes outstanding research and business leaders who have made and who continue to make significant contributions to the growth and prosperity of the biosciences industry in New Jersey and throughout the world. After receiving his doctorate from Rutgers University, Dr. Abuchowski went on to develop PEGylation, the most widely used protein drug delivery system in the world. He founded Enzon to commercialize the technology and it later became the first biotechnology company in New Jersey to obtain Food and Drug Administration approval of a product. Three decades later, New Jersey has become a leader in the biotechnology industry and our companies have secured more than thirty drug and medical device approvals in 2014 alone.
