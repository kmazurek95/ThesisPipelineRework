Mr. President, it has been 164 days--164 very long, long days, especially for a woman by the name of Loretta Lynch. Her nomination is languishing here in the Republican limbo that they have created. For 6 months Senate Republicans have looked for any and every reason to push back confirmation of this good woman to be Attorney General. Does anyone know why? Can a single Republican Senator tell us why? The answer is no. Her qualifications are impeccable. She has some bipartisan support. But again, for unknown reasons, Republican support seems to be disappearing. Is there a single Republican Senator who can come here to the Senate floor and give an explanation that does not absolutely smack of political foolishness? Republicans do not know why Loretta Lynch has not yet been confirmed--just listen to what Congressman Peter King said. By the way, Peter King is a Republican from New York. All you've heard from our party for a very long time is how much contempt they have for Holder. Now they're presented with Loretta Lynch, who is by far the best attorney general they could ever have expected this President to appoint, and they still hold the thing up. . . . And for what? Because they think it scores them a few political points? With whom? That is the irony of it all. Republicans have held Ms. Lynch's nomination hostage for nothing more than political purposes. Here is something I will read to the people within the sound of my voice, which is a direct quote from the New York Daily News editorial. The Republicans in the Senate, the meanest and most narrow- minded among them occasionally acting as if they want the Democrats to have the White House into the next century, need to free Loretta Lynch this week. They need to stop using abortion language in an anti- trafficking bill for cover, they need to stop using Lynch's support for President Obama on immigration as cover, they need to stop insulting Lynch the way they have for months as they have delayed a vote on confirming her as our next attorney general for the simple reason that they can. The issue here was never Loretta Lynch's policies, always about President Obama's. They have used her to get at him, because to the end they remain obsessed with getting at him. No wonder Jeb Bush stood up for Lynch in New Hampshire. Bush didn't just show grace in doing that, he also showed more common sense than his brother showed in eight years as President. Jeb Bush has to know that Sen. Mitch McConnell hijacking this process does him absolutely no good, the way it does him no good to have McConnell as an important voice and face of the Republican Party. As long as McConnell is, too many voters completely wide-open about the upcoming Presidential campaign will continue to think the party is still owned and operated by scrubs who think they can push around Loretta Lynch for sport. ``Pushing around Loretta Lynch for sport'' is certainly how it seems. How else can you explain the Republicans changing the subject every time her name comes up? Every time Ms. Lynch's confirmation is discussed, they change the subject. Every time when asked, Republicans deflect: ``next Congress'' or ``after Keystone'' or ``after we try and shut down Homeland Security,'' and, of course, the newest, ``after trafficking.'' President Obama put it best last Friday when he said: Nobody can describe a reason for it beyond political gamesmanship in the Senate. I have [[Page S2260]] to say that there are times where the dysfunction in the Senate just goes too far. This is an example of it. He said: ``This is embarrassing.'' It is embarrassing. It is embarrassing for the Senate and for our Nation. Even Republicans--I should say some Republicans--are embarrassed. They know there is no rationale for delaying a vote for America's chief law enforcement officer. There is no reason that we cannot confirm Loretta Lynch today--right now, even. There is nothing preventing the majority leader from coming to the Senate floor immediately and moving the Senate into executive session for consideration of Ms. Lynch's nomination. Why then is the majority leader determined to make her wait until after the trafficking legislation is approved? Why? We are now spending the first 2 weeks of this current work period finishing two matters-- human trafficking and her nomination. These two matters could have been completed months ago. Everyone is aware of what has transpired with the human trafficking bill. It is sufficient to say that Republicans tried to pull a fast one on the American people. Republicans attempted to broaden a precedent that traditionally prevents Federal funds for paying for abortion, except in cases of rape, incest, and when the life of the mother is at risk. This is commonly known as the Hyde language. The Hyde language has applied to taxpayer dollars. Republicans want to change that to apply to nontaxpayer dollars. It was a failed political ploy, and it is no surprise, then, that the Republicans are scrambling to save their necks after trying to dupe American women. My Republican colleagues appear to be close to seeing the light on human trafficking, and there seems to be a path forward. But there is no guarantee that we can do it. As of right now, we do not have an agreement in place to put the finishing touches on our work on the bill. But we are working on that goal. The progress we have made is due almost entirely to the good-faith efforts of Senators Murray, Leahy, and Amy Klobuchar. When are Republicans going to see the light on Loretta Lynch? When will the majority leader realize he continues to obstruct a qualified nominee for absolutely no reason? The Senate should turn to a vote on Ms. Lynch's nomination immediately. Every day that passes without a newly confirmed Attorney General proves once and again that Republicans cannot lead and they certainly cannot govern. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 57 (Monday, April 20, 2015)] [Senate] [Pages S2259-S2260] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] LYNCH NOMINATION Mr. REID.

We are now spending the first 2 weeks of this current work period finishing two matters-- human trafficking and her nomination. These two matters could have been completed months ago. Everyone is aware of what has transpired with the human trafficking bill. It is sufficient to say that Republicans tried to pull a fast one on the American people. Republicans attempted to broaden a precedent that traditionally prevents Federal funds for paying for abortion, except in cases of rape, incest, and when the life of the mother is at risk. This is commonly known as the Hyde language. The Hyde language has applied to taxpayer dollars. Republicans want to change that to apply to nontaxpayer dollars. It was a failed political ploy, and it is no surprise, then, that the Republicans are scrambling to save their necks after trying to dupe American women. My Republican colleagues appear to be close to seeing the light on human trafficking, and there seems to be a path forward. But there is no guarantee that we can do it. As of right now, we do not have an agreement in place to put the finishing touches on our work on the bill. But we are working on that goal. The progress we have made is due almost entirely to the good-faith efforts of Senators Murray, Leahy, and Amy Klobuchar. When are Republicans going to see the light on Loretta Lynch? When will the majority leader realize he continues to obstruct a qualified nominee for absolutely no reason? The Senate should turn to a vote on Ms. Lynch's nomination immediately. Every day that passes without a newly confirmed Attorney General proves once and again that Republicans cannot lead and they certainly cannot govern. ____________________",package_114_100.csv,6124,6124,6191,"[congressional record volume 161, number 57 (monday, april 20, 2015)] [senate] [pages s2259-s2260] from the congressional record online through the government publishing office [ www.gpo.gov ] lynch nomination mr. reid. mr. president, it has been 164 days--164 very long, long days, especially for a woman by the name of loretta lynch. her nomination is languishing here in the republican limbo that they have created. for 6 months senate republicans have looked for any and every reason to push back confirmation of this good woman to be attorney general. does anyone know why? can a single republican senator tell us why? the answer is no. her qualifications are impeccable. she has some bipartisan support. but again, for unknown reasons, republican support seems to be disappearing. is there a single republican senator who can come here to the senate floor and give an explanation that does not absolutely smack of political foolishness? republicans do not know why loretta lynch has not yet been confirmed--just listen to what congressman peter king said. by the way, peter king is a republican from new york. all you've heard from our party for a very long time is how much contempt they have for holder. now they're presented with loretta lynch, who is by far the best attorney general they could ever have expected this president to appoint, and they still hold the thing up. . . . and for what? because they think it scores them a few political points? with whom? that is the irony of it all. republicans have held ms. lynch's nomination hostage for nothing more than political purposes. here is something i will read to the people within the sound of my voice, which is a direct quote from the new york daily news editorial. the republicans in the senate, the meanest and most narrow- minded among them occasionally acting as if they want the democrats to have the white house into the next century, need to free loretta lynch this week. they need to stop using abortion language in an anti- trafficking bill for cover, they need to stop using lynch's support for president obama on immigration as cover, they need to stop insulting lynch the way they have for months as they have delayed a vote on confirming her as our next attorney general for the simple reason that they can. the issue here was never loretta lynch's policies, always about president obama's. they have used her to get at him, because to the end they remain obsessed with getting at him. no wonder jeb bush stood up for lynch in new hampshire. bush didn't just show grace in doing that, he also showed more common sense than his brother showed in eight years as president. jeb bush has to know that sen. mitch mcconnell hijacking this process does him absolutely no good, the way it does him no good to have mcconnell as an important voice and face of the republican party. as long as mcconnell is, too many voters completely wide-open about the upcoming presidential campaign will continue to think the party is still owned and operated by scrubs who think they can push around loretta lynch for sport. ``pushing around loretta lynch for sport'' is certainly how it seems. how else can you explain the republicans changing the subject every time her name comes up? every time ms. lynch's confirmation is discussed, they change the subject. every time when asked, republicans deflect: ``next congress'' or ``after keystone'' or ``after we try and shut down homeland security,'' and, of course, the newest, ``after trafficking.'' president obama put it best last friday when he said: nobody can describe a reason for it beyond political gamesmanship in the senate. i have [[page s2260]] to say that there are times where the dysfunction in the senate just goes too far. this is an example of it. he said: ``this is embarrassing.'' it is embarrassing. it is embarrassing for the senate and for our nation. even republicans--i should say some republicans--are embarrassed. they know there is no rationale for delaying a vote for america's chief law enforcement officer. there is no reason that we cannot confirm loretta lynch today--right now, even. there is nothing preventing the majority leader from coming to the senate floor immediately and moving the senate into executive session for consideration of ms. lynch's nomination. why then is the majority leader determined to make her wait until after the trafficking legislation is approved? why? we are now spending the first 2 weeks of this current work period finishing two matters-- human trafficking and her nomination. these two matters could have been completed months ago. everyone is aware of what has transpired with the human trafficking bill. it is sufficient to say that republicans tried to pull a fast one on the american people. republicans attempted to broaden a precedent that traditionally prevents federal funds for paying for abortion, except in cases of rape, incest, and when the life of the mother is at risk. this is commonly known as the hyde language. the hyde language has applied to taxpayer dollars. republicans want to change that to apply to nontaxpayer dollars. it was a failed political ploy, and it is no surprise, then, that the republicans are scrambling to save their necks after trying to dupe american women. my republican colleagues appear to be close to seeing the light on human trafficking, and there seems to be a path forward. but there is no guarantee that we can do it. as of right now, we do not have an agreement in place to put the finishing touches on our work on the bill. but we are working on that goal. the progress we have made is due almost entirely to the good-faith efforts of senators murray, leahy, and amy klobuchar. when are republicans going to see the light on loretta lynch?

CREC-2015-04-20-pt1-PgS2262-2,CREC-2015-04-20,114,FIVE-YEAR ANNIVERSARY OF THE DEEPWATER HORIZON TRAGEDY,"[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 57 (Monday, April 20, 2015)] [Senate] [Pages S2262-S2263] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] FIVE-YEAR ANNIVERSARY OF THE DEEPWATER HORIZON TRAGEDY Mr. NELSON. Madam President, it is 5 in the afternoon. Exactly 5 years ago, at 5 p.m., the crew of the Deepwater Horizon mobile oil drilling unit began what is called a negative pressure test of the Macondo prospect oil formation. A cascade of menacing events followed the first failed test. At around 9:40 that evening, drilling mud began gushing out onto the rig. The well had kicked. The crew activated the rig's blowout preventer 1 mile below the surface of the Gulf of Mexico, down at the bottom of the gulf. [[Page S2263]] Tragically, the blowout preventer failed. At 9:49 p.m., there was an explosion on the rig floor. The Deepwater Horizon rig quickly became an inferno. Eleven men died. Eleven families were changed forever. As morning came the next day, an oil sheen 2 miles long and a half mile wide shone on the surface of the waters of the gulf as the blaze on the rig continued. Those images are seared into our collective mind's eyes. So the owner of the well, BP, and the owner and operator of the rig, Transocean, tried and failed again to close the blowout preventer that evening. Then days later, on Earth Day, April 22, at 10:22 a.m., the rig on the surface of the gulf sank. If we can remember, we were first told the sheen that was 2 miles long and a half mile wide came from the drums of diesel onboard the rig. Then later, a revision was made that 1,000 barrels of oil a day were leaking from the well a mile below the surface of the gulf. Then that was changed to 5,000 barrels of oil per day and then to 25,000 barrels of oil a day. But none of those estimates were true. Scientists looking at the sheen from aerial observations started to grow very skeptical about what BP engineers were telling them. On the environment committee, Chairman Boxer and I started to turn up the public pressure to get BP to turn over live footage of 1 mile below the surface of the gulf, where the oil was escaping. We wanted to see how much oil the cameras were showing was escaping from the well. The spill was not out of mind; it was out of sight. As it turned out, unbelievably, 62,000 barrels of oil a day were gushing into the gulf into what is one of our most productive ecosystems on the planet. But we would never have gotten that had scientists not been able to make their estimates by virtue of the live-streaming video that Senator Boxer and I put up on our Web sites so people--unencumbered, around the globe--could make their estimates. This is a prime example of why we must independently verify what oil companies tell us about a spill. As we got into the summer, the prime of the summer beach season, especially at our beaches in Florida, that was devastating. Nearly 37 percent of gulf waters were closed to fishing. BP and its contractors had no control of the runaway well. On July 15, in the middle of the summer--87 days after the explosion--BP finally stopped the oil flow. Today is the anniversary. Our hearts collectively go out to the families that lost the 11 men. If we don't learn from this experience, shame on us. It will come back to haunt us, and in many ways it already has. If we start at the bottom of the food chain, there are impacts to the gulf environment. Bull minnows, or killifish--little fish about that size--root around in the sediment of the bays of Louisiana. In those oiled Louisiana marshes, these little killifish are showing grotesquely deformed gill tissue. And when the killifish embryos were exposed to oil sediment, they showed heart defects, and many failed to hatch. Two LSU professors told me shortly after they had done the research about a year after the spill that they found that the killifish in their reproductive cycle were mutated. They compared them to the killifish in the bays that did not have the oil come in, and there was a distinct difference between the two. As we go up the food chain, the top predators face threats from the oil. Scientists have found unusual lung damage, hormone abnormalities, and low blood cell counts up the food chain in dolphins that were exposed to the oil. And we are not going to know the full extent of the impact for years, even decades. As a matter of fact, somebody said a few months after the BP spill had been contained that there was no more oil in the gulf. There is a lot of oil in the gulf. We just can't see it. It is down there a mile below the surface. And what are the effects on the health, the future health of the gulf? We don't know, but we are going to have to research it. But even with all we learned back in 2010, to this very day, oil infrastructure in the gulf--this is just unbelievable--operated by the Taylor Energy Company continues to leak crude oil since one of the hurricanes years ago. In 2004, a hurricane caused an underwater mudslide that damaged a cluster of oil wells off of Louisiana. Need I remind the Senate, June 1 is the beginning of hurricane season. So if we are visited by another hurricane, and if it does as it did in 2004, 11 years ago, having a cluster of Taylor wells that got buried in an undersea mudslide from the hurricane--but the wells are still leaking 11 years later--what is going to happen to other oil structures in the gulf if the big one comes? According to the Associated Press investigation, the actual flow rate of those Taylor wells may be 20 times higher than originally reported. We have seen this episode before. I don't think we want to repeat this. It is so frightening. I asked the Secretary of Homeland Security and the Secretary of the Interior to provide any and all images of the Taylor spill. The Congress, in our oversight responsibility, has the right to that information. We have to know how much oil is escaping, and then we have to figure out how to stop it from underneath the undersea mudslide that covered up that cluster of wells. In the coming weeks in the Senate commerce committee we are going to examine what we have learned in 5 years since the Deepwater Horizon explosion. In 2012, our bipartisan RESTORE Act got overwhelming votes in both the House and the Senate. The RESTORE Act is a formula with which to send the money that ultimately Judge Barbier of the Federal district court in New Orleans will decide as a result of the number of barrels spilled and the culpability of the company. As a result of that, money will flow. It will flow back to the local governments, it will flow back to help the economies of the gulf, and it will flow back in order to try to protect our environment. There is more to be done. I intend to introduce legislation to make sure we prevent, prepare for, and effectively respond to the next oil spill. As we reflect on the tragic events of April 20, 2010, I hope the Senate will be mindful of this tragedy in the gulf, which riveted the attention of the Nation, that seemed out of control for 3 months, and of which we will have the very infernal consequences for years to come. Mr. President, I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sasse). Will the Senator withhold his request? Mr. NELSON. Of course. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 57 (Monday, April 20, 2015)] [Senate] [Pages S2262-S2263] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] FIVE-YEAR ANNIVERSARY OF THE DEEPWATER HORIZON TRAGEDY Mr. NELSON.

Of course. ____________________",package_114_100.csv,7354,7354,7421,"[congressional record volume 161, number 57 (monday, april 20, 2015)] [senate] [pages s2262-s2263] from the congressional record online through the government publishing office [ www.gpo.gov ] five-year anniversary of the deepwater horizon tragedy mr. nelson. madam president, it is 5 in the afternoon. exactly 5 years ago, at 5 p.m., the crew of the deepwater horizon mobile oil drilling unit began what is called a negative pressure test of the macondo prospect oil formation. a cascade of menacing events followed the first failed test. at around 9:40 that evening, drilling mud began gushing out onto the rig. the well had kicked. the crew activated the rig's blowout preventer 1 mile below the surface of the gulf of mexico, down at the bottom of the gulf. [[page s2263]] tragically, the blowout preventer failed. at 9:49 p.m., there was an explosion on the rig floor. the deepwater horizon rig quickly became an inferno. eleven men died. eleven families were changed forever. as morning came the next day, an oil sheen 2 miles long and a half mile wide shone on the surface of the waters of the gulf as the blaze on the rig continued. those images are seared into our collective mind's eyes. so the owner of the well, bp, and the owner and operator of the rig, transocean, tried and failed again to close the blowout preventer that evening. then days later, on earth day, april 22, at 10:22 a.m., the rig on the surface of the gulf sank. if we can remember, we were first told the sheen that was 2 miles long and a half mile wide came from the drums of diesel onboard the rig. then later, a revision was made that 1,000 barrels of oil a day were leaking from the well a mile below the surface of the gulf. then that was changed to 5,000 barrels of oil per day and then to 25,000 barrels of oil a day. but none of those estimates were true. scientists looking at the sheen from aerial observations started to grow very skeptical about what bp engineers were telling them. on the environment committee, chairman boxer and i started to turn up the public pressure to get bp to turn over live footage of 1 mile below the surface of the gulf, where the oil was escaping. we wanted to see how much oil the cameras were showing was escaping from the well. the spill was not out of mind; it was out of sight. as it turned out, unbelievably, 62,000 barrels of oil a day were gushing into the gulf into what is one of our most productive ecosystems on the planet. but we would never have gotten that had scientists not been able to make their estimates by virtue of the live-streaming video that senator boxer and i put up on our web sites so people--unencumbered, around the globe--could make their estimates. this is a prime example of why we must independently verify what oil companies tell us about a spill. as we got into the summer, the prime of the summer beach season, especially at our beaches in florida, that was devastating. nearly 37 percent of gulf waters were closed to fishing. bp and its contractors had no control of the runaway well. on july 15, in the middle of the summer--87 days after the explosion--bp finally stopped the oil flow. today is the anniversary. our hearts collectively go out to the families that lost the 11 men. if we don't learn from this experience, shame on us. it will come back to haunt us, and in many ways it already has. if we start at the bottom of the food chain, there are impacts to the gulf environment. bull minnows, or killifish--little fish about that size--root around in the sediment of the bays of louisiana. in those oiled louisiana marshes, these little killifish are showing grotesquely deformed gill tissue. and when the killifish embryos were exposed to oil sediment, they showed heart defects, and many failed to hatch. two lsu professors told me shortly after they had done the research about a year after the spill that they found that the killifish in their reproductive cycle were mutated. they compared them to the killifish in the bays that did not have the oil come in, and there was a distinct difference between the two. as we go up the food chain, the top predators face threats from the oil. scientists have found unusual lung damage, hormone abnormalities, and low blood cell counts up the food chain in dolphins that were exposed to the oil. and we are not going to know the full extent of the impact for years, even decades. as a matter of fact, somebody said a few months after the bp spill had been contained that there was no more oil in the gulf. there is a lot of oil in the gulf. we just can't see it. it is down there a mile below the surface. and what are the effects on the health, the future health of the gulf? we don't know, but we are going to have to research it. but even with all we learned back in 2010, to this very day, oil infrastructure in the gulf--this is just unbelievable--operated by the taylor energy company continues to leak crude oil since one of the hurricanes years ago. in 2004, a hurricane caused an underwater mudslide that damaged a cluster of oil wells off of louisiana. need i remind the senate, june 1 is the beginning of hurricane season. so if we are visited by another hurricane, and if it does as it did in 2004, 11 years ago, having a cluster of taylor wells that got buried in an undersea mudslide from the hurricane--but the wells are still leaking 11 years later--what is going to happen to other oil structures in the gulf if the big one comes? according to the associated press investigation, the actual flow rate of those taylor wells may be 20 times higher than originally reported. we have seen this episode before. i don't think we want to repeat this. it is so frightening. i asked the secretary of homeland security and the secretary of the interior to provide any and all images of the taylor spill. the congress, in our oversight responsibility, has the right to that information. we have to know how much oil is escaping, and then we have to figure out how to stop it from underneath the undersea mudslide that covered up that cluster of wells. in the coming weeks in the senate commerce committee we are going to examine what we have learned in 5 years since the deepwater horizon explosion. in 2012, our bipartisan restore act got overwhelming votes in both the house and the senate. the restore act is a formula with which to send the money that ultimately judge barbier of the federal district court in new orleans will decide as a result of the number of barrels spilled and the culpability of the company. as a result of that, money will flow. it will flow back to the local governments, it will flow back to help the economies of the gulf, and it will flow back in order to try to protect our environment. there is more to be done. i intend to introduce legislation to make sure we prevent, prepare for, and effectively respond to the next oil spill. as we reflect on the tragic events of april 20, 2010, i hope the senate will be mindful of this tragedy in the gulf, which riveted the attention of the nation, that seemed out of control for 3 months, and of which we will have the very infernal consequences for years to come. mr. president, i yield the floor. i suggest the absence of a quorum. the presiding officer (mr. sasse). will the senator withhold his request?

CREC-2015-04-20-pt1-PgS2262,CREC-2015-04-20,114,MOMENT OF SILENCE FOR THE VICTIMS OF THE DEEPWATER HORIZON TRAGEDY,"[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 57 (Monday, April 20, 2015)] [Senate] [Page S2262] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] MOMENT OF SILENCE FOR THE VICTIMS OF THE DEEPWATER HORIZON TRAGEDY Mr. VITTER. Madam President, I rise today to solemnly observe the 5- year anniversary of the Deepwater Horizon oilspill, also known as the BP disaster. It was a major and deeply tragic incident that resulted in the loss of 11 lives in the Gulf of Mexico and beyond that really devastated the gulf region. I wish to start where we should always start--by remembering in a solemn and prayerful way the 11 men who lost their lives in the incident. They were Donald ``Duck'' Clark, 49, of Newellton, LA; Stephen Ray Curtis, 40, of Georgetown, LA; Gordon Jones, 28, of Baton Rouge, LA; Roy Wyatt Kemp, 27, of Jonesville, LA; Keith Blair Manuel, 56, of Gonzalez, LA; Jason Anderson, 35, of Midfield, TX; Adam Weise, 24, of Yorktown, TX; Aaron Dale Durkeen, 37, of Philadelphia, MS; Karl Kleppinger, Jr., 38, of Natchez, MS; Dewey Revette, 48, of State Line, MS; and Shane Roshto, 22, of Liberty, MS. We lift up those men and their families in our prayers, and we will continue to keep those men whose lives were lost and continue to keep their families in our fervent thoughts and prayers. While 5 years have passed, the effects of the Deepwater Horizon tragedy are still felt today in communities all along the gulf coast. The terrible and unnecessary loss of life, the harming of our precious coastal ecosystems, and the persisting economic burdens serve as a constant reminder of the failures that led to the spill, as well as the lessons learned in the 5 years since. Poor industry and government oversight and the failure by many involved to enforce safety regulations were largely responsible for multiple mistakes leading up to the tragedy. As a result, we have learned many lessons on how to prevent future accidents such as this. The first is that the lives and safety of the men and women who work in this field are absolutely paramount and need to be kept so, and the Federal and State safety standards overseeing them should reflect that as a priority. Changes are needed, and the Federal agencies that oversee and regulate the offshore energy industry must communicate clearly with State and local governments and impacted industries. They must also do a better job of enforcing strong, necessary safety and environmental standards. It is also important that we prevent the administration or any future administration from having knee-jerk reactions to incidents such as this. Each gulf coast community remembers the devastating effects of the offshore drilling moratorium that followed the disaster--something that was completely unnecessary, including in the opinion of so many experts. Once the Obama administration imposed this unnecessary drilling moratorium, that decision had crippling results for Louisiana and Gulf State economies. When accidents such as this spill happen, there needs to be a calculated, logical, and immediate response in order to replace ineffective regulations with rules that focus on preserving lives and protecting the environment. It is imperative that we prevent shortsighted Federal mandates and thoughtless regulations that hinder regional recovery and destroy local economies instead. We also learned that there needs to be a clear and specific judicial penalty process in place in order to ensure that claims can be efficiently filed and finalized in order to let those who are affected by such disasters return to some sense of normalcy, day-to-day normalcy, and economic normalcy as quickly as possible. This should include insuring responsible parties such as BP are timely in paying their judicially and statutorily mandated fines and penalties. There is absolutely no excuse that 5 years later gulf residents, in many cases, are still waiting for the responsible parties to fulfill their legal obligations, including under the RESTORE Act. As we remember the Deepwater Horizon tragedy today, let us renew our commitment to work on all of these matters and to finish the work that is left to do as our gulf coastlines and economies continue to recover. Thank you, Madam President. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana. Mr. CASSIDY. Madam President, 5 years ago today, 11 Americans were lost when the Deepwater Horizon exploded off the gulf coast. I would like to name them. This is hard. These were the people we grew up with. I apologize for being emotional, but these are our neighbors, and so to remember them--Jason Anderson 35, Midfield, TX. Jason had two kids, and his wife Shelley said that Thanksgiving was his favorite holiday. Aaron Dale ``Bubba'' Burkeen, 37, of Philadelphia, MS. He passed on his wedding anniversary and 4 days before his birthday. He was married with two children. Donald Clark, 49, of Newellton, LA. Husband to Sheila with four kids. He was a fisherman. To honor him on the anniversary of his death, his family says a prayer and releases balloons over a lake in his favorite color, which is sky blue. Stephen Ray Curtis, 40, of Georgetown, LA. Stephen was married and the father of two teenagers. Gordon Jones of Baton Rouge, LA. Gordon was 28. His wife was Michelle. His son Max was born 3 weeks after Gordon passed. An oak tree was planted on the LSU campus on the path where he ran. Roy Wyatt Kemp, 27, of Jonesville, LA. He was married to Courtney and father of one child. Karl Kleppinger, Jr., 38, of Natchez, MS. He was a veteran of the first gulf war and the father of one. Keith Blair Manuel, 56, of Gonzales, LA. Keith had three daughters, was a big fan of LSU sports, and had football and basketball season tickets. Dewey A. Revette, 48, of State Line, MS. His wife was Sherri. They had been married for 26 years. Shane M. Roshto, 22, of Liberty, MS. He was the youngest of the men who died. His wife was Natalie, and his son is Blaine. Adam Weise, 24, of Yorktown, TX. Adam drove 10 hours to Louisiana every 3 weeks to work on the rig. He was a high school football star and spent his off time hunting and fishing. We pray that the families find peace in the memories of their sons, husbands, and fathers. The spill was the worst in our Nations's history, and while the consequences of this spill are still seen, it is our task to live forward and, in so doing, honor the memory of these men and provide a better future for their families. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that there be a moment of silence to honor their memory. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. (Moment of silence.) Mr. CASSIDY. Thank you, Madam President. I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. NELSON. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 57 (Monday, April 20, 2015)] [Senate] [Page S2262] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] MOMENT OF SILENCE FOR THE VICTIMS OF THE DEEPWATER HORIZON TRAGEDY Mr. VITTER.

Under the previous order, the Senate will resume consideration of S. 178, which the clerk will report. The senior assistant legislative clerk read as follows: A bill (S. 178) to provide justice for the victims of trafficking. Pending: McConnell (for Cornyn) amendment No. 1120, to strengthen the Justice for Victims of Trafficking Act by incorporating additional bipartisan amendments. Mr. REID. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum. The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Ms. STABENOW. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Ernst). Without objection, it is so ordered. Lynch Nomination Ms. STABENOW. Madam President, as we all know, a vote of confirmation for Loretta Lynch to be our next Attorney General has now been delayed 164 days, or 5 months. We have seen this qualified woman waiting for a confirmation vote, and we have had at least 51 Members--a majority-- indicating they will support her confirmation. I remember coming to the floor listening to colleagues during the Bush administration state over and over again that elections have consequences, that Presidents have a right to have their nominees voted on, and that it is our responsibility to make sure, if something comes out of committee, that we vote on a final confirmation. When we look at the fact that we have seen Loretta Lynch wait for a vote on the floor for a combined length of time that equals more than the last seven Attorneys General, I really do believe, as the President has said, enough is enough. I remember a time when we had a controversial nominee--John Ashcroft--and many of us did not support that nomination. I did not support that nomination. But we brought it to the floor for a vote. He waited 42 days. At the time, people said that was a long time. He was not blocked. We did not filibuster. We did not require a supermajority. In fact, there were 42 of us who voted no, so we could have stopped it on a procedural vote. But we allowed the nomination of John Ashcroft to come to the floor for a vote. So we fast-forward. And we have seen this, of course, over and over again, as we look at the President's nominees in the last 6\1/2\ years. Now we see this eminently qualified woman, who has been held up as of today 164 days, waiting and waiting to have the opportunity to have a vote up or down on confirmation. If people want to vote no, they have that right, but she deserves a vote. Today, we are going to vote on the confirmation of a district court judge in Texas. I think it is good that the Southern District of Texas will have a Federal court judge, but the entire country needs a permanent Attorney General. In fact, the Attorney General's office is the one that actually brings the cases to Federal courts and tries them on behalf of all the American people. So it is really ridiculous that we stand at this point where we are having to ask, after more than 5 months, that there be a vote for Loretta Lynch. After she was reported out, we saw a very distinguished nominee for Secretary of Defense come out of committee and immediately come to the floor and be confirmed, but Loretta Lynch has waited and waited. We continue to vote on district judges, and Loretta Lynch is waiting and waiting. We hear all kinds of excuses, all kinds of reasons. We are hearing that Loretta Lynch's nomination to be Attorney General cannot be voted on until we complete another very important bill--the human trafficking bill--that we all want to get done. It has, unfortunately, had a curve ball added because of the politics around choice and abortion that has been interjected into this, and we are having to work our way through that. I have been involved in a lot of discussions, as my colleagues have. I am confident we can address those if people want to get this done on behalf of girls and women in our country. But that has nothing to do with the nomination of Loretta Lynch for Attorney General, other than one thing, which is that as U.S. attorney of the Eastern District of New York, she presided over a very effective antitrafficking program, investigating and prosecuting scores of defendants. In that sense, again, we need Loretta Lynch--her talent, her expertise, and her experience--to be able to tackle what is a horrible situation that way too many of our girls and women find themselves in. We somehow for too long have thought this was something that was happening someplace else. Yet we saw it in Lansing, MI--where I live, the capital of Michigan--where there was a case in the trafficking situation that the FBI and local officials addressed. What we are finding right now is that as we proceed with confirming other people for other positions--Monday nights we are voting on other positions, we are voting on district judges, and we voted on other people for other positions not held up by human trafficking, not held up by trying to get that bill resolved, but for some reason the Attorney General position has somehow been held up. I don't buy it. It makes no sense that we would pick one person--one person--not others but one person and decide that this person and this nomination, this confirmation vote will be held hostage to another issue. It is time to stop it. Now, 164 days is long enough; 164 days is long enough. It is time to give Loretta Lynch the respect and the vote she has been waiting for and she deserves. [[Page S2261]] I yield back the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. BROWN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. BROWN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for up to 15 minutes as in morning business. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Trans-Pacific Partnership Mr. BROWN. Madam President, this body--the Senate--continues to rush through one of the most consequential changes to U.S. economic policy this decade with little media attention, little scrutiny by committees, and little discussion from leadership of this Senate. Last week, we were called into a rushed legislative hearing on fast-track and a trade package with little notice and no bill to see. We had less than 13 hours' notice for a committee meeting--the standard here is 1 week, and I believe that is the Senate rule--on one of the most secretive documents we have seen in front of us. Senators and their staffs, Congress men and women and their staffs, have limited access to this document--the Trans-Pacific Partnership--and no access to legislation upon which we had a hearing on Thursday. It was only after the hearing that they finally decided to introduce the bill. Yet, this affects more than 50 percent of the world's GDP. Fifty percent of the world's GDP could be affected by this package. Millions of American jobs are on the line. Yet, Congress is rushing this bill through. We cannot fast-track fast-track legislation. We know what so-called free trade has done to this country. It may not affect too many people who dress like this in this town, people who wear expensive suits, but for those in the heartland and in places such as Des Moines and Iowa City and Columbus and Cleveland, we know bad trade deals have devastated towns. I grew up in Mansfield, OH. When I was a kid, we had thousands of jobs at Westinghouse, Ohio Brass, Mansfield Tire, Fisher Body, Goreman- Rupp, and so many other companies. Almost all of those companies have shut down--not just because of globalization and bad trade deals, but certainly that contributed to it. Every one of those companies that hasn't shut down has laid off, in most cases, thousands of its workers. On Friday, I was in Dayton, where I spoke with Jimmy Allen. Jimmy worked at Appleton Paper for 45 years. He was a union officer for 43 of those years. He was one of 400 workers laid off due to unfair trade in 2012 when China cheated on currency, undermining the U.S. paper industry. I hear all the time from workers like Jimmy. George Rossi of Warren, OH--at the other end of the State--wrote to me to share his story. He wrote: My wife lost her job of 15 years at GE in Ravenna, OH because of foreign trade. The plant that once employed 600 is now closed. My brother-in-law lost his [job] at Ohio Lamp in Warren, which is now closed. My plant, WCI Steel, is now closed. At one time the plant employed 1,800 people. George wrote: I could go on and on. There have been many friends and family, so many who have worked in numerous plants that are now closed--in large part because of bad foreign trade deals. Jamie Vaughan wrote to me saying that Jamie's father and Jamie's grandfather worked at Ford in Canton, OH, until it shut down. Jamie's father was able to transfer to Indianapolis, where Jamie and Jamie's brother also worked, until that Ford plant shut down too. Jamie wrote: They built a plant exactly like Indy's in Brazil. My brother and I transferred to California. A few years later, that plant shut down. I got a letter from Gary Ordway of Continental, OH, about how factory closures have ripple effects across entire communities. He wrote: In 1995 I was employed with General Motors Powertrain Foundry in Defiance, OH, where we were working 12 hours a day, 6 to 7 days a week, and then along came the North American Free Trade Agreement. There were over 5,000 employees working at that time, and after NAFTA there was a constant loss of jobs, so today, there are about 1,000 employees left. We are looking at a weekly loss of $4.8 million in wages to the local economy and around $1.2 million in weekly taxes lost due to the 4,000 jobs exported because of NAFTA. Within the next couple of years the foundry will be losing all of its iron castings and another 350 jobs will be eliminated, and Plant One is scheduled to be torn town. So NAFTA wasn't good for our community and foundry because our iron casting business went to Mexico. That was Gary Ordway of northwest Ohio. We have seen it in the northwest and we have seen it in the southwest. Joseph Hicks from Elyria, OH, wrote: I am a member of Local 1104 in Lorain. I work at U.S. Steel tubular division. As of the 22nd of March, me and 600 of my brothers and sisters have been placed on indefinite layoff, some departments idled, due to lack of work. This is mainly [because of] the illegal dumping of cheaply-made steel. I would add, subsidized steel. Foreign countries cut corners on safety, pay workers next to nothing, and don't care about quality. With these ingredients, they are able to sell their steel products for a lot less than we at U.S. steel can. There used to be a time when ``Made in America'' meant something. I long to see that be the attitude again. Joseph goes on: I am suffering greatly now because of the trickle-down effect. I am laid off, I have lost my job, my career, my way of life to support my growing and deserving family. I have a wife, Megan, [who] cannot work because she has to care for our 2-year-old disabled daughter. I ask, beg, our public officials . . . do what needs to be done to get American workers back to work. That is Joseph from U.S. Steel in Lorain. We owe these workers more than rushed hearings. We owe them more than to rubberstamp a deal we have barely been able to read. Keep in mind that we didn't see this bill until Thursday night. We have still not had one hearing on this bill to discuss the bill. The chairman of the committee wants to do the markup the day after tomorrow, and this bill will govern potentially 60 percent of the world's GDP. So they want to fast-track this fast-track legislation so they can pass more trade agreements that outsource jobs. Trade done right can create jobs, but our current trade deals amount to corporate handouts and worker sellouts. The Economic Policy Institute found that the wage loss to workers on the wrong end of expanded trade is almost certainly larger than the estimated net national gains from the TPP. They write that there is no such thing as an all-gain, no-pain treaty. We know that is true because workers such as Joseph and Jamie and George and Gary and Jimmy feel that pain. I urge my colleagues over the next couple of days to ask the tough questions and demand answers from the U.S. Trade Representative, who has told us little and who has given us even less access to these trade agreements, and to say no to a trade deal that will end up fast- tracking more jobs overseas.

A bill (H.R. 1314) to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide for a right to an administrative appeal relating to adverse determinations of tax-exempt status of certain organizations. A bill (S. 984) to amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to provide Medicare beneficiary access to eye tracking accessories for speech generating devices and to remove the rental cap for durable medical equipment under the Medicare Program with respect to speech generating devices. Mr. VITTER. Madam President, in order to place the bills on the calendar under the provisions of rule XIV, I object to further proceeding en bloc. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.

Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum. The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Ms. STABENOW. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Ernst). Without objection, it is so ordered. Lynch Nomination Ms. STABENOW. Madam President, as we all know, a vote of confirmation for Loretta Lynch to be our next Attorney General has now been delayed 164 days, or 5 months. We have seen this qualified woman waiting for a confirmation vote, and we have had at least 51 Members--a majority-- indicating they will support her confirmation. I remember coming to the floor listening to colleagues during the Bush administration state over and over again that elections have consequences, that Presidents have a right to have their nominees voted on, and that it is our responsibility to make sure, if something comes out of committee, that we vote on a final confirmation. When we look at the fact that we have seen Loretta Lynch wait for a vote on the floor for a combined length of time that equals more than the last seven Attorneys General, I really do believe, as the President has said, enough is enough. I remember a time when we had a controversial nominee--John Ashcroft--and many of us did not support that nomination. I did not support that nomination. But we brought it to the floor for a vote. He waited 42 days. At the time, people said that was a long time. He was not blocked. We did not filibuster. We did not require a supermajority. In fact, there were 42 of us who voted no, so we could have stopped it on a procedural vote. But we allowed the nomination of John Ashcroft to come to the floor for a vote. So we fast-forward. And we have seen this, of course, over and over again, as we look at the President's nominees in the last 6\1/2\ years. Now we see this eminently qualified woman, who has been held up as of today 164 days, waiting and waiting to have the opportunity to have a vote up or down on confirmation. If people want to vote no, they have that right, but she deserves a vote. Today, we are going to vote on the confirmation of a district court judge in Texas. I think it is good that the Southern District of Texas will have a Federal court judge, but the entire country needs a permanent Attorney General. In fact, the Attorney General's office is the one that actually brings the cases to Federal courts and tries them on behalf of all the American people. So it is really ridiculous that we stand at this point where we are having to ask, after more than 5 months, that there be a vote for Loretta Lynch. After she was reported out, we saw a very distinguished nominee for Secretary of Defense come out of committee and immediately come to the floor and be confirmed, but Loretta Lynch has waited and waited. We continue to vote on district judges, and Loretta Lynch is waiting and waiting. We hear all kinds of excuses, all kinds of reasons. We are hearing that Loretta Lynch's nomination to be Attorney General cannot be voted on until we complete another very important bill--the human trafficking bill--that we all want to get done. It has, unfortunately, had a curve ball added because of the politics around choice and abortion that has been interjected into this, and we are having to work our way through that. I have been involved in a lot of discussions, as my colleagues have. I am confident we can address those if people want to get this done on behalf of girls and women in our country. But that has nothing to do with the nomination of Loretta Lynch for Attorney General, other than one thing, which is that as U.S. attorney of the Eastern District of New York, she presided over a very effective antitrafficking program, investigating and prosecuting scores of defendants. In that sense, again, we need Loretta Lynch--her talent, her expertise, and her experience--to be able to tackle what is a horrible situation that way too many of our girls and women find themselves in. We somehow for too long have thought this was something that was happening someplace else. Yet we saw it in Lansing, MI--where I live, the capital of Michigan--where there was a case in the trafficking situation that the FBI and local officials addressed. What we are finding right now is that as we proceed with confirming other people for other positions--Monday nights we are voting on other positions, we are voting on district judges, and we voted on other people for other positions not held up by human trafficking, not held up by trying to get that bill resolved, but for some reason the Attorney General position has somehow been held up. I don't buy it. It makes no sense that we would pick one person--one person--not others but one person and decide that this person and this nomination, this confirmation vote will be held hostage to another issue. It is time to stop it. Now, 164 days is long enough; 164 days is long enough. It is time to give Loretta Lynch the respect and the vote she has been waiting for and she deserves. [[Page S2261]] I yield back the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. BROWN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. BROWN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for up to 15 minutes as in morning business. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Trans-Pacific Partnership Mr. BROWN. Madam President, this body--the Senate--continues to rush through one of the most consequential changes to U.S. economic policy this decade with little media attention, little scrutiny by committees, and little discussion from leadership of this Senate. Last week, we were called into a rushed legislative hearing on fast-track and a trade package with little notice and no bill to see. We had less than 13 hours' notice for a committee meeting--the standard here is 1 week, and I believe that is the Senate rule--on one of the most secretive documents we have seen in front of us. Senators and their staffs, Congress men and women and their staffs, have limited access to this document--the Trans-Pacific Partnership--and no access to legislation upon which we had a hearing on Thursday. It was only after the hearing that they finally decided to introduce the bill. Yet, this affects more than 50 percent of the world's GDP. Fifty percent of the world's GDP could be affected by this package. Millions of American jobs are on the line. Yet, Congress is rushing this bill through. We cannot fast-track fast-track legislation. We know what so-called free trade has done to this country. It may not affect too many people who dress like this in this town, people who wear expensive suits, but for those in the heartland and in places such as Des Moines and Iowa City and Columbus and Cleveland, we know bad trade deals have devastated towns. I grew up in Mansfield, OH. When I was a kid, we had thousands of jobs at Westinghouse, Ohio Brass, Mansfield Tire, Fisher Body, Goreman- Rupp, and so many other companies. Almost all of those companies have shut down--not just because of globalization and bad trade deals, but certainly that contributed to it. Every one of those companies that hasn't shut down has laid off, in most cases, thousands of its workers. On Friday, I was in Dayton, where I spoke with Jimmy Allen. Jimmy worked at Appleton Paper for 45 years. He was a union officer for 43 of those years. He was one of 400 workers laid off due to unfair trade in 2012 when China cheated on currency, undermining the U.S. paper industry. I hear all the time from workers like Jimmy. George Rossi of Warren, OH--at the other end of the State--wrote to me to share his story. He wrote: My wife lost her job of 15 years at GE in Ravenna, OH because of foreign trade. The plant that once employed 600 is now closed. My brother-in-law lost his [job] at Ohio Lamp in Warren, which is now closed. My plant, WCI Steel, is now closed. At one time the plant employed 1,800 people. George wrote: I could go on and on. There have been many friends and family, so many who have worked in numerous plants that are now closed--in large part because of bad foreign trade deals. Jamie Vaughan wrote to me saying that Jamie's father and Jamie's grandfather worked at Ford in Canton, OH, until it shut down. Jamie's father was able to transfer to Indianapolis, where Jamie and Jamie's brother also worked, until that Ford plant shut down too. Jamie wrote: They built a plant exactly like Indy's in Brazil. My brother and I transferred to California. A few years later, that plant shut down. I got a letter from Gary Ordway of Continental, OH, about how factory closures have ripple effects across entire communities. He wrote: In 1995 I was employed with General Motors Powertrain Foundry in Defiance, OH, where we were working 12 hours a day, 6 to 7 days a week, and then along came the North American Free Trade Agreement. There were over 5,000 employees working at that time, and after NAFTA there was a constant loss of jobs, so today, there are about 1,000 employees left. We are looking at a weekly loss of $4.8 million in wages to the local economy and around $1.2 million in weekly taxes lost due to the 4,000 jobs exported because of NAFTA. Within the next couple of years the foundry will be losing all of its iron castings and another 350 jobs will be eliminated, and Plant One is scheduled to be torn town. So NAFTA wasn't good for our community and foundry because our iron casting business went to Mexico. That was Gary Ordway of northwest Ohio. We have seen it in the northwest and we have seen it in the southwest. Joseph Hicks from Elyria, OH, wrote: I am a member of Local 1104 in Lorain. I work at U.S. Steel tubular division. As of the 22nd of March, me and 600 of my brothers and sisters have been placed on indefinite layoff, some departments idled, due to lack of work. This is mainly [because of] the illegal dumping of cheaply-made steel. I would add, subsidized steel. Foreign countries cut corners on safety, pay workers next to nothing, and don't care about quality. With these ingredients, they are able to sell their steel products for a lot less than we at U.S. steel can. There used to be a time when ``Made in America'' meant something. I long to see that be the attitude again. Joseph goes on: I am suffering greatly now because of the trickle-down effect. I am laid off, I have lost my job, my career, my way of life to support my growing and deserving family. I have a wife, Megan, [who] cannot work because she has to care for our 2-year-old disabled daughter. I ask, beg, our public officials . . . do what needs to be done to get American workers back to work. That is Joseph from U.S. Steel in Lorain. We owe these workers more than rushed hearings. We owe them more than to rubberstamp a deal we have barely been able to read. Keep in mind that we didn't see this bill until Thursday night. We have still not had one hearing on this bill to discuss the bill. The chairman of the committee wants to do the markup the day after tomorrow, and this bill will govern potentially 60 percent of the world's GDP. So they want to fast-track this fast-track legislation so they can pass more trade agreements that outsource jobs. Trade done right can create jobs, but our current trade deals amount to corporate handouts and worker sellouts. The Economic Policy Institute found that the wage loss to workers on the wrong end of expanded trade is almost certainly larger than the estimated net national gains from the TPP. They write that there is no such thing as an all-gain, no-pain treaty. We know that is true because workers such as Joseph and Jamie and George and Gary and Jimmy feel that pain. I urge my colleagues over the next couple of days to ask the tough questions and demand answers from the U.S. Trade Representative, who has told us little and who has given us even less access to these trade agreements, and to say no to a trade deal that will end up fast- tracking more jobs overseas. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana. Measures Placed on the Calendar En Bloc--H.R. 636, H.R. 644, H.R. 1295, H.R. 1314, and S. 984 Mr. VITTER.

The Senator from Iowa. Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, tonight, the Senate will vote on the nomination of George Hanks to be a district judge for the Southern District of Texas. If confirmed, Judge Hanks will be the President's 309th judicial nominee confirmed since this President took office. By comparison, at the same point in his Presidency, President Bush had only 273 judicial nominees confirmed. Despite some of the complaints that we are hearing from my colleagues on the other side, we are moving judicial nominees at about the same pace as we did at this point in President Bush's Presidency. One difference, of course, is how the Senate handled the judicial nominees that were reported out of the committee during the lameduck session. [[Page S2264]] Historically, the Senate doesn't confirm judges at the end of a Congress if those judges are reported out of committee during a lameduck. The reason for this, of course, is so the newly elected Members have an opportunity for their voices to be heard. For instance, that is what happened in 2006 when the Senate returned 13 judicial nominees to the President. Those nominees were then renominated in 2007 and eventually confirmed in the new Congress, but the Senate Democrats did not follow tradition last year. Instead of following standard practice, Senate Democrats confirmed 11 judicial nominees who were reported out of committee during the lameduck session. Had they followed standard practice, we would have voted on those nominees at the beginning of this year, just as the committee did with the nominees that were resubmitted in 2007. At the end of the day, when we include the 11 district court nominees who were confirmed at the end of last year, we are at about the same pace that the Democratically led Senate was in 2007 during the Bush administration. This is further confirmed when you compare the committee's work this year to 2007. In 2007, at this point in the Congress, the committee had held three nominee hearings for a total of 10 judges. As of right now, the Judiciary Committee has already held 4 nomination hearings for a total of 10 nominees. These nominees include six judges and four executive nominees, including both the Attorney General and Deputy Attorney General nominees. The bottom line is the Senate Judiciary Committee is treating the President's nominees extremely fairly. He has had dozens more nominees confirmed than President Bush did at this point in his Presidency. I expect another one will be confirmed tonight, and I congratulate Judge Hanks on his pending nomination and urge my colleagues to vote accordingly. Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, today, we will be voting to confirm Judge George Hanks, who has been nominated to be a Federal district judge in the Southern District of Texas. Judge Hanks is just the second judicial nominee that we have voted to confirm more than 3 months into the 114th Congress. The slow trickle of confirmations that the new majority has allowed is undermining the functioning of our Federal courts and is hurting the American people. This past month, the Wall Street Journal wrote an alarming article about the backlog of civil cases in our Federal courts. One man interviewed for the article filed a Federal law suit in 2007 and is still waiting for his case to be heard. It is unconscionable that an American would have to wait 8 years and still not have his day in court. Unfortunately, it is not surprising given that at last count, there were more than 330,000 civil cases pending in our Federal courts. This is a record high and an increase of nearly 20 percent since 2004. There are steps the Republican majority should take to help our Federal courts better serve the American people. First, the Senate should confirm every single one of the nine judicial nominees on the Executive Calendar without further delay. Besides Judge Hanks, there are two other Federal district court nominees pending on the Executive Calendar, both from States with two Republican home State Senators. Both of those nominees were reported out of the Judiciary Committee unanimously by voice vote. One of the nominees will fill a judicial emergency vacancy in Texas that has remained unfilled for more than 2 years. This type of neglect is unacceptable. In addition, there are five other nominees to the Court of Federal Claims and a nominee for the Court of International Trade. None of these nominees are controversial and they could easily be confirmed by a simple voice vote if Republicans would allow. After today's confirmation vote, there will be 53 vacancies on our Federal courts. But even if we filled every one of these vacancies, we still would have to address the growing needs of our co-equal branch of government that is struggling with heavy caseloads. Last month, the Judicial Conference of the United States, led by Chief Justice John Roberts, identified the need for adding 73 permanent judgeships, as well as converting 9 temporary district court judgeships to permanent status. The Senate should be working in a bipartisan manner to provide the Federal Judiciary with the resources it needs, including the addition of woefully-needed additional judgeships. The fact that today we are only voting on the second judicial nominee of this Congress shows that the delay and obstruction that we saw from Republicans in the first 6 years of the Obama administration has continued now that they control the Senate's agenda. One simply needs to look at the nomination of Loretta Lynch to understand how Republicans approach our constitutional role of advice and consent. Ms. Lynch is an eminently qualified nominee and enjoys broad support, yet her nomination has now been pending before the full Senate for 53 days. That is more than twice as long as all of the past seven Attorneys General combined: Richard Thornburgh, 1 day; William Barr, 5 days; Janet Reno, 1 day; John Ashcroft, 2 days, Alberto Gonzales, 8 days; Michael Mukasey, 2 days; and Eric Holder, 5 days. This delay is an embarrassment for the United States Senate. I agree with President Obama, who said last week that ``there are times where the dysfunction in the Senate just goes too far.'' The obstruction of this historic nominee has gone on far too long. It is long past time for the Senate Republican leader to allow Ms. Lynch a vote and allow the American people to be served by this outstanding public servant. The judicial nominee we are voting on today, Judge George Hanks, will fill a Federal district court vacancy in the Southern District of Texas. Since 2010, Judge Hanks has served as a U.S. Magistrate Judge for the U.S. District Court Judge for the Southern District of Texas. Prior to joining the Federal bench, Judge Hanks was a Court of Appeals Justice for the First District of Texas from 2002 to 2010, and a judge on the 157th Civil District Court of Texas from 2001 to 2002. Before becoming a judge, he was in private practice for nearly a decade. The ABA Standing Committee on the Federal Judiciary unanimously rated him ``Well Qualified,'' its highest rating. Judge Hanks is supported by his two Republican home State Senators and his nomination was unanimously approved by voice vote by the Judiciary Committee on February 26. He has strong qualifications and should be confirmed without further delay. I urge the Republican Leader to schedule votes to confirm the remaining judicial nominees pending on the Executive Calendar. None of the nominees are controversial. We should do our jobs and vote on their nominations so that they can start doing their jobs working for the American people. Mr. GRASSLEY. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Under the previous order, the question is, Will the Senate advise and consent to the nomination of George C. Hanks, Jr., of Texas, to be United States District Judge for the Southern District of Texas? Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays. The PRESIDING OFFICER.

alarming article about the backlog of civil cases in our federal courts. one man interviewed for the article filed a federal law suit in 2007 and is still waiting for his case to be heard. it is unconscionable that an american would have to wait 8 years and still not have his day in court. unfortunately, it is not surprising given that at last count, there were more than 330,000 civil cases pending in our federal courts. this is a record high and an increase of nearly 20 percent since 2004. there are steps the republican majority should take to help our federal courts better serve the american people. first, the senate should confirm every single one of the nine judicial nominees on the executive calendar without further delay. besides judge hanks, there are two other federal district court nominees pending on the executive calendar, both from states with two republican home state senators. both of those nominees were reported out of the judiciary committee unanimously by voice vote. one of the nominees will fill a judicial emergency vacancy in texas that has remained unfilled for more than 2 years. this type of neglect is unacceptable. in addition, there are five other nominees to the court of federal claims and a nominee for the court of international trade. none of these nominees are controversial and they could easily be confirmed by a simple voice vote if republicans would allow. after today's confirmation vote, there will be 53 vacancies on our federal courts. but even if we filled every one of these vacancies, we still would have to address the growing needs of our co-equal branch of government that is struggling with heavy caseloads. last month, the judicial conference of the united states, led by chief justice john roberts, identified the need for adding 73 permanent judgeships, as well as converting 9 temporary district court judgeships to permanent status. the senate should be working in a bipartisan manner to provide the federal judiciary with the resources it needs, including the addition of woefully-needed additional judgeships. the fact that today we are only voting on the second judicial nominee of this congress shows that the delay and obstruction that we saw from republicans in the first 6 years of the obama administration has continued now that they control the senate's agenda. one simply needs to look at the nomination of loretta lynch to understand how republicans approach our constitutional role of advice and consent. ms. lynch is an eminently qualified nominee and enjoys broad support, yet her nomination has now been pending before the full senate for 53 days. that is more than twice as long as all of the past seven attorneys general combined: richard thornburgh, 1 day; william barr, 5 days; janet reno, 1 day; john ashcroft, 2 days, alberto gonzales, 8 days; michael mukasey, 2 days; and eric holder, 5 days. this delay is an embarrassment for the united states senate. i agree with president obama, who said last week that ``there are times where the dysfunction in the senate just goes too far.'' the obstruction of this historic nominee has gone on far too long. it is long past time for the senate republican leader to allow ms. lynch a vote and allow the american people to be served by this outstanding public servant. the judicial nominee we are voting on today, judge george hanks, will fill a federal district court vacancy in the southern district of texas. since 2010, judge hanks has served as a u.s. magistrate judge for the u.s. district court judge for the southern district of texas. prior to joining the federal bench, judge hanks was a court of appeals justice for the first district of texas from 2002 to 2010, and a judge on the 157th civil district court of texas from 2001 to 2002. before becoming a judge, he was in private practice for nearly a decade. the aba standing committee on the federal judiciary unanimously rated him ``well qualified,'' its highest rating. judge hanks is supported by his two republican home state senators and his nomination was unanimously approved by voice vote by the judiciary committee on february 26. he has strong qualifications and should be confirmed without further delay. i urge the republican leader to schedule votes to confirm the remaining judicial nominees pending on the executive calendar. none of the nominees are controversial. we should do our jobs and vote on their nominations so that they can start doing their jobs working for the american people. mr. grassley. i suggest the absence of a quorum. the presiding officer. the clerk will call the roll. the legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. mr. grassley. mr. president, i ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call

Mr. President, I stand with great pleasure and pride, along with Senator Whitehouse, to congratulate the Providence College men's hockey team in winning the 2015 NCAA Division I National Championship, and I am pleased to have worked with my colleague Senator Whitehouse in adopting a resolution last week to honor this great accomplishment. This is the first national championship in the history of PC's men's hockey club, and I am sure this season will be long remembered by Providence College players, coaches, staff, and fans. The championship game featured phenomenal plays and contributions from many Friars players, including a career-high 49 saves by goaltender Jon Gillies, and one goal each from Anthony Florentino, Mark Jankowski, Tom Parisi, and Brandon Tanev. I would like to congratulate all of the Friars players whose season- long hard work and dedication made this successful season possible. The 2015 PC men's hockey team consisted of: Rhode Island's own Noel Acciari, Mark Adams, Brooks Behling, Alex Cromwell, Logan Day, Stefan Demopoulos, Nick Ellis, Anthony Florentino, Jon Gillies, John Gilmour, Robbie Hennessey, Mark Jankowski, Brendan Leahy, Shane Luke, Conor MacPhee, Ross Mauermann, Kyle McKenzie, Steven McParland, Trevor Mingoia, Josh Monk, Tom Perisi, Brian Pinho, Truman Reed, Kevin Rooney, Niko Rufo, Nick Saracino, Brandon Tanev, and Jake Walman. I will apologize for my Rhode Island accent. I would also like to extend my best wishes to PC player Drew Brown, who missed this season while battling a rare form of bone cancer and is thankfully now reported to be cancer-free. But he contributed in many ways to the success of the team. Additionally, I want to recognize the coaches and staff whose commitment and preparation was essential to winning this national championship, especially head coach Nate Leaman, who won the championship in only his fourth season at PC. The other coaches and staff of the 2015 PC men's hockey team were: associate head coach Steve Miller, assistant coach Kris Mayotte, coordinator of Men's Hockey operations Kyle Murphy, and goaltending coach Jim McNiff. I also commend Providence College President Father Brian Shanley and athletic director Robert Driscoll on their accomplishments and extraordinary dedication to the school and to the community of Rhode Island. Again, I join many in the State of Rhode Island and around the hockey world in congratulating the Providence College men's ice hockey team on their incredible national championship season and wish them continued success in the future. I am proud to yield the floor to my colleague Senator Whitehouse. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island. Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I am very pleased and also very proud to follow the senior Senator and my colleague and to join Senator Reed in congratulating our Providence College men's ice hockey team on winning its first-ever national championship. The Friars edged out Boston University 4 to 3 a week ago Saturday night in PC's first trip to the Frozen Four in 30 years. The BU-PC event was a southern New England showdown that brought more than 18,000 hockey fans to Boston's TD Garden. Playing so close to home, PC had plenty of support from the stands. They also had a little bit of good luck, but it was more than luck that put Providence College over the top. Those kids played their hearts out, and forward Brandon Tanev's go- ahead score in the third period to seal the win was no fluke. The Friars earned that victory, and Rhode Islanders couldn't be more proud of them. Head coach Nate Leaman said that when it gets to be that late in the season and when there is that kind of championship pressure, ``You win,'' he said, ``with guys that are gritty. . . . '' Well, Senator Reed and I are excited to join Providence College president Father Brian Shanley and the entire PC community in celebrating this historic win. Congratulations to Coach Leaman and his staff, to goalie Jon Gillies, who was named Frozen Four Most Outstanding Player, and to all the PC players who fought so hard all season to this wonderful result. As junior forward Noel Acciari, a native of Johnston, RI, put it, ``We might be a small State, but we're hard workers.'' Well done, Friars. You are, indeed, hard workers and your hard work paid off. I yield the floor. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 57 (Monday, April 20, 2015)] [Senate] [Page S2265] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] CONGRATULATING THE PROVIDENCE COLLEGE MEN'S ICE HOCKEY TEAM FOR WINNING THE 2015 NCAA DIVISION I NATIONAL CHAMPIONSHIP Mr. REED.

CREC-2015-04-20-pt1-PgS2265-4,CREC-2015-04-20,114,INSPECTORS GENERAL,"[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 57 (Monday, April 20, 2015)] [Senate] [Pages S2265-S2266] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] INSPECTORS GENERAL Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, the ability of Congress to be a check on the actions of the executive branch is being endangered. One of the tools that we in Congress have created to help the government identify and correct its mistakes is being obstructed. That tool is the vital work of inspectors general. Inspectors general work in nearly 80 Federal agencies. They perform audits, conduct investigations, and issue public reports of their findings and recommendations. They combat waste, fraud, and abuse. Their work is being frustrated, and that is why I am here. To keep an eye on what is happening inside a government agency, the inspector general must be able to access the agency's records. This is exactly what the law calls for. The Inspector General Act of 1978 directs that all inspectors general have a right to access all records, documents, and other materials. ``All'' is not the same as ``some.'' If the inspector general deems a document necessary to do his job, then the agency should turn it over immediately--immediately. But [[Page S2266]] the clear command of that law is being ignored far too often. Agencies partially comply or refuse to turn over materials after a lengthy review and screening process by lawyers for the agency. That is a step not included in the IG law. The examples range from the Environmental Protection Agency to the FBI, and can you believe it, even to the Peace Corps. The excuses vary, but the pattern is very clear. For example, the Department of Justice Office of Inspector General is reviewing the Department's use of the material witness statute. That statute authorizes detaining certain witnesses for testimony before a grand jury. The inspector general was looking into allegations that the civil rights and the civil liberties of certain material witnesses may have been abused. This is just the kind of issue that Congress relies on inspectors general to investigate. If the problems are found, the inspector general helps our government identify the problem and helps Department leadership fix these problems. Naturally, the inspector general needed to review the grand jury testimony to decide if the value of that testimony was reasonable, given the burden imposed on the witnesses. Three U.S. attorneys offices and the Department's National Security Division provided the inspector general with the grand jury information concerning material witnesses, but the FBI refused to cooperate. The FBI claimed the grand jury testimony could not be shared with the inspector general. This FBI decision to withhold information was a brandnew practice, beginning sometime in 2010. The law was not changed in 2010 so the FBI could do it. The FBI claimed it had the right to refuse to provide the inspector general information in over a dozen other categories as well. Remember, the law says the inspector general shall have access to all--not some--records, documents, and other materials that they deem necessary to conduct their investigations. Yet the FBI says its attorneys will review material first and then decide what it would and would not release to the inspector general. It even gets worse. The FBI claimed it needed the approval of the Attorney General or the Deputy Attorney General to provide the information to the inspector general. This is exactly upside down. Under the law, an inspector general must be independent. Agencies cannot be trusted to investigate themselves. If an inspector general had to ask for permission from senior leadership, he would not be truly independent. The Inspector General Act of 1978 does allow the Attorney General, not the FBI, to prohibit the inspector general from carrying out or completing an investigation but only in certain limited circumstances. When that extraordinary step is taken, it must be done in writing to the inspector general, and the inspector general must forward that written notice to the Congress. The FBI would have us believe that instead of written notice being required to block an IG investigation, it needs written permission to comply with an investigation. This is simply not how the law is designed to work. After this controversy took place, Congress took action. We essentially bolded and underlined the provision in the Inspector General Act that ensures access to documents. We didn't literally do that, but this year's Justice Department appropriation declares that no funds shall be used to deny the inspector general timely access to all records. The new law also directed the inspector general to report to Congress within 5 days whenever there was a failure to comply with this requirement. Since February of this year, we have already received four of those reports that the FBI is still refusing to comply, regardless of the actions Congress took on the appropriations bill last year. One notice said the FBI was withholding evidence in two whistleblower cases. I have written to the FBI twice about these notices and just received a reply from the FBI Wednesday. Unfortunately, the FBI ignores most of the questions I asked and simply reasserts their original position. That tells me the FBI thinks they are above the law. It has an obligation to comply not only with the Inspector General Act but also with restrictions Congress placed on its appropriations. That means FBI employees cannot legally be spending their time withholding and reviewing documents before providing those same documents to the inspector general. We must stay vigilant and we must insist all government agencies, including the FBI, work with the inspectors general, not against them. I applaud my colleagues on the Appropriations Committee for standing up for inspectors general. I also urge them to follow through and help make sure the funding restrictions they put in place are obeyed. As I noted earlier, the problem is not confined to the FBI or to the Department of Justice, similar attempts to limit the work of an inspector general have occurred at the EPA and the Peace Corps. Just last year, 47 inspectors general signed a letter to the Congress warning of these problems across government. We all lose when inspectors general are delayed or prevented in doing their work. In every agency where IG's work, they help agency management become aware of problems and opportunities to improve government service. We must support the work of inspectors general and remind government agencies that blocking their investigations is not acceptable. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 57 (Monday, April 20, 2015)] [Senate] [Pages S2265-S2266] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] INSPECTORS GENERAL Mr. GRASSLEY.

Agencies partially comply or refuse to turn over materials after a lengthy review and screening process by lawyers for the agency. That is a step not included in the IG law. The examples range from the Environmental Protection Agency to the FBI, and can you believe it, even to the Peace Corps. The excuses vary, but the pattern is very clear. For example, the Department of Justice Office of Inspector General is reviewing the Department's use of the material witness statute. That statute authorizes detaining certain witnesses for testimony before a grand jury. The inspector general was looking into allegations that the civil rights and the civil liberties of certain material witnesses may have been abused. This is just the kind of issue that Congress relies on inspectors general to investigate. If the problems are found, the inspector general helps our government identify the problem and helps Department leadership fix these problems. Naturally, the inspector general needed to review the grand jury testimony to decide if the value of that testimony was reasonable, given the burden imposed on the witnesses. Three U.S. attorneys offices and the Department's National Security Division provided the inspector general with the grand jury information concerning material witnesses, but the FBI refused to cooperate. The FBI claimed the grand jury testimony could not be shared with the inspector general. This FBI decision to withhold information was a brandnew practice, beginning sometime in 2010. The law was not changed in 2010 so the FBI could do it. The FBI claimed it had the right to refuse to provide the inspector general information in over a dozen other categories as well. Remember, the law says the inspector general shall have access to all--not some--records, documents, and other materials that they deem necessary to conduct their investigations. Yet the FBI says its attorneys will review material first and then decide what it would and would not release to the inspector general. It even gets worse. The FBI claimed it needed the approval of the Attorney General or the Deputy Attorney General to provide the information to the inspector general. This is exactly upside down. Under the law, an inspector general must be independent. Agencies cannot be trusted to investigate themselves. If an inspector general had to ask for permission from senior leadership, he would not be truly independent. The Inspector General Act of 1978 does allow the Attorney General, not the FBI, to prohibit the inspector general from carrying out or completing an investigation but only in certain limited circumstances. When that extraordinary step is taken, it must be done in writing to the inspector general, and the inspector general must forward that written notice to the Congress. The FBI would have us believe that instead of written notice being required to block an IG investigation, it needs written permission to comply with an investigation. This is simply not how the law is designed to work. After this controversy took place, Congress took action. We essentially bolded and underlined the provision in the Inspector General Act that ensures access to documents. We didn't literally do that, but this year's Justice Department appropriation declares that no funds shall be used to deny the inspector general timely access to all records. The new law also directed the inspector general to report to Congress within 5 days whenever there was a failure to comply with this requirement. Since February of this year, we have already received four of those reports that the FBI is still refusing to comply, regardless of the actions Congress took on the appropriations bill last year. One notice said the FBI was withholding evidence in two whistleblower cases. I have written to the FBI twice about these notices and just received a reply from the FBI Wednesday. Unfortunately, the FBI ignores most of the questions I asked and simply reasserts their original position. That tells me the FBI thinks they are above the law. It has an obligation to comply not only with the Inspector General Act but also with restrictions Congress placed on its appropriations. That means FBI employees cannot legally be spending their time withholding and reviewing documents before providing those same documents to the inspector general. We must stay vigilant and we must insist all government agencies, including the FBI, work with the inspectors general, not against them. I applaud my colleagues on the Appropriations Committee for standing up for inspectors general. I also urge them to follow through and help make sure the funding restrictions they put in place are obeyed. As I noted earlier, the problem is not confined to the FBI or to the Department of Justice, similar attempts to limit the work of an inspector general have occurred at the EPA and the Peace Corps. Just last year, 47 inspectors general signed a letter to the Congress warning of these problems across government. We all lose when inspectors general are delayed or prevented in doing their work. In every agency where IG's work, they help agency management become aware of problems and opportunities to improve government service. We must support the work of inspectors general and remind government agencies that blocking their investigations is not acceptable. ____________________","Congressional Record, Volume 161 Issue 57 (Monday, April 20, 2015) [Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 57 (Monday, April 20, 2015)] [Senate] [Pages S2265-S2266] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] INSPECTORS GENERAL Mr. GRASSLEY.

Mr. President, I am proud to be an original cosponsor of legislation offered by Senators Cornyn and Franken, the Comprehensive Justice and Mental Health Act. This critical piece of bipartisan legislation would promote alternatives to incarceration by helping identify and treat Americans suffering from mental illness. For far too long our criminal justice system has been a substitute for a mental health system. That practice is costly, wastes limited resources, and is contrary to evidence-based practices proven to make our communities safer. I thank Senators Cornyn and Franken for their hard work on this important criminal justice reform bill. Today, law enforcement is ill-equipped and not properly trained to deal with individuals suffering from severe mental disorders whose conditions can cause them to commit crimes. The mentally ill are too often treated as common criminals and are not given access to the critical treatment they need. The Comprehensive Justice and Mental Health Act would save taxpayers' money and effectively use limited resources by ensuring our prisons contain violent offenders as opposed to those who suffer from mental illnesses. When more than four of five inmates with a mental illness are not treated in jail, we waste resources by incarcerating them. This bill would make the public safer and save taxpayers' money by ensuring that we continue to support vital programs, such as mental health courts, veterans' courts, and crisis intervention teams. The bill would also improve public safety. Persons with complicated psychiatric problems that are thrown in jail can have their mental state deteriorate even further. If incarcerated without treatment, some mental illnesses can lead people to be a danger to the public once released. But with proper treatment, they can lead ordinary, law- abiding lives even absent incarceration. The bill would help to reduce jail overcrowding caused by warehousing people for low-level crimes, which often includes the mentally ill. For example, from 2009 to 2013 in New York City, about 400 people were sent to jail on at least 18 occasions each. That amounts to more than 10,000 jail admissions and 300,000 days in jail. In Chicago, from 2007 to 2011, 21 percent of the people sent to jails accounted for 50 percent of jail admissions. Because a significant number of people in jail are mentally ill, reducing recidivism for this population is critical. By supporting state and local efforts to identify and direct them to the appropriate mental health services, this bill would reduce recidivism and, in turn, help reduce jail over-crowding. The bill would also encourage the development of curricula on mental health conditions for police academies [[Page S2267]] and orientations. Finally, the legislation would include new grant accountability measures and emphasize the implantation of evidence- based practices. It is time we address mental illness in our country through treatment, not incarceration. Passing this common-sense bill would reduce recidivism, save taxpayer money, and make our communities safer. That is why I support this bill and I urge its speedy passage. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 57 (Monday, April 20, 2015)] [Senate] [Pages S2266-S2267] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] COMPREHENSIVE JUSTICE AND MENTAL HEALTH ACT Mr. BOOKER.

VICKERS Mr. BURR. Mr. President, I wish to recognize the tremendous contributions of Dr. Michael G. Vickers, the Under Secretary of Defense for Intelligence. Secretary Vickers is retiring this month from the Federal Government having served with distinction in two critical leadership positions in the Department of Defense: Assistant Secretary of Defense for Special Operations/Low-Intensity Conflict and Interdependent Capabilities, ASD SO/LIC&IC, from 2007 to 2011, and Under Secretary of Defense for Intelligence, USD(I), since 2011. His dedicated service has spanned the administrations of both President George W. Bush and President Barack Obama. Moreover, he has helped shape national security for three decades. Secretary Vickers is the Department's longest serving USD(I). During his tenure he has led a comprehensive, mission-focused transformation of defense intelligence, and has provided policy and operational oversight for numerous sensitive intelligence and counterterrorism operations. He played a critical policy and planning role in the operation that brought justice to Osama bin Ladin. Of note, we are only days away from the fourth anniversary of that successful operation, which occurred on May 2, 2011. As ASD SO/LIC&IC, Secretary Vickers served as the ``Service'' Secretary for all Special Operations Forces, and as the senior civilian advisor to the Secretary of Defense on all counterterrorism, irregular warfare, and special activities. He played a central role in shaping U.S. strategy for the war with Al Qaeda and the war in Afghanistan, and conceived of and led the largest expansion of SOF capabilities and capacity in history. From 1973 to 1986, Secretary Vickers served as an Army Special Forces noncommissioned officer, Special Forces officer, and Central Intelligence Agency operations officer. He had operational and combat experience in Central America and the Caribbean, the Middle East, and Central and South Asia. His operational experience spans covert action and espionage, unconventional warfare, counterterrorism, counterinsurgency, and foreign internal defense. During the mid-1980s, Secretary Vickers was the principal strategist for the largest covert action program in the CIA's history: the paramilitary operation that drove the Soviet Army out of Afghanistan. Because of Dr. Vickers' selfless service, hard work and tireless dedication, our Nation is a safer place. I want to thank him for his service and wish him and his family all the best as he begins his next adventure. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 57 (Monday, April 20, 2015)] [Senate] [Page S2267] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] RECOGNIZING MICHAEL G.

I want to thank him for his service and wish him and his family all the best as he begins his next adventure. ____________________","Congressional Record, Volume 161 Issue 57 (Monday, April 20, 2015) [Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 57 (Monday, April 20, 2015)] [Senate] [Page S2267] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] RECOGNIZING MICHAEL G. VICKERS Mr. BURR. Mr. President, I wish to recognize the tremendous contributions of Dr. Michael G. Vickers, the Under Secretary of Defense for Intelligence. Secretary Vickers is retiring this month from the Federal Government having served with distinction in two critical leadership positions in the Department of Defense: Assistant Secretary of Defense for Special Operations/Low-Intensity Conflict and Interdependent Capabilities, ASD SO/LIC&IC, from 2007 to 2011, and Under Secretary of Defense for Intelligence, USD(I), since 2011. His dedicated service has spanned the administrations of both President George W. Bush and President Barack Obama. Moreover, he has helped shape national security for three decades. Secretary Vickers is the Department's longest serving USD(I). During his tenure he has led a comprehensive, mission-focused transformation of defense intelligence, and has provided policy and operational oversight for numerous sensitive intelligence and counterterrorism operations. He played a critical policy and planning role in the operation that brought justice to Osama bin Ladin. Of note, we are only days away from the fourth anniversary of that successful operation, which occurred on May 2, 2011. As ASD SO/LIC&IC, Secretary Vickers served as the ``Service'' Secretary for all Special Operations Forces, and as the senior civilian advisor to the Secretary of Defense on all counterterrorism, irregular warfare, and special activities. He played a central role in shaping U.S. strategy for the war with Al Qaeda and the war in Afghanistan, and conceived of and led the largest expansion of SOF capabilities and capacity in history. From 1973 to 1986, Secretary Vickers served as an Army Special Forces noncommissioned officer, Special Forces officer, and Central Intelligence Agency operations officer. He had operational and combat experience in Central America and the Caribbean, the Middle East, and Central and South Asia. His operational experience spans covert action and espionage, unconventional warfare, counterterrorism, counterinsurgency, and foreign internal defense. During the mid-1980s, Secretary Vickers was the principal strategist for the largest covert action program in the CIA's history: the paramilitary operation that drove the Soviet Army out of Afghanistan. Because of Dr. Vickers' selfless service, hard work and tireless dedication, our Nation is a safer place.

Mr. President, today I pay tribute to a towering figure from Michigan's political past: former Senator Robert Griffin, who died Friday at the age of 91. Senator Griffin was born in Detroit and was educated in the Wayne County Public Schools. By the time he graduated high school, the United States was embroiled in World War II. And in 1943--a year when so many American families came to fully comprehend the horrors of modern warfare--young Bob Griffin enlisted in the U.S. Army, joining the 71st Infantry Division. For 3 years, Bob Griffin served our country in a time of war unmatched in its intensity, including 14 months fighting Nazis in Europe. After returning from war, like so many of our surviving soldiers, he turned his attention to his education, attending Central Michigan University, then getting his law degree at the University of Michigan. Bob Griffin decided to begin his legal career in Traverse City. After practicing law for several years, Bob Griffin felt compelled to practice public service, so in 1956 he ran and won office to the U.S. House of Representatives. He distinguished himself in Congress over the next decade, and following the death of Michigan Senator Patrick McNamara, then-Governor George Romney appointed Bob Griffin to finish the 7 months remaining in McNamara's term. It did not take Senator Griffin long to earn the support of Michigan voters: They elected him to a full 6-year term that fall of 1966. Senator Griffin served the people of Michigan loyally for the next 12 years. He authored major pieces of legislation during his career in this Chamber, and he was a member of the Republican leadership from 1969 to 1977. But he is being remembered most for the role he played in helping our Nation overcome the shock of the Watergate scandal. In August 1974, as that scandal worsened, it became clear that President Nixon was in danger of being impeached. The impeachment process would be an embarrassing spectacle, not just for President Nixon, but for the institution of the President and for our Nation's political system. Senator Griffin was a close friend of President Nixon, but it was the Senator's devotion to the country that led him to write a letter strongly suggesting that the President resign and spare the Nation from having to endure impeachment. That letter is said to have played a major role in Nixon's decision to finally step aside. At a time when our Nation's political system was teetering, it was Senator Griffin who helped it to recover its balance by doing what was best for the country. That is the mark of true leadership. Even those who disagreed with Senator Griffin's policies never found fault with his integrity or his character. Although Senator Griffin left office in 1979, he still had a desire to serve the people of Michigan, and for 8 years he applied his wisdom and judgment on Michigan's Supreme Court, retiring in 1994. Today the Grand Traverse County courthouse bears his name. Senator Griffin's devotion to our State was rivaled only by the devotion he had for his wife, Marjorie, with whom he spent nearly 68 years, and their four children: Paul, Richard, James, and Jill. The couple has 13 grandchildren and 7 great-grandchildren. Senator Griffin's loss will be felt not only by his loving family, but in his home of Traverse City and in every corner of the State he served during his career. Senator Griffin will be remembered for his leadership, his fierce integrity, and his unwavering allegiance to the State of Michigan and the United States of America. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 57 (Monday, April 20, 2015)] [Senate] [Page S2267] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] REMEMBERING ROBERT GRIFFIN Ms. STABENOW.

Michael Johnson was born in Herlong, CA, where his father served as a military police officer before becoming a deputy for the Calaveras County Sheriff's Department. After moving to San Jose as a teenager, Officer Johnson graduated from Gunderson High School in 1995 and joined the San Jose Police Department in 2001, continuing his family's commitment to law enforcement. Those who knew Officer Johnson fondly remember him as a caring and trustworthy colleague who was passionate about his work and loved the community he served. An experienced patrol officer, he was recently promoted to serve as a field training officer and advise new members of the police force. Outside of work, Officer Johnson found joy in hobbies ranging from jujitsu and baking to scuba diving and world travel. He was also an outstanding marksman, winning several awards from the Police and Fire Games. Above all else, Office Johnson is remembered as a loving husband and devoted family man. In 2013, he married the love of his life, Nicole, and they planned to celebrate their marriage this summer with a large formal ceremony in Santa Cruz before starting a family.

After moving to San Jose as a teenager, Officer Johnson graduated from Gunderson High School in 1995 and joined the San Jose Police Department in 2001, continuing his family's commitment to law enforcement. Those who knew Officer Johnson fondly remember him as a caring and trustworthy colleague who was passionate about his work and loved the community he served. An experienced patrol officer, he was recently promoted to serve as a field training officer and advise new members of the police force. Outside of work, Officer Johnson found joy in hobbies ranging from jujitsu and baking to scuba diving and world travel. He was also an outstanding marksman, winning several awards from the Police and Fire Games. Above all else, Office Johnson is remembered as a loving husband and devoted family man. In 2013, he married the love of his life, Nicole, and they planned to celebrate their marriage this summer with a large formal ceremony in Santa Cruz before starting a family. My heart goes out to Nicole and Officer Johnson's parents Daniel Johnson and Katherine Decker, his step-parents Dann Decker and Penny Johnson, his sister Jamie Radack, his brother-in-law Steve, and his niece Ami and nephew Eli. Officer Johnson's dedicated and courageous service will not be forgotten. On behalf of the people of California and San Jose, whom he served so bravely, I extend my gratitude and deepest sympathies to his family, friends, and colleagues. ____________________",package_114_100.csv,2137,2137,2204,"[congressional record volume 161, number 57 (monday, april 20, 2015)] [senate] [page s2268] from the congressional record online through the government publishing office [ www.gpo.gov ] additional statements ______ remembering michael johnson mrs. boxer. mr. president, today i ask my colleagues to join me in paying tribute to officer michael johnson, a 14-year veteran of the san jose police department who was tragically killed in the line of duty while responding to a call for help on march 24, 2015. michael johnson was born in herlong, ca, where his father served as a military police officer before becoming a deputy for the calaveras county sheriff's department. after moving to san jose as a teenager, officer johnson graduated from gunderson high school in 1995 and joined the san jose police department in 2001, continuing his family's commitment to law enforcement. those who knew officer johnson fondly remember him as a caring and trustworthy colleague who was passionate about his work and loved the community he served. an experienced patrol officer, he was recently promoted to serve as a field training officer and advise new members of the police force. outside of work, officer johnson found joy in hobbies ranging from jujitsu and baking to scuba diving and world travel. he was also an outstanding marksman, winning several awards from the police and fire games. above all else, office johnson is remembered as a loving husband and devoted family man. in 2013, he married the love of his life, nicole, and they planned to celebrate their marriage this summer with a large formal ceremony in santa cruz before starting a family. my heart goes out to nicole and officer johnson's parents daniel johnson and katherine decker, his step-parents dann decker and penny johnson, his sister jamie radack, his brother-in-law steve, and his niece ami and nephew eli. officer johnson's dedicated and courageous service will not be forgotten. on behalf of the people of california and san jose, whom he served so bravely, i extend my gratitude and deepest sympathies to his family, friends, and colleagues. ____________________",2137

Mr. President, today, I wish to congratulate Galena High School on its team of students selected as a national winner in the Samsung Solve for Tomorrow contest. The high school competition was judged based upon how well teams applied science, technology, engineering, and math, STEM, in helping the local community. Seventeen students competed on the core team; however, 85 students from Galena High School contributed to 21 projects that continue to develop as a result of the contest. The team competed with 3,100 other applicants, winning a total of $138,000 for its achievement in being selected as a national winner. This money will be used to purchase new technology for the high school, a contribution that will help future students for years to come. Galena High School students chose to address difficulties faced by fellow peers with disabilities. Specifically, they worked alongside two students with disabilities to bring firsthand experience and realistic application to the project. The students utilized their STEM knowledge to create innovative equipment capable of adapting to difficult scenarios relating to those with disabilities and motor skill restrictions. The students spent hours researching current technology and worked tirelessly, brainstorming and creating solutions to different scenarios and ultimately chose two successful projects. The first, a tool to help special-needs students with typing, and the second, a portable table space making it easier for students with disabilities to carry lunch. These are only 2 of 21 projects that continue to develop and will be distributed to the local community. The students are shining examples of how compassion and hard work can make a difference in the lives of others and stand as role models for future Galena Grizzlies. I am excited to see local students bringing recognition to both Nevada and to Galena High School for their advancement in a national competition. These students should be proud to call themselves top contenders in a competitive environment. I ask my colleagues to join me and all Nevadans in congratulating Galena High School for its success and honorable representation of Nevada. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 57 (Monday, April 20, 2015)] [Senate] [Page S2268] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] CONGRATULATING GALENA HIGH SCHOOL Mr. HELLER.

Mr. President, I wish to pay tribute to Coach Willie Carl Martin of the University of Alabama. After 42 years of coaching football in the Alabama public school system and at the University of Alabama, Coach Willie Carl Martin is retiring. During his high school playing days, he was such an outstanding athlete that the late Coach Paul ``Bear'' Bryant offered him a full scholarship to Alabama. He was the first African-American to be offered an athletic scholarship to the university. He declined the offer and went to college at Northeastern State University, where he was a second team All-American. He then played professional football in Canada for 6 years. He returned to his hometown, Alexander City, AL; where he began his coaching career as an assistant coach, and then as head football coach at Benjamin Russell High School. In 2001, he led Benjamin Russell High School to their first and only State Championship. After 25 years of a truly outstanding and impressive career in high school coaching, Coach Martin was hired as an assistant coach and for player development by Alabama's new coach, Nick Saban, in 2007. During his 8 years at Alabama, he had an instrumental part in Alabama winning three SEC championships and three national championships. Willie Carl has demonstrated exceptional academic and professional careers both in teaching and coaching young students. He is a loyal, dedicated individual who has always had time for his students and players. He is generous with his time with others, regardless of their station in life. He is fortunate enough to have a wife, Leslie, as well as two lovely daughters and grandchildren, who have stood by him in all of his endeavors. I know they, along with his other numerous friends and family, will join me in proclaiming May 12, 2015, as Willie Carl Martin Day in Alexander City, AL. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 57 (Monday, April 20, 2015)] [Senate] [Page S2268] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] TRIBUTE TO WILLIE CARL MARTIN Mr. SHELBY.

CREC-2015-04-20-pt1-PgS2270,CREC-2015-04-20,114,PETITIONS AND MEMORIALS,"[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 57 (Monday, April 20, 2015)] [Senate] [Pages S2270-S2272] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] PETITIONS AND MEMORIALS The following petitions and memorials were laid before the Senate and were referred or ordered to lie on the table as indicated: POM-11. A joint resolution adopted by the Legislature of the State of Nevada urging the United States Congress to facilitate the payment of contractors who completed hazardous fuels treatment projects in the Lake Tahoe Basin pursuant to contracts with the Nevada Fire Safe Council; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources. Assembly Joint Resolution No. 3 Whereas, In 1999, Northern Nevada experienced one of the worst wildfire years on record, with more than 1.6 million acres burned and significant economic and environmental impacts; and Whereas, In the spring of 1999, a resolution was approved at Nevada's first comprehensive fire conference, known as the ``Living With Fire Forum,'' which urged the establishment of a statewide council to provide support to make homes, neighborhoods and communities in Nevada safe from fire; and Whereas, The Nevada Fire Safe Council was formed as a domestic nonprofit corporation on December 10, 1999, and received appropriations from the Nevada Legislature in 2005 and 2007 to administer a community-based wildfire threat reduction program; and Whereas, By March 2007, the Council had grown to include 60 affiliated chapters and 3,515 members; and Whereas, The Angora Fire in the summer of 2007 burned more than 250 structures on private property and more than 3,000 acres in the Lake Tahoe Basin, and further amplified the existing need for mitigation work to reduce the threat of wildfire in communities; and Whereas, Between 2008 and 2012, the Council was awarded over $21 million in federal reimbursement grants to be used to pay public and private entities for the completion of hazardous fuels treatment projects; and Whereas, In July 2011, the Office of Inspector General of the United States Department of Agriculture initiated an audit of the Council's records after receiving a complaint on its hotline alleging that the Council was awarding certain contracts in a noncompetitive manner; and Whereas, The audit report issued by the Inspector General in January 2012 indicated various accounting irregularities in the Council's administration of the federal reimbursement grant money and resulted in the freezing of reimbursement payments of that grant money for completed projects until the accounting deficiencies were corrected; and Whereas, In November 2012, the Council filed for bankruptcy and ceased operations; and Whereas, As a result of the freezing of reimbursement payments and the Council's bankruptcy, various public and private entities that had completed hazardous fuels treatment projects in the Lake Tahoe Basin pursuant to agreements with the Council have not been paid for their services, which has caused significant economic hardship to those entities; and Whereas, On March 20, 2014, California Assemblyman Brian Dahle and his staff were joined by staff from the offices of United States Representatives Doug LaMalfa and Tom McClintock to share their concerns about the outstanding debts of the Council and to explore solutions with Nevada's Legislative Committee for the Review and Oversight of the Tahoe Regional Planning Agency and the Marlette Lake Water System: Now, therefore, be it Resolved by the Assembly and Senate of the State of Nevada, Jointly, That the members of the 78th Session of the Nevada Legislature hereby urge Congress to facilitate the payment of contractors who completed hazardous fuels treatment projects in the Lake Tahoe Basin pursuant to contracts with the Nevada Fire Safe Council and be it further Resolved, That the Chief Clerk of the Assembly prepare and transmit a copy of this resolution to the Attorney General of the United States, the Chief of the United States Forest Service, the Director of the Bureau of Land Management, the Vice President of the United States as the presiding officer of the United States Senate, the Speaker of the House of Representatives and each member of the Nevada Congressional Delegation; and be it further Resolved, That this resolution becomes effective upon passage. ____ POM-12. A concurrent memorial adopted by the Legislature of the State of Arizona urging the United States Congress to provide full long-term funding for the Payment in Lieu of Taxes program and to reauthorize Secure Rural Schools and Community Self-Determination Act funding; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources. Senate Concurrent Memorial 1010 Whereas, the State of Arizona is composed of 113,417 square miles of land, of which 17% is managed by the Bureau of Land Management 15% is managed by the United States Forest Service, 2% is managed by the United States Fish and Wildlife Service, 4% is managed by the National Park Service, 4% is military land and 28% is tribal land. Thus, much of the land in Arizona is unavailable for economic development and is not part of the property tax base; and Whereas, counties are required to provide law enforcement, search and rescue, emergency services, road building and maintenance, and other community services on, or associated with, tax-exempt federally managed public lands; and Whereas, the Payment in Lieu of Taxes (PILT) program was established in 1976 to offset costs incurred by counties for services provided to the federal government and to the users of federally managed lands located within a county; and Whereas, the national average PILT payment in fiscal year 2014 was $0.72 per acre, which is far below the amount that federally managed lands would return through both value-based taxation and economic development; and Whereas, Congress has been unable to pass a long-term funding solution for the PILT program since 2008 and has instead passed last-minute one-year extensions, causing great uncertainty about county finances and services as well as rural school funding; and Whereas, funding for fiscal year 2015 PILT was included in the Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act and the Carl Levin and Howard P. ``Buck'' McKeon National Defense Authorization Act, totaling $442 million, but the fate of fiscal year 2016 and future years is still unknown; and Whereas, a lack of certainty for PILT funding places the large, unsustainable burden of providing services on federally managed lands squarely on the backs of local county taxpayers, while the presence of that federally managed land creates barriers to economic opportunities; and Whereas, rural communities and schools in and around national forests have historically relied on a share of receipts from timber harvests to support education services and roads; and Whereas, in the 1980s, federal restrictions substantially diminished the revenue-generating timber harvests permitted in these forests; and Whereas, the Secure Rural Schools and Community Self- Determination Act (SRS) was passed in 2000 to stabilize and transition payments to counties and schools away from the declining and unreliable share of timber sales; and Whereas, the failure of Congress to honor the more than 100-year-old contract between the federal government and heavily forested communities by not reauthorizing SRS funding for fiscal years 2014 and 2015 will create budgetary shortfalls for rural counties and school districts; and Whereas, failure to immediately secure SRS funding for fiscal years 2014 and 2015 and PILT funding for fiscal year 2016 and into the future for Arizona counties will critically impact the local budget process and structural solvency of counties and the public school systems and will substantially compromise their ability to provide essential services, such as health, safety and welfare; and Whereas, the federal government has the duty to reimburse local jurisdictions for the presence of federally managed public lands in a reliable and consistent manner. Wherefore your memorialist, the Senate of the State of Arizona, the House of Representatives concurring, prays: 1. That the United States Congress provide full long-term funding for the PILT program to help create financial stability within Arizona's counties. 2. That the United States Congress immediately reauthorize SRS funding for fiscal years 2014 and 2015 and work toward a long-term solution. 3. That the United States Congress work with the State of Arizona and county governments to identify and implement policies to promote economic development on, or associated with, federally managed lands. 4. That the Secretary of State of the State of Arizona transmit a copy of this Memorial to the President of the United States, the President of the United States Senate, the Speaker of the United States House of Representatives and each Member of Congress from the State of Arizona. ____ POM-13. A concurrent memorial adopted by the Legislature of the State of Arizona urging the United States Congress to enact legislation exempting United States military bases from the regulations and restrictions of the Endangered Species Act; to the Committee on Environment and Public Works. Senate Concurrent Memorial 1009 Whereas, the mission of the United States Department of Defense is ``to provide the military forces needed to deter war and to protect the security of our country''; and Whereas, according to the Department of Defense and the Government Accountability Office (GAO), a fundamental principle of military readiness is that the military must train as it intends to fight; and Whereas, the Department of Defense has established military training facilities in Arizona, including Fort Huachuca, Davis-Monthan Air Force Base, Luke Air Force Base and the Barry M. Goldwater range, among others, to accomplish this goal; and Whereas, Department of Defense officials indicate that heightened focus on the application of environmental statutes has affected the use of its training areas; and Whereas, compliance with environmental regulations, especially the Endangered Species Act (ESA), has caused some training activities to be canceled, postponed or modified; and Whereas, compliance with environmental regulations, particularly the ESA, has forced military officials to make adjustments to training regimens, including requiring units [[Page S2271]] in training to avoid areas with ESA restrictions; and Whereas, since 2003, the Department of Defense has obtained exemptions from three environmental laws and sought exemptions from three others; and Whereas, these exemptions allow the military to maintain its high state of readiness and help to ensure its ability to meet unexpected threats; and Whereas, these exemptions are under increased scrutiny by environmental groups and federal officials who would rather protect wildlife than allow the military to maintain its readiness; and Whereas, a GAO report found no instances in which the Department of Defense's use of exemptions from the ESA or the Migratory Bird Treaty Act has adversely affected the environment; and Whereas, the United States military has proven itself to be a responsible and effective steward of the land and environment. Wherefore your memorialist, the Senate of the State of Arizona, the House of Representatives concurring, prays: 1. That the United States Congress enact legislation exempting United States military bases and training facilities from the regulations and restrictions of the Endangered Species Act. 2. That the Secretary of State of the State of Arizona transmit a copy of this Memorial to the President of the United States Senate, the Speaker of the United States House of Representatives and each Member of Congress from the State of Arizona. ____ POM-14. A concurrent memorial adopted by the Legislature of the State of Arizona urging the United States Congress to enact the 21st Century Endangered Species Transparency Act; to the Committee on Environment and Public Works. Senate Concurrent Memorial 1012 Whereas, when the Endangered Species Act (ESA) was originally enacted in 1973, the framers and supporters of the ESA envisioned a law that would protect species believed to be on the brink of extinction; and Whereas, at that time, 109 species were listed for protection; and Whereas, today, over 1,500 species in the United States are designated as threatened or endangered under the ESA; and Whereas, as a result of a 2011 mega-settlement between the United States Fish and Wildlife Service and environmental litigants, hundreds more species could be added within the next two years; and Whereas, the ESA is failing to achieve its primary purpose of species recovery as it has only a 2% recovery rate; and Whereas, the ESA was last amended in 1988, which means 27 years have passed since any improvements have been made; and Whereas, the 21st Century Endangered Species Transparency Act would require that data used by federal agencies for ESA listing decisions be made publicly available and accessible through the Internet, while respecting state data privacy laws and private property; and Whereas, the 21st Century Endangered Species Transparency Act would require the federal government to disclose to affected states data used prior to an ESA listing decision and require the ``best available scientific and commercial data'' used by the federal government to incorporate data provided by states, tribes and local county governments; and Whereas, the 21st Century Endangered Species Transparency Act would require the United States Fish and Wildlife Service to track, report to Congress and make available online the federal taxpayer funds used to respond to ESA lawsuits, the number of employees dedicated to ESA litigation and the amount of attorney fees awarded in the course of ESA litigation and settlement agreements; and Whereas, the 21st Century Endangered Species Transparency Act would prioritize species protection and protect taxpayer dollars by placing reasonable caps on attorney fees to make the ESA consistent with existing federal law; and Whereas, the customs, cultures and economic well-being of our local communities, as well as important historic and cultural aspects of our local heritage, are being ignored, which adversely affects the lives and jobs of the people of the United States and devastates local and state economies; and Whereas, a cost-benefit analysis should be required on any ESA action; and Whereas, the United States Chamber of Commerce, the American Farm Bureau Federation, the National Rural Electric Cooperative Association and many others support the 21st Century Endangered Species Transparency Act. Wherefore your memorialist, the Senate of the State of Arizona, the House of Representative concurring, prays: 1. That the Congress of the United States enact the 21st Century Endangered Species Transparency Act. 2. That the Secretary of State of the State of Arizona transmit copies of this Memorial to the President of the United States Senate, the Speaker of the United States House of Representatives and each Member of Congress from the State of Arizona. ____ POM-15. A concurrent memorial adopted by the Legislature of the State of Arizona urging the United States Congress to oppose the implementation of certain technology and emissions reduction rules for new and existing electric generating units; to the Committee on Environment and Public Works. Senate Concurrent Memorial 1013 Whereas, the Clean Air Act (CAA) is a federal law designed to protect air quality nationwide; and Whereas, jurisdiction to implement the CAA lies primarily with the states; and Whereas, in 1970, Congress enacted the CAA, mandating comprehensive state and federal regulations for both stationary and nonstationary sources of pollution; and Whereas, while Americans support efforts to improve air quality, such efforts should be carefully balanced to ensure that the costs of new regulations to the economy do not exceed potential benefits; and Whereas, on June 2, 2014, the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) proposed rules in the Federal Register that will require Arizona to reduce carbon emissions at existing generating facilities by 51.7% by 2030; and Whereas, the carbon reduction targets for Arizona are the second highest in the nation; and Whereas, the interim goal proposed for Arizona would require nearly 90% of the final goal to be achieved by the year 2020: and Whereas, concentrations of greenhouse gases are the result of global emissions and do not pose an immediate risk to public health and safety as do other criteria pollutants; and Whereas, the EPA's proposed rules exceed its legal authority to require reductions in carbon dioxide emissions from fossil fuel-fired electric generating units under Section 111(d) of the CAA and interfere with the electric system of Arizona; and Whereas, addressing greenhouse gas emissions under Section 111(d) is a discretionary duty of the EPA as outlined in the CAA; and Whereas, devoting resources to discretionary duties such as regulating greenhouse gas emissions takes away resources from nondiscretionary duties that are better suited to protect the public health in the near term; and Whereas, it is important to Arizona's economy to have a diverse energy portfolio that provides reliable and affordable electric service to Arizona residents and businesses while protecting the public health and welfare; and Whereas, fossil fuels, including coal and natural gas, provide an abundant, domestic and affordable energy source that is important to Arizona's economy and the availability and reliability of electric service; and Whereas, the EPA ignores the customs, cultures and economic well-being of our local communities as well as important historic and cultural aspects of our local heritage; and Whereas, the EPA's proposed Clean Power Plan will cause significant disruptions in Arizona's electricity supply and transmission system, causing reliability in the system to decrease. Wherefore your memorialist, the Senate of the State of Arizona, the House of Representatives concurring, prays: 1. That the United States Congress oppose the implementation of rules for existing electric generating units that exceed the EPA's legal authority under Section 111 of the CAA and interfere with the prerogative of Arizona to regulate electricity and ensure an affordable and reliable supply of electricity for its citizens. 2. That the United States Congress oppose the implementation of rules for new or existing electric generating units that do not recognize the primary role of states in establishing and implementing plans to achieve emissions reductions for existing units under Section 111 of the CAA. 3. That the United States Congress exercise oversight over the EPA to ensure that the primary role of States in establishing and implementing rules under Section 111 of the CAA is respected. 4. That the Governor and the Attorney General of the State of Arizona take appropriate actions to uphold this state's responsibilities with respect to the CAA and defend the state against overreaching regulations. 5. That the Secretary of State of the State of Arizona transmit a copy of this Memorial to the President of the United States, the President of the United States Senate, the Speaker of the United States House of Representatives, each Member of Congress from the State of Arizona, the Administrator of the United States Environmental Protection Agency, the Governor of the State of Arizona and the Attorney General of the State of Arizona. ____ POM-16. A concurrent memorial adopted by the Legislature of the State of Arizona urging the United States Congress to act to increase the United States Customs field office personnel at the ports of entry in Nogales, Douglas, and San Luis, Arizona; to the Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs. House Concurrent Memorial 2003 Whereas, the United States and Mexico are important trading partners, and commerce between the two countries is a critical source of jobs, income and exchange; and Whereas, according to the United States Department of Commerce, more than $500 billion in bilateral trade and over $100 billion occurs in cross-border investment annually: and Whereas, in Arizona, $28 billion in two-way trade is processed annually through Arizona's ports of entry; and [[Page S2272]] Whereas, according to the United States Census Bureau, Arizona exports to Mexico totaled $7.1 billion in 2013; and Whereas, the prime conduits for cross-border trade are through the ports of entry in Nogales, Douglas and San Luis, Arizona; and Whereas, the Customs Field Office personnel within the United States Custom and Border Protection service of the United States Department of Homeland Security serve a vital function in promoting security and economic stability; and Whereas, the lack of capacity and staffing for customs inspections at these primary entry points create congestion for incoming and outgoing goods, hampers commercial activity and potentially compromises border security; and Whereas, these impediments ultimately translate into perished agricultural produce and lost business opportunities and income; and Whereas, the rapid delivery of goods and commerce enhances business activity and strengthens economic integration; and Whereas, greater inspection capacity at the United States border at the ports of entry in Nogales, Douglas and San Luis, Arizona will enhance the safety and swiftness of goods moving across the border, benefiting the economies of both nations; and Whereas, increasing the number of Customs Field Office personnel at these ports will facilitate commercial traffic and will result in increased economic growth and stability for Arizona; and Whereas, the letter signed by every member of the Arizona Congressional delegation and sent to the United States Department of Homeland Security dated October 14, 2014 expressed the need for greater staffing and allocation of personnel to Arizona's ports of entry. Wherefore your memorialist, the House of Representatives of the State of Arizona, the Senate concurring, prays: 1. That the United States Congress act expediently to increase and maintain staffing for Customs Field Office personnel at the ports of entry in Nogales. Douglas and San Luis, Arizona in order to prudently speed the flow of goods and commerce. 2. That the Secretary of State of the State of Arizona transmit copies of this Memorial to the President of the United States Senate, the Speaker of the United States House of Representatives and each Member of Congress from the State of Arizona. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 57 (Monday, April 20, 2015)] [Senate] [Pages S2270-S2272] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] PETITIONS AND MEMORIALS The following petitions and memorials were laid before the Senate and were referred or ordered to lie on the table as indicated: POM-11.

A concurrent memorial adopted by the Legislature of the State of Arizona urging the United States Congress to provide full long-term funding for the Payment in Lieu of Taxes program and to reauthorize Secure Rural Schools and Community Self-Determination Act funding; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.

A concurrent memorial adopted by the Legislature of the State of Arizona urging the United States Congress to enact legislation exempting United States military bases from the regulations and restrictions of the Endangered Species Act; to the Committee on Environment and Public Works. Senate Concurrent Memorial 1009 Whereas, the mission of the United States Department of Defense is ``to provide the military forces needed to deter war and to protect the security of our country''; and Whereas, according to the Department of Defense and the Government Accountability Office (GAO), a fundamental principle of military readiness is that the military must train as it intends to fight; and Whereas, the Department of Defense has established military training facilities in Arizona, including Fort Huachuca, Davis-Monthan Air Force Base, Luke Air Force Base and the Barry M. Goldwater range, among others, to accomplish this goal; and Whereas, Department of Defense officials indicate that heightened focus on the application of environmental statutes has affected the use of its training areas; and Whereas, compliance with environmental regulations, especially the Endangered Species Act (ESA), has caused some training activities to be canceled, postponed or modified; and Whereas, compliance with environmental regulations, particularly the ESA, has forced military officials to make adjustments to training regimens, including requiring units [[Page S2271]] in training to avoid areas with ESA restrictions; and Whereas, since 2003, the Department of Defense has obtained exemptions from three environmental laws and sought exemptions from three others; and Whereas, these exemptions allow the military to maintain its high state of readiness and help to ensure its ability to meet unexpected threats; and Whereas, these exemptions are under increased scrutiny by environmental groups and federal officials who would rather protect wildlife than allow the military to maintain its readiness; and Whereas, a GAO report found no instances in which the Department of Defense's use of exemptions from the ESA or the Migratory Bird Treaty Act has adversely affected the environment; and Whereas, the United States military has proven itself to be a responsible and effective steward of the land and environment. Wherefore your memorialist, the Senate of the State of Arizona, the House of Representatives concurring, prays: 1. That the United States Congress enact legislation exempting United States military bases and training facilities from the regulations and restrictions of the Endangered Species Act. 2.

A concurrent memorial adopted by the Legislature of the State of Arizona urging the United States Congress to enact the 21st Century Endangered Species Transparency Act; to the Committee on Environment and Public Works. Senate Concurrent Memorial 1012 Whereas, when the Endangered Species Act (ESA) was originally enacted in 1973, the framers and supporters of the ESA envisioned a law that would protect species believed to be on the brink of extinction; and Whereas, at that time, 109 species were listed for protection; and Whereas, today, over 1,500 species in the United States are designated as threatened or endangered under the ESA; and Whereas, as a result of a 2011 mega-settlement between the United States Fish and Wildlife Service and environmental litigants, hundreds more species could be added within the next two years; and Whereas, the ESA is failing to achieve its primary purpose of species recovery as it has only a 2% recovery rate; and Whereas, the ESA was last amended in 1988, which means 27 years have passed since any improvements have been made; and Whereas, the 21st Century Endangered Species Transparency Act would require that data used by federal agencies for ESA listing decisions be made publicly available and accessible through the Internet, while respecting state data privacy laws and private property; and Whereas, the 21st Century Endangered Species Transparency Act would require the federal government to disclose to affected states data used prior to an ESA listing decision and require the ``best available scientific and commercial data'' used by the federal government to incorporate data provided by states, tribes and local county governments; and Whereas, the 21st Century Endangered Species Transparency Act would require the United States Fish and Wildlife Service to track, report to Congress and make available online the federal taxpayer funds used to respond to ESA lawsuits, the number of employees dedicated to ESA litigation and the amount of attorney fees awarded in the course of ESA litigation and settlement agreements; and Whereas, the 21st Century Endangered Species Transparency Act would prioritize species protection and protect taxpayer dollars by placing reasonable caps on attorney fees to make the ESA consistent with existing federal law; and Whereas, the customs, cultures and economic well-being of our local communities, as well as important historic and cultural aspects of our local heritage, are being ignored, which adversely affects the lives and jobs of the people of the United States and devastates local and state economies; and Whereas, a cost-benefit analysis should be required on any ESA action; and Whereas, the United States Chamber of Commerce, the American Farm Bureau Federation, the National Rural Electric Cooperative Association and many others support the 21st Century Endangered Species Transparency Act. Wherefore your memorialist, the Senate of the State of Arizona, the House of Representative concurring, prays: 1. That the Congress of the United States enact the 21st Century Endangered Species Transparency Act. 2. That the Secretary of State of the State of Arizona transmit copies of this Memorial to the President of the United States Senate, the Speaker of the United States House of Representatives and each Member of Congress from the State of Arizona. ____ POM-15. A concurrent memorial adopted by the Legislature of the State of Arizona urging the United States Congress to oppose the implementation of certain technology and emissions reduction rules for new and existing electric generating units; to the Committee on Environment and Public Works. Senate Concurrent Memorial 1013 Whereas, the Clean Air Act (CAA) is a federal law designed to protect air quality nationwide; and Whereas, jurisdiction to implement the CAA lies primarily with the states; and Whereas, in 1970, Congress enacted the CAA, mandating comprehensive state and federal regulations for both stationary and nonstationary sources of pollution; and Whereas, while Americans support efforts to improve air quality, such efforts should be carefully balanced to ensure that the costs of new regulations to the economy do not exceed potential benefits; and Whereas, on June 2, 2014, the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) proposed rules in the Federal Register that will require Arizona to reduce carbon emissions at existing generating facilities by 51.7% by 2030; and Whereas, the carbon reduction targets for Arizona are the second highest in the nation; and Whereas, the interim goal proposed for Arizona would require nearly 90% of the final goal to be achieved by the year 2020: and Whereas, concentrations of greenhouse gases are the result of global emissions and do not pose an immediate risk to public health and safety as do other criteria pollutants; and Whereas, the EPA's proposed rules exceed its legal authority to require reductions in carbon dioxide emissions from fossil fuel-fired electric generating units under Section 111(d) of the CAA and interfere with the electric system of Arizona; and Whereas, addressing greenhouse gas emissions under Section 111(d) is a discretionary duty of the EPA as outlined in the CAA; and Whereas, devoting resources to discretionary duties such as regulating greenhouse gas emissions takes away resources from nondiscretionary duties that are better suited to protect the public health in the near term; and Whereas, it is important to Arizona's economy to have a diverse energy portfolio that provides reliable and affordable electric service to Arizona residents and businesses while protecting the public health and welfare; and Whereas, fossil fuels, including coal and natural gas, provide an abundant, domestic and affordable energy source that is important to Arizona's economy and the availability and reliability of electric service; and Whereas, the EPA ignores the customs, cultures and economic well-being of our local communities as well as important historic and cultural aspects of our local heritage; and Whereas, the EPA's proposed Clean Power Plan will cause significant disruptions in Arizona's electricity supply and transmission system, causing reliability in the system to decrease. Wherefore your memorialist, the Senate of the State of Arizona, the House of Representatives concurring, prays: 1. That the United States Congress oppose the implementation of rules for existing electric generating units that exceed the EPA's legal authority under Section 111 of the CAA and interfere with the prerogative of Arizona to regulate electricity and ensure an affordable and reliable supply of electricity for its citizens. 2. That the United States Congress oppose the implementation of rules for new or existing electric generating units that do not recognize the primary role of states in establishing and implementing plans to achieve emissions reductions for existing units under Section 111 of the CAA. 3. That the United States Congress exercise oversight over the EPA to ensure that the primary role of States in establishing and implementing rules under Section 111 of the CAA is respected. 4. That the Governor and the Attorney General of the State of Arizona take appropriate actions to uphold this state's responsibilities with respect to the CAA and defend the state against overreaching regulations. 5. That the Secretary of State of the State of Arizona transmit a copy of this Memorial to the President of the United States, the President of the United States Senate, the Speaker of the United States House of Representatives, each Member of Congress from the State of Arizona, the Administrator of the United States Environmental Protection Agency, the Governor of the State of Arizona and the Attorney General of the State of Arizona. ____ POM-16.

A joint resolution adopted by the Legislature of the State of Nevada urging the United States Congress to facilitate the payment of contractors who completed hazardous fuels treatment projects in the Lake Tahoe Basin pursuant to contracts with the Nevada Fire Safe Council; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources. Assembly Joint Resolution No. 3 Whereas, In 1999, Northern Nevada experienced one of the worst wildfire years on record, with more than 1.6 million acres burned and significant economic and environmental impacts; and Whereas, In the spring of 1999, a resolution was approved at Nevada's first comprehensive fire conference, known as the ``Living With Fire Forum,'' which urged the establishment of a statewide council to provide support to make homes, neighborhoods and communities in Nevada safe from fire; and Whereas, The Nevada Fire Safe Council was formed as a domestic nonprofit corporation on December 10, 1999, and received appropriations from the Nevada Legislature in 2005 and 2007 to administer a community-based wildfire threat reduction program; and Whereas, By March 2007, the Council had grown to include 60 affiliated chapters and 3,515 members; and Whereas, The Angora Fire in the summer of 2007 burned more than 250 structures on private property and more than 3,000 acres in the Lake Tahoe Basin, and further amplified the existing need for mitigation work to reduce the threat of wildfire in communities; and Whereas, Between 2008 and 2012, the Council was awarded over $21 million in federal reimbursement grants to be used to pay public and private entities for the completion of hazardous fuels treatment projects; and Whereas, In July 2011, the Office of Inspector General of the United States Department of Agriculture initiated an audit of the Council's records after receiving a complaint on its hotline alleging that the Council was awarding certain contracts in a noncompetitive manner; and Whereas, The audit report issued by the Inspector General in January 2012 indicated various accounting irregularities in the Council's administration of the federal reimbursement grant money and resulted in the freezing of reimbursement payments of that grant money for completed projects until the accounting deficiencies were corrected; and Whereas, In November 2012, the Council filed for bankruptcy and ceased operations; and Whereas, As a result of the freezing of reimbursement payments and the Council's bankruptcy, various public and private entities that had completed hazardous fuels treatment projects in the Lake Tahoe Basin pursuant to agreements with the Council have not been paid for their services, which has caused significant economic hardship to those entities; and Whereas, On March 20, 2014, California Assemblyman Brian Dahle and his staff were joined by staff from the offices of United States Representatives Doug LaMalfa and Tom McClintock to share their concerns about the outstanding debts of the Council and to explore solutions with Nevada's Legislative Committee for the Review and Oversight of the Tahoe Regional Planning Agency and the Marlette Lake Water System: Now, therefore, be it Resolved by the Assembly and Senate of the State of Nevada, Jointly, That the members of the 78th Session of the Nevada Legislature hereby urge Congress to facilitate the payment of contractors who completed hazardous fuels treatment projects in the Lake Tahoe Basin pursuant to contracts with the Nevada Fire Safe Council and be it further Resolved, That the Chief Clerk of the Assembly prepare and transmit a copy of this resolution to the Attorney General of the United States, the Chief of the United States Forest Service, the Director of the Bureau of Land Management, the Vice President of the United States as the presiding officer of the United States Senate, the Speaker of the House of Representatives and each member of the Nevada Congressional Delegation; and be it further Resolved, That this resolution becomes effective upon passage. ____ POM-12. A concurrent memorial adopted by the Legislature of the State of Arizona urging the United States Congress to provide full long-term funding for the Payment in Lieu of Taxes program and to reauthorize Secure Rural Schools and Community Self-Determination Act funding; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources. Senate Concurrent Memorial 1010 Whereas, the State of Arizona is composed of 113,417 square miles of land, of which 17% is managed by the Bureau of Land Management 15% is managed by the United States Forest Service, 2% is managed by the United States Fish and Wildlife Service, 4% is managed by the National Park Service, 4% is military land and 28% is tribal land. Thus, much of the land in Arizona is unavailable for economic development and is not part of the property tax base; and Whereas, counties are required to provide law enforcement, search and rescue, emergency services, road building and maintenance, and other community services on, or associated with, tax-exempt federally managed public lands; and Whereas, the Payment in Lieu of Taxes (PILT) program was established in 1976 to offset costs incurred by counties for services provided to the federal government and to the users of federally managed lands located within a county; and Whereas, the national average PILT payment in fiscal year 2014 was $0.72 per acre, which is far below the amount that federally managed lands would return through both value-based taxation and economic development; and Whereas, Congress has been unable to pass a long-term funding solution for the PILT program since 2008 and has instead passed last-minute one-year extensions, causing great uncertainty about county finances and services as well as rural school funding; and Whereas, funding for fiscal year 2015 PILT was included in the Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act and the Carl Levin and Howard P. ``Buck'' McKeon National Defense Authorization Act, totaling $442 million, but the fate of fiscal year 2016 and future years is still unknown; and Whereas, a lack of certainty for PILT funding places the large, unsustainable burden of providing services on federally managed lands squarely on the backs of local county taxpayers, while the presence of that federally managed land creates barriers to economic opportunities; and Whereas, rural communities and schools in and around national forests have historically relied on a share of receipts from timber harvests to support education services and roads; and Whereas, in the 1980s, federal restrictions substantially diminished the revenue-generating timber harvests permitted in these forests; and Whereas, the Secure Rural Schools and Community Self- Determination Act (SRS) was passed in 2000 to stabilize and transition payments to counties and schools away from the declining and unreliable share of timber sales; and Whereas, the failure of Congress to honor the more than 100-year-old contract between the federal government and heavily forested communities by not reauthorizing SRS funding for fiscal years 2014 and 2015 will create budgetary shortfalls for rural counties and school districts; and Whereas, failure to immediately secure SRS funding for fiscal years 2014 and 2015 and PILT funding for fiscal year 2016 and into the future for Arizona counties will critically impact the local budget process and structural solvency of counties and the public school systems and will substantially compromise their ability to provide essential services, such as health, safety and welfare; and Whereas, the federal government has the duty to reimburse local jurisdictions for the presence of federally managed public lands in a reliable and consistent manner. Wherefore your memorialist, the Senate of the State of Arizona, the House of Representatives concurring, prays: 1. That the United States Congress provide full long-term funding for the PILT program to help create financial stability within Arizona's counties. 2. That the United States Congress immediately reauthorize SRS funding for fiscal years 2014 and 2015 and work toward a long-term solution. 3. That the United States Congress work with the State of Arizona and county governments to identify and implement policies to promote economic development on, or associated with, federally managed lands. 4.

and whereas, on march 20, 2014, california assemblyman brian dahle and his staff were joined by staff from the offices of united states representatives doug lamalfa and tom mcclintock to share their concerns about the outstanding debts of the council and to explore solutions with nevada's legislative committee for the review and oversight of the tahoe regional planning agency and the marlette lake water system: now, therefore, be it resolved by the assembly and senate of the state of nevada, jointly, that the members of the 78th session of the nevada legislature hereby urge congress to facilitate the payment of contractors who completed hazardous fuels treatment projects in the lake tahoe basin pursuant to contracts with the nevada fire safe council and be it further resolved, that the chief clerk of the assembly prepare and transmit a copy of this resolution to the attorney general of the united states, the chief of the united states forest service, the director of the bureau of land management, the vice president of the united states as the presiding officer of the united states senate, the speaker of the house of representatives and each member of the nevada congressional delegation; and be it further resolved, that this resolution becomes effective upon passage. ____ pom-12. a concurrent memorial adopted by the legislature of the state of arizona urging the united states congress to provide full long-term funding for the payment in lieu of taxes program and to reauthorize secure rural schools and community self-determination act funding; to the committee on energy and natural resources. senate concurrent memorial 1010 whereas, the state of arizona is composed of 113,417 square miles of land, of which 17% is managed by the bureau of land management 15% is managed by the united states forest service, 2% is managed by the united states fish and wildlife service, 4% is managed by the national park service, 4% is military land and 28% is tribal land. thus, much of the land in arizona is unavailable for economic development and is not part of the property tax base; and whereas, counties are required to provide law enforcement, search and rescue, emergency services, road building and maintenance, and other community services on, or associated with, tax-exempt federally managed public lands; and whereas, the payment in lieu of taxes (pilt) program was established in 1976 to offset costs incurred by counties for services provided to the federal government and to the users of federally managed lands located within a county; and whereas, the national average pilt payment in fiscal year 2014 was $0.72 per acre, which is far below the amount that federally managed lands would return through both value-based taxation and economic development; and whereas, congress has been unable to pass a long-term funding solution for the pilt program since 2008 and has instead passed last-minute one-year extensions, causing great uncertainty about county finances and services as well as rural school funding; and whereas, funding for fiscal year 2015 pilt was included in the consolidated and further continuing appropriations act and the carl levin and howard p. ``buck'' mckeon national defense authorization act, totaling $442 million, but the fate of fiscal year 2016 and future years is still unknown; and whereas, a lack of certainty for pilt funding places the large, unsustainable burden of providing services on federally managed lands squarely on the backs of local county taxpayers, while the presence of that federally managed land creates barriers to economic opportunities; and whereas, rural communities and schools in and around national forests have historically relied on a share of receipts from timber harvests to support education services and roads; and whereas, in the 1980s, federal restrictions substantially diminished the revenue-generating timber harvests permitted in these forests; and whereas, the secure rural schools and community self- determination act (srs) was passed in 2000 to stabilize and transition payments to counties and schools away from the declining and unreliable share of timber sales; and whereas, the failure of congress to honor the more than 100-year-old contract between the federal government and heavily forested communities by not reauthorizing srs funding for fiscal years 2014 and 2015 will create budgetary shortfalls for rural counties and school districts; and whereas, failure to immediately secure srs funding for fiscal years 2014 and 2015 and pilt funding for fiscal year 2016 and into the future for arizona counties will critically impact the local budget process and structural solvency of counties and the public school systems and will substantially compromise their ability to provide essential services, such as health, safety and welfare; and whereas, the federal government has the duty to reimburse local jurisdictions for the presence of federally managed public lands in a reliable and consistent manner. wherefore your memorialist, the senate of the state of arizona, the house of representatives concurring, prays: 1. that the united states congress provide full long-term funding for the pilt program to help create financial stability within arizona's counties. 2. that the united states congress immediately reauthorize srs funding for fiscal years 2014 and 2015 and work toward a long-term solution. 3. that the united states congress work with the state of arizona and county governments to identify and implement policies to promote economic development on, or associated with, federally managed lands. 4. that the secretary of state of the state of arizona transmit a copy of this memorial to the president of the united states, the president of the united states senate, the speaker of the united states house of representatives and each member of congress from the state of arizona. ____ pom-13. a concurrent memorial adopted by the legislature of the state of arizona urging the united states congress to enact legislation exempting united states military bases from the regulations and restrictions of the endangered species act; to the committee on environment and public works. senate concurrent memorial 1009 whereas, the mission of the united states department of defense is ``to provide the military forces needed to deter war and to protect the security of our country''; and whereas, according to the department of defense and the government accountability office (gao), a fundamental principle of military readiness is that the military must train as it intends to fight; and whereas, the department of defense has established military training facilities in arizona, including fort huachuca, davis-monthan air force base, luke air force base and the barry m. goldwater range, among others, to accomplish this goal; and whereas, department of defense officials indicate that heightened focus on the application of environmental statutes has affected the use of its training areas; and whereas, compliance with environmental regulations, especially the endangered species act (esa), has caused some training activities to be canceled, postponed or modified; and whereas, compliance with environmental regulations, particularly the esa, has forced military officials to make adjustments to training regimens, including requiring units [[page s2271]] in training to avoid areas with esa restrictions; and whereas, since 2003, the department of defense has obtained exemptions from three environmental laws and sought exemptions from three others; and whereas, these exemptions allow the military to maintain its high state of readiness and help to ensure its ability to meet unexpected threats; and whereas, these exemptions are under increased scrutiny by environmental groups and federal officials who would rather protect wildlife than allow the military to maintain its readiness; and whereas, a gao report found no instances in which the department of defense's use of exemptions from the esa or the migratory bird treaty act has adversely affected the environment; and whereas, the united states military has proven itself to be a responsible and effective steward of the land and environment. wherefore your memorialist, the senate of the state of arizona, the house of representatives concurring, prays: 1. that the united states congress enact legislation exempting united states military bases and training facilities from the regulations and restrictions of the endangered species act. 2. that the secretary of state of the state of arizona transmit a copy of this memorial to the president of the united states senate, the speaker of the united states house of representatives and each member of congress from the state of arizona. ____ pom-14. a concurrent memorial adopted by the legislature of the state of arizona urging the united states congress to enact the 21st century endangered species transparency act; to the committee on environment and public works. senate concurrent memorial 1012 whereas, when the endangered species act (esa) was originally enacted in 1973, the framers and supporters of the esa envisioned a law that would protect species believed to be on the brink of extinction; and whereas, at that time, 109 species were listed for protection; and whereas, today, over 1,500 species in the united states are designated as threatened or endangered under the esa; and whereas, as a result of a 2011 mega-settlement between the united states fish and wildlife service and environmental litigants, hundreds more species could be added within the next two years; and whereas, the esa is failing to achieve its primary purpose of species recovery as it has only a 2% recovery rate; and whereas, the esa was last amended in 1988, which means 27 years have passed since any improvements have been made; and whereas, the 21st century endangered species transparency act would require that data used by federal agencies for esa listing decisions be made publicly available and accessible through the internet, while respecting state data privacy laws and private property; and whereas, the 21st century endangered species transparency act would require the federal government to disclose to affected states data used prior to an esa listing decision and require the ``best available scientific and commercial data'' used by the federal government to incorporate data provided by states, tribes and local county governments; and whereas, the 21st century endangered species transparency act would require the united states fish and wildlife service to track, report to congress and make available online the federal taxpayer funds used to respond to esa lawsuits, the number of employees dedicated to esa litigation and the amount of attorney fees awarded in the course of esa litigation and settlement agreements; and whereas, the 21st century endangered species transparency act would prioritize species protection and protect taxpayer dollars by placing reasonable caps on attorney fees to make the esa consistent with existing federal law; and whereas, the customs, cultures and economic well-being of our local communities, as well as important historic and cultural aspects of our local heritage, are being ignored, which adversely affects the lives and jobs of the people of the united states and devastates local and state economies; and whereas, a cost-benefit analysis should be required on any esa action; and whereas, the united states chamber of commerce, the american farm bureau federation, the national rural electric cooperative association and many others support the 21st century endangered species transparency act. wherefore your memorialist, the senate of the state of arizona, the house of representative concurring, prays: 1. that the congress of the united states enact the 21st century endangered species transparency act. 2. that the secretary of state of the state of arizona transmit copies of this memorial to the president of the united states senate, the speaker of the united states house of representatives and each member of congress from the state of arizona. ____ pom-15. a concurrent memorial adopted by the legislature of the state of arizona urging the united states congress to oppose the implementation of certain technology and emissions reduction rules for new and existing electric generating units; to the committee on environment and public works. senate concurrent memorial 1013 whereas, the clean air act (caa) is a federal law designed to protect air quality nationwide; and whereas, jurisdiction to implement the caa lies primarily with the states; and whereas, in 1970, congress enacted the caa, mandating comprehensive state and federal regulations for both stationary and nonstationary sources of pollution; and whereas, while americans support efforts to improve air quality, such efforts should be carefully balanced to ensure that the costs of new regulations to the economy do not exceed potential benefits; and whereas, on june 2, 2014, the united states environmental protection agency (epa) proposed rules in the federal register that will require arizona to reduce carbon emissions at existing generating facilities by 51.7% by 2030; and whereas, the carbon reduction targets for arizona are the second highest in the nation; and whereas, the interim goal proposed for arizona would require nearly 90% of the final goal to be achieved by the year 2020: and whereas, concentrations of greenhouse gases are the result of global emissions and do not pose an immediate risk to public health and safety as do other criteria pollutants; and whereas, the epa's proposed rules exceed its legal authority to require reductions in carbon dioxide emissions from fossil fuel-fired electric generating units under section 111(d) of the caa and interfere with the electric system of arizona; and whereas, addressing greenhouse gas emissions under section 111(d) is a discretionary duty of the epa as outlined in the caa; and whereas, devoting resources to discretionary duties such as regulating greenhouse gas emissions takes away resources from nondiscretionary duties that are better suited to protect the public health in the near term; and whereas, it is important to arizona's economy to have a diverse energy portfolio that provides reliable and affordable electric service to arizona residents and businesses while protecting the public health and welfare; and whereas, fossil fuels, including coal and natural gas, provide an abundant, domestic and affordable energy source that is important to arizona's economy and the availability and reliability of electric service; and whereas, the epa ignores the customs, cultures and economic well-being of our local communities as well as important historic and cultural aspects of our local heritage; and whereas, the epa's proposed clean power plan will cause significant disruptions in arizona's electricity supply and transmission system, causing reliability in the system to decrease. wherefore your memorialist, the senate of the state of arizona, the house of representatives concurring, prays: 1. that the united states congress oppose the implementation of rules for existing electric generating units that exceed the epa's legal authority under section 111 of the caa and interfere with the prerogative of arizona to regulate electricity and ensure an affordable and reliable supply of electricity for its citizens. 2. that the united states congress oppose the implementation of rules for new or existing electric generating units that do not recognize the primary role of states in establishing and implementing plans to achieve emissions reductions for existing units under section 111 of the caa. 3. that the united states congress exercise oversight over the epa to ensure that the primary role of states in establishing and implementing rules under section 111 of the caa is respected. 4. that the governor and the attorney general of the state of arizona take appropriate actions to uphold this state's responsibilities with respect to the caa and defend the state against overreaching regulations. 5. that the secretary of state of the state of arizona transmit a copy of this memorial to the president of the united states, the president of the united states senate, the speaker of the united states house of representatives, each member of congress from the state of arizona, the administrator of the united states environmental protection agency, the governor of the state of arizona and the attorney general of the state of arizona. ____ pom-16. a concurrent memorial adopted by the legislature of the state of arizona urging the united states congress to act to increase the united states customs field office personnel at the ports of entry in nogales, douglas, and san luis, arizona; to the committee on homeland security and governmental affairs. house concurrent memorial 2003 whereas, the united states and mexico are important trading partners, and commerce between the two countries is a critical source of jobs, income and exchange; and whereas, according to the united states department of commerce, more than $500 billion in bilateral trade and over $100 billion occurs in cross-border investment annually: and whereas, in arizona, $28 billion in two-way trade is processed annually through arizona's ports of entry; and [[page s2272]] whereas, according to the united states census bureau, arizona exports to mexico totaled $7.1 billion in 2013; and whereas, the prime conduits for cross-border trade are through the ports of entry in nogales, douglas and san luis, arizona; and whereas, the customs field office personnel within the united states custom and border protection service of the united states department of homeland security serve a vital function in promoting security and economic stability; and whereas, the lack of capacity and staffing for customs inspections at these primary entry points create congestion for incoming and outgoing goods, hampers commercial activity and potentially compromises border security; and whereas, these impediments ultimately translate into perished agricultural produce and lost business opportunities and income; and whereas, the rapid delivery of goods and commerce enhances business activity and strengthens economic integration; and whereas, greater inspection capacity at the united states border at the ports of entry in nogales, douglas and san luis, arizona will enhance the safety and swiftness of goods moving across the border, benefiting the economies of both nations; and whereas, increasing the number of customs field office personnel at these ports will facilitate commercial traffic and will result in increased economic growth and stability for arizona; and whereas, the letter signed by every member of the arizona congressional delegation and sent to the united states department of homeland security dated october 14, 2014 expressed the need for greater staffing and allocation of personnel to arizona's ports of entry. wherefore your memorialist, the house of representatives of the state of arizona, the senate concurring, prays: 1. that the united states congress act expediently to increase and maintain staffing for customs field office personnel at the ports of entry in nogales. douglas and san luis, arizona in order to prudently speed the flow of goods and commerce. 2. that the secretary of state of the state of arizona transmit copies of this memorial to the president of the united states senate, the speaker of the united states house of representatives and each member of congress from the state of arizona. ____________________",22780

CREC-2015-04-20-pt1-PgS2274,CREC-2015-04-20,114,STATEMENTS ON INTRODUCED BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS,"[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 57 (Monday, April 20, 2015)] [Senate] [Pages S2274-S2275] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] STATEMENTS ON INTRODUCED BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS By Mrs. FEINSTEIN (for herself and Ms. Collins): S. 1014. A bill to amend the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act to ensure the safety of cosmetics; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions. Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, the use of personal care products is virtually universal in this country. These products include everything from shampoo and hair dye to deodorant and lotion. Troubling examples of negative health effects call into question the safety of some of the chemicals used in these products. For example, methylene glycol, which turns into formaldehyde when heated, is a chemical in the popular hair smoothing treatment known as the ``Brazilian Blowout''. Short term exposure has been reported to cause hair loss, rashes, blistered scalps, nosebleeds, bleeding gums, shortness of breath and vomiting. Over the long term, exposure is associated with an increased risk of cancer. Some ingredients in cosmetics may only be safe for use in certain concentrations. Propyl paraben, a widely used preservative, is found in many products and mimics the hormone estrogen. This has the potential to disrupt the endocrine system, which can lead to a variety of health concerns such as reproductive system disorders. In light of this and other examples, consumers deserve to know that the products they use every day are safe. To do this, Federal oversight of the personal care products industry needs to be strengthened. Europe has a robust system of oversight for personal care products, including consumer protections like product registration and ingredient reviews, but in the United States, the industry is regulated largely on a voluntary basis, with a sparse patchwork of state regulations. The Food and Drug Administration, FDA, has little authority, operating under a Federal law from the 1930s that has seen little change since. Consumers rightly expect that basic protective measures to ensure the safety of personal care product ingredients are in place, but the reality is that FDA doesn't even have mandatory recall authority for products that pose significant harm to human health. I have been working with consumer groups, companies and FDA to put together a bipartisan, middle of the road bill to update the regulatory structure for personal care products, provide a streamlined national system of oversight and accountability, and review the safety of specific chemicals in these products. I am grateful to my colleague, Senator Collins, for working with me in this effort. Today we are introducing the Personal Care Products Safety Act, a comprehensive step forward. The bill, which is the result of feedback we received from a wide range of stakeholders, addresses consumer safety concerns and provides a modernized, predictable and straightforward system of compliance for companies. The Personal Care Products Safety Act will, for the first time, enable the public to know which companies, whether they are American or foreign, are producing and distributing personal care products through a registration system operated by FDA. Companies will provide information about the ingredients in their products and attest to their safety. This updated system will be supported by user fees paid by the industry. Under this legislation, FDA will review at least five chemical ingredients per year for their safety and appropriate use in personal care products. In determining which ingredients to evaluate and their safety, many factors must be considered, including how prevalent the ingredient is, the likely exposure, adverse event reports, and scientific studies from a wide range of sources. The first set of chemicals for review includes: diazolidinyl urea, which is used as a preservative in a wide range of products including deodorant, shampoo, conditioner, bubble bath and lotion; lead acetate, which is used as a color additive in hair dyes; methylene glycol/ formaldehyde, which is used in hair treatments; propyl paraben, which is used as a preservative in a wide range of products including shampoo, conditioner and lotion; quaternium-15, which is used as a preservative in a wide range of products including shampoo, shaving cream, skin creams and cleansers. FDA may deem an ingredient safe, unsafe, or safe under certain uses or conditions. FDA will also be empowered to require warning labels on products with certain ingredients, as appropriate, and limit the amount of an ingredient that may be used in certain products. For example, some ingredients may only be safe when used by professionals in a salon or spa setting. The structure of the legislation encourages, and relies on, public input. There are many opportunities built in for consumer groups, companies, medical professionals, scientists and the public to weigh in with feedback on the ingredients that should be prioritized for review and scientific information that FDA should consider regarding the safety of those ingredients. FDA is required to provide a yearly update to Congress and the public on its progress in reviewing these ingredients and the new oversight system. Many companies follow strict voluntary standards for manufacturing under proper conditions, but the current lack of a Federal standard leaves this to chance. Under this legislation, FDA sets Good Manufacturing Practice guidelines to ensure companies meet a minimum standard. Companies will also need to report adverse health events related to their products to FDA. As more consumers choose to shop online, it is of growing importance that they have access to the same product information they would see in a store. This bill requires all personal care products sold online to include information that is on the label. Consumers will be able to see all ingredients listed, along with any product warnings and other important information on use. We also take steps to reduce animal testing in personal care products, and direct FDA to encourage the use of alternatives and provide specific guidance to companies on non-animal testing methods that are seen as acceptable. This legislation is the product of many different groups working together. I am pleased to have the support of the Personal Care Products Council, which represents over 600 companies, Environmental Working Group, Society for Women's Health Research, HealthyWomen, and National Alliance for Hispanic Health. These individual companies have also stepped forward to independently support the bill: Johnson & Johnson, brands include Neutrogena, Aveeno, Clean & Clear, Lubriderm, Johnson's baby products; Procter & Gamble, brands include [[Page S2275]] Pantene, Head & Shoulders, Clairol, Herbal Essences, Secret, Dolce & Gabbana, Gucci, Ivory, CoverGirl, Olay, Sebastian Professional, Vidal Sassoon; Revlon, brands include Revlon, Almay, Mitchum; Esteee Lauder, brands include Esteee Lauder, Clinique, Origins, Tommy Hilfiger, MAC, La Mer, Bobbi Brown, Donna Karan, Aveda, Michael Kors; Unilever, brands include Dove, Tresemme, Lever, St. Ives, Noxzema, Nexxus, Pond's, Suave, Sunsilk, Vaseline, Degree; L'Oreeal, brands include L'Oreeal Paris, Lancome, Giorgio Armani, Yves Saint Laurent, Kiehl's, Essie, Garnier, Maybelline-New York, Vichy, La Roche-Posay, The Body Shop, Redken. I urge my colleagues to join Senator Collins and me in supporting this effort to modernize our outdated regulatory system for personal care products, and to cosponsor the bill. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 57 (Monday, April 20, 2015)] [Senate] [Pages S2274-S2275] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] STATEMENTS ON INTRODUCED BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS By Mrs. FEINSTEIN (for herself and Ms. Collins): S. 1014.

Under this legislation, FDA sets Good Manufacturing Practice guidelines to ensure companies meet a minimum standard. Companies will also need to report adverse health events related to their products to FDA. As more consumers choose to shop online, it is of growing importance that they have access to the same product information they would see in a store. This bill requires all personal care products sold online to include information that is on the label. Consumers will be able to see all ingredients listed, along with any product warnings and other important information on use. We also take steps to reduce animal testing in personal care products, and direct FDA to encourage the use of alternatives and provide specific guidance to companies on non-animal testing methods that are seen as acceptable.

A bill to amend the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act to ensure the safety of cosmetics; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions. Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, the use of personal care products is virtually universal in this country. These products include everything from shampoo and hair dye to deodorant and lotion. Troubling examples of negative health effects call into question the safety of some of the chemicals used in these products. For example, methylene glycol, which turns into formaldehyde when heated, is a chemical in the popular hair smoothing treatment known as the ``Brazilian Blowout''. Short term exposure has been reported to cause hair loss, rashes, blistered scalps, nosebleeds, bleeding gums, shortness of breath and vomiting. Over the long term, exposure is associated with an increased risk of cancer. Some ingredients in cosmetics may only be safe for use in certain concentrations. Propyl paraben, a widely used preservative, is found in many products and mimics the hormone estrogen. This has the potential to disrupt the endocrine system, which can lead to a variety of health concerns such as reproductive system disorders. In light of this and other examples, consumers deserve to know that the products they use every day are safe. To do this, Federal oversight of the personal care products industry needs to be strengthened. Europe has a robust system of oversight for personal care products, including consumer protections like product registration and ingredient reviews, but in the United States, the industry is regulated largely on a voluntary basis, with a sparse patchwork of state regulations. The Food and Drug Administration, FDA, has little authority, operating under a Federal law from the 1930s that has seen little change since. Consumers rightly expect that basic protective measures to ensure the safety of personal care product ingredients are in place, but the reality is that FDA doesn't even have mandatory recall authority for products that pose significant harm to human health. I have been working with consumer groups, companies and FDA to put together a bipartisan, middle of the road bill to update the regulatory structure for personal care products, provide a streamlined national system of oversight and accountability, and review the safety of specific chemicals in these products. I am grateful to my colleague, Senator Collins, for working with me in this effort. Today we are introducing the Personal Care Products Safety Act, a comprehensive step forward. The bill, which is the result of feedback we received from a wide range of stakeholders, addresses consumer safety concerns and provides a modernized, predictable and straightforward system of compliance for companies. The Personal Care Products Safety Act will, for the first time, enable the public to know which companies, whether they are American or foreign, are producing and distributing personal care products through a registration system operated by FDA. Companies will provide information about the ingredients in their products and attest to their safety. This updated system will be supported by user fees paid by the industry. Under this legislation, FDA will review at least five chemical ingredients per year for their safety and appropriate use in personal care products. In determining which ingredients to evaluate and their safety, many factors must be considered, including how prevalent the ingredient is, the likely exposure, adverse event reports, and scientific studies from a wide range of sources. The first set of chemicals for review includes: diazolidinyl urea, which is used as a preservative in a wide range of products including deodorant, shampoo, conditioner, bubble bath and lotion; lead acetate, which is used as a color additive in hair dyes; methylene glycol/ formaldehyde, which is used in hair treatments; propyl paraben, which is used as a preservative in a wide range of products including shampoo, conditioner and lotion; quaternium-15, which is used as a preservative in a wide range of products including shampoo, shaving cream, skin creams and cleansers. FDA may deem an ingredient safe, unsafe, or safe under certain uses or conditions. FDA will also be empowered to require warning labels on products with certain ingredients, as appropriate, and limit the amount of an ingredient that may be used in certain products. For example, some ingredients may only be safe when used by professionals in a salon or spa setting. The structure of the legislation encourages, and relies on, public input. There are many opportunities built in for consumer groups, companies, medical professionals, scientists and the public to weigh in with feedback on the ingredients that should be prioritized for review and scientific information that FDA should consider regarding the safety of those ingredients. FDA is required to provide a yearly update to Congress and the public on its progress in reviewing these ingredients and the new oversight system. Many companies follow strict voluntary standards for manufacturing under proper conditions, but the current lack of a Federal standard leaves this to chance.

Consumers will be able to see all ingredients listed, along with any product warnings and other important information on use. We also take steps to reduce animal testing in personal care products, and direct FDA to encourage the use of alternatives and provide specific guidance to companies on non-animal testing methods that are seen as acceptable. This legislation is the product of many different groups working together. I am pleased to have the support of the Personal Care Products Council, which represents over 600 companies, Environmental Working Group, Society for Women's Health Research, HealthyWomen, and National Alliance for Hispanic Health. These individual companies have also stepped forward to independently support the bill: Johnson & Johnson, brands include Neutrogena, Aveeno, Clean & Clear, Lubriderm, Johnson's baby products; Procter & Gamble, brands include [[Page S2275]] Pantene, Head & Shoulders, Clairol, Herbal Essences, Secret, Dolce & Gabbana, Gucci, Ivory, CoverGirl, Olay, Sebastian Professional, Vidal Sassoon; Revlon, brands include Revlon, Almay, Mitchum; Esteee Lauder, brands include Esteee Lauder, Clinique, Origins, Tommy Hilfiger, MAC, La Mer, Bobbi Brown, Donna Karan, Aveda, Michael Kors; Unilever, brands include Dove, Tresemme, Lever, St. Ives, Noxzema, Nexxus, Pond's, Suave, Sunsilk, Vaseline, Degree; L'Oreeal, brands include L'Oreeal Paris, Lancome, Giorgio Armani, Yves Saint Laurent, Kiehl's, Essie, Garnier, Maybelline-New York, Vichy, La Roche-Posay, The Body Shop, Redken. I urge my colleagues to join Senator Collins and me in supporting this effort to modernize our outdated regulatory system for personal care products, and to cosponsor the bill. ____________________",package_114_100.csv,7633,7633,7700,"[congressional record volume 161, number 57 (monday, april 20, 2015)] [senate] [pages s2274-s2275] from the congressional record online through the government publishing office [ www.gpo.gov ] by mrs. feinstein (for herself and ms. collins): s. 1014. a bill to amend the federal food, drug, and cosmetic act to ensure the safety of cosmetics; to the committee on health, education, labor, and pensions. mrs. feinstein. mr. president, the use of personal care products is virtually universal in this country. these products include everything from shampoo and hair dye to deodorant and lotion. troubling examples of negative health effects call into question the safety of some of the chemicals used in these products. for example, methylene glycol, which turns into formaldehyde when heated, is a chemical in the popular hair smoothing treatment known as the ``brazilian blowout''. short term exposure has been reported to cause hair loss, rashes, blistered scalps, nosebleeds, bleeding gums, shortness of breath and vomiting. over the long term, exposure is associated with an increased risk of cancer. some ingredients in cosmetics may only be safe for use in certain concentrations. propyl paraben, a widely used preservative, is found in many products and mimics the hormone estrogen. this has the potential to disrupt the endocrine system, which can lead to a variety of health concerns such as reproductive system disorders. in light of this and other examples, consumers deserve to know that the products they use every day are safe. to do this, federal oversight of the personal care products industry needs to be strengthened. europe has a robust system of oversight for personal care products, including consumer protections like product registration and ingredient reviews, but in the united states, the industry is regulated largely on a voluntary basis, with a sparse patchwork of state regulations. the food and drug administration, fda, has little authority, operating under a federal law from the 1930s that has seen little change since. consumers rightly expect that basic protective measures to ensure the safety of personal care product ingredients are in place, but the reality is that fda doesn't even have mandatory recall authority for products that pose significant harm to human health. i have been working with consumer groups, companies and fda to put together a bipartisan, middle of the road bill to update the regulatory structure for personal care products, provide a streamlined national system of oversight and accountability, and review the safety of specific chemicals in these products. i am grateful to my colleague, senator collins, for working with me in this effort. today we are introducing the personal care products safety act, a comprehensive step forward. the bill, which is the result of feedback we received from a wide range of stakeholders, addresses consumer safety concerns and provides a modernized, predictable and straightforward system of compliance for companies. the personal care products safety act will, for the first time, enable the public to know which companies, whether they are american or foreign, are producing and distributing personal care products through a registration system operated by fda. companies will provide information about the ingredients in their products and attest to their safety. this updated system will be supported by user fees paid by the industry. under this legislation, fda will review at least five chemical ingredients per year for their safety and appropriate use in personal care products. in determining which ingredients to evaluate and their safety, many factors must be considered, including how prevalent the ingredient is, the likely exposure, adverse event reports, and scientific studies from a wide range of sources. the first set of chemicals for review includes: diazolidinyl urea, which is used as a preservative in a wide range of products including deodorant, shampoo, conditioner, bubble bath and lotion; lead acetate, which is used as a color additive in hair dyes; methylene glycol/ formaldehyde, which is used in hair treatments; propyl paraben, which is used as a preservative in a wide range of products including shampoo, conditioner and lotion; quaternium-15, which is used as a preservative in a wide range of products including shampoo, shaving cream, skin creams and cleansers. fda may deem an ingredient safe, unsafe, or safe under certain uses or conditions. fda will also be empowered to require warning labels on products with certain ingredients, as appropriate, and limit the amount of an ingredient that may be used in certain products. for example, some ingredients may only be safe when used by professionals in a salon or spa setting. the structure of the legislation encourages, and relies on, public input. there are many opportunities built in for consumer groups, companies, medical professionals, scientists and the public to weigh in with feedback on the ingredients that should be prioritized for review and scientific information that fda should consider regarding the safety of those ingredients. fda is required to provide a yearly update to congress and the public on its progress in reviewing these ingredients and the new oversight system. many companies follow strict voluntary standards for manufacturing under proper conditions, but the current lack of a federal standard leaves this to chance. under this legislation, fda sets good manufacturing practice guidelines to ensure companies meet a minimum standard. companies will also need to report adverse health events related to their products to fda. as more consumers choose to shop online, it is of growing importance that they have access to the same product information they would see in a store. this bill requires all personal care products sold online to include information that is on the label. consumers will be able to see all ingredients listed, along with any product warnings and other important information on use. we also take steps to reduce animal testing in personal care products, and direct fda to encourage the use of alternatives and provide specific guidance to companies on non-animal testing methods that are seen as acceptable. this legislation is the product of many different groups working together. i am pleased to have the support of the personal care products council, which represents over 600 companies, environmental working group, society for women's health research, healthywomen, and national alliance for hispanic health. these individual companies have also stepped forward to independently support the bill: johnson & johnson, brands include neutrogena, aveeno, clean & clear, lubriderm, johnson's baby products;

ROSA L. DeLAURO of connecticut in the house of representatives Thursday, April 16, 2015 Ms. DeLAURO. Madam Speaker, I rise in opposition to this reckless and regressive bill. My colleagues in the Majority often claim to be opposed to government spending they describe as ``wasteful.'' But this bill is the epitome of wasteful spending. By permanently repealing the estate tax, without any additional revenue whatsoever to cover the losses, it increases our nation's deficit by almost $270 billion. Make no mistake--tax breaks are spending. Moreover, this bill spends money on those who need it least. According to the Joint Committee on Taxation, only the wealthiest 0.2 percent of estates will benefit at all, and almost three quarters of the benefits will go to estates worth more than $20 million. For every rich estate that reaps the benefits of this bill, there are ten thousand of our fellow citizens living in poverty. Yet the same House Majority that now supports this bill also passed a budget last month that would cut $125 billion from food stamps and kick up to 20 million Americans off Medicaid--all at a time when working families are struggling to make ends meet. Talk about misplaced priorities. Madam Speaker, instead of spending hundreds of billions on a tax break for a wealthy elite, we should be directing more assistance to those who are in genuine need. That is why I urge my colleagues to vote against this bill. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 57 (Monday, April 20, 2015)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E529] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] DEATH TAX REPEAL ACT OF 2015 ______ speech of HON.

My colleagues in the Majority often claim to be opposed to government spending they describe as ``wasteful.'' But this bill is the epitome of wasteful spending. By permanently repealing the estate tax, without any additional revenue whatsoever to cover the losses, it increases our nation's deficit by almost $270 billion. Make no mistake--tax breaks are spending. Moreover, this bill spends money on those who need it least. According to the Joint Committee on Taxation, only the wealthiest 0.2 percent of estates will benefit at all, and almost three quarters of the benefits will go to estates worth more than $20 million. For every rich estate that reaps the benefits of this bill, there are ten thousand of our fellow citizens living in poverty.

CREC-2015-04-20-pt1-PgE529-3,CREC-2015-04-20,114,ALL LIVES MATTER,"[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 57 (Monday, April 20, 2015)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E529] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] ALL LIVES MATTER ______ HON. SHEILA JACKSON LEE of texas in the house of representatives Monday, April 20, 2015 Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, April 4, 1968 in an unforgettable day because on that day the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., a man of peace who devoted his life to nonviolence, was struck down by an assassin's bullet in Memphis, Tennessee. Sadly, April 4, 2015, will also take its place as a day of infamy because on that day in North Charleston, South Carolina, a man less celebrated but no less innocent, Walter Scott, was slain in an act of lethal violence that shocks the conscience. I rise today to extend my deepest sympathies to the family and loved ones of Walter Scott, who was laid to rest this past Saturday, and call upon this Congress to enact legislation that will provide the resources and guidance needed for law enforcement personnel to maintain the trust and confidence and support of the communities they serve and the safeguards needed to protect our people from becoming victims of excessive or lethal force. Mr. Speaker, the problems revealed by several of the more notorious incidents involving the use of lethal force against unarmed citizens that have captured the attention of the nation over the past several months require a national response because the problems identified are not isolated or limited to one region of the country. For example, the death of 43 year-old Eric Garner resulting from the application of a NYPD police chokehold occurred in the Northeast and the death of 18-year-old Michael Brown and the resulting events in Ferguson occurred in the border state of Missouri. The killing of 12 year-old Tamir Rice by a Cleveland police officer occurred in the Midwest and death of unarmed 26 year-old Jordan Baker by an off-duty Houston police officer occurred in Texas. In Phoenix, Arizona, Rumain Brisbon, an unarmed black father of four, was shot to death when a police officer allegedly mistook his bottle of pills for a gun. In Pasdena, California, 19-year-old Kendrec McDade was chased and shot seven times by two police officers after a 911 caller falsely reported he had been robbed at gunpoint by two black men, neither of whom in fact was armed. And, of course, on April 4, the conscience of the nation was shocked by the horrifying killing of 50-year-old Walter Scott by a North Charleston police officer in the southern state of South Carolina. Mr. Speaker, while the problem is national in scope, it appears to affect disproportionately and adversely a particular demographic group: African American males. Because all lives matter in our great nation, it is imperative that we in Congress act swiftly and decisively to focus much needed attention and resources on legislative proposals intended to address the problem of misuse of lethal force by law enforcement and to rebuild the public trust and confidence needed to ensure that law enforcement receive and maintain the support of the communities they serve and protect. As Ranking Member of the Judiciary Committee's Subcommittee on Crime, Terrorism, Homeland Security, and Investigations, I note that are several promising legislative criminal justice reform initiatives that have been introduced and are worthy of consideration. Among them are H.R. 59, the ``Build TRUST in Municipal Law Enforcement Act of 2015'' (Rep. Jackson Lee); H.R. 1459, the Democracy Restoration Act of 2015 (Rep. Conyers); H.R. 1810, the ``Collection and Analysis of Data to Educate and Train Law Enforcement Officers'' (``CADET Act''); H.R. 920, the ``Smarter Sentencing Act of 2015'' (Rep. Labrador); and S. 675, the ``Record Expungement Designed to Enhance Employment Act of 2015'' (REDEEM Act) (Sens. Paul and Booker). Mr. Speaker, earlier this year FBI Director James Comey delivered a remarkable speech at Georgetown University in which he laid out several hard truths about the administration of the criminal justice system and state of community policing in our country. One of the hardest truths discussed by Director Comey is the fact we have limited information and inadequate data regarding the scope and extent of the problems endemic in the criminal justice system. This lack of information hampers the ability of policymakers and administrators at the federal, state, and local level to identify and implement laws, policies, and practices to remedy identified problems. The Judiciary Committee should immediately conduct hearings to educate the Congress and the public on the nature and extent of deficiencies in the nation's criminal justice systems and the efficacy of proposed solutions. Specifically, hearings should be held to investigate practices and policies governing: 1. the use of lethal force by state and local police departments; 2. educational requirements, mental health and psychological evaluations, and training in non-violent conflict resolution received by veteran law enforcement officers and new recruits; and 3. the feasibility and efficacy of making greater use of technological devices such as body cameras. A fourth area to be explored is the state of the social science research in the academic study of criminal justice reform because there is much the Committee can learn by engaging leading experts in the field regarding the state of knowledge in their respective disciplines. Mr. Speaker, reforming the criminal justice system so that it dispenses justice impartially and equally to all persons is one of the most important challenges facing this Congress. And it is a goal that can be achieved if we work together in a spirit of goodwill and bipartisan cooperation. There are few things we can do that will provide a greater service to our nation. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 57 (Monday, April 20, 2015)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E529] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] ALL LIVES MATTER ______ HON.

Mr. Speaker, as Congressman for New York's 16th District, I am always honored to have community groups working to better both their neighborhoods and the lives of those who live in them. For 90 years, the Bronxville Women's Club (BWC) has done just that, serving the greater good in Bronxville and its surrounding area. The BWC was founded in 1925, just as women's clubs were popularized and forming all throughout Westchester County and the country. Born out of the suffrage movement, the club's original mission has expanded over the years to include philanthropic work geared toward education and the arts, in addition to overall communal improvement. The organization's stated mission of serving as a source [[Page E530]] and center for enrichment, and contributing to the community through philanthropic work and cultural projects, has made the BWC one of the preeminent community organizations in the entire county. As the BWC celebrates its 90th Anniversary, it is also celebrating two incredible honorees; Lorraine Lange, recipient of the Woman of the Year Award, and Helen Marie Ringeisen, this year's Distinguished Cultural Leadership Award winner. Both of these women embody the spirit of the BWC, and are most deserving of this wonderful honor. Although many of the post-suffrage movement women's clubs closed, the BWC has thrived, and is often referred to around Bronxville as ``the best kept secret in town.'' Their success is a testament to their leadership, their members, and all of the incredible work they've done. I am proud to represent such a remarkable club and I wish them another 90 years of amazing success and achievement. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 57 (Monday, April 20, 2015)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Pages E529-E530] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] HONORING BRONXVILLE WOMEN'S CLUB 90TH ANNIVERSARY ______ HON.
