The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Washington (Mr. Heck) for 5 minutes. Mr. HECK of Washington. Madam Speaker, ticktock, ticktock. The countdown has begun. Beginning tomorrow, there are exactly--count them--30 legislative days left before the Export-Import Bank is gone--vanished, disappeared--and each day that we fail to address this vital institution for American jobs, we let the obstructionists win. We let this bipartisan, eight decade champion of American exports go away. The irony of it all is, as my dear friend from Texas, Congressman Green, once observed, if we didn't have an Export-Import Bank, we would all be scurrying around, trying to figure out how to invent it in order to compete with every other developed country in the world that has an export credit authority. Ticktock. Ticktock. American companies are, unfortunately, already hurting. It is happening now. We don't have to wait for May or June or July 1, which is the day the bank will disappear if we do not reauthorize it. I am speaking in the present tense. Export contracts are being lost now-- today--as we speak. Production lines are slowing. Labor needs are being reevaluated. Let me be clear: American corporations and companies are already losing deals to our global competitors because of this pointless fight. It is hurting companies now. American companies are being penalized because, yet again, unfortunately, Congress procrastinates; yet we have a bill to reauthorize the Export-Import Bank. We have two bills with substantial, broad, deep, bipartisan support--250 Members out of 435, to put a fine point on it. There are 60 for Congressman Fincher of Tennessee's bill and 190 for Congresswoman Waters', Congresswoman Moore's, and my bill. Again, every other developed nation on the face of the planet has an export credit authority, and most of them are larger as a percent of their gross domestic products than ours is. To allow it to expire is to engage in nothing short of--and this is not hyperbole--unilateral economic disarmament. Ticktock. Ticktock. Small businesses are the ones that will be hurt first. Now, I know a lot of the focus of debate about the Export-Import Bank is Boeing. Yes, Boeing will be hurt. That is for sure. Although, I enjoy reminding people that the Boeing Company assembles airplanes, and what they depend upon is the supply chain of 12,000 businesses and vendors-- thousands of whom are, in fact, small businesses. Nearly 90 percent of all of the Export-Import Bank's transactions are to provide loans or loan guarantees to small businesses. They are the backbone of our economy. Everybody knows it. Nearly one in three jobs created in the last decade was created by small businesses, and they will be hurt first, small businesses like STAC, Inc., in Sumner, Washington. It is a veteran-owned business that provides industrial tapes and adhesives and a host of other fasteners. They predict, as their owner told me personally, that they could hire 40 percent more staff as a consequence of their exports. The truth of the matter is that there is a STAC in every congressional district in America--in every town, in every city, in every community, in every neighborhood--and they need and use the export credit agency of this Nation, the Export-Import Bank, just like the businesses of every other developed nation in the world. The rest of the world is growing a middle class. We all know it. If we want to keep and expand ours, then we are going to have to engage in global trade with one of the tools known as the Export-Import Bank. We have to sell in to their growing middle class.

The Chair recognizes the gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. Jones) for 5 minutes. Mr. JONES. Mr. Speaker, last week, mailman Doug Hughes flew a gyrocopter onto the Capitol lawn to make a point about the influence of money in politics. While I don't condone violating restricted airspace and [[Page H2320]] putting innocent people at risk by flying a gyrocopter onto the Capitol lawn, Mr. Hughes does have a point about the pervasive influence of money in politics. I have seen it get worse and worse during my 20 years in Congress. The Citizens United decision by the United States Supreme Court in 2010 created super-PACs and multi-millionaires who buy candidates. As of April 8, 2015, there were 1,360 super-PACs in existence that controlled nearly $700 million in the 2014 election cycle, according to OpenSecrets.org. The American people have lost confidence in the House and in the Senate partially because super-PACs influence candidates and politicians. Too many times I have seen bills come to the floor of the House that seem influenced by money. Just last week, the House voted on H.R. 650, the Preserving Access to Manufactured Housing Act of 2015, which does nothing but line the pockets of Warren Buffett by enabling his near- monopoly of the mobile home industry to strap poor people with higher interest rates while his companies are being protected from government regulations against predatory lending. It is my disgust at this influence of money in politics that has led me to be a cosponsor of H.R. 20, the Government by the People Act, introduced by my colleague Congressman John Sarbanes. H.R. 20 would curb the influence of super-PACs so that small donors can have a voice again. We in Congress owe the American people a vote on this bill so we can inspire confidence in our democratic process. House leadership should bring this bill to the floor, but I know it won't happen. There isn't the stomach for reform bills in this Congress, even for bipartisan reform bills. Maybe it does take a statement like Mr. Hughes' to bring this issue into the national debate and to make Congress address our out-of-control fund-raising. I ask my colleagues in both parties in the House of Representatives to look seriously at the John Sarbanes bill, because the Government by the People Act will help to restore the confidence of the American people. We cannot stop what is already public law, and we cannot change Citizens United unless we go back through the legal process, but we can have an alternative. That is what the John Sarbanes bill does, so I hope Republicans and Democrats will look seriously at becoming cosponsors. I ask God to bless America. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 58 (Tuesday, April 21, 2015)] [House] [Pages H2319-H2320] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] GOVERNMENT BY THE PEOPLE ACT The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Denham).

Mr. Speaker, last week, mailman Doug Hughes flew a gyrocopter onto the Capitol lawn to make a point about the influence of money in politics. While I don't condone violating restricted airspace and [[Page H2320]] putting innocent people at risk by flying a gyrocopter onto the Capitol lawn, Mr. Hughes does have a point about the pervasive influence of money in politics. I have seen it get worse and worse during my 20 years in Congress. The Citizens United decision by the United States Supreme Court in 2010 created super-PACs and multi-millionaires who buy candidates. As of April 8, 2015, there were 1,360 super-PACs in existence that controlled nearly $700 million in the 2014 election cycle, according to OpenSecrets.org. The American people have lost confidence in the House and in the Senate partially because super-PACs influence candidates and politicians. Too many times I have seen bills come to the floor of the House that seem influenced by money. Just last week, the House voted on H.R. 650, the Preserving Access to Manufactured Housing Act of 2015, which does nothing but line the pockets of Warren Buffett by enabling his near- monopoly of the mobile home industry to strap poor people with higher interest rates while his companies are being protected from government regulations against predatory lending. It is my disgust at this influence of money in politics that has led me to be a cosponsor of H.R. 20, the Government by the People Act, introduced by my colleague Congressman John Sarbanes. H.R. 20 would curb the influence of super-PACs so that small donors can have a voice again. We in Congress owe the American people a vote on this bill so we can inspire confidence in our democratic process. House leadership should bring this bill to the floor, but I know it won't happen. There isn't the stomach for reform bills in this Congress, even for bipartisan reform bills. Maybe it does take a statement like Mr. Hughes' to bring this issue into the national debate and to make Congress address our out-of-control fund-raising. I ask my colleagues in both parties in the House of Representatives to look seriously at the John Sarbanes bill, because the Government by the People Act will help to restore the confidence of the American people. We cannot stop what is already public law, and we cannot change Citizens United unless we go back through the legal process, but we can have an alternative. That is what the John Sarbanes bill does, so I hope Republicans and Democrats will look seriously at becoming cosponsors. I ask God to bless America. ____________________",package_114_99.csv,2948,2948,3016,"[congressional record volume 161, number 58 (tuesday, april 21, 2015)] [house] [pages h2319-h2320] from the congressional record online through the government publishing office [ www.gpo.gov ] government by the people act the speaker pro tempore (mr. denham). the chair recognizes the gentleman from north carolina (mr. jones) for 5 minutes. mr. jones. mr. speaker, last week, mailman doug hughes flew a gyrocopter onto the capitol lawn to make a point about the influence of money in politics. while i don't condone violating restricted airspace and [[page h2320]] putting innocent people at risk by flying a gyrocopter onto the capitol lawn, mr. hughes does have a point about the pervasive influence of money in politics. i have seen it get worse and worse during my 20 years in congress. the citizens united decision by the united states supreme court in 2010 created super-pacs and multi-millionaires who buy candidates. as of april 8, 2015, there were 1,360 super-pacs in existence that controlled nearly $700 million in the 2014 election cycle, according to opensecrets.org. the american people have lost confidence in the house and in the senate partially because super-pacs influence candidates and politicians. too many times i have seen bills come to the floor of the house that seem influenced by money. just last week, the house voted on h.r. 650, the preserving access to manufactured housing act of 2015, which does nothing but line the pockets of warren buffett by enabling his near- monopoly of the mobile home industry to strap poor people with higher interest rates while his companies are being protected from government regulations against predatory lending. it is my disgust at this influence of money in politics that has led me to be a cosponsor of h.r. 20, the government by the people act, introduced by my colleague congressman john sarbanes. h.r. 20 would curb the influence of super-pacs so that small donors can have a voice again. we in congress owe the american people a vote on this bill so we can inspire confidence in our democratic process. house leadership should bring this bill to the floor, but i know it won't happen. there isn't the stomach for reform bills in this congress, even for bipartisan reform bills. maybe it does take a statement like mr. hughes' to bring this issue into the national debate and to make congress address our out-of-control fund-raising. i ask my colleagues in both parties in the house of representatives to look seriously at the john sarbanes bill, because the government by the people act will help to restore the confidence of the american people. we cannot stop what is already public law, and we cannot change citizens united unless we go back through the legal process, but we can have an alternative. that is what the john sarbanes bill does, so i hope republicans and democrats will look seriously at becoming cosponsors. i ask god to bless america. ____________________",2948

Mr. Speaker, it isn't often that Members can take to the House floor to share good news, but, this morning, I have an opportunity to do just that. Today, I rise to honor the 150th anniversary of the First Baptist Church on East Winchester Street in my hometown of Gallatin. Founded in 1865 by a former slave named Robert Belote, the First Baptist Church is a congregation steeped in history and poised to continue changing hearts and changing lives for many years to come. Its mission is to be a ``church of welcome,'' and over the years, they have certainly lived up to that goal. In the beginning, their congregation was known as Union Church because they welcomed ex-slaves from all denominations--Catholic, Baptist, Presbyterian. No matter your background or your upbringing, there was a place for all of God's children within their pews. {time} 1215 The church has been destroyed multiple times over the years, first by heavy winds and then by fire, but they always rebuilt and reemerged stronger than before. They weathered the Reconstruction era following the Civil War, the economic uncertainty of the Great Depression, and the rise and the fall of the Jim Crow South. They are truly a statement to Christ's promise in the Gospel of Matthew when He proclaimed, ``Upon this rock I will build My church, and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it.'' Today the church's attendance climbed to approximately 1,000 people. I have had the opportunity to join my friends and neighbors at First Baptist Church for worship on many occasions. I have sat under the powerful teaching of their pastor and my dear friend, Reverend Derrick Jackson, and I can tell you that, 150 years later, God is still doing mighty work in the life of this special community of believers. I am thankful for how First Baptist Church has personally ministered to me and so many others in our community, and I wish them many years of continued growth and prosperity. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 58 (Tuesday, April 21, 2015)] [House] [Page H2320] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] 150TH ANNIVERSARY OF FIRST BAPTIST CHURCH, GALLATIN, TENNESSEE The SPEAKER pro tempore.

The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Danny K. Davis) for 5 minutes. Mr. DANNY K. DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I was just thinking that one of the reasons I like spring so much and so well is that we get an opportunity to interact a bit more with young people, with our children, and I have seen many around here this morning all over the place, and I simply want to welcome them. Also, yesterday, I got an opportunity to visit two schools. The first was the Proviso Area School for Exceptional Children in Maywood, Illinois, where we just had a wonderful time. Then, in the afternoon, I did a book fair at the Lovett Elementary School with its principal, Dr. Haney. The young people at Lovett were saying they just love being at Lovett, so it was a refreshing day. Like many of my colleagues, I also use a lot of interns and fellows who come and learn and work and who are engaged and involved. The statement that I am going to read today was developed by one of my interns, Jakie Martinez. Jakie has been working on health issues, and she came up with this statement. So I come here today to speak of a health concern that many women are likely to develop in their lifetimes. Known as one of the most common gynecological disorders, uterine fibroids affect nearly 70 percent of Caucasian women and more than 80 percent of African American women by the age of 50. For many of these women the associated symptoms of this diagnosis will significantly impact their quality of life, work, personal relationships, and daily activities. The prevalence of uterine fibroids is one that increases with age. Although we see a commonality in the disorder and its symptoms, the greater public has not yet received the proper continued education into the causes and treatment options available for women who suffer from these fibroids. In response, we see that hysterectomies are the most commonly performed major gynecologic surgery in the United States, with over 400,000 hysterectomies performed annually; yet there are also several minimally invasive surgical options for the treatment of uterine fibroids that feature less blood loss, shorter hospital stays, smaller incisions for minimal scarring, and less need for pain medication than with traditional open surgery. It is important to remember that the best surgical option for each woman, whether it is open or minimally invasive, is reserved for a case-by-case evaluation. In recognizing the health and educational needs of women in the United States, it is important that the greater public be educated in greater detail on the alternatives to more or less invasive surgical treatments so that women can have access to a full spectrum of treatment options. After all, it is my hope that women will become more educated and empowered in regards to their reproductive health and in the understanding of safe options available for the treatment of symptomatic fibroids. I thank Jakie Martinez for writing this statement. It is very important. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 58 (Tuesday, April 21, 2015)] [House] [Page H2320] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] EMPOWERING AND EDUCATING WOMEN AS TO THEIR REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH The SPEAKER pro tempore.

The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Oregon (Mr. Blumenauer) for 5 minutes. Mr. BLUMENAUER. Mr. President, please help us stop this madness. The same way President Reagan demanded Gorbachev to tear down the Berlin Wall, you have an opportunity to stop serial malpractice on the part of Congress refusing to meet its obligation to [[Page H2321]] fully fund our transportation responsibility. Twenty-three short-term extensions of the transportation program in recent years is as embarrassing as it is destructive. No country became great building its infrastructure 9 months at a time. You can bring this charade to a halt. With all the major agenda items on the table this spring for Congress, there is no way that we are going to be able to do anything but extend the May 31st transportation deadline, when the funding authorization expires. That is the most recent time when Congress kicked the can down the road, what it approved last fall all the way to this spring. I said at the time, When spring comes, we will be right back in the same situation. And we are. This does not mean that we need to write off the entire year and beyond. It certainly does not mean that we need to throw this issue into the middle of the next Presidential campaign, which unfortunately has already started. You should give us a reasonable deadline: July 1st, August 1st, or even September 1st. Under no circumstances should you let this bleed into the next Federal fiscal year, starting October 1st. We lost an opportunity at the end of the last Congress to force responsible action in the lame duck session after the 2014 election. We were close, but it eluded us. Please don't let that happen again. Make clear you will not sign any transportation extension beyond the end of the Federal fiscal year. Mr. President, you don't have to dictate a solution. You have already indicated what you want in a robust 6-year bill; you have given an outline of how you would have Congress fund this significant reauthorization. Your Secretary of Transportation, Anthony Foxx, has been traveling the country, advancing a vision for transportation for decades to come; and he is clear about the need for bold action to properly fund it. You and your administration have also made it clear that you are willing to sign any reasonable bipartisan legislation that meets the standards that we need. It needs to be sustainable; it needs to be dedicated; it needs to be big enough to get the job done. Let Congress put up or shut up. Force it to act by not extending the deadline past October 1st. Recently, the historic solution driven by Speaker Boehner and Leader Pelosi took a problem that long seemed intractable here on Capitol Hill since 1998 on Medicare payments and the funding under the so-called ``doc fix,'' but yet enacted a permanent solution on a bipartisan basis, overwhelmingly approved in this House and in the Senate. It required leadership and for some people to relax somewhat their partisan talking points--if not their core principles--but we all got the job done under your leadership. Let's do the same on transportation funding. Let's lay down an absolute deadline. Let's refuse to let it slide past October 1, 2015. Let's all work together, demanding Congress do its job. Several hundred Members of Congress signed a letter recently circulated by Congressman Ribble and Congressman Lipinski, my colleague from Illinois, saying that that is what should happen. Well, let's actually do it. Together, Congress can be forced to act. We can rebuild and renew America, putting hundreds of thousands of people to work at family wage jobs, making our communities more livable, our families safer, healthier, and more economically secure. It is not going to get easier if we stall. It is not going to be a smaller problem if it is going to be done next year or the year beyond. Let's decide this summer we are going to get the job done. Mr. President, you can help us by demanding that it be done according to a strict timeline, no later than October 1st. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Members are reminded to address their remarks to the Chair. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 58 (Tuesday, April 21, 2015)] [House] [Pages H2320-H2321] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] TRANSPORTATION FUNDING The SPEAKER pro tempore.

We lost an opportunity at the end of the last Congress to force responsible action in the lame duck session after the 2014 election. We were close, but it eluded us. Please don't let that happen again. Make clear you will not sign any transportation extension beyond the end of the Federal fiscal year. Mr. President, you don't have to dictate a solution. You have already indicated what you want in a robust 6-year bill; you have given an outline of how you would have Congress fund this significant reauthorization. Your Secretary of Transportation, Anthony Foxx, has been traveling the country, advancing a vision for transportation for decades to come; and he is clear about the need for bold action to properly fund it. You and your administration have also made it clear that you are willing to sign any reasonable bipartisan legislation that meets the standards that we need. It needs to be sustainable; it needs to be dedicated; it needs to be big enough to get the job done. Let Congress put up or shut up. Force it to act by not extending the deadline past October 1st. Recently, the historic solution driven by Speaker Boehner and Leader Pelosi took a problem that long seemed intractable here on Capitol Hill since 1998 on Medicare payments and the funding under the so-called ``doc fix,'' but yet enacted a permanent solution on a bipartisan basis, overwhelmingly approved in this House and in the Senate. It required leadership and for some people to relax somewhat their partisan talking points--if not their core principles--but we all got the job done under your leadership. Let's do the same on transportation funding. Let's lay down an absolute deadline. Let's refuse to let it slide past October 1, 2015. Let's all work together, demanding Congress do its job. Several hundred Members of Congress signed a letter recently circulated by Congressman Ribble and Congressman Lipinski, my colleague from Illinois, saying that that is what should happen. Well, let's actually do it. Together, Congress can be forced to act. We can rebuild and renew America, putting hundreds of thousands of people to work at family wage jobs, making our communities more livable, our families safer, healthier, and more economically secure. It is not going to get easier if we stall. It is not going to be a smaller problem if it is going to be done next year or the year beyond. Let's decide this summer we are going to get the job done.

The same way President Reagan demanded Gorbachev to tear down the Berlin Wall, you have an opportunity to stop serial malpractice on the part of Congress refusing to meet its obligation to [[Page H2321]] fully fund our transportation responsibility. Twenty-three short-term extensions of the transportation program in recent years is as embarrassing as it is destructive. No country became great building its infrastructure 9 months at a time. You can bring this charade to a halt. With all the major agenda items on the table this spring for Congress, there is no way that we are going to be able to do anything but extend the May 31st transportation deadline, when the funding authorization expires. That is the most recent time when Congress kicked the can down the road, what it approved last fall all the way to this spring. I said at the time, When spring comes, we will be right back in the same situation. And we are. This does not mean that we need to write off the entire year and beyond. It certainly does not mean that we need to throw this issue into the middle of the next Presidential campaign, which unfortunately has already started.

The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from North Carolina (Ms. Foxx) for 5 minutes. Ms. FOXX. Mr. Speaker, over the last 4 years, House Republicans have worked hard to put this Nation on a better path forward. We have passed numerous pieces of legislation to encourage job growth and strengthen America's standing in the global economy. We have also passed bills that would decrease energy costs and increase transparency in how tax dollars are spent. Despite the short time we have had, the obstacles we have faced, and the enormity of our task, House Republicans have managed a number of conservative victories. For example, legislation I authored was signed into law last summer to streamline the Federal workforce development system, including the elimination of 15 duplicative programs. We have worked tirelessly to minimize the damage caused by ObamaCare. The first pieces of legislation to pass in the 114th Congress included the Hire More Heroes Act, which would make it easier to hire veterans by exempting those who already have health insurance from being subject to the employer mandate in the President's health care law, and the Save American Workers Act to change ObamaCare's 30-hour definition of full-time employment and restore the traditional 40-hour workweek, which has long been the standard for full-time work. Additionally, the House Republican working group has laid out an alternative vision to ObamaCare. It includes allowing affected States to opt out of ObamaCare's costly rules and regulations and to opt into a patient-centered system focused on choice and lower cost. House Republicans have been vigilant against any attempt that would impugn the Second Amendment rights of all Americans to own and bear firearms. Our Republican committee chairmen are using their gavels to exercise the constitutionally prescribed system of checks and balances to hold oversight hearings exposing the Obama administration for its unconstitutional overreach. Much of the economic turmoil that has gripped this Nation is the result of the Federal Government spending beyond its means. In North Carolina I often hear from constituents who are worried that our ballooning national debt threatens economic stability and jeopardizes the American Dream for their families. House Republicans have responded to those concerns by passing laws cutting Federal spending 2 years in a row for the first time since the Korean war. We banned earmarks and achieved the most significant spending reductions in modern history. We have protected tax cuts for individuals and families. Unfortunately, President Obama's budget ignores our crushing debt burden. Despite proposing $2.1 trillion in new tax increases, the President's budget never balances because it spends too much. In contrast to the President's budget proposal that ignores our crushing debt burden, House Republicans recently approved a budget that balances in less than 10 years without raising taxes while cutting $5.5 trillion in unnecessary spending. This budget not only places our country on a path to pay off the overwhelming mound of debt we face but will also spur economic growth and increase opportunity. Balanced Budget for a Stronger America also provides a framework for completely repealing ObamaCare and calls on Congress to pass comprehensive tax reform that lowers rates for individuals, families, and employers. Following approval of the budget, the House continued its record of tackling tough issues by passing bipartisan legislation to help stabilize Medicare and secure seniors' access to their doctors. By transitioning to a new provider payment system focused on quality, value, and accountability, we have laid the groundwork for future Medicare reforms. It has been said that no one hears the plane that landed safely. What that very apt adage suggests is that we are often unaware of the good work being done every day, and it isn't until something goes wrong that people take notice. House Republicans are working hard to continue our good work and advance solutions that will build a healthy economy, empowering all Americans to seek new opportunities and achieve a better life.

Ms. SCHAKOWSKY. In recognition of the Oncology Nursing Society's 40th anniversary, I want to congratulate ONS for their legacy of excellence in oncology nursing and quality cancer care. ONS is a professional organization of over 37,000 registered nurses and other healthcare providers dedicated to providing care to patients in one of the most difficult stages of their lives. Since 1975, the Oncology Nursing Society has worked tirelessly to lead the transformation of cancer care. ONS is the primary source of education for all nurses providing care to people with cancer, regardless of the setting. In my State of Illinois alone, there are 10 chapters of ONS, with more than 1,600 members. In addition, the ONS Chicago chapter is the oldest chapter in the country. Oncology nurses are there for patients through one of the most challenging times in their lives. They help patients and their loved ones by caring, teaching, listening, and simply being present. As Congress continues to work to increase access to quality care, I praise the commitment of ONS in fostering excellence in oncology nursing and the care of cancer patients. I would like to congratulate all the members of ONS on the occasion of its 40th anniversary and wish them many more years of dedicated service to the country. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 58 (Tuesday, April 21, 2015)] [House] [Page H2323] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] IN RECOGNITION OF ONCOLOGY NURSING SOCIETY'S 40TH ANNIVERSARY (Ms. SCHAKOWSKY asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.)

Pursuant to the rule, the gentlewoman from [[Page H2330]] Tennessee (Mrs. Blackburn) and the gentleman from Vermont (Mr. Welch) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Tennessee. General Leave Mrs. BLACKBURN. Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and insert extraneous materials into the Record. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentlewoman from Tennessee? There was no objection. Mrs. BLACKBURN. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I rise in strong support of H.R. 471, the Ensuring Patient Access and Effective Drug Enforcement Act of 2015. This critical legislation combats inappropriate use of prescription drugs by bringing greater clarity and transparency to the requirements for safe and secure distribution of these medicines. It accomplishes these goals by clarifying some key terminology in the Controlled Substances Act. This comprehensive approach to the legislation will result in better protections against diversion and abuse of controlled substances. What it does is it provides the DEA with the clarity to collaborate with the very people responsible for ensuring that these medications get to the patients who need them without hurting and harming that distribution chain and while clamping down on diversions and abuse. These collaborations will lead to improved policies to prevent diversion while allowing legitimate patients to have access to the medications they need. Now, like so many components and pieces and bills and parts of legislation, the best example of why this is needed is a story that comes from home. In the case of this bill, we had a constituent who called our office after one of the recent ice storms that we saw in middle Tennessee this winter. It seemed as if these storms would never stop. The ice would come, and then it would not melt. We had a constituent who has a son who has a severe seizure disorder, and he takes three different medicines to control these seizures. Although his medicines are not opioids, two of them are controlled substances. So this mother, taking care of her son, decided she better get herself to the drugstore before the storm hit, and she did just that, to refill his prescriptions. She was anticipating that the prescriptions would run out before the ice melted and she would be able to get to the store. At the drugstore, she was told that she could not refill them because it was too early. She explained the situation. The pharmacist sympathized, but the pharmacist went on to say if the prescription were to be filled early, there would be problems with the DEA and other agencies. {time} 1600 The pharmacist was worried that his license might be lost. Our legislation is simply to ensure that patients who have a legitimate need for medications can receive them while we are battling diversion and abuse, which truly is a problem in this country. So, Madam Speaker, I encourage all of my colleagues to support this effort. I reserve the balance of my time. House of Representatives, Committee on the Judiciary, Washington, DC, April 20, 2015. Hon. Fred Upton, Chairman, Committee on Energy and Commerce, Washington, DC. Dear Chairman Upton: I am writing with respect to H.R. 471, the ``Ensuring Patient Access and Effective Drug Enforcement Act of 2015.'' As a result of your having consulted with us on provisions in H.R. 471 that fall within the Rule X jurisdiction of the Committee on the Judiciary, I agree to discharge our Committee from further consideration of this bill so that it may proceed expeditiously to the House floor for consideration. The Judiciary Committee takes this action with our mutual understanding that by foregoing consideration of H.R. 471 at this time, we do not waive any jurisdiction over subject matter contained in this or similar legislation, and that our Committee will be appropriately consulted and involved as this bill or similar legislation moves forward so that we may address any remaining issues in our jurisdiction. Our Committee also reserves the right to seek appointment of an appropriate number of conferees to any House-Senate conference involving this or similar legislation, and asks that you support any such request. I would appreciate a response to this letter confirming this understanding with respect to H.R. 471, and would ask that a copy of our exchange of letters on this matter be included in the Congressional Record during Floor consideration of H.R. 471. Sincerely, Bob Goodlatte, Chairman. ____ House of Representatives, Committee on Energy and Commerce, Washington, DC, April 20, 2015. Hon. Bob Goodlatte, Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary, Washington, DC. Dear Chairman Goodlatte: Thank you for your letter regarding H.R. 471, the ``Ensuring Patient Access and Effective Drug Enforcement Act of 2015''. As you noted, there are provisions of the bill that fall within the Committee on the Judiciary's Rule X jurisdiction. I appreciate your willingness to forgo consideration of H.R. 471, and I agree that your decision is not a waiver of any of the Committee on the Judiciary's jurisdiction over the subject matter contained in this or similar legislation, and that the Committee will be appropriately consulted and involved as this bill or similar legislation moves forward. In addition, I understand the Committee reserves the right to seek the appointment of an appropriate number of conferees to any House-Senate conference involving this or similar legislation, for which you will have my support. I will include a copy of your letter and this response in the Congressional Record during consideration of H.R. 471 on the House floor. Sincerely, Fred Upton, Chairman. Mr. WELCH. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I am pleased that the House is taking up again bipartisan action today to address the serious issue that impacts families in each of our districts: prescription drug abuse. Vermont, like Tennessee and many States around the country, is grappling with a serious opiate epidemic. In addition to alarming increases in heroin abuse, admissions for treatment of prescription drug abuse increased 361 percent between 2005 and 2013. As we have experienced in Vermont, we are most effective in dealing with this public health crisis when stakeholders--providers, public health officials, law enforcement, distributors, and pharmacists--come together to tackle the problem head-on. Today, the distributors of prescription drugs, along with local pharmacies, are experiencing unpredictable enforcement from the DEA. This has led to disruptions in the supply chain which limit patient access to prescription drugs for legitimate uses, as was evidenced by my colleague's story. The Ensuring Patient Access and Effective Drug Enforcement Act will encourage collaboration between law enforcement, members of the supply chain, and public health providers and officials while ensuring patients have access to the treatment their doctor has prescribed. It has been a pleasure to work with Representative Marino, Representative Blackburn, and Representative Chu, who has been a major leader on this, and I thank them for their efforts and their leadership. I also thank Chairman Upton and Ranking Member Pallone for making this issue a priority of the Energy and Commerce Committee. I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 471, and I reserve the balance of my time. Mrs. BLACKBURN. Mr. Speaker, I think it is so important for us to note that the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Marino) has been the primary author of this legislation and has brought to the table to work on this bill his experience of 7 years as a U.S. attorney--10 years prior to that as a district attorney--and has seen firsthand and dealt with drug diversion, drug enforcement issues, and the needs of the patient. At this time, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Marino). Mr. MARINO. Mr. Speaker, in early 2013, a pharmacist told me about a problem he was having accessing necessary prescriptions for his customers, many of whom were older cancer patients suffering with chronic pain. What started out as a simple conversation with a constituent soon [[Page H2331]] turned into serious concerns about problems in the prescription drug supply chain--problems that we aim to address here today by passing H.R. 471, the Ensuring Patient Access and Effective Drug Enforcement Act. Any legitimate business involved in distributing or dispensing prescriptions welcomes appropriate oversight and regulation. Further, we know these businesses value a collaborative working relationship with agencies like the Drug Enforcement Administration. Manufacturers, distributors, and pharmacies alike are on the front lines every day in the fight to end the prescription drug abuse epidemic. They are making efforts to educate prescribers and patients about the safe use and disposal of prescriptions and working to implement prescription drug monitoring programs that will reduce the illegal diversion of powerful opioid pain relievers. Despite a strong commitment to being part of the solution, distributors and pharmacists are finding that the unnecessary adversarial regulatory environment created by the DEA is putting effective enforcement outcomes in jeopardy. As a former district attorney and United States attorney, I have fond memories of working with DEA agents to put away drug dealers. To say that I have the highest regard for the DEA and the work they do does not begin to convey my respect for the agency and its employees. That is why I am so passionate about this subject and why I think it is necessary to pass H.R. 471 today. This bill will bring much-needed clarity to critical provisions of the Controlled Substances Act. In doing so, we will ensure that the DEA's authorities are not abused and threatened by future legal challenges; foster greater collaboration, communication, and transparency between the DEA and the supply chain; create more opportunities to identify bad actors at the end of the supply chain; and, most importantly, be certain that prescriptions are accessible to patients in need. We are all in this together. We cannot enforce our way out of this epidemic. Education, treatment, and enforcement are all critical to addressing the problem, but so is collaboration. The clarity that H.R. 471 brings will ensure that the current regulatory culture evolves into one that rewards cooperation and brings more successful diversion control efforts in the future. I want to thank my friend, Congresswoman Blackburn, for working closely with my team and me to develop the bill. I want to thank our champions on the other side of the aisle, Dr. Judy Chu and Representative Peter Welch, for their leadership and efforts to bring us here today. We could not have achieved this without the efforts of Chairman Pitts and Chairman Upton and their staff on the Energy and Commerce Committee. I must thank House Judiciary Committee Chairman Goodlatte for his forthright suggestions that made this a more effective, efficient measure worthy of consideration by this House. Again, I want to stress the fact that this is bipartisan. The Democrats and the Republicans saw the importance in this and got together, and we worked it out, and I thank everyone involved. Mr. WELCH. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as she may consume to the gentlewoman from California (Ms. Judy Chu), one of the lead sponsors of this legislation. Ms. JUDY CHU of California. Mr. Speaker, prescription drugs improve the quality of life for millions of Americans. They treat illnesses, alleviate pain, and help cure disease. But the ease of abuse has turned a solution into a problem. Each year, nearly 15,000 overdose deaths are attributed to prescription pain relievers--more than heroin and cocaine combined. Our government and private entities in the prescription drug supply chain must do what they can to prevent drug abuse and diversion. At the same time, we must ensure that pharmacists, who are our Nation's most accessible healthcare providers, are able to dispense drugs to patients who are in legitimate need and have proper prescriptions without groundless disruptions. The bipartisan bill we vote on today that I am proud to have introduced with my colleagues would do just that. Our bill encourages collaboration between stakeholders and the Drug Enforcement Administration to ensure effective enforcement of abuse while also ensuring that patients will continue to have safe access to the drugs they need. This will lead to fewer disruptions for pharmacists and, in turn, ensure that patients will not be left behind. I urge an ``aye'' vote on this very important bill. Mrs. BLACKBURN. Mr. Speaker, at this time I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Jolly), one of our colleagues from the Appropriations Committee handling Commerce, Justice, Science appropriations. Mr. JOLLY. I thank the gentlewoman. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of this commonsense measure that will help us more effectively fight prescription drug abuse while also ensuring that Americans are able to get their needed pain medications. Florida has been at the epicenter of the debate concerning combating prescription drug abuse while ensuring legitimate patient access to critical pain medications. Florida was one of the first States to be affected by the proliferation of ``pill mills'' and took strong action to shut them down, under the stellar leadership of our State attorney general. We have seen similar challenges nationally, and DEA has taken action. Unfortunately, Federal agencies have not coordinated their efforts to ensure appropriate access to prescription controlled substances. In Florida and elsewhere, we are seeing legitimate patients who are getting caught up in the efforts to stop prescription drug abuse. My own father was one of those patients: an 80-year-old retired minister prescribed a legitimate medication for chronic pain and yet unable to fill that prescription at his local pharmacy. All of the best intentions in the world by all of the actors but, unfortunately, there were very unintended consequences for a patient who needed care. The issue is largely due to DEA policies and extremely poor coordination between DEA and FDA. The key to this legislation is collaboration and coordination. This bill requires HHS and DEA to collaboratively assess the obstacles patients like my own father face and more effectively coordinate those efforts to prevent diversion and abuse of prescription drugs, while including the input of private sector stakeholders who are vital to these efforts. I urge my colleagues to support this very important and commonsense legislation. Mr. WELCH. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I want to thank my colleagues, particularly Mr. Marino. We have the practical application of a commonsense approach here, where, on the one hand, you have got this enormous health need that the people whom we represent can have some of their suffering alleviated if they can get access to the appropriate prescription drugs. On the other hand, we do have an abuse. Folks get stuck on them, and we have got law enforcement out there trying to make sure they are enforcing the laws. The need for law enforcement and the need for proper access to prescription medication have to coexist. This practical presentation that was spearheaded by somebody who knows how law enforcement works and is committed to the principles of good law enforcement, I think, really gave this Congress a boost in coming up with a practical, bipartisan approach to finding the right balance. So I thank my colleague, Mrs. Blackburn, as well as Mr. Jolly, for what I thought was a very helpful statement, and I yield back the balance of my time. Mrs. BLACKBURN. Mr. Speaker, at this time I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Costello), a member of the Veterans' Affairs Committee who has worked through this issue with some veterans. Mr. COSTELLO of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 471. We have all seen reports in our local newspapers about the fight against prescription drug abuse by our local law enforcement officials and the damaging effect that prescription drug abuse has [[Page H2332]] on families and communities across this country. According to the CDC, since 1999, the amount of prescription painkillers prescribed and sold in the United States has quadrupled. There is, indeed, a trend in the abuse of prescription painkillers, which is, in part, attributed to the changes in how providers prescribe painkillers. The best way to crack down on prescription drug abuse is to have a broad coalition of specialists, including supply chain stakeholders and regulators, to encourage a constructive dialogue to help minimize the impact of this serious public health issue. This legislation does just that. Our Federal agencies will be required to consult with our local pharmacies and stakeholders on how best to prevent prescription drug abuse, while not taking away the access for individuals who rely on these drugs for medicinal needs. I commend the efforts of Congressman Marino and Congresswoman Blackburn to create a more constructive environment between manufacturers, wholesalers, retail pharmacies, and enforcement agencies to crack down on this epidemic. I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support this legislation. {time} 1615 Mrs. BLACKBURN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, as our colleagues have heard today, this is a bipartisan effort, and Mr. Marino has really worked diligently with his team and with all of us on this legislation to make certain that we got it right the first time and we didn't have to come back and revisit it. I thank him, the gentleman from Vermont (Mr. Welch), and the gentlewoman from California (Ms. Judy Chu) for the efforts that they have put into this, and also Chairman Pitts and Chairman Upton for the diligence that they have shown to the issue to make certain that we moved the bill through the process. As I said earlier, this is about access to the supply chain and making certain that those with legitimate needs for these medicines have the ability to access them in a timely manner, also bringing our pharmacists and the DEA into a collaborative process, with clarity, so that they make certain that this supply chain remains open to those that need it and that the DEA has the ability to continue to fight diversion and drug abuse. Prescription drugs kill more people than heroin. This is something we need to realize is a problem. At the same time, those that need these medicines, we need to make certain that supply chain is clear. I thank my colleagues for their diligence and their work, and I encourage an ``aye'' vote. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 471, the Ensuring Patient Access and Effective Drug Enforcement Act of 2015. Millions of Americans rely on prescription drugs to treat and cure illnesses and improve the overall quality of their lives. Unfortunately, we also have a significant problem in this country with abuse of prescription drugs. H.R. 471 would help drug distributors, pharmacies, and others work with DEA to achieve the difficult balance between keeping controlled substance prescription drugs away from drug abusers, but not from patients who urgently need them. It would achieve this goal by making several changes to the Controlled Substances Act. It would provide definitions for the phrases ``factors as may be relevant to and consistent with the public health and safety'' and ``imminent danger to the public health or safety.'' It would require DEA to provide registrants an opportunity to submit an action plan to correct any violations for which DEA is considering revoking or suspending their controlled substance registration. And it would require FDA, in consultation with DEA, to submit a report one year after enactment to Congress on obstacles to legitimate patient access to controlled substances and collaborative efforts to benefit patients and prevent abuse of these substances. I want to thank Representatives Blackburn, Marino, Welch and Chu for introducing this bipartisan legislation and I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this legislation. The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Duncan of Tennessee). The question is on the motion offered by the gentlewoman from Tennessee (Mrs. Blackburn) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 471, as amended. The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 58 (Tuesday, April 21, 2015)] [House] [Pages H2329-H2332] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] ENSURING PATIENT ACCESS AND EFFECTIVE DRUG ENFORCEMENT ACT OF 2015 Mrs. BLACKBURN.

The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Tennessee. General Leave Mrs. BLACKBURN. Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and insert extraneous materials into the Record. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentlewoman from Tennessee? There was no objection. Mrs. BLACKBURN. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I rise in strong support of H.R. 471, the Ensuring Patient Access and Effective Drug Enforcement Act of 2015. This critical legislation combats inappropriate use of prescription drugs by bringing greater clarity and transparency to the requirements for safe and secure distribution of these medicines. It accomplishes these goals by clarifying some key terminology in the Controlled Substances Act. This comprehensive approach to the legislation will result in better protections against diversion and abuse of controlled substances. What it does is it provides the DEA with the clarity to collaborate with the very people responsible for ensuring that these medications get to the patients who need them without hurting and harming that distribution chain and while clamping down on diversions and abuse. These collaborations will lead to improved policies to prevent diversion while allowing legitimate patients to have access to the medications they need. Now, like so many components and pieces and bills and parts of legislation, the best example of why this is needed is a story that comes from home. In the case of this bill, we had a constituent who called our office after one of the recent ice storms that we saw in middle Tennessee this winter. It seemed as if these storms would never stop. The ice would come, and then it would not melt. We had a constituent who has a son who has a severe seizure disorder, and he takes three different medicines to control these seizures. Although his medicines are not opioids, two of them are controlled substances. So this mother, taking care of her son, decided she better get herself to the drugstore before the storm hit, and she did just that, to refill his prescriptions. She was anticipating that the prescriptions would run out before the ice melted and she would be able to get to the store. At the drugstore, she was told that she could not refill them because it was too early. She explained the situation. The pharmacist sympathized, but the pharmacist went on to say if the prescription were to be filled early, there would be problems with the DEA and other agencies. {time} 1600 The pharmacist was worried that his license might be lost. Our legislation is simply to ensure that patients who have a legitimate need for medications can receive them while we are battling diversion and abuse, which truly is a problem in this country. So, Madam Speaker, I encourage all of my colleagues to support this effort. I reserve the balance of my time. House of Representatives, Committee on the Judiciary, Washington, DC, April 20, 2015. Hon. Fred Upton, Chairman, Committee on Energy and Commerce, Washington, DC. Dear Chairman Upton: I am writing with respect to H.R. 471, the ``Ensuring Patient Access and Effective Drug Enforcement Act of 2015.'' As a result of your having consulted with us on provisions in H.R. 471 that fall within the Rule X jurisdiction of the Committee on the Judiciary, I agree to discharge our Committee from further consideration of this bill so that it may proceed expeditiously to the House floor for consideration. The Judiciary Committee takes this action with our mutual understanding that by foregoing consideration of H.R. 471 at this time, we do not waive any jurisdiction over subject matter contained in this or similar legislation, and that our Committee will be appropriately consulted and involved as this bill or similar legislation moves forward so that we may address any remaining issues in our jurisdiction. Our Committee also reserves the right to seek appointment of an appropriate number of conferees to any House-Senate conference involving this or similar legislation, and asks that you support any such request. I would appreciate a response to this letter confirming this understanding with respect to H.R. 471, and would ask that a copy of our exchange of letters on this matter be included in the Congressional Record during Floor consideration of H.R. 471. Sincerely, Bob Goodlatte, Chairman. ____ House of Representatives, Committee on Energy and Commerce, Washington, DC, April 20, 2015. Hon. Bob Goodlatte, Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary, Washington, DC. Dear Chairman Goodlatte: Thank you for your letter regarding H.R. 471, the ``Ensuring Patient Access and Effective Drug Enforcement Act of 2015''. As you noted, there are provisions of the bill that fall within the Committee on the Judiciary's Rule X jurisdiction. I appreciate your willingness to forgo consideration of H.R. 471, and I agree that your decision is not a waiver of any of the Committee on the Judiciary's jurisdiction over the subject matter contained in this or similar legislation, and that the Committee will be appropriately consulted and involved as this bill or similar legislation moves forward. In addition, I understand the Committee reserves the right to seek the appointment of an appropriate number of conferees to any House-Senate conference involving this or similar legislation, for which you will have my support. I will include a copy of your letter and this response in the Congressional Record during consideration of H.R. 471 on the House floor. Sincerely, Fred Upton, Chairman. Mr. WELCH. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I am pleased that the House is taking up again bipartisan action today to address the serious issue that impacts families in each of our districts: prescription drug abuse. Vermont, like Tennessee and many States around the country, is grappling with a serious opiate epidemic. In addition to alarming increases in heroin abuse, admissions for treatment of prescription drug abuse increased 361 percent between 2005 and 2013. As we have experienced in Vermont, we are most effective in dealing with this public health crisis when stakeholders--providers, public health officials, law enforcement, distributors, and pharmacists--come together to tackle the problem head-on. Today, the distributors of prescription drugs, along with local pharmacies, are experiencing unpredictable enforcement from the DEA. This has led to disruptions in the supply chain which limit patient access to prescription drugs for legitimate uses, as was evidenced by my colleague's story. The Ensuring Patient Access and Effective Drug Enforcement Act will encourage collaboration between law enforcement, members of the supply chain, and public health providers and officials while ensuring patients have access to the treatment their doctor has prescribed. It has been a pleasure to work with Representative Marino, Representative Blackburn, and Representative Chu, who has been a major leader on this, and I thank them for their efforts and their leadership. I also thank Chairman Upton and Ranking Member Pallone for making this issue a priority of the Energy and Commerce Committee. I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 471, and I reserve the balance of my time. Mrs. BLACKBURN. Mr. Speaker, I think it is so important for us to note that the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Marino) has been the primary author of this legislation and has brought to the table to work on this bill his experience of 7 years as a U.S. attorney--10 years prior to that as a district attorney--and has seen firsthand and dealt with drug diversion, drug enforcement issues, and the needs of the patient. At this time, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Marino). Mr. MARINO. Mr. Speaker, in early 2013, a pharmacist told me about a problem he was having accessing necessary prescriptions for his customers, many of whom were older cancer patients suffering with chronic pain. What started out as a simple conversation with a constituent soon [[Page H2331]] turned into serious concerns about problems in the prescription drug supply chain--problems that we aim to address here today by passing H.R. 471, the Ensuring Patient Access and Effective Drug Enforcement Act. Any legitimate business involved in distributing or dispensing prescriptions welcomes appropriate oversight and regulation. Further, we know these businesses value a collaborative working relationship with agencies like the Drug Enforcement Administration. Manufacturers, distributors, and pharmacies alike are on the front lines every day in the fight to end the prescription drug abuse epidemic. They are making efforts to educate prescribers and patients about the safe use and disposal of prescriptions and working to implement prescription drug monitoring programs that will reduce the illegal diversion of powerful opioid pain relievers. Despite a strong commitment to being part of the solution, distributors and pharmacists are finding that the unnecessary adversarial regulatory environment created by the DEA is putting effective enforcement outcomes in jeopardy. As a former district attorney and United States attorney, I have fond memories of working with DEA agents to put away drug dealers. To say that I have the highest regard for the DEA and the work they do does not begin to convey my respect for the agency and its employees. That is why I am so passionate about this subject and why I think it is necessary to pass H.R. 471 today. This bill will bring much-needed clarity to critical provisions of the Controlled Substances Act. In doing so, we will ensure that the DEA's authorities are not abused and threatened by future legal challenges; foster greater collaboration, communication, and transparency between the DEA and the supply chain; create more opportunities to identify bad actors at the end of the supply chain; and, most importantly, be certain that prescriptions are accessible to patients in need. We are all in this together. We cannot enforce our way out of this epidemic. Education, treatment, and enforcement are all critical to addressing the problem, but so is collaboration. The clarity that H.R. 471 brings will ensure that the current regulatory culture evolves into one that rewards cooperation and brings more successful diversion control efforts in the future. I want to thank my friend, Congresswoman Blackburn, for working closely with my team and me to develop the bill. I want to thank our champions on the other side of the aisle, Dr. Judy Chu and Representative Peter Welch, for their leadership and efforts to bring us here today. We could not have achieved this without the efforts of Chairman Pitts and Chairman Upton and their staff on the Energy and Commerce Committee. I must thank House Judiciary Committee Chairman Goodlatte for his forthright suggestions that made this a more effective, efficient measure worthy of consideration by this House. Again, I want to stress the fact that this is bipartisan. The Democrats and the Republicans saw the importance in this and got together, and we worked it out, and I thank everyone involved. Mr. WELCH. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as she may consume to the gentlewoman from California (Ms. Judy Chu), one of the lead sponsors of this legislation. Ms. JUDY CHU of California. Mr. Speaker, prescription drugs improve the quality of life for millions of Americans. They treat illnesses, alleviate pain, and help cure disease. But the ease of abuse has turned a solution into a problem. Each year, nearly 15,000 overdose deaths are attributed to prescription pain relievers--more than heroin and cocaine combined. Our government and private entities in the prescription drug supply chain must do what they can to prevent drug abuse and diversion. At the same time, we must ensure that pharmacists, who are our Nation's most accessible healthcare providers, are able to dispense drugs to patients who are in legitimate need and have proper prescriptions without groundless disruptions. The bipartisan bill we vote on today that I am proud to have introduced with my colleagues would do just that. Our bill encourages collaboration between stakeholders and the Drug Enforcement Administration to ensure effective enforcement of abuse while also ensuring that patients will continue to have safe access to the drugs they need. This will lead to fewer disruptions for pharmacists and, in turn, ensure that patients will not be left behind. I urge an ``aye'' vote on this very important bill. Mrs. BLACKBURN. Mr. Speaker, at this time I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Jolly), one of our colleagues from the Appropriations Committee handling Commerce, Justice, Science appropriations. Mr. JOLLY. I thank the gentlewoman. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of this commonsense measure that will help us more effectively fight prescription drug abuse while also ensuring that Americans are able to get their needed pain medications. Florida has been at the epicenter of the debate concerning combating prescription drug abuse while ensuring legitimate patient access to critical pain medications. Florida was one of the first States to be affected by the proliferation of ``pill mills'' and took strong action to shut them down, under the stellar leadership of our State attorney general. We have seen similar challenges nationally, and DEA has taken action. Unfortunately, Federal agencies have not coordinated their efforts to ensure appropriate access to prescription controlled substances. In Florida and elsewhere, we are seeing legitimate patients who are getting caught up in the efforts to stop prescription drug abuse. My own father was one of those patients: an 80-year-old retired minister prescribed a legitimate medication for chronic pain and yet unable to fill that prescription at his local pharmacy. All of the best intentions in the world by all of the actors but, unfortunately, there were very unintended consequences for a patient who needed care. The issue is largely due to DEA policies and extremely poor coordination between DEA and FDA. The key to this legislation is collaboration and coordination. This bill requires HHS and DEA to collaboratively assess the obstacles patients like my own father face and more effectively coordinate those efforts to prevent diversion and abuse of prescription drugs, while including the input of private sector stakeholders who are vital to these efforts. I urge my colleagues to support this very important and commonsense legislation. Mr. WELCH. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I want to thank my colleagues, particularly Mr. Marino. We have the practical application of a commonsense approach here, where, on the one hand, you have got this enormous health need that the people whom we represent can have some of their suffering alleviated if they can get access to the appropriate prescription drugs. On the other hand, we do have an abuse. Folks get stuck on them, and we have got law enforcement out there trying to make sure they are enforcing the laws. The need for law enforcement and the need for proper access to prescription medication have to coexist. This practical presentation that was spearheaded by somebody who knows how law enforcement works and is committed to the principles of good law enforcement, I think, really gave this Congress a boost in coming up with a practical, bipartisan approach to finding the right balance. So I thank my colleague, Mrs. Blackburn, as well as Mr. Jolly, for what I thought was a very helpful statement, and I yield back the balance of my time. Mrs. BLACKBURN. Mr. Speaker, at this time I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Costello), a member of the Veterans' Affairs Committee who has worked through this issue with some veterans. Mr. COSTELLO of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 471. We have all seen reports in our local newspapers about the fight against prescription drug abuse by our local law enforcement officials and the damaging effect that prescription drug abuse has [[Page H2332]] on families and communities across this country. According to the CDC, since 1999, the amount of prescription painkillers prescribed and sold in the United States has quadrupled. There is, indeed, a trend in the abuse of prescription painkillers, which is, in part, attributed to the changes in how providers prescribe painkillers. The best way to crack down on prescription drug abuse is to have a broad coalition of specialists, including supply chain stakeholders and regulators, to encourage a constructive dialogue to help minimize the impact of this serious public health issue. This legislation does just that. Our Federal agencies will be required to consult with our local pharmacies and stakeholders on how best to prevent prescription drug abuse, while not taking away the access for individuals who rely on these drugs for medicinal needs. I commend the efforts of Congressman Marino and Congresswoman Blackburn to create a more constructive environment between manufacturers, wholesalers, retail pharmacies, and enforcement agencies to crack down on this epidemic. I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support this legislation. {time} 1615 Mrs. BLACKBURN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, as our colleagues have heard today, this is a bipartisan effort, and Mr. Marino has really worked diligently with his team and with all of us on this legislation to make certain that we got it right the first time and we didn't have to come back and revisit it. I thank him, the gentleman from Vermont (Mr. Welch), and the gentlewoman from California (Ms. Judy Chu) for the efforts that they have put into this, and also Chairman Pitts and Chairman Upton for the diligence that they have shown to the issue to make certain that we moved the bill through the process. As I said earlier, this is about access to the supply chain and making certain that those with legitimate needs for these medicines have the ability to access them in a timely manner, also bringing our pharmacists and the DEA into a collaborative process, with clarity, so that they make certain that this supply chain remains open to those that need it and that the DEA has the ability to continue to fight diversion and drug abuse. Prescription drugs kill more people than heroin. This is something we need to realize is a problem. At the same time, those that need these medicines, we need to make certain that supply chain is clear. I thank my colleagues for their diligence and their work, and I encourage an ``aye'' vote. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 471, the Ensuring Patient Access and Effective Drug Enforcement Act of 2015. Millions of Americans rely on prescription drugs to treat and cure illnesses and improve the overall quality of their lives. Unfortunately, we also have a significant problem in this country with abuse of prescription drugs. H.R. 471 would help drug distributors, pharmacies, and others work with DEA to achieve the difficult balance between keeping controlled substance prescription drugs away from drug abusers, but not from patients who urgently need them. It would achieve this goal by making several changes to the Controlled Substances Act. It would provide definitions for the phrases ``factors as may be relevant to and consistent with the public health and safety'' and ``imminent danger to the public health or safety.'' It would require DEA to provide registrants an opportunity to submit an action plan to correct any violations for which DEA is considering revoking or suspending their controlled substance registration. And it would require FDA, in consultation with DEA, to submit a report one year after enactment to Congress on obstacles to legitimate patient access to controlled substances and collaborative efforts to benefit patients and prevent abuse of these substances. I want to thank Representatives Blackburn, Marino, Welch and Chu for introducing this bipartisan legislation and I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this legislation. The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Duncan of Tennessee). The question is on the motion offered by the gentlewoman from Tennessee (Mrs. Blackburn) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 471, as amended. The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. ____________________","Congressional Record, Volume 161 Issue 58 (Tuesday, April 21, 2015) [Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 58 (Tuesday, April 21, 2015)] [House] [Pages H2329-H2332] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] ENSURING PATIENT ACCESS AND EFFECTIVE DRUG ENFORCEMENT ACT OF 2015 Mrs. BLACKBURN.

The Ensuring Patient Access and Effective Drug Enforcement Act will encourage collaboration between law enforcement, members of the supply chain, and public health providers and officials while ensuring patients have access to the treatment their doctor has prescribed. It has been a pleasure to work with Representative Marino, Representative Blackburn, and Representative Chu, who has been a major leader on this, and I thank them for their efforts and their leadership. I also thank Chairman Upton and Ranking Member Pallone for making this issue a priority of the Energy and Commerce Committee. I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 471, and I reserve the balance of my time. Mrs. BLACKBURN. Mr. Speaker, I think it is so important for us to note that the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Marino) has been the primary author of this legislation and has brought to the table to work on this bill his experience of 7 years as a U.S. attorney--10 years prior to that as a district attorney--and has seen firsthand and dealt with drug diversion, drug enforcement issues, and the needs of the patient. At this time, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Marino). Mr. MARINO. Mr. Speaker, in early 2013, a pharmacist told me about a problem he was having accessing necessary prescriptions for his customers, many of whom were older cancer patients suffering with chronic pain. What started out as a simple conversation with a constituent soon [[Page H2331]] turned into serious concerns about problems in the prescription drug supply chain--problems that we aim to address here today by passing H.R. 471, the Ensuring Patient Access and Effective Drug Enforcement Act. Any legitimate business involved in distributing or dispensing prescriptions welcomes appropriate oversight and regulation. Further, we know these businesses value a collaborative working relationship with agencies like the Drug Enforcement Administration. Manufacturers, distributors, and pharmacies alike are on the front lines every day in the fight to end the prescription drug abuse epidemic. They are making efforts to educate prescribers and patients about the safe use and disposal of prescriptions and working to implement prescription drug monitoring programs that will reduce the illegal diversion of powerful opioid pain relievers. Despite a strong commitment to being part of the solution, distributors and pharmacists are finding that the unnecessary adversarial regulatory environment created by the DEA is putting effective enforcement outcomes in jeopardy. As a former district attorney and United States attorney, I have fond memories of working with DEA agents to put away drug dealers. To say that I have the highest regard for the DEA and the work they do does not begin to convey my respect for the agency and its employees. That is why I am so passionate about this subject and why I think it is necessary to pass H.R. 471 today. This bill will bring much-needed clarity to critical provisions of the Controlled Substances Act. In doing so, we will ensure that the DEA's authorities are not abused and threatened by future legal challenges; foster greater collaboration, communication, and transparency between the DEA and the supply chain; create more opportunities to identify bad actors at the end of the supply chain; and, most importantly, be certain that prescriptions are accessible to patients in need. We are all in this together. We cannot enforce our way out of this epidemic. Education, treatment, and enforcement are all critical to addressing the problem, but so is collaboration. The clarity that H.R. 471 brings will ensure that the current regulatory culture evolves into one that rewards cooperation and brings more successful diversion control efforts in the future. I want to thank my friend, Congresswoman Blackburn, for working closely with my team and me to develop the bill. I want to thank our champions on the other side of the aisle, Dr. Judy Chu and Representative Peter Welch, for their leadership and efforts to bring us here today. We could not have achieved this without the efforts of Chairman Pitts and Chairman Upton and their staff on the Energy and Commerce Committee. I must thank House Judiciary Committee Chairman Goodlatte for his forthright suggestions that made this a more effective, efficient measure worthy of consideration by this House. Again, I want to stress the fact that this is bipartisan. The Democrats and the Republicans saw the importance in this and got together, and we worked it out, and I thank everyone involved. Mr. WELCH. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as she may consume to the gentlewoman from California (Ms. Judy Chu), one of the lead sponsors of this legislation. Ms. JUDY CHU of California. Mr. Speaker, prescription drugs improve the quality of life for millions of Americans. They treat illnesses, alleviate pain, and help cure disease. But the ease of abuse has turned a solution into a problem. Each year, nearly 15,000 overdose deaths are attributed to prescription pain relievers--more than heroin and cocaine combined. Our government and private entities in the prescription drug supply chain must do what they can to prevent drug abuse and diversion. At the same time, we must ensure that pharmacists, who are our Nation's most accessible healthcare providers, are able to dispense drugs to patients who are in legitimate need and have proper prescriptions without groundless disruptions. The bipartisan bill we vote on today that I am proud to have introduced with my colleagues would do just that. Our bill encourages collaboration between stakeholders and the Drug Enforcement Administration to ensure effective enforcement of abuse while also ensuring that patients will continue to have safe access to the drugs they need. This will lead to fewer disruptions for pharmacists and, in turn, ensure that patients will not be left behind. I urge an ``aye'' vote on this very important bill. Mrs. BLACKBURN. Mr. Speaker, at this time I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Jolly), one of our colleagues from the Appropriations Committee handling Commerce, Justice, Science appropriations. Mr. JOLLY. I thank the gentlewoman. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of this commonsense measure that will help us more effectively fight prescription drug abuse while also ensuring that Americans are able to get their needed pain medications. Florida has been at the epicenter of the debate concerning combating prescription drug abuse while ensuring legitimate patient access to critical pain medications. Florida was one of the first States to be affected by the proliferation of ``pill mills'' and took strong action to shut them down, under the stellar leadership of our State attorney general. We have seen similar challenges nationally, and DEA has taken action. Unfortunately, Federal agencies have not coordinated their efforts to ensure appropriate access to prescription controlled substances. In Florida and elsewhere, we are seeing legitimate patients who are getting caught up in the efforts to stop prescription drug abuse. My own father was one of those patients: an 80-year-old retired minister prescribed a legitimate medication for chronic pain and yet unable to fill that prescription at his local pharmacy. All of the best intentions in the world by all of the actors but, unfortunately, there were very unintended consequences for a patient who needed care. The issue is largely due to DEA policies and extremely poor coordination between DEA and FDA. The key to this legislation is collaboration and coordination. This bill requires HHS and DEA to collaboratively assess the obstacles patients like my own father face and more effectively coordinate those efforts to prevent diversion and abuse of prescription drugs, while including the input of private sector stakeholders who are vital to these efforts. I urge my colleagues to support this very important and commonsense legislation. Mr. WELCH. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I want to thank my colleagues, particularly Mr. Marino. We have the practical application of a commonsense approach here, where, on the one hand, you have got this enormous health need that the people whom we represent can have some of their suffering alleviated if they can get access to the appropriate prescription drugs. On the other hand, we do have an abuse. Folks get stuck on them, and we have got law enforcement out there trying to make sure they are enforcing the laws. The need for law enforcement and the need for proper access to prescription medication have to coexist. This practical presentation that was spearheaded by somebody who knows how law enforcement works and is committed to the principles of good law enforcement, I think, really gave this Congress a boost in coming up with a practical, bipartisan approach to finding the right balance. So I thank my colleague, Mrs. Blackburn, as well as Mr. Jolly, for what I thought was a very helpful statement, and I yield back the balance of my time. Mrs. BLACKBURN. Mr. Speaker, at this time I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Costello), a member of the Veterans' Affairs Committee who has worked through this issue with some veterans. Mr. COSTELLO of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 471. We have all seen reports in our local newspapers about the fight against prescription drug abuse by our local law enforcement officials and the damaging effect that prescription drug abuse has [[Page H2332]] on families and communities across this country. According to the CDC, since 1999, the amount of prescription painkillers prescribed and sold in the United States has quadrupled. There is, indeed, a trend in the abuse of prescription painkillers, which is, in part, attributed to the changes in how providers prescribe painkillers. The best way to crack down on prescription drug abuse is to have a broad coalition of specialists, including supply chain stakeholders and regulators, to encourage a constructive dialogue to help minimize the impact of this serious public health issue. This legislation does just that. Our Federal agencies will be required to consult with our local pharmacies and stakeholders on how best to prevent prescription drug abuse, while not taking away the access for individuals who rely on these drugs for medicinal needs. I commend the efforts of Congressman Marino and Congresswoman Blackburn to create a more constructive environment between manufacturers, wholesalers, retail pharmacies, and enforcement agencies to crack down on this epidemic. I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support this legislation. {time} 1615 Mrs. BLACKBURN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, as our colleagues have heard today, this is a bipartisan effort, and Mr. Marino has really worked diligently with his team and with all of us on this legislation to make certain that we got it right the first time and we didn't have to come back and revisit it. I thank him, the gentleman from Vermont (Mr. Welch), and the gentlewoman from California (Ms. Judy Chu) for the efforts that they have put into this, and also Chairman Pitts and Chairman Upton for the diligence that they have shown to the issue to make certain that we moved the bill through the process. As I said earlier, this is about access to the supply chain and making certain that those with legitimate needs for these medicines have the ability to access them in a timely manner, also bringing our pharmacists and the DEA into a collaborative process, with clarity, so that they make certain that this supply chain remains open to those that need it and that the DEA has the ability to continue to fight diversion and drug abuse. Prescription drugs kill more people than heroin. This is something we need to realize is a problem. At the same time, those that need these medicines, we need to make certain that supply chain is clear. I thank my colleagues for their diligence and their work, and I encourage an ``aye'' vote. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 471, the Ensuring Patient Access and Effective Drug Enforcement Act of 2015. Millions of Americans rely on prescription drugs to treat and cure illnesses and improve the overall quality of their lives. Unfortunately, we also have a significant problem in this country with abuse of prescription drugs. H.R. 471 would help drug distributors, pharmacies, and others work with DEA to achieve the difficult balance between keeping controlled substance prescription drugs away from drug abusers, but not from patients who urgently need them. It would achieve this goal by making several changes to the Controlled Substances Act. It would provide definitions for the phrases ``factors as may be relevant to and consistent with the public health and safety'' and ``imminent danger to the public health or safety.'' It would require DEA to provide registrants an opportunity to submit an action plan to correct any violations for which DEA is considering revoking or suspending their controlled substance registration. And it would require FDA, in consultation with DEA, to submit a report one year after enactment to Congress on obstacles to legitimate patient access to controlled substances and collaborative efforts to benefit patients and prevent abuse of these substances. I want to thank Representatives Blackburn, Marino, Welch and Chu for introducing this bipartisan legislation and I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this legislation. The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Duncan of Tennessee). The question is on the motion offered by the gentlewoman from Tennessee (Mrs. Blackburn) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 471, as amended. The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. ____________________",package_114_99.csv,26558,26558,26626,"[congressional record volume 161, number 58 (tuesday, april 21, 2015)] [house] [pages h2329-h2332] from the congressional record online through the government publishing office [ www.gpo.gov ] ensuring patient access and effective drug enforcement act of 2015 mrs. blackburn. madam speaker, i move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (h.r. 471) to improve enforcement efforts related to prescription drug diversion and abuse, and for other purposes, as amended. the clerk read the title of the bill. the text of the bill is as follows: h.r. 471 be it enacted by the senate and house of representatives of the united states of america in congress assembled, section 1. short title. this act may be cited as the ``ensuring patient access and effective drug enforcement act of 2015''. sec. 2. registration process under controlled substances act.

minutes. the chair recognizes the gentlewoman from tennessee. general leave mrs. blackburn. madam speaker, i ask unanimous consent that all members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and insert extraneous materials into the record. the speaker pro tempore. is there objection to the request of the gentlewoman from tennessee? there was no objection. mrs. blackburn. madam speaker, i yield myself such time as i may consume. i rise in strong support of h.r. 471, the ensuring patient access and effective drug enforcement act of 2015. this critical legislation combats inappropriate use of prescription drugs by bringing greater clarity and transparency to the requirements for safe and secure distribution of these medicines. it accomplishes these goals by clarifying some key terminology in the controlled substances act. this comprehensive approach to the legislation will result in better protections against diversion and abuse of controlled substances. what it does is it provides the dea with the clarity to collaborate with the very people responsible for ensuring that these medications get to the patients who need them without hurting and harming that distribution chain and while clamping down on diversions and abuse. these collaborations will lead to improved policies to prevent diversion while allowing legitimate patients to have access to the medications they need. now, like so many components and pieces and bills and parts of legislation, the best example of why this is needed is a story that comes from home. in the case of this bill, we had a constituent who called our office after one of the recent ice storms that we saw in middle tennessee this winter. it seemed as if these storms would never stop. the ice would come, and then it would not melt. we had a constituent who has a son who has a severe seizure disorder, and he takes three different medicines to control these seizures. although his medicines are not opioids, two of them are controlled substances. so this mother, taking care of her son, decided she better get herself to the drugstore before the storm hit, and she did just that, to refill his prescriptions. she was anticipating that the prescriptions would run out before the ice melted and she would be able to get to the store. at the drugstore, she was told that she could not refill them because it was too early. she explained the situation. the pharmacist sympathized, but the pharmacist went on to say if the prescription were to be filled early, there would be problems with the dea and other agencies. {time} 1600 the pharmacist was worried that his license might be lost. our legislation is simply to ensure that patients who have a legitimate need for medications can receive them while we are battling diversion and abuse, which truly is a problem in this country. so, madam speaker, i encourage all of my colleagues to support this effort. i reserve the balance of my time. house of representatives, committee on the judiciary, washington, dc, april 20, 2015. hon. fred upton, chairman, committee on energy and commerce, washington, dc. dear chairman upton: i am writing with respect to h.r. 471, the ``ensuring patient access and effective drug enforcement act of 2015.'' as a result of your having consulted with us on provisions in h.r. 471 that fall within the rule x jurisdiction of the committee on the judiciary, i agree to discharge our committee from further consideration of this bill so that it may proceed expeditiously to the house floor for consideration. the judiciary committee takes this action with our mutual understanding that by foregoing consideration of h.r. 471 at this time, we do not waive any jurisdiction over subject matter contained in this or similar legislation, and that our committee will be appropriately consulted and involved as this bill or similar legislation moves forward so that we may address any remaining issues in our jurisdiction. our committee also reserves the right to seek appointment of an appropriate number of conferees to any house-senate conference involving this or similar legislation, and asks that you support any such request. i would appreciate a response to this letter confirming this understanding with respect to h.r. 471, and would ask that a copy of our exchange of letters on this matter be included in the congressional record during floor consideration of h.r. 471. sincerely, bob goodlatte, chairman. ____ house of representatives, committee on energy and commerce, washington, dc, april

consideration of h.r. 471, and i agree that your decision is not a waiver of any of the committee on the judiciary's jurisdiction over the subject matter contained in this or similar legislation, and that the committee will be appropriately consulted and involved as this bill or similar legislation moves forward. in addition, i understand the committee reserves the right to seek the appointment of an appropriate number of conferees to any house-senate conference involving this or similar legislation, for which you will have my support. i will include a copy of your letter and this response in the congressional record during consideration of h.r. 471 on the house floor. sincerely, fred upton, chairman. mr. welch. mr. speaker, i yield myself such time as i may consume. i am pleased that the house is taking up again bipartisan action today to address the serious issue that impacts families in each of our districts: prescription drug abuse. vermont, like tennessee and many states around the country, is grappling with a serious opiate epidemic. in addition to alarming increases in heroin abuse, admissions for treatment of prescription drug abuse increased 361 percent between 2005 and 2013. as we have experienced in vermont, we are most effective in dealing with this public health crisis when stakeholders--providers, public health officials, law enforcement, distributors, and pharmacists--come together to tackle the problem head-on. today, the distributors of prescription drugs, along with local pharmacies, are experiencing unpredictable enforcement from the dea. this has led to disruptions in the supply chain which limit patient access to prescription drugs for legitimate uses, as was evidenced by my colleague's story. the ensuring patient access and effective drug enforcement act will encourage collaboration between law enforcement, members of the supply chain, and public health providers and officials while ensuring patients have access to the treatment their doctor has prescribed. it has been a pleasure to work with representative marino, representative blackburn, and representative chu, who has been a major leader on this, and i thank them for their efforts and their leadership. i also thank chairman upton and ranking member pallone for making this issue a priority of the energy and commerce committee. i urge my colleagues to support h.r. 471, and i reserve the balance of my time. mrs. blackburn. mr. speaker, i think it is so important for us to note that the gentleman from pennsylvania (mr. marino) has been the primary author of this

work, and i encourage an ``aye'' vote. mr. speaker, i yield back the balance of my time. mr. pallone. mr. speaker, i rise in support of h.r. 471, the ensuring patient access and effective drug enforcement act of 2015. millions of americans rely on prescription drugs to treat and cure illnesses and improve the overall quality of their lives. unfortunately, we also have a significant problem in this country with abuse of prescription drugs. h.r. 471 would help drug distributors, pharmacies, and others work with dea to achieve the difficult balance between keeping controlled substance prescription drugs away from drug abusers, but not from patients who urgently need them. it would achieve this goal by making several changes to the controlled substances act. it would provide definitions for the phrases ``factors as may be relevant to and consistent with the public health and safety'' and ``imminent danger to the public health or safety.'' it would require dea to provide registrants an opportunity to submit an action plan to correct any violations for which dea is considering revoking or suspending their controlled substance registration. and it would require fda, in consultation with dea, to submit a report one year after enactment to congress on obstacles to legitimate patient access to controlled substances and collaborative efforts to benefit patients and prevent abuse of these substances. i want to thank representatives blackburn, marino, welch and chu for introducing this bipartisan legislation and i urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this legislation. the speaker pro tempore (mr. duncan of tennessee). the question is on the motion offered by the gentlewoman from tennessee (mrs. blackburn) that the house suspend the rules and pass the bill, h.r. 471, as amended. the question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed. a motion to reconsider was laid on the table. ____________________",26558

Passed the Senate March 26 (legislative day, March 27), 2015. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from Kentucky (Mr. Whitfield) and the gentleman from Vermont (Mr. Welch) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Kentucky. General Leave Mr. WHITFIELD. Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and to insert extraneous materials in the Record on the bill. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Kentucky? There was no objection. Mr. WHITFIELD. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Today, we are considering S. 535, the Energy Efficiency Improvement Act of 2015, a bill to address energy efficiency in Federal buildings, energy conservation through the continued use of grid-enabled water heaters, and energy information for federally leased commercial buildings. I also want to thank the gentleman from Vermont (Mr. Welch) for working with us on this important legislation. Both sides of the aisle came together in this legislation, and I want to thank all of them and their staffs for the work that they have done. Madam Speaker, the first title in this bill would establish a Tenant Star program--a voluntary certification and recognition program--within ENERGY STAR to promote energy efficiency in separate spaces. This program allows for a voluntary, market-driven approach to aligning the interests of commercial building owners and their tenants to reduce energy consumption. The DOE would also be required to complete a study on feasible approaches to improving the energy efficiency of tenant- occupied spaces in commercial buildings. The second title in this bill relates to hot water heaters. There are approximately 250 electric cooperatives in 34 States that utilize large electric resistance water heaters in demand response programs to help with reliability and consumer costs during peak periods of energy use. In March 2010, the Department of Energy issued new energy efficiency standards for large electric resistance water heaters that would, in effect, prohibit the manufacture of these water heaters that are 55 gallons or larger in favor of heat pump technology for water heaters of 55 gallons or larger. These standards took effect last week. I might say that the American people from whom I frequently hear are totally frustrated by the micromanagement of the government in almost every aspect of their lives, and this regulation about water heaters is just one example. At the hearing that we held on this regulation, the manufacturers testified that this regulation would basically double the cost of these water heaters. We have a situation in which many heat pump water heaters are not compatible with certain utility thermal energy storage and demand response programs that allow utilities to reduce or to shift their loads during certain periods of energy use. Title II would allow for the continued manufacture of large electric resistant water heaters above certain gallons specifically for use in these energy savings programs. This is very common sense, Congress' responding to concerns by the general [[Page H2327]] public that the Department of Energy is trying to micromanage this small part of the energy sector in the United States. I might mention that the third title of this bill requires that federally leased buildings without ENERGY STAR labels benchmark and disclose their energy usage data where practicable. Federally owned buildings are already subject to benchmarking requirements pursuant to section 432 of the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007. Title III simply requires the DOE to complete a study of best practices regarding State and local performance benchmarking and disclosure policies for commercial and multi-family buildings in addition to the impact of utility policies for providing aggregated information to owners of multi-tenant buildings to assist with benchmarking programs. This is a commonsense piece of legislation. It has passed the House and the Senate. The Senate bill was a little bit different than ours, so we are taking up their bill. I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. WELCH. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I thank the gentleman for his excellent work. Today is a very good day in Congress and in our country as we send to the President's desk bipartisan legislation that will: one, lower energy bills for families and businesses; two, create good jobs in manufacturing American-made energy efficiency products; and, three, improve our environment by reducing carbon emissions. I am hopeful that the common ground we have found in this bill sets the stage for further cooperation by both parties and by both Chambers in addressing many of the challenges facing our country. I want to thank Chairman Upton and Chairman Whitfield, and I want to thank Ranking Member Pallone and Ranking Member Rush for working with us to advance this important legislation. Thank you, especially, Representative McKinley, for partnering with me this term and last on this issue. Your background as an engineer and as a small business owner has provided much-needed expertise to our committee, and I am grateful to you for your partnership and leadership on this issue. The bill before us today, as Mr. Whitfield said, advanced by Senators Shaheen and Portman in the Senate, also includes some very good ideas from many Members of this House, those from Representatives Cramer, Doyle, Latta, Loebsack, Castor, and Kinzinger. Thank you all for your contributions to this good, bipartisan bill. Madam Speaker, I have long believed that energy efficiency is an issue that lends itself to looking past partisan differences to find common ground in our Congress. We may disagree on the causes of climate change and of the best fuel mix to meet America's energy needs, but we can all agree that using less of whatever energy source is more. We can all agree that creating demand for American-made, energy-efficient products will create good jobs, and we can all agree that cutting the energy bills of homeowners, businesses, and the Federal Government is a very good thing. Vermont has been a leader for a long time in energy efficiency. We were the first in the Nation to establish an ``energy efficiency utility'' to provide assistance to homeowners and businesses that were seeking to lower their energy bills. In 2013 alone, the work of Efficiency Vermont yielded a lifetime customer savings of $206 million for Vermonters. That is real money. The bill before us today takes an important step towards making America more energy efficient. It includes the Better Buildings Act, also known as Tenant Star, which will drive private sector innovation in the energy efficiency sector. Homes and buildings consume 40 percent of our energy in the United States. That is 40 percent. In commercial buildings, owners report that tenants consume up to 50 percent or more of the total building energy. One of the challenges facing commercial buildings has been the issue of ``split incentives.'' Building owners and tenants are not always on the same page when it comes to energy performance. Part of the problem is that only one party is paying the energy bill. The other part of the problem is that, while we recognize energy-efficient buildings through our ENERGY STAR program, we have no similar recognition program for tenant spaces. Our bill creates a voluntary Tenant Star recognition program for separate spaces in commercial buildings. When we combine ENERGY STAR buildings with Tenant Star rentals, we can optimize energy efficiency and shorten payback periods. A good example of this synergy can be found in the ENERGY STAR-certified Vermont Innovation Center, located in Burlington, Vermont. The Vermont Energy Investment Corporation is located in this building as well as my own district office. The VEIC took aggressive action to optimize the efficiency of its tenant space in the building. It converted the overhead fluorescent lighting to highly efficient LEDs and applied 6 inches of spray foam insulation to the exterior walls. Making these improvements in an ENERGY STAR building optimized an already efficient tenant space. The VEIC expects to save nearly $11,000 a year in energy savings. However, there is no recognition program for these improvements, and we don't know what else VEIC could be doing to increase energy savings. Under this bill, we will study the best ways to optimize commercial tenant spaces and to recognize such spaces with a new Tenant Star label. By combining energy-efficient tenant build-outs with ENERGY STAR buildings, we will double down on a successful program and optimize energy savings in commercial buildings, all through voluntary action. In addition to Tenant Star, this legislation includes two other important efficiency provisions. First, the bill makes much-needed changes to energy efficiency standards for large water heaters used in demand response programs. These water heaters act as residential energy storage devices and allow utilities to curb energy demand during peak hours. Mr. Whitfield, thank you again for your leadership on this. Second, the bill will require the disclosure of the amount of energy consumed in federally leased buildings and begin benchmarking their energy use. In the coming weeks, I look forward to working with my colleagues to pass additional bipartisan energy efficiency bills, including a more expansive version of the McKinley-Welch-Shaheen-Portman legislation before us today. We should also pass legislation to encourage performance contracting in Federal buildings and streamline the Federal green schools efforts. {time} 1545 Madam Speaker, energy efficiency is not a partisan issue. I am encouraged by the steps we are taking today and look forward to working with my colleagues on additional initiatives that cut energy bills, create jobs, and improve the environment. I urge Members to vote for this bill. I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. WHITFIELD. Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. WELCH. I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Rush). Mr. RUSH. I thank the gentleman for yielding. Madam Speaker, I rise in support of S. 535, the Energy Efficiency Improvement Act of 2015, and I want to join with my colleague, Mr. Welch, in congratulating all in the leadership: Mr. Whitfield, Mr. Welch, Mr. Pallone, and the chairman of the full committee. Mr. Speaker, this is a modest but, most importantly, a bipartisan piece of legislation that combines three separate energy efficiency titles. This bill was passed by unanimous consent out of the Senate just this last month. The bill before us today is also similar to H.R. 2126, which passed out of this House in the last session of Congress on an overwhelmingly bipartisan vote of 375-36. The first title of this bill, Madam Speaker, is the Better Buildings Act, which was introduced into the Congress by my friends and colleagues, the gentleman from West Virginia (Mr. McKinley) and the gentleman from Vermont (Mr. Welch). This title simply directs the General Services Administration to develop model leasing provisions and best practices to encourage commercial building [[Page H2328]] owners and their tenants to invest in cost-effective energy efficiency measures. These model leasing provisions may then be used in Federal leases and, along with the best practices, Madam Speaker, shall be made available to all State and local governments. Additionally, section 103 directs the Department of Energy to conduct a study on the feasibility of significantly improving energy efficiency in commercial buildings through the design and construction of separate tenant spaces with high-performance energy efficiency measures. Section 104 directs the EPA to develop a ``Tenant Star'' program within the ENERGY STAR program to promote energy efficiency in separate spaces leased by tenants in commercial buildings. This data can then be used to establish an ENERGY STAR rating system to recognize tenants in commercial buildings that voluntarily achieve high levels of energy efficiency in separate spaces. Madam Speaker, title II of this bill, the Grid-Enabled Water Heaters bill, was introduced by my colleague and my good friend, Chairman Whitfield, along with Mr. Welch, Mr. Latta, Mr. Loebsack, Mr. Cramer, and Mr. Doyle. This section establishes a separate energy efficiency standard for grid-enabled water heaters, which are used in utility demand and thermal storage programs. Finally, Madam Speaker, title III of this bill, the Energy Information for Commercial Buildings bill, which was introduced into Congress by my friend and colleague, Ms. Castor of Florida, requires Federally leased buildings without ENERGY STAR labels to benchmark and disclose their energy usage data in most cases. It also requires the Department of Energy to complete a study of best practices for and impacts of, one, State and local performance benchmarking and disclosure policies for commercial and multifamily buildings; and, two, utility policies for providing aggregated information to owners of multitenant buildings to assist with benchmarking programs. In addition, Madam Speaker, the DOE is required to maintain a database to store and make available public energy- related information on commercial and multifamily buildings. Madam Speaker, in recent history, we have not been able to pass bipartisan energy legislation through both Chambers and into law, so it is important that we move this bill to the President's desk so that we can demonstrate once again to the American people that this Congress is still capable of functioning properly and legislating on their behalf. Madam Speaker, I urge all my colleagues to vote for this bill. Mr. WHITFIELD. Madam Speaker, I don't believe we have any additional speakers on our side, and I would like the opportunity to close, so I will reserve the balance of my time. Mr. WELCH. Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time, and thank the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Rush) not just for his remarks on this bill, but for his leadership on this issue and other issues in the committee over the years. It is a good day when we can come together to do something constructive. This legislation finds that spot, energy efficiency, where we can join in embracing the enormous benefit of creating ways where homeowners and business owners of commercial buildings can figure out how to cut down on their bills. Whatever fuel source they use, if they have got a lower bill, that is a good thing. To achieve that goal, we have to put Americans to work, a lot of tradespeople who have got real skills and need a place to use them. They are the ones who retrofit these buildings, commercial buildings and homes. There is an incidental benefit: We reduce carbon emissions since we are using less fuel. This is tremendous. I want to thank the gentleman from Kentucky (Mr. Whitfield) and the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Upton) for all the good work that they did. Madam Speaker, seeing no other speakers here, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. WHITFIELD. Madam Speaker, I want to thank my colleagues on both sides of the aisle once again, specifically Senators Shaheen and Portman, Congressmen McKinley and Welch, Mr. Upton and Mr. Pallone, and certainly Mr. Rush of Illinois. All of them worked very diligently on this, and I know they are committed to efficiency. I want to just say one more time that I am specifically pleased that this legislation will stop the Department of Energy's regulation that would prohibit the manufacture of heat-resistant water heaters above 55 gallons. If that regulation had been allowed to continue, it would have cost the American public a lot more money going to the heat pump technology. So this legislation has stopped that. It is going to improve efficiency. I would urge all of my colleagues to support this legislation. I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I rise in support of S. 535, the Energy Efficiency Improvement Act of 2015. This is bipartisan legislation to promote energy efficiency that recently passed the Senate by unanimous consent. S. 535--sponsored by Senators Portman and Shaheen--is very similar to legislation reported last Congress by the Energy and Commerce Committee which passed the House with an overwhelmingly bipartisan vote. The bill addresses three main areas: energy efficient buildings, the grid- enabled water heaters, and energy benchmarking and information disclosure for federal buildings. Title one is comprised of the Better Buildings Act, bipartisan legislation sponsored in the House by Reps. McKinley and Welch. Section 102 of the bill directs the General Services Administration to develop model leasing provisions and best practices to encourage commercial building owners and tenants to invest in cost-effective energy efficiency measures. It also ensures the model leasing provisions are available for use in federal leases and, along with the best practices, are available for state and local governments to also use. Additionally, Section 103 directs the Department of Energy (DOE) to study improving energy efficiency in commercial buildings through design and construction of separate tenant spaces with high-performance energy efficiency measures. And, Section 104 directs EPA to develop a voluntary ``Tenant Star'' program within the Energy Star program to promote energy efficiency in separate spaces leased by tenants in commercial buildings and requires the Agency to establish an Energy Star rating system to recognize tenants in commercial buildings that voluntarily achieve high levels of energy efficiency in separate spaces. Title two establishes a separate energy efficiency standard for grid- enabled water heaters, which are used in utility demand-response and thermal storage programs. This is substantially the same language included in H.R. 906, legislation sponsored by Chairman Whitfield, Mr. Loebsack and others that was reported without dissent last week by our committee. In addition to establishing a separate standard for these water heaters, the provision requires those units to have a built-in activation lock to ensure their participation in such a program. Finally, title three is essentially the same as H.R. 1867, legislation sponsored by Reps. Castor and Kinzinger regarding energy information for commercial buildings. Section 301 requires federally- leased buildings without Energy Star labels to benchmark and disclose their energy usage data except in certain circumstances. It also requires DOE to complete a study of best practices regarding the impacts of state and local performance benchmarking and disclosure policies for commercial and multifamily buildings, as well as utility policies for providing aggregated information to owners of multitenant buildings to assist with benchmarking programs. In addition, it requires DOE to maintain a database to store and make available public energy-related information on commercial and multifamily buildings. S. 535 is a stripped down version of the Shaheen-Portman efficiency legislation that has taken far too long to pass either chamber. However, I am disappointed that--unlike the original Shaheen-Portman bill--the proposal before us does not contain provisions authored by Rep. Eshoo that would address the efficiency of federal data centers. This is an area where we can easily see a great gain in efficiency relatively quickly and easily and her proposal has good bipartisan support. So, I have to note with concern the fact that something as useful and bipartisan as that federal data center efficiency language could not make it into the final package, despite being something that enjoys support on both sides. I hope that is an anomaly and not a harbinger of things to come, because we need to look at both sides of the equation--demand and supply, consumers and producers--to construct an energy policy for the future, one that is both economically and environmentally sustainable. And we need the resources of both sides of the aisle, both chambers of Congress and all branches of government to get there. [[Page H2329]] Today, the Obama Administration released the first installment of its Quadrennial Energy Review (QER) after a year-long, detailed examination of our energy needs. The QER is not exactly glamorous, but it is a serious, thoughtful and necessary look at how best to modernize America's energy infrastructure to create jobs and grow our economy in a manner that ensures our energy security and protects our environment. While I look forward to reviewing the complete report, I know that the progress updates we have received throughout the year have elicited positive and hopeful reactions from both sides of the aisle. That's why I'm particularly pleased that the Administration is releasing this now while our Committee and our counterparts in the other body are considering the components of a possible bipartisan energy bill. We must meet consumers' need for reliable, affordable and, just as importantly, clean energy--one of the nation's most pressing issues. The QER looks to the future of our economy to take full advantage of American innovation and the new sources of domestic energy supply that are transforming the nation's energy marketplace. Just like efficiency, energy infrastructure--particularly with regard to size, scope, volume and siting--is critical to that endeavor. So, too, is the makeup--not just the volume--of the jobs that are created in modernizing that infrastructure; they must be jobs that are long-term, well-paying, and a gateway to the American dream for a diverse range of women and men. As Chairman Upton, Chairman Whitfield, Ranking Member Rush and I continue to explore the potential for developing and moving a bipartisan energy bill during this Congress, I hope we will take advantage of the QER, as well as the best consensus ideas on both sides of the aisle here in Congress. That, to me, is the only successful path forward and it is the process embodied in the legislation before us today. I urge my colleagues to support both the legislation before us and continuing the effort to build a broad, bipartisan partnership on energy issues. Only through this kind of cooperation can we enact energy legislation that truly powers our economy and our future. Mr. PETERSON. Madam Speaker, I strongly support the Energy Efficiency Improvement Act, which will create a special category for large volume water heaters in the Department of Energy's new energy efficiency standards. Without this bill, manufacturers would no longer be able to make large volume water heaters, which are commonly used in Minnesota homes. This legislation is necessary because the DOE failed to recognize the many benefits that large-volume water heaters provide, like bringing more renewable energy onto the grid, and allowing power plants to run more efficiently. The Department then made a problematic rule even worse by pulling a waiver for this technology three weeks before the rule went final this month. This could have been where the story ended, but a diverse coalition of stakeholders had been working together to ensure that this technology can continue to be used. They know that using electricity in a smarter way not only saves consumers money, but it is also good for the environment and helps to stabilize the grid. That is why industry, environmental and energy efficiency stakeholders support these hot water heaters when used as part of demand response systems. I hope that with the passage of this bill, the Department can get quickly reverse course, and move forward. This is good, reasonable legislation and I urge my colleagues to vote yes. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Kentucky (Mr. Whitfield) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, S. 535. The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill was passed. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 58 (Tuesday, April 21, 2015)] [House] [Pages H2324-H2329] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] ENERGY EFFICIENCY IMPROVEMENT ACT OF 2015 Mr. WHITFIELD.

Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and to insert extraneous materials in the Record on the bill. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Kentucky? There was no objection. Mr. WHITFIELD. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Today, we are considering S. 535, the Energy Efficiency Improvement Act of 2015, a bill to address energy efficiency in Federal buildings, energy conservation through the continued use of grid-enabled water heaters, and energy information for federally leased commercial buildings. I also want to thank the gentleman from Vermont (Mr. Welch) for working with us on this important legislation. Both sides of the aisle came together in this legislation, and I want to thank all of them and their staffs for the work that they have done. Madam Speaker, the first title in this bill would establish a Tenant Star program--a voluntary certification and recognition program--within ENERGY STAR to promote energy efficiency in separate spaces. This program allows for a voluntary, market-driven approach to aligning the interests of commercial building owners and their tenants to reduce energy consumption. The DOE would also be required to complete a study on feasible approaches to improving the energy efficiency of tenant- occupied spaces in commercial buildings. The second title in this bill relates to hot water heaters. There are approximately 250 electric cooperatives in 34 States that utilize large electric resistance water heaters in demand response programs to help with reliability and consumer costs during peak periods of energy use. In March 2010, the Department of Energy issued new energy efficiency standards for large electric resistance water heaters that would, in effect, prohibit the manufacture of these water heaters that are 55 gallons or larger in favor of heat pump technology for water heaters of 55 gallons or larger. These standards took effect last week. I might say that the American people from whom I frequently hear are totally frustrated by the micromanagement of the government in almost every aspect of their lives, and this regulation about water heaters is just one example. At the hearing that we held on this regulation, the manufacturers testified that this regulation would basically double the cost of these water heaters. We have a situation in which many heat pump water heaters are not compatible with certain utility thermal energy storage and demand response programs that allow utilities to reduce or to shift their loads during certain periods of energy use. Title II would allow for the continued manufacture of large electric resistant water heaters above certain gallons specifically for use in these energy savings programs. This is very common sense, Congress' responding to concerns by the general [[Page H2327]] public that the Department of Energy is trying to micromanage this small part of the energy sector in the United States. I might mention that the third title of this bill requires that federally leased buildings without ENERGY STAR labels benchmark and disclose their energy usage data where practicable. Federally owned buildings are already subject to benchmarking requirements pursuant to section 432 of the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007. Title III simply requires the DOE to complete a study of best practices regarding State and local performance benchmarking and disclosure policies for commercial and multi-family buildings in addition to the impact of utility policies for providing aggregated information to owners of multi-tenant buildings to assist with benchmarking programs. This is a commonsense piece of legislation. It has passed the House and the Senate. The Senate bill was a little bit different than ours, so we are taking up their bill. I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. WELCH. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I thank the gentleman for his excellent work. Today is a very good day in Congress and in our country as we send to the President's desk bipartisan legislation that will: one, lower energy bills for families and businesses; two, create good jobs in manufacturing American-made energy efficiency products; and, three, improve our environment by reducing carbon emissions. I am hopeful that the common ground we have found in this bill sets the stage for further cooperation by both parties and by both Chambers in addressing many of the challenges facing our country. I want to thank Chairman Upton and Chairman Whitfield, and I want to thank Ranking Member Pallone and Ranking Member Rush for working with us to advance this important legislation. Thank you, especially, Representative McKinley, for partnering with me this term and last on this issue. Your background as an engineer and as a small business owner has provided much-needed expertise to our committee, and I am grateful to you for your partnership and leadership on this issue. The bill before us today, as Mr. Whitfield said, advanced by Senators Shaheen and Portman in the Senate, also includes some very good ideas from many Members of this House, those from Representatives Cramer, Doyle, Latta, Loebsack, Castor, and Kinzinger. Thank you all for your contributions to this good, bipartisan bill. Madam Speaker, I have long believed that energy efficiency is an issue that lends itself to looking past partisan differences to find common ground in our Congress. We may disagree on the causes of climate change and of the best fuel mix to meet America's energy needs, but we can all agree that using less of whatever energy source is more. We can all agree that creating demand for American-made, energy-efficient products will create good jobs, and we can all agree that cutting the energy bills of homeowners, businesses, and the Federal Government is a very good thing. Vermont has been a leader for a long time in energy efficiency. We were the first in the Nation to establish an ``energy efficiency utility'' to provide assistance to homeowners and businesses that were seeking to lower their energy bills. In 2013 alone, the work of Efficiency Vermont yielded a lifetime customer savings of $206 million for Vermonters. That is real money. The bill before us today takes an important step towards making America more energy efficient. It includes the Better Buildings Act, also known as Tenant Star, which will drive private sector innovation in the energy efficiency sector. Homes and buildings consume 40 percent of our energy in the United States. That is 40 percent. In commercial buildings, owners report that tenants consume up to 50 percent or more of the total building energy. One of the challenges facing commercial buildings has been the issue of ``split incentives.'' Building owners and tenants are not always on the same page when it comes to energy performance. Part of the problem is that only one party is paying the energy bill. The other part of the problem is that, while we recognize energy-efficient buildings through our ENERGY STAR program, we have no similar recognition program for tenant spaces. Our bill creates a voluntary Tenant Star recognition program for separate spaces in commercial buildings. When we combine ENERGY STAR buildings with Tenant Star rentals, we can optimize energy efficiency and shorten payback periods. A good example of this synergy can be found in the ENERGY STAR-certified Vermont Innovation Center, located in Burlington, Vermont. The Vermont Energy Investment Corporation is located in this building as well as my own district office. The VEIC took aggressive action to optimize the efficiency of its tenant space in the building. It converted the overhead fluorescent lighting to highly efficient LEDs and applied 6 inches of spray foam insulation to the exterior walls. Making these improvements in an ENERGY STAR building optimized an already efficient tenant space. The VEIC expects to save nearly $11,000 a year in energy savings. However, there is no recognition program for these improvements, and we don't know what else VEIC could be doing to increase energy savings. Under this bill, we will study the best ways to optimize commercial tenant spaces and to recognize such spaces with a new Tenant Star label. By combining energy-efficient tenant build-outs with ENERGY STAR buildings, we will double down on a successful program and optimize energy savings in commercial buildings, all through voluntary action. In addition to Tenant Star, this legislation includes two other important efficiency provisions. First, the bill makes much-needed changes to energy efficiency standards for large water heaters used in demand response programs. These water heaters act as residential energy storage devices and allow utilities to curb energy demand during peak hours. Mr. Whitfield, thank you again for your leadership on this. Second, the bill will require the disclosure of the amount of energy consumed in federally leased buildings and begin benchmarking their energy use. In the coming weeks, I look forward to working with my colleagues to pass additional bipartisan energy efficiency bills, including a more expansive version of the McKinley-Welch-Shaheen-Portman legislation before us today. We should also pass legislation to encourage performance contracting in Federal buildings and streamline the Federal green schools efforts. {time} 1545 Madam Speaker, energy efficiency is not a partisan issue. I am encouraged by the steps we are taking today and look forward to working with my colleagues on additional initiatives that cut energy bills, create jobs, and improve the environment. I urge Members to vote for this bill. I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. WHITFIELD. Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. WELCH. I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Rush). Mr. RUSH. I thank the gentleman for yielding. Madam Speaker, I rise in support of S. 535, the Energy Efficiency Improvement Act of 2015, and I want to join with my colleague, Mr. Welch, in congratulating all in the leadership: Mr. Whitfield, Mr. Welch, Mr. Pallone, and the chairman of the full committee. Mr. Speaker, this is a modest but, most importantly, a bipartisan piece of legislation that combines three separate energy efficiency titles. This bill was passed by unanimous consent out of the Senate just this last month. The bill before us today is also similar to H.R. 2126, which passed out of this House in the last session of Congress on an overwhelmingly bipartisan vote of 375-36. The first title of this bill, Madam Speaker, is the Better Buildings Act, which was introduced into the Congress by my friends and colleagues, the gentleman from West Virginia (Mr. McKinley) and the gentleman from Vermont (Mr. Welch). This title simply directs the General Services Administration to develop model leasing provisions and best practices to encourage commercial building [[Page H2328]] owners and their tenants to invest in cost-effective energy efficiency measures. These model leasing provisions may then be used in Federal leases and, along with the best practices, Madam Speaker, shall be made available to all State and local governments. Additionally, section 103 directs the Department of Energy to conduct a study on the feasibility of significantly improving energy efficiency in commercial buildings through the design and construction of separate tenant spaces with high-performance energy efficiency measures. Section 104 directs the EPA to develop a ``Tenant Star'' program within the ENERGY STAR program to promote energy efficiency in separate spaces leased by tenants in commercial buildings. This data can then be used to establish an ENERGY STAR rating system to recognize tenants in commercial buildings that voluntarily achieve high levels of energy efficiency in separate spaces. Madam Speaker, title II of this bill, the Grid-Enabled Water Heaters bill, was introduced by my colleague and my good friend, Chairman Whitfield, along with Mr. Welch, Mr. Latta, Mr. Loebsack, Mr. Cramer, and Mr. Doyle. This section establishes a separate energy efficiency standard for grid-enabled water heaters, which are used in utility demand and thermal storage programs. Finally, Madam Speaker, title III of this bill, the Energy Information for Commercial Buildings bill, which was introduced into Congress by my friend and colleague, Ms. Castor of Florida, requires Federally leased buildings without ENERGY STAR labels to benchmark and disclose their energy usage data in most cases. It also requires the Department of Energy to complete a study of best practices for and impacts of, one, State and local performance benchmarking and disclosure policies for commercial and multifamily buildings; and, two, utility policies for providing aggregated information to owners of multitenant buildings to assist with benchmarking programs. In addition, Madam Speaker, the DOE is required to maintain a database to store and make available public energy- related information on commercial and multifamily buildings. Madam Speaker, in recent history, we have not been able to pass bipartisan energy legislation through both Chambers and into law, so it is important that we move this bill to the President's desk so that we can demonstrate once again to the American people that this Congress is still capable of functioning properly and legislating on their behalf. Madam Speaker, I urge all my colleagues to vote for this bill. Mr. WHITFIELD. Madam Speaker, I don't believe we have any additional speakers on our side, and I would like the opportunity to close, so I will reserve the balance of my time. Mr. WELCH. Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time, and thank the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Rush) not just for his remarks on this bill, but for his leadership on this issue and other issues in the committee over the years. It is a good day when we can come together to do something constructive. This legislation finds that spot, energy efficiency, where we can join in embracing the enormous benefit of creating ways where homeowners and business owners of commercial buildings can figure out how to cut down on their bills. Whatever fuel source they use, if they have got a lower bill, that is a good thing. To achieve that goal, we have to put Americans to work, a lot of tradespeople who have got real skills and need a place to use them. They are the ones who retrofit these buildings, commercial buildings and homes. There is an incidental benefit: We reduce carbon emissions since we are using less fuel. This is tremendous. I want to thank the gentleman from Kentucky (Mr. Whitfield) and the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Upton) for all the good work that they did. Madam Speaker, seeing no other speakers here, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. WHITFIELD. Madam Speaker, I want to thank my colleagues on both sides of the aisle once again, specifically Senators Shaheen and Portman, Congressmen McKinley and Welch, Mr. Upton and Mr. Pallone, and certainly Mr. Rush of Illinois. All of them worked very diligently on this, and I know they are committed to efficiency. I want to just say one more time that I am specifically pleased that this legislation will stop the Department of Energy's regulation that would prohibit the manufacture of heat-resistant water heaters above 55 gallons. If that regulation had been allowed to continue, it would have cost the American public a lot more money going to the heat pump technology. So this legislation has stopped that. It is going to improve efficiency. I would urge all of my colleagues to support this legislation. I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I rise in support of S. 535, the Energy Efficiency Improvement Act of 2015. This is bipartisan legislation to promote energy efficiency that recently passed the Senate by unanimous consent. S. 535--sponsored by Senators Portman and Shaheen--is very similar to legislation reported last Congress by the Energy and Commerce Committee which passed the House with an overwhelmingly bipartisan vote. The bill addresses three main areas: energy efficient buildings, the grid- enabled water heaters, and energy benchmarking and information disclosure for federal buildings. Title one is comprised of the Better Buildings Act, bipartisan legislation sponsored in the House by Reps. McKinley and Welch. Section 102 of the bill directs the General Services Administration to develop model leasing provisions and best practices to encourage commercial building owners and tenants to invest in cost-effective energy efficiency measures. It also ensures the model leasing provisions are available for use in federal leases and, along with the best practices, are available for state and local governments to also use. Additionally, Section 103 directs the Department of Energy (DOE) to study improving energy efficiency in commercial buildings through design and construction of separate tenant spaces with high-performance energy efficiency measures. And, Section 104 directs EPA to develop a voluntary ``Tenant Star'' program within the Energy Star program to promote energy efficiency in separate spaces leased by tenants in commercial buildings and requires the Agency to establish an Energy Star rating system to recognize tenants in commercial buildings that voluntarily achieve high levels of energy efficiency in separate spaces. Title two establishes a separate energy efficiency standard for grid- enabled water heaters, which are used in utility demand-response and thermal storage programs. This is substantially the same language included in H.R. 906, legislation sponsored by Chairman Whitfield, Mr. Loebsack and others that was reported without dissent last week by our committee. In addition to establishing a separate standard for these water heaters, the provision requires those units to have a built-in activation lock to ensure their participation in such a program. Finally, title three is essentially the same as H.R. 1867, legislation sponsored by Reps. Castor and Kinzinger regarding energy information for commercial buildings. Section 301 requires federally- leased buildings without Energy Star labels to benchmark and disclose their energy usage data except in certain circumstances. It also requires DOE to complete a study of best practices regarding the impacts of state and local performance benchmarking and disclosure policies for commercial and multifamily buildings, as well as utility policies for providing aggregated information to owners of multitenant buildings to assist with benchmarking programs. In addition, it requires DOE to maintain a database to store and make available public energy-related information on commercial and multifamily buildings. S. 535 is a stripped down version of the Shaheen-Portman efficiency legislation that has taken far too long to pass either chamber. However, I am disappointed that--unlike the original Shaheen-Portman bill--the proposal before us does not contain provisions authored by Rep. Eshoo that would address the efficiency of federal data centers. This is an area where we can easily see a great gain in efficiency relatively quickly and easily and her proposal has good bipartisan support. So, I have to note with concern the fact that something as useful and bipartisan as that federal data center efficiency language could not make it into the final package, despite being something that enjoys support on both sides. I hope that is an anomaly and not a harbinger of things to come, because we need to look at both sides of the equation--demand and supply, consumers and producers--to construct an energy policy for the future, one that is both economically and environmentally sustainable. And we need the resources of both sides of the aisle, both chambers of Congress and all branches of government to get there. [[Page H2329]] Today, the Obama Administration released the first installment of its Quadrennial Energy Review (QER) after a year-long, detailed examination of our energy needs. The QER is not exactly glamorous, but it is a serious, thoughtful and necessary look at how best to modernize America's energy infrastructure to create jobs and grow our economy in a manner that ensures our energy security and protects our environment. While I look forward to reviewing the complete report, I know that the progress updates we have received throughout the year have elicited positive and hopeful reactions from both sides of the aisle. That's why I'm particularly pleased that the Administration is releasing this now while our Committee and our counterparts in the other body are considering the components of a possible bipartisan energy bill. We must meet consumers' need for reliable, affordable and, just as importantly, clean energy--one of the nation's most pressing issues. The QER looks to the future of our economy to take full advantage of American innovation and the new sources of domestic energy supply that are transforming the nation's energy marketplace. Just like efficiency, energy infrastructure--particularly with regard to size, scope, volume and siting--is critical to that endeavor. So, too, is the makeup--not just the volume--of the jobs that are created in modernizing that infrastructure; they must be jobs that are long-term, well-paying, and a gateway to the American dream for a diverse range of women and men. As Chairman Upton, Chairman Whitfield, Ranking Member Rush and I continue to explore the potential for developing and moving a bipartisan energy bill during this Congress, I hope we will take advantage of the QER, as well as the best consensus ideas on both sides of the aisle here in Congress. That, to me, is the only successful path forward and it is the process embodied in the legislation before us today. I urge my colleagues to support both the legislation before us and continuing the effort to build a broad, bipartisan partnership on energy issues. Only through this kind of cooperation can we enact energy legislation that truly powers our economy and our future. Mr. PETERSON. Madam Speaker, I strongly support the Energy Efficiency Improvement Act, which will create a special category for large volume water heaters in the Department of Energy's new energy efficiency standards. Without this bill, manufacturers would no longer be able to make large volume water heaters, which are commonly used in Minnesota homes. This legislation is necessary because the DOE failed to recognize the many benefits that large-volume water heaters provide, like bringing more renewable energy onto the grid, and allowing power plants to run more efficiently. The Department then made a problematic rule even worse by pulling a waiver for this technology three weeks before the rule went final this month. This could have been where the story ended, but a diverse coalition of stakeholders had been working together to ensure that this technology can continue to be used. They know that using electricity in a smarter way not only saves consumers money, but it is also good for the environment and helps to stabilize the grid. That is why industry, environmental and energy efficiency stakeholders support these hot water heaters when used as part of demand response systems. I hope that with the passage of this bill, the Department can get quickly reverse course, and move forward. This is good, reasonable legislation and I urge my colleagues to vote yes. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Kentucky (Mr. Whitfield) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, S. 535. The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill was passed. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. ____________________","Congressional Record, Volume 161 Issue 58 (Tuesday, April 21, 2015) [Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 58 (Tuesday, April 21, 2015)] [House] [Pages H2324-H2329] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] ENERGY EFFICIENCY IMPROVEMENT ACT OF 2015 Mr. WHITFIELD.

Passed the Senate March 26 (legislative day, March 27), 2015. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from Kentucky (Mr. Whitfield) and the gentleman from Vermont (Mr. Welch) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Kentucky. General Leave Mr. WHITFIELD. Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and to insert extraneous materials in the Record on the bill. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Kentucky? There was no objection. Mr. WHITFIELD. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Today, we are considering S. 535, the Energy Efficiency Improvement Act of 2015, a bill to address energy efficiency in Federal buildings, energy conservation through the continued use of grid-enabled water heaters, and energy information for federally leased commercial buildings. I also want to thank the gentleman from Vermont (Mr. Welch) for working with us on this important legislation. Both sides of the aisle came together in this legislation, and I want to thank all of them and their staffs for the work that they have done. Madam Speaker, the first title in this bill would establish a Tenant Star program--a voluntary certification and recognition program--within ENERGY STAR to promote energy efficiency in separate spaces. This program allows for a voluntary, market-driven approach to aligning the interests of commercial building owners and their tenants to reduce energy consumption. The DOE would also be required to complete a study on feasible approaches to improving the energy efficiency of tenant- occupied spaces in commercial buildings. The second title in this bill relates to hot water heaters. There are approximately 250 electric cooperatives in 34 States that utilize large electric resistance water heaters in demand response programs to help with reliability and consumer costs during peak periods of energy use. In March 2010, the Department of Energy issued new energy efficiency standards for large electric resistance water heaters that would, in effect, prohibit the manufacture of these water heaters that are 55 gallons or larger in favor of heat pump technology for water heaters of 55 gallons or larger. These standards took effect last week. I might say that the American people from whom I frequently hear are totally frustrated by the micromanagement of the government in almost every aspect of their lives, and this regulation about water heaters is just one example. At the hearing that we held on this regulation, the manufacturers testified that this regulation would basically double the cost of these water heaters. We have a situation in which many heat pump water heaters are not compatible with certain utility thermal energy storage and demand response programs that allow utilities to reduce or to shift their loads during certain periods of energy use. Title II would allow for the continued manufacture of large electric resistant water heaters above certain gallons specifically for use in these energy savings programs. This is very common sense, Congress' responding to concerns by the general [[Page H2327]] public that the Department of Energy is trying to micromanage this small part of the energy sector in the United States. I might mention that the third title of this bill requires that federally leased buildings without ENERGY STAR labels benchmark and disclose their energy usage data where practicable. Federally owned buildings are already subject to benchmarking requirements pursuant to section 432 of the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007. Title III simply requires the DOE to complete a study of best practices regarding State and local performance benchmarking and disclosure policies for commercial and multi-family buildings in addition to the impact of utility policies for providing aggregated information to owners of multi-tenant buildings to assist with benchmarking programs. This is a commonsense piece of legislation. It has passed the House and the Senate. The Senate bill was a little bit different than ours, so we are taking up their bill. I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. WELCH. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I thank the gentleman for his excellent work. Today is a very good day in Congress and in our country as we send to the President's desk bipartisan legislation that will: one, lower energy bills for families and businesses; two, create good jobs in manufacturing American-made energy efficiency products; and, three, improve our environment by reducing carbon emissions. I am hopeful that the common ground we have found in this bill sets the stage for further cooperation by both parties and by both Chambers in addressing many of the challenges facing our country. I want to thank Chairman Upton and Chairman Whitfield, and I want to thank Ranking Member Pallone and Ranking Member Rush for working with us to advance this important legislation. Thank you, especially, Representative McKinley, for partnering with me this term and last on this issue. Your background as an engineer and as a small business owner has provided much-needed expertise to our committee, and I am grateful to you for your partnership and leadership on this issue. The bill before us today, as Mr. Whitfield said, advanced by Senators Shaheen and Portman in the Senate, also includes some very good ideas from many Members of this House, those from Representatives Cramer, Doyle, Latta, Loebsack, Castor, and Kinzinger. Thank you all for your contributions to this good, bipartisan bill. Madam Speaker, I have long believed that energy efficiency is an issue that lends itself to looking past partisan differences to find common ground in our Congress. We may disagree on the causes of climate change and of the best fuel mix to meet America's energy needs, but we can all agree that using less of whatever energy source is more. We can all agree that creating demand for American-made, energy-efficient products will create good jobs, and we can all agree that cutting the energy bills of homeowners, businesses, and the Federal Government is a very good thing. Vermont has been a leader for a long time in energy efficiency. We were the first in the Nation to establish an ``energy efficiency utility'' to provide assistance to homeowners and businesses that were seeking to lower their energy bills. In 2013 alone, the work of Efficiency Vermont yielded a lifetime customer savings of $206 million for Vermonters. That is real money. The bill before us today takes an important step towards making America more energy efficient. It includes the Better Buildings Act, also known as Tenant Star, which will drive private sector innovation in the energy efficiency sector. Homes and buildings consume 40 percent of our energy in the United States. That is 40 percent. In commercial buildings, owners report that tenants consume up to 50 percent or more of the total building energy. One of the challenges facing commercial buildings has been the issue of ``split incentives.'' Building owners and tenants are not always on the same page when it comes to energy performance. Part of the problem is that only one party is paying the energy bill. The other part of the problem is that, while we recognize energy-efficient buildings through our ENERGY STAR program, we have no similar recognition program for tenant spaces. Our bill creates a voluntary Tenant Star recognition program for separate spaces in commercial buildings. When we combine ENERGY STAR buildings with Tenant Star rentals, we can optimize energy efficiency and shorten payback periods. A good example of this synergy can be found in the ENERGY STAR-certified Vermont Innovation Center, located in Burlington, Vermont. The Vermont Energy Investment Corporation is located in this building as well as my own district office. The VEIC took aggressive action to optimize the efficiency of its tenant space in the building. It converted the overhead fluorescent lighting to highly efficient LEDs and applied 6 inches of spray foam insulation to the exterior walls. Making these improvements in an ENERGY STAR building optimized an already efficient tenant space. The VEIC expects to save nearly $11,000 a year in energy savings. However, there is no recognition program for these improvements, and we don't know what else VEIC could be doing to increase energy savings. Under this bill, we will study the best ways to optimize commercial tenant spaces and to recognize such spaces with a new Tenant Star label. By combining energy-efficient tenant build-outs with ENERGY STAR buildings, we will double down on a successful program and optimize energy savings in commercial buildings, all through voluntary action. In addition to Tenant Star, this legislation includes two other important efficiency provisions. First, the bill makes much-needed changes to energy efficiency standards for large water heaters used in demand response programs. These water heaters act as residential energy storage devices and allow utilities to curb energy demand during peak hours. Mr. Whitfield, thank you again for your leadership on this. Second, the bill will require the disclosure of the amount of energy consumed in federally leased buildings and begin benchmarking their energy use. In the coming weeks, I look forward to working with my colleagues to pass additional bipartisan energy efficiency bills, including a more expansive version of the McKinley-Welch-Shaheen-Portman legislation before us today. We should also pass legislation to encourage performance contracting in Federal buildings and streamline the Federal green schools efforts. {time} 1545 Madam Speaker, energy efficiency is not a partisan issue. I am encouraged by the steps we are taking today and look forward to working with my colleagues on additional initiatives that cut energy bills, create jobs, and improve the environment. I urge Members to vote for this bill. I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. WHITFIELD. Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. WELCH. I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Rush). Mr. RUSH. I thank the gentleman for yielding. Madam Speaker, I rise in support of S. 535, the Energy Efficiency Improvement Act of 2015, and I want to join with my colleague, Mr. Welch, in congratulating all in the leadership: Mr. Whitfield, Mr. Welch, Mr. Pallone, and the chairman of the full committee. Mr. Speaker, this is a modest but, most importantly, a bipartisan piece of legislation that combines three separate energy efficiency titles. This bill was passed by unanimous consent out of the Senate just this last month. The bill before us today is also similar to H.R. 2126, which passed out of this House in the last session of Congress on an overwhelmingly bipartisan vote of 375-36. The first title of this bill, Madam Speaker, is the Better Buildings Act, which was introduced into the Congress by my friends and colleagues, the gentleman from West Virginia (Mr. McKinley) and the gentleman from Vermont (Mr. Welch). This title simply directs the General Services Administration to develop model leasing provisions and best practices to encourage commercial building [[Page H2328]] owners and their tenants to invest in cost-effective energy efficiency measures. These model leasing provisions may then be used in Federal leases and, along with the best practices, Madam Speaker, shall be made available to all State and local governments. Additionally, section 103 directs the Department of Energy to conduct a study on the feasibility of significantly improving energy efficiency in commercial buildings through the design and construction of separate tenant spaces with high-performance energy efficiency measures. Section 104 directs the EPA to develop a ``Tenant Star'' program within the ENERGY STAR program to promote energy efficiency in separate spaces leased by tenants in commercial buildings. This data can then be used to establish an ENERGY STAR rating system to recognize tenants in commercial buildings that voluntarily achieve high levels of energy efficiency in separate spaces. Madam Speaker, title II of this bill, the Grid-Enabled Water Heaters bill, was introduced by my colleague and my good friend, Chairman Whitfield, along with Mr. Welch, Mr. Latta, Mr. Loebsack, Mr. Cramer, and Mr. Doyle. This section establishes a separate energy efficiency standard for grid-enabled water heaters, which are used in utility demand and thermal storage programs. Finally, Madam Speaker, title III of this bill, the Energy Information for Commercial Buildings bill, which was introduced into Congress by my friend and colleague, Ms. Castor of Florida, requires Federally leased buildings without ENERGY STAR labels to benchmark and disclose their energy usage data in most cases. It also requires the Department of Energy to complete a study of best practices for and impacts of, one, State and local performance benchmarking and disclosure policies for commercial and multifamily buildings; and, two, utility policies for providing aggregated information to owners of multitenant buildings to assist with benchmarking programs. In addition, Madam Speaker, the DOE is required to maintain a database to store and make available public energy- related information on commercial and multifamily buildings. Madam Speaker, in recent history, we have not been able to pass bipartisan energy legislation through both Chambers and into law, so it is important that we move this bill to the President's desk so that we can demonstrate once again to the American people that this Congress is still capable of functioning properly and legislating on their behalf. Madam Speaker, I urge all my colleagues to vote for this bill. Mr. WHITFIELD. Madam Speaker, I don't believe we have any additional speakers on our side, and I would like the opportunity to close, so I will reserve the balance of my time. Mr. WELCH. Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time, and thank the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Rush) not just for his remarks on this bill, but for his leadership on this issue and other issues in the committee over the years. It is a good day when we can come together to do something constructive. This legislation finds that spot, energy efficiency, where we can join in embracing the enormous benefit of creating ways where homeowners and business owners of commercial buildings can figure out how to cut down on their bills. Whatever fuel source they use, if they have got a lower bill, that is a good thing. To achieve that goal, we have to put Americans to work, a lot of tradespeople who have got real skills and need a place to use them. They are the ones who retrofit these buildings, commercial buildings and homes. There is an incidental benefit: We reduce carbon emissions since we are using less fuel. This is tremendous. I want to thank the gentleman from Kentucky (Mr. Whitfield) and the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Upton) for all the good work that they did. Madam Speaker, seeing no other speakers here, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. WHITFIELD. Madam Speaker, I want to thank my colleagues on both sides of the aisle once again, specifically Senators Shaheen and Portman, Congressmen McKinley and Welch, Mr. Upton and Mr. Pallone, and certainly Mr. Rush of Illinois. All of them worked very diligently on this, and I know they are committed to efficiency. I want to just say one more time that I am specifically pleased that this legislation will stop the Department of Energy's regulation that would prohibit the manufacture of heat-resistant water heaters above 55 gallons. If that regulation had been allowed to continue, it would have cost the American public a lot more money going to the heat pump technology. So this legislation has stopped that. It is going to improve efficiency. I would urge all of my colleagues to support this legislation. I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I rise in support of S. 535, the Energy Efficiency Improvement Act of 2015. This is bipartisan legislation to promote energy efficiency that recently passed the Senate by unanimous consent. S. 535--sponsored by Senators Portman and Shaheen--is very similar to legislation reported last Congress by the Energy and Commerce Committee which passed the House with an overwhelmingly bipartisan vote. The bill addresses three main areas: energy efficient buildings, the grid- enabled water heaters, and energy benchmarking and information disclosure for federal buildings. Title one is comprised of the Better Buildings Act, bipartisan legislation sponsored in the House by Reps. McKinley and Welch. Section 102 of the bill directs the General Services Administration to develop model leasing provisions and best practices to encourage commercial building owners and tenants to invest in cost-effective energy efficiency measures. It also ensures the model leasing provisions are available for use in federal leases and, along with the best practices, are available for state and local governments to also use. Additionally, Section 103 directs the Department of Energy (DOE) to study improving energy efficiency in commercial buildings through design and construction of separate tenant spaces with high-performance energy efficiency measures. And, Section 104 directs EPA to develop a voluntary ``Tenant Star'' program within the Energy Star program to promote energy efficiency in separate spaces leased by tenants in commercial buildings and requires the Agency to establish an Energy Star rating system to recognize tenants in commercial buildings that voluntarily achieve high levels of energy efficiency in separate spaces. Title two establishes a separate energy efficiency standard for grid- enabled water heaters, which are used in utility demand-response and thermal storage programs. This is substantially the same language included in H.R. 906, legislation sponsored by Chairman Whitfield, Mr. Loebsack and others that was reported without dissent last week by our committee. In addition to establishing a separate standard for these water heaters, the provision requires those units to have a built-in activation lock to ensure their participation in such a program. Finally, title three is essentially the same as H.R. 1867, legislation sponsored by Reps. Castor and Kinzinger regarding energy information for commercial buildings. Section 301 requires federally- leased buildings without Energy Star labels to benchmark and disclose their energy usage data except in certain circumstances. It also requires DOE to complete a study of best practices regarding the impacts of state and local performance benchmarking and disclosure policies for commercial and multifamily buildings, as well as utility policies for providing aggregated information to owners of multitenant buildings to assist with benchmarking programs. In addition, it requires DOE to maintain a database to store and make available public energy-related information on commercial and multifamily buildings. S. 535 is a stripped down version of the Shaheen-Portman efficiency legislation that has taken far too long to pass either chamber. However, I am disappointed that--unlike the original Shaheen-Portman bill--the proposal before us does not contain provisions authored by Rep. Eshoo that would address the efficiency of federal data centers. This is an area where we can easily see a great gain in efficiency relatively quickly and easily and her proposal has good bipartisan support. So, I have to note with concern the fact that something as useful and bipartisan as that federal data center efficiency language could not make it into the final package, despite being something that enjoys support on both sides. I hope that is an anomaly and not a harbinger of things to come, because we need to look at both sides of the equation--demand and supply, consumers and producers--to construct an energy policy for the future, one that is both economically and environmentally sustainable. And we need the resources of both sides of the aisle, both chambers of Congress and all branches of government to get there. [[Page H2329]] Today, the Obama Administration released the first installment of its Quadrennial Energy Review (QER) after a year-long, detailed examination of our energy needs. The QER is not exactly glamorous, but it is a serious, thoughtful and necessary look at how best to modernize America's energy infrastructure to create jobs and grow our economy in a manner that ensures our energy security and protects our environment. While I look forward to reviewing the complete report, I know that the progress updates we have received throughout the year have elicited positive and hopeful reactions from both sides of the aisle. That's why I'm particularly pleased that the Administration is releasing this now while our Committee and our counterparts in the other body are considering the components of a possible bipartisan energy bill. We must meet consumers' need for reliable, affordable and, just as importantly, clean energy--one of the nation's most pressing issues. The QER looks to the future of our economy to take full advantage of American innovation and the new sources of domestic energy supply that are transforming the nation's energy marketplace. Just like efficiency, energy infrastructure--particularly with regard to size, scope, volume and siting--is critical to that endeavor. So, too, is the makeup--not just the volume--of the jobs that are created in modernizing that infrastructure; they must be jobs that are long-term, well-paying, and a gateway to the American dream for a diverse range of women and men. As Chairman Upton, Chairman Whitfield, Ranking Member Rush and I continue to explore the potential for developing and moving a bipartisan energy bill during this Congress, I hope we will take advantage of the QER, as well as the best consensus ideas on both sides of the aisle here in Congress. That, to me, is the only successful path forward and it is the process embodied in the legislation before us today. I urge my colleagues to support both the legislation before us and continuing the effort to build a broad, bipartisan partnership on energy issues. Only through this kind of cooperation can we enact energy legislation that truly powers our economy and our future. Mr. PETERSON. Madam Speaker, I strongly support the Energy Efficiency Improvement Act, which will create a special category for large volume water heaters in the Department of Energy's new energy efficiency standards. Without this bill, manufacturers would no longer be able to make large volume water heaters, which are commonly used in Minnesota homes. This legislation is necessary because the DOE failed to recognize the many benefits that large-volume water heaters provide, like bringing more renewable energy onto the grid, and allowing power plants to run more efficiently. The Department then made a problematic rule even worse by pulling a waiver for this technology three weeks before the rule went final this month. This could have been where the story ended, but a diverse coalition of stakeholders had been working together to ensure that this technology can continue to be used. They know that using electricity in a smarter way not only saves consumers money, but it is also good for the environment and helps to stabilize the grid. That is why industry, environmental and energy efficiency stakeholders support these hot water heaters when used as part of demand response systems. I hope that with the passage of this bill, the Department can get quickly reverse course, and move forward. This is good, reasonable legislation and I urge my colleagues to vote yes. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Kentucky (Mr. Whitfield) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, S. 535. The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill was passed. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. ____________________",package_114_99.csv,49266,49266,49334,"[congressional record volume 161, number 58 (tuesday, april 21, 2015)] [house] [pages h2324-h2329] from the congressional record online through the government publishing office [ www.gpo.gov ] energy efficiency improvement act of 2015 mr. whitfield. madam speaker, i move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (s. 535) to promote energy efficiency. the clerk read the title of the bill. the text of the bill is as follows: s. 535 be it enacted by the senate and house of representatives of the united states of america in congress assembled, section 1. short title; table of contents.

the speaker pro tempore. pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from kentucky (mr. whitfield) and the gentleman from vermont (mr. welch) each will control 20 minutes. the chair recognizes the gentleman from kentucky. general leave mr. whitfield. madam speaker, i ask unanimous consent that all members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and to insert extraneous materials in the record on the bill. the speaker pro tempore. is there objection to the request of the gentleman from kentucky? there was no objection. mr. whitfield. madam speaker, i yield myself such time as i may consume. today, we are considering s. 535, the energy efficiency improvement act of 2015, a bill to address energy efficiency in federal buildings, energy conservation through the continued use of grid-enabled water heaters, and energy information for federally leased commercial buildings. i also want to thank the gentleman from vermont (mr. welch) for working with us on this important legislation. both sides of the aisle came together in this legislation, and i want to thank all of them and their staffs for the work that they have done. madam speaker, the first title in this bill would establish a tenant star program--a voluntary certification and recognition program--within energy star to promote energy efficiency in separate spaces. this program allows for a voluntary, market-driven approach to aligning the interests of commercial building owners and their tenants to reduce energy consumption. the doe would also be required to complete a study on feasible approaches to improving the energy efficiency of tenant- occupied spaces in commercial buildings. the second title in this bill relates to hot water heaters. there are approximately 250 electric cooperatives in 34 states that utilize large electric resistance water heaters in demand response programs to help with reliability and consumer costs during peak periods of energy use. in march 2010, the department of energy issued new energy efficiency standards for large electric resistance water heaters that would, in effect, prohibit the manufacture of these water heaters that are 55 gallons or larger in favor of heat pump technology for water heaters of 55 gallons or larger. these standards took effect last week. i might say that the american people from whom i frequently hear are totally frustrated by the micromanagement of the government in almost every aspect of their lives, and this regulation about water heaters is just one example. at the hearing that we held on this regulation, the manufacturers testified that this regulation would basically double the cost of these water heaters. we have a situation in which many heat pump water heaters are not compatible with certain utility thermal energy storage and demand response programs that allow utilities to reduce or to shift their loads during certain periods of energy use. title ii would allow for the continued manufacture of large electric resistant water heaters above certain gallons specifically for use in these energy savings programs. this is very common sense, congress' responding to concerns by the general [[page h2327]] public that the department of energy is trying to micromanage this small part of the energy sector in the united states. i might mention that the third title of this bill requires that federally leased buildings without energy star labels benchmark and disclose their energy usage data where practicable. federally owned buildings are already subject to benchmarking requirements pursuant to section 432 of the energy independence and security act of 2007. title iii simply requires the doe to complete a study of best practices regarding state and local performance benchmarking and disclosure policies for commercial and multi-family buildings in addition to the impact of utility policies for providing aggregated information to owners of multi-tenant buildings to assist with benchmarking programs. this is a commonsense piece of legislation. it has passed the house and the senate. the senate bill was a little bit different than ours, so we are taking up their bill. i reserve the balance of my time. mr. welch. madam speaker, i yield myself such time as i may consume. i thank the gentleman for his excellent work. today is a very good day in congress and in our country as we send to the president's desk bipartisan legislation that will: one, lower energy bills for families and businesses; two, create good jobs in manufacturing american-made energy efficiency products; and, three, improve our environment by reducing carbon emissions. i am hopeful that the common ground we have found in this bill sets the stage for further cooperation by both parties and by both chambers in addressing many of the challenges facing our country. i want to thank chairman upton and chairman whitfield, and i want to thank ranking member pallone and ranking member rush for working with us to advance this important legislation. thank you, especially, representative mckinley, for partnering with me this term and last on this issue. your background as an engineer and as a small business owner has provided much-needed expertise to our committee, and i am grateful to you for your partnership and leadership on this issue. the bill before us today, as mr. whitfield said, advanced by senators shaheen and portman in the senate, also includes some very good ideas from many members of this house, those from representatives cramer, doyle, latta, loebsack, castor, and kinzinger. thank you all for your contributions to this good, bipartisan bill. madam speaker, i have long believed that energy efficiency is an issue that lends itself to looking past partisan differences to find common ground in our congress. we may disagree on the causes of climate change and of the best fuel mix to meet america's energy needs, but we can all agree that using less of whatever energy source is more. we can all agree that creating demand for american-made, energy-efficient products will create good jobs, and we can all agree that cutting the energy bills of homeowners, businesses, and the federal government is a very good thing. vermont has been a leader for a long time in energy efficiency. we were the first in the nation to establish an ``energy efficiency utility'' to provide assistance to homeowners and businesses that were seeking to lower their energy bills. in 2013 alone, the work of efficiency vermont yielded a lifetime customer savings of $206 million for vermonters. that is real money. the bill before us today takes an important step towards making america more energy efficient. it includes the better buildings act, also known as tenant star, which will drive private sector innovation in the energy efficiency sector. homes and buildings consume 40 percent of our energy in the united states. that is 40 percent. in commercial buildings, owners report that tenants consume up to 50 percent or more of the total building energy. one of the challenges facing commercial buildings has been the issue of ``split incentives.'' building owners and tenants are not always on the same page when it comes to energy performance. part of the problem is that only one party is paying the energy bill. the other part of the problem is that, while we recognize energy-efficient buildings through our energy star program, we have no similar recognition program for tenant spaces. our bill creates a voluntary tenant star recognition program for separate spaces in commercial buildings. when we combine energy star buildings with tenant star rentals, we can optimize energy efficiency and shorten payback periods. a good example of this synergy can be found in the energy star-certified vermont innovation center, located in burlington, vermont. the vermont energy investment corporation is located in this building as well as my own district office. the veic took aggressive action to optimize the efficiency of its tenant space in the building. it converted the overhead fluorescent lighting to highly efficient leds and applied 6 inches of spray foam insulation to the exterior walls. making these improvements in an energy star building optimized an already efficient tenant space. the veic expects to save nearly $11,000 a year in energy savings. however, there is no recognition program for these improvements, and we don't know what else veic could be doing to increase energy savings. under this bill, we will study the best ways to optimize commercial tenant spaces and to recognize such spaces with a new tenant star label. by combining energy-efficient tenant build-outs with energy star buildings, we will double down on a successful program and optimize energy savings in commercial buildings, all through voluntary action. in addition to tenant star, this legislation includes two other important efficiency provisions. first, the bill makes much-needed changes to energy efficiency standards for large water heaters used in demand response programs. these water heaters act as residential energy storage devices and allow utilities to curb energy demand during peak hours. mr. whitfield, thank you again for your leadership on this. second, the bill will require the disclosure of the amount of energy consumed in federally leased buildings and begin benchmarking their energy use. in the coming weeks, i look forward to working with my colleagues to pass additional bipartisan energy efficiency bills, including a more expansive version of the mckinley-welch-shaheen-portman legislation before us today. we should also pass legislation to encourage performance contracting in federal buildings and streamline the federal green schools efforts. {time} 1545 madam speaker, energy efficiency is not a partisan issue. i am encouraged by the steps we are taking today and look forward to working with my colleagues on additional initiatives that cut energy bills, create jobs, and improve the environment. i urge members to vote for this bill. i reserve the balance of my time. mr. whitfield. madam speaker, i reserve the balance of my time. mr. welch. i yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from illinois (mr. rush). mr. rush. i thank the gentleman for yielding. madam speaker, i rise in support of s. 535, the energy efficiency improvement act of 2015, and i want to join with my colleague, mr. welch, in congratulating all in the leadership: mr. whitfield, mr. welch, mr. pallone, and the chairman of the full committee. mr. speaker, this is a modest but, most importantly, a bipartisan piece of legislation that combines three separate energy efficiency titles. this bill was passed by unanimous consent out of the senate just this last month. the bill before us today is also similar to h.r. 2126, which passed out of this house in the last session of congress on an overwhelmingly bipartisan vote of 375-36. the first title of this bill, madam speaker, is the better buildings act, which was introduced into the congress by my friends and colleagues, the gentleman from west virginia (mr. mckinley) and the gentleman from vermont (mr. welch). this title simply directs the general services administration to develop model leasing provisions and best practices to encourage commercial building [[page h2328]] owners and their tenants to invest in cost-effective energy efficiency measures. these model leasing provisions may then be used in federal leases and, along with the best practices, madam speaker, shall be made available to all state and local governments. additionally, section 103 directs the department of energy to conduct a study on the feasibility of significantly improving energy efficiency in commercial buildings through the design and construction of separate tenant spaces with high-performance energy efficiency measures. section 104 directs the epa to develop a ``tenant star'' program within the energy star program to promote energy efficiency in separate spaces leased by tenants in commercial buildings. this data can then be used to establish an energy star rating system to recognize tenants in commercial buildings that voluntarily achieve high levels of energy efficiency in separate spaces. madam speaker, title ii of this bill, the grid-enabled water heaters bill, was introduced by my colleague and my good friend, chairman whitfield, along with mr. welch, mr. latta, mr. loebsack, mr. cramer, and mr. doyle. this section establishes a separate energy efficiency standard for grid-enabled water heaters, which are used in utility demand and thermal storage programs. finally, madam speaker, title iii of this bill, the energy information for commercial buildings bill, which was introduced into congress by my friend and colleague, ms. castor of florida, requires federally leased buildings without energy star labels to benchmark and disclose their energy usage data in most cases. it also requires the department of energy to complete a study of best practices for and impacts of, one, state and local performance benchmarking and disclosure policies for commercial and multifamily buildings; and, two, utility policies for providing aggregated information to owners of multitenant buildings to assist with benchmarking programs. in addition, madam speaker, the doe is required to maintain a database to store and make available public energy- related information on commercial and multifamily buildings. madam speaker, in recent history, we have not been able to pass bipartisan energy legislation through both chambers and into law, so it is important that we move this bill to the president's desk so that we can demonstrate once again to the american people that this congress is still capable of functioning properly and legislating on their behalf. madam speaker, i urge all my colleagues to vote for this bill. mr. whitfield. madam speaker, i don't believe we have any additional speakers on our side, and i would like the opportunity to close, so i will reserve the balance of my time. mr. welch. madam speaker, i yield myself the balance of my time, and thank the gentleman from illinois (mr. rush) not just for his remarks on this bill, but for his leadership on this issue and other issues in the committee over the years. it is a good day when we can come together to do something constructive. this legislation finds that spot, energy efficiency, where we can join in embracing the enormous benefit of creating ways where homeowners and business owners of commercial buildings can figure out how to cut down on their bills. whatever fuel source they use, if they have got a lower bill, that is a good thing. to achieve that goal, we have to put americans to work, a lot of tradespeople who have got real skills and need a place to use them. they are the ones who retrofit these buildings, commercial buildings and homes. there is an incidental benefit: we reduce carbon emissions since we are using less fuel. this is tremendous. i want to thank the gentleman from kentucky (mr. whitfield) and the gentleman from michigan (mr. upton) for all the good work that they did. madam speaker, seeing no other speakers here, i yield back the balance of my time. mr. whitfield. madam speaker, i want to thank my colleagues on both sides of the aisle once again, specifically senators shaheen and portman, congressmen mckinley and welch, mr. upton and mr. pallone, and certainly mr. rush of illinois. all of them worked very diligently on this, and i know they are committed to efficiency. i want to just say one more time that i am specifically pleased that this legislation will stop the department of energy's regulation that would prohibit the manufacture of heat-resistant water heaters above 55 gallons. if that regulation had been allowed to continue, it would have cost the american public a lot more money going to the heat pump technology. so this legislation has stopped that. it is going to improve efficiency. i would urge all of my colleagues to support this legislation. i yield back the balance of my time. mr. pallone. madam speaker, i rise in support of s. 535, the energy efficiency improvement act of 2015. this is bipartisan legislation to promote energy efficiency that recently passed the senate by unanimous consent. s. 535--sponsored by senators portman and shaheen--is very similar to legislation reported last congress by the energy and commerce committee which passed the house with an overwhelmingly bipartisan vote. the bill addresses three main areas: energy efficient buildings, the grid- enabled water heaters, and energy benchmarking and information disclosure for federal buildings. title one is comprised of the better buildings act, bipartisan legislation sponsored in the house by reps. mckinley and welch. section 102 of the bill directs the general services administration to develop model leasing provisions and best practices to encourage commercial building owners and tenants to invest in cost-effective energy efficiency measures. it also ensures the model leasing provisions are available for use in federal leases and, along with the best practices, are available for state and local governments to also use. additionally, section 103 directs the department of energy (doe) to study improving energy efficiency in commercial buildings through design and construction of separate tenant spaces with high-performance energy efficiency measures. and, section 104 directs epa to develop a voluntary ``tenant star'' program within the energy star program to promote energy efficiency in separate spaces leased by tenants in commercial buildings and requires the agency to establish an energy star rating system to recognize tenants in commercial buildings that voluntarily achieve high levels of energy efficiency in separate spaces. title two establishes a separate energy efficiency standard for grid- enabled water heaters, which are used in utility demand-response and thermal storage programs. this is substantially the same language included in h.r. 906, legislation sponsored by chairman whitfield, mr. loebsack and others that was reported without dissent last week by our committee. in addition to establishing a separate standard for these water heaters, the provision requires those units to have a built-in activation lock to ensure their participation in such a program. finally, title three is essentially the same as h.r. 1867, legislation sponsored by reps. castor and kinzinger regarding energy information for commercial buildings. section 301 requires federally- leased buildings without energy star labels to benchmark and disclose their energy usage data except in certain circumstances. it also requires doe to complete a study of best practices regarding the impacts of state and local performance benchmarking and disclosure policies for commercial and multifamily buildings, as well as utility policies for providing aggregated information to owners of multitenant buildings to assist with benchmarking programs. in addition, it requires doe to maintain a database to store and make available public energy-related information on commercial and multifamily buildings. s. 535 is a stripped down version of the shaheen-portman efficiency legislation that has taken far too long to pass either chamber. however, i am disappointed that--unlike the original shaheen-portman bill--the proposal before us does not contain provisions authored by rep. eshoo that would address the efficiency of federal data centers. this is an area where we can easily see a great gain in efficiency relatively quickly and easily and her proposal has good bipartisan support. so, i have to note with concern the fact that something as useful and bipartisan as that federal data center efficiency language could not make it into the final package, despite being something that enjoys support on both sides. i hope that is an anomaly and not a harbinger of things to come, because we need to look at both sides of the equation--demand and supply, consumers and producers--to construct an energy policy for the future, one that is both economically and environmentally sustainable. and we need the resources of both sides of the aisle, both chambers of congress and all branches of government to get there. [[page h2329]] today, the obama administration released the first installment of its quadrennial energy review (qer) after a year-long, detailed examination of our energy needs. the qer is not exactly glamorous, but it is a serious, thoughtful and necessary look at how best to modernize america's energy infrastructure to create jobs and grow our economy in a manner that ensures our energy security and protects our environment. while i look forward to reviewing the complete report, i know that the progress updates we have received throughout the year have elicited positive and hopeful reactions from both sides of the aisle. that's why i'm particularly pleased that the administration is releasing this now while our committee and our counterparts in the other body are considering the components of a possible bipartisan energy bill. we must meet consumers' need for reliable, affordable and, just as importantly, clean energy--one of the nation's most pressing issues. the qer looks to the future of our economy to take full advantage of american innovation and the new sources of domestic energy supply that are transforming the nation's energy marketplace. just like efficiency, energy infrastructure--particularly with regard to size, scope, volume and siting--is critical to that endeavor. so, too, is the makeup--not just the volume--of the jobs that are created in modernizing that infrastructure; they must be jobs that are long-term, well-paying, and a gateway to the american dream for a diverse range of women and men. as chairman upton, chairman whitfield, ranking member rush and i continue to explore the potential for developing and moving a bipartisan energy bill during this congress, i hope we will take advantage of the qer, as well as the best consensus ideas on both sides of the aisle here in congress. that, to me, is the only successful path forward and it is the process embodied in the legislation before us today. i urge my colleagues to support both the legislation before us and continuing the effort to build a broad, bipartisan partnership on energy issues. only through this kind of cooperation can we enact energy legislation that truly powers our economy and our future. mr. peterson. madam speaker, i strongly support the energy efficiency improvement act, which will create a special category for large volume water heaters in the department of energy's new energy efficiency standards. without this bill, manufacturers would no longer be able to make large volume water heaters, which are commonly used in minnesota homes. this legislation is necessary because the doe failed to recognize the many benefits that large-volume water heaters provide, like bringing more renewable energy onto the grid, and allowing power plants to run more efficiently. the department then made a problematic rule even worse by pulling a waiver for this technology three weeks before the rule went final this month. this could have been where the story ended, but a diverse coalition of stakeholders had been working together to ensure that this technology can continue to be used. they know that using electricity in a smarter way not only saves consumers money, but it is also good for the environment and helps to stabilize the grid. that is why industry, environmental and energy efficiency stakeholders support these hot water heaters when used as part of demand response systems. i hope that with the passage of this bill, the department can get quickly reverse course, and move forward. this is good, reasonable legislation and i urge my colleagues to vote yes. the speaker pro tempore. the question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from kentucky (mr. whitfield) that the house suspend the rules and pass the bill, s. 535. the question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill was passed. a motion to reconsider was laid on the table. ____________________",49266
CREC-2015-04-21-pt1-PgH2332,CREC-2015-04-21,114,AUTHORIZING USE OF CAPITOL GROUNDS FOR GREATER WASHINGTON SOAP BOX DERBY,"[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 58 (Tuesday, April 21, 2015)] [House] [Pages H2332-H2333] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] AUTHORIZING USE OF CAPITOL GROUNDS FOR GREATER WASHINGTON SOAP BOX DERBY Mr. BARLETTA. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and agree to the concurrent resolution (H. Con. Res. 21) authorizing the use of the Capitol Grounds for the Greater Washington Soap Box Derby. The Clerk read the title of the concurrent resolution. The text of the concurrent resolution is as follows: H. Con. Res. 21 Resolved by the House of Representatives (the Senate concurring), SECTION 1. USE OF CAPITOL GROUNDS FOR SOAP BOX DERBY RACES. (a) In General.--The Greater Washington Soap Box Derby Association (in this resolution referred to as the ``sponsor'') shall be permitted to sponsor a public event, soap box derby races (in this resolution referred to as the ``event''), on the Capitol Grounds.

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Barletta) and the gentlewoman from Maryland (Ms. Edwards) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Pennsylvania. General Leave Mr. BARLETTA. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous material on H. Con. Res. 21. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Pennsylvania? There was no objection. Mr. BARLETTA. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. H. Con. Res. 21 authorizes the use of the Capitol Grounds for the annual Greater Washington Soap Box Derby on June 20. I want to thank the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. Hoyer) for introducing this resolution. He has been a longtime supporter of this event and the children involved each year. This event occurs annually on the Capitol Grounds. The soapbox derby encourages children to show off their dedication, work, and creativity as they compete for trophies. The winners of each division are qualified to compete in the national All-American Soap Box Derby held in Ohio. I support passage of this resolution. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Ms. EDWARDS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Representative Hoyer for, every year, introducing this resolution on behalf of the Washington regional delegation, and I rise as an original cosponsor. This annual competitive event encourages boys and girls, ages 9 through 16, to construct and operate their own [[Page H2333]] soapbox vehicles. The children that participate in these races come from all over the national capital region to participate in this really fun event. The derby has become quite a tradition in Washington. The D.C. metropolitan area has hosted this tradition for over the last 20 years. It provides a terrific opportunity for children to appreciate the workmanship necessary to build the vehicles and for the thrill of competition. Winners of this event go on to compete in the national competition in Akron, Ohio, where they compete against children from all over the world. On race day, every Greater Washington Soap Box Derby participant starts the race day with a chance to become a world champion. The Greater Washington Soap Box Derby organizers will work with the Architect of the Capitol and the Capitol Police to ensure the appropriate rules and regulations are in place and that the event remains free to the public. I support this terrific opportunity for the children of the Washington, D.C., metropolitan area, and I urge my colleagues to support the passage of this resolution. Mr. Speaker, I may have one additional speaker, but I would like to say that the children who participate in this event do so with a lot of creativity and ingenuity. They spend an entire year designing their vehicles, then they test their vehicles; they experiment with their friends, and then they put them out on race day for the soapbox derby. Now, I haven't had the privilege, Mr. Speaker, of participating in a soapbox derby, but they sure are fun to watch. Each year, Representative Hoyer makes sure that all of our delegation in the Metropolitan Washington region gathers to organize to make certain that children, from ages 9 through 16, are able to construct those vehicles, operate them themselves, and compete in the competition. As I have said before, Mr. Speaker, the great challenge is that, on race day, in the morning, all of the young people participating in the soapbox derby get up; and on that day, first thing in the morning, every single one of them is a champion, right up until the finish line. It is an exciting time for these young people. Of course, they go on to compete in a competition in Akron, Ohio, where there are kids gathered from all over the world who also do the same thing: build those soapboxes and participate. The Washington metropolitan region is really grateful to be able to host this soapbox derby and, of course, with the good graces of this Congress, to be able to do that on the Capitol Grounds with the cooperation of the Architect. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. Hoyer), our whip. Mr. HOYER. I thank the gentlewoman for yielding. I thank her for using some of the time so I could get up to the floor. I appreciate that very much. I also thank the gentleman from Pennsylvania for his leadership. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this resolution, which I have sponsored for many Congresses, to permit the Greater Washington Soap Box Derby Association to hold its annual race on the grounds of the United States Capitol. I am sure that both the chairman and the ranking member, Ms. Edwards, have already said that. This year will be the 74th soapbox derby, held on June 20. On that day, young people from around Washington, D.C., will gather at the Capitol for an event that is both fun, educational, and a teacher of responsibility and making things in America. The Greater Washington Soap Box Derby began in 1938 with Norman Rocca outmaneuvering 223 other racers to win the inaugural race. Each year since, dozens of boys and girls, ranging in age from 8 to 17, have competed in three divisions: stock, super stock, and masters. The winner in each will qualify to compete with racers from across the country in the All-American Soap Box Derby in Akron, Ohio. Called ``the greatest amateur racing event in the world,'' America's soapbox derbies bring parents, children, and friends and neighbors together. They teach hard work, leadership, sportsmanship, and pride of achievement. These values not only make great soapbox racers, but great American innovators and leaders in business, government, science, and the arts. Participants are often sponsored by community groups, police departments, fire departments, service organizations, and others who see future great promise in these children and teenagers. Mr. Speaker, I have been sponsoring this resolution for 24 years because I am so proud of America's soapbox derby tradition and proud of those from Maryland's Fifth District who participate. My district has celebrated a number of derby champions, including the winners from 2007, 2008, 2009, 2012, 2013, and 2014. My district is sort of like John Wooden's UCLA or the Duke Blue Devils, maybe, or the Maryland Terrapins. The young Marylanders who won the Greater Washington race in 2007 and 2008 went on to win the national championship. I want to thank my colleagues who have cosponsored this resolution: Representatives Chris Van Hollen; Gerry Connolly; Don Beyer; John Delaney; Eleanor Holmes Norton; Donna Edwards, who has brought this to the floor with the chair; and Barbara Comstock. I hope all Members of this House will join in supporting our resolution, and they will come to watch the soapbox derby in action on June 20. Again, I thank my colleague from Maryland (Ms. Edwards), for making sure that I got here so that I could, once again, say how proud I am of those who participate in the soapbox derby. Good luck to all of them. Mr. BARLETTA. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I just want to, once again, thank the gentleman from Maryland for his commitment to our youth and for, once again, introducing this great piece of legislation. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Ms. EDWARDS. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Barletta) that the House suspend the rules and agree to the concurrent resolution, H. Con. Res. 21. The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the concurrent resolution was agreed to. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 58 (Tuesday, April 21, 2015)] [House] [Pages H2332-H2333] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] AUTHORIZING USE OF CAPITOL GROUNDS FOR GREATER WASHINGTON SOAP BOX DERBY Mr. BARLETTA.

Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this resolution, which I have sponsored for many Congresses, to permit the Greater Washington Soap Box Derby Association to hold its annual race on the grounds of the United States Capitol. I am sure that both the chairman and the ranking member, Ms. Edwards, have already said that. This year will be the 74th soapbox derby, held on June 20. On that day, young people from around Washington, D.C., will gather at the Capitol for an event that is both fun, educational, and a teacher of responsibility and making things in America. The Greater Washington Soap Box Derby began in 1938 with Norman Rocca outmaneuvering 223 other racers to win the inaugural race. Each year since, dozens of boys and girls, ranging in age from 8 to 17, have competed in three divisions: stock, super stock, and masters. The winner in each will qualify to compete with racers from across the country in the All-American Soap Box Derby in Akron, Ohio. Called ``the greatest amateur racing event in the world,'' America's soapbox derbies bring parents, children, and friends and neighbors together. They teach hard work, leadership, sportsmanship, and pride of achievement. These values not only make great soapbox racers, but great American innovators and leaders in business, government, science, and the arts. Participants are often sponsored by community groups, police departments, fire departments, service organizations, and others who see future great promise in these children and teenagers. Mr. Speaker, I have been sponsoring this resolution for 24 years because I am so proud of America's soapbox derby tradition and proud of those from Maryland's Fifth District who participate. My district has celebrated a number of derby champions, including the winners from 2007, 2008, 2009, 2012, 2013, and 2014. My district is sort of like John Wooden's UCLA or the Duke Blue Devils, maybe, or the Maryland Terrapins. The young Marylanders who won the Greater Washington race in 2007 and 2008 went on to win the national championship. I want to thank my colleagues who have cosponsored this resolution: Representatives Chris Van Hollen; Gerry Connolly; Don Beyer; John Delaney; Eleanor Holmes Norton; Donna Edwards, who has brought this to the floor with the chair; and Barbara Comstock. I hope all Members of this House will join in supporting our resolution, and they will come to watch the soapbox derby in action on June 20. Again, I thank my colleague from Maryland (Ms. Edwards), for making sure that I got here so that I could, once again, say how proud I am of those who participate in the soapbox derby. Good luck to all of them. Mr. BARLETTA. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I just want to, once again, thank the gentleman from Maryland for his commitment to our youth and for, once again, introducing this great piece of legislation. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Ms. EDWARDS. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Barletta) that the House suspend the rules and agree to the concurrent resolution, H. Con. Res. 21. The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the concurrent resolution was agreed to. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. ____________________",package_114_99.csv,10390,10390,10458,"[congressional record volume 161, number 58 (tuesday, april 21, 2015)] [house] [pages h2332-h2333] from the congressional record online through the government publishing office [ www.gpo.gov ] authorizing use of capitol grounds for greater washington soap box derby mr. barletta. mr. speaker, i move to suspend the rules and agree to the concurrent resolution (h. con. res. 21) authorizing the use of the capitol grounds for the greater washington soap box derby. the clerk read the title of the concurrent resolution. the text of the concurrent resolution is as follows: h. con. res. 21 resolved by the house of representatives (the senate concurring), section 1. use of capitol grounds for soap box derby races.

they experiment with their friends, and then they put them out on race day for the soapbox derby. now, i haven't had the privilege, mr. speaker, of participating in a soapbox derby, but they sure are fun to watch. each year, representative hoyer makes sure that all of our delegation in the metropolitan washington region gathers to organize to make certain that children, from ages 9 through 16, are able to construct those vehicles, operate them themselves, and compete in the competition. as i have said before, mr. speaker, the great challenge is that, on race day, in the morning, all of the young people participating in the soapbox derby get up; and on that day, first thing in the morning, every single one of them is a champion, right up until the finish line. it is an exciting time for these young people. of course, they go on to compete in a competition in akron, ohio, where there are kids gathered from all over the world who also do the same thing: build those soapboxes and participate. the washington metropolitan region is really grateful to be able to host this soapbox derby and, of course, with the good graces of this congress, to be able to do that on the capitol grounds with the cooperation of the architect. mr. speaker, i yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from maryland (mr. hoyer), our whip. mr. hoyer. i thank the gentlewoman for yielding. i thank her for using some of the time so i could get up to the floor. i appreciate that very much. i also thank the gentleman from pennsylvania for his leadership. mr. speaker, i rise in support of this resolution, which i have sponsored for many congresses, to permit the greater washington soap box derby association to hold its annual race on the grounds of the united states capitol. i am sure that both the chairman and the ranking member, ms. edwards, have already said that. this year will be the 74th soapbox derby, held on june 20. on that day, young people from around washington, d.c., will gather at the capitol for an event that is both fun, educational, and a teacher of responsibility and making things in america. the greater washington soap box derby began in 1938 with norman rocca outmaneuvering 223 other racers to win the inaugural race. each year since, dozens of boys and girls, ranging in age from 8 to 17, have competed in three divisions: stock, super stock, and masters. the winner in each will qualify to compete with racers from across the country in the all-american soap box derby in akron, ohio. called ``the greatest amateur racing event in the world,'' america's soapbox derbies bring parents, children, and friends and neighbors together. they teach hard work, leadership, sportsmanship, and pride of achievement. these values not only make great soapbox racers, but great american innovators and leaders in business, government, science, and the arts. participants are often sponsored by community groups, police departments, fire departments, service organizations, and others who see future great promise in these children and teenagers. mr. speaker, i have been sponsoring this resolution for 24 years because i am so proud of america's soapbox derby tradition and proud of those from maryland's fifth district who participate. my district has celebrated a number of derby champions, including the winners from 2007, 2008, 2009, 2012, 2013, and 2014. my district is sort of like john wooden's ucla or the duke blue devils, maybe, or the maryland terrapins. the young marylanders who won the greater washington race in 2007 and 2008 went on to win the national championship. i want to thank my colleagues who have cosponsored this resolution: representatives chris van hollen;

CREC-2015-04-21-pt1-PgH2333,CREC-2015-04-21,114,AUTHORIZING USE OF CAPITOL GROUNDS FOR NATIONAL PEACE OFFICERS MEMORIAL SERVICE,"[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 58 (Tuesday, April 21, 2015)] [House] [Pages H2333-H2335] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] AUTHORIZING USE OF CAPITOL GROUNDS FOR NATIONAL PEACE OFFICERS MEMORIAL SERVICE Mr. BARLETTA. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and agree to the concurrent resolution (H. Con. Res. 25) authorizing the use of the Capitol Grounds for the National Peace Officers Memorial Service and the National Honor Guard and Pipe Band Exhibition. The Clerk read the title of the concurrent resolution. The text of the concurrent resolution is as follows: H. Con. Res. 25 Resolved by the House of Representatives (the Senate concurring), SECTION 1. USE OF THE CAPITOL GROUNDS FOR NATIONAL PEACE OFFICERS MEMORIAL SERVICE. (a) In General.--The Grand Lodge of the Fraternal Order of Police and its auxiliary shall be permitted to sponsor a public event, the 34th Annual National Peace Officers Memorial Service (in this resolution referred to as the ``Memorial Service''), on the Capitol Grounds, in order to honor the law enforcement officers who died in the line of duty during 2014. (b) Date of Memorial Service.--The Memorial Service shall be held on May 15, 2015, or on such other date as the Speaker of the House of Representatives and the Committee on Rules and Administration of the Senate jointly designate, with preparation for the event to begin on May 12, 2015. SEC. 2. USE OF THE CAPITOL GROUNDS FOR NATIONAL HONOR GUARD AND PIPE BAND EXHIBITION.

(b) Date of Exhibition.--The exhibition shall be held on May 14, 2015, or on such [[Page H2334]] other date as the Speaker of the House of Representatives and the Committee on Rules and Administration of the Senate jointly designate. SEC. 3. TERMS AND CONDITIONS.

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Barletta) and the gentlewoman from Maryland (Ms. Edwards) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Pennsylvania. {time} 1630 General Leave Mr. BARLETTA. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous materials on H. Con. Res. 25. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Pennsylvania? There was no objection. Mr. BARLETTA. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. H. Con. Res. 25 authorizes the use of the Capitol Grounds for the annual National Peace Officers Memorial Service and a National Honor Guard and Pipe Band Exhibition. I am pleased to be the sponsor of this resolution, along with the gentleman from Indiana (Mr. Carson). These events are held each year as part of Police Week, to honor the men and women who sacrificed their lives in the line of duty. This year, over 125 Federal, State, and local law enforcement officers will be honored for their ultimate sacrifice: giving their lives in the line of duty. Four of these officers are from Pennsylvania, including one from near my district, Corporal Bryon Dickson II of the Pennsylvania State Police. Corporal Dickson was killed in September of 2014 after he and Trooper Alex Douglass were shot during an ambush targeting police officers outside the Blooming Grove barracks in northeastern Pennsylvania. The suspect, Eric Frein, cowardly hid in the woods while local, State, and Federal law enforcement searched for him. He was finally captured after a 7-week manhunt. Corporal Dickson was a United States Marine Corps veteran and served with the Pennsylvania State Police for 7 years. He left behind a wife and two young sons. Three other Pennsylvania officers will also be honored, including Officer Richard Champion of the Perryopolis Borough Police Department, who was killed during a vehicle pursuit in December; Trooper David Kedra of the Pennsylvania State Police, who was accidentally shot during a training exercise; and Sergeant Sheryl Pierce of the South Londonderry Township Police Department, who died from a deadly illness contracted while carrying out her duties. The sacrifices of these officers and the sacrifices of those like them should not be forgotten. These tragic episodes should serve to remind all citizens of the dangerous jobs our men and women of law enforcement courageously volunteer for. They put their lives on the line to protect us daily, and for that we should always remain grateful. I support passage of this resolution, and I reserve the balance of my time. Ms. EDWARDS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, H. Con. Res. 25 authorizes the use of the Capitol Grounds for the annual National Peace Officers Memorial Service on May 15 and a National Honor Guard and Pipe Band Exhibition. Both events will be coordinated with the Architect of the Capitol and the Capitol Police. The National Peace Officers Memorial will honor law enforcement officers who were killed in the line of duty in 2014. According to preliminary estimates, over 125 law enforcement officers were killed in the line of duty just this last year, a 24 percent increase over the 102 officers killed in 2013. Firearms-related incidents were the leading cause of death among law enforcement officers in 2014, with 50 officers slain by firearms. The second leading cause of death among law enforcement officers was traffic-related fatalities, with 49 officers killed in that manner. In the State of Maryland, there was one law enforcement officer killed in the line of duty in 2014, Officer Jamel Claggett from the Charles County Sheriff's Office. Mr. Speaker, I know that we are honoring and recognizing peace officers who were killed in the line of duty in 2014, but I would like to make a personal note that in the State of Maryland alone, just since the beginning of this year, three officers were killed and one police dog was also killed in the line of duty: Just a couple of weeks ago, Federal Protective Service Officer Lawrence Buckner was killed outside of the Census Bureau on April 9; just a few weeks before that, Prince George's County Police Officer Brennan Rabain was killed in an automobile accident on March 7; just prior to that, in January, a police officer from Baltimore, Craig Chandler, was also killed in a vehicle accident; a canine, Bella, from the Maryland Division of Correction in Maryland was killed in a fire incident also just a few weeks ago. It is a stark reminder of the jeopardy that officers place themselves in and a reminder of what they do every single day to protect each and every one of us. I have such a deep admiration and appreciation for the fallen officers who will be honored on May 15 and the ultimate sacrifices they have made on behalf of all of our local communities. I urge Members to join me in supporting this tribute to our law enforcement officers across the country who died in the line of duty in 2014. I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. BARLETTA. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H. Con. Res. 25, which authorizes the use of the Capitol grounds for the National Peace Officers Memorial Service and the National Honor Guard and Pipe Band Exhibition. It is altogether fitting and proper that we do this. The National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial is the nation's monument to law enforcement officers who have died in the line of duty. Dedicated on October 15, 1991, the Memorial honors federal, state and local law enforcement officers who have made the ultimate sacrifice for the safety and protection of our nation and its people. Carved on its walls are the names of 20,538 officers who have been killed in the line of duty throughout U.S. history, dating back to the first known death in 1791. Added to the Wall this year will be the names of the 117 police officers killed in the line of duty in 2014. Mr. Speaker, enshrined on the Memorial Wall of Honor also are the names of 1,695 fallen peace officers from the state of Texas, the most of any state, including 114 members of the Houston Police Department who gave their lives to keep their city safe. I ask unanimous consent to include a list of these fallen heroes from Houston, Texas. Mr. Speaker, today there are more than 900,000 law enforcement personnel serving the people of our country, the highest amount ever. About 12 percent of them are female. These brave men and women risk their lives to keep the peace and keep us safe but they are too often taken by the violence they are working to prevent. Every year, a law enforcement officer is killed somewhere in the United States every 60 hours, and there are also 58,930 assaults against our law officers each year, resulting in 15,404 injuries. Mr. Speaker, as a member of the Law Enforcement Caucus I am proud to represent the people of the 18th Congressional District of Texas in paying tribute to the 117 fallen heroes who will be joining the 20,538 gallant [[Page H2335]] men and women who gave the last full measure of devotion to the communities they took an oath to protect and serve. Mr. Speaker, I ask for a moment of silence in memory of the officers whose names will be added to the National Peace Officers Memorial Wall of Honor.

Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and agree to the concurrent resolution (H. Con. Res. 25) authorizing the use of the Capitol Grounds for the National Peace Officers Memorial Service and the National Honor Guard and Pipe Band Exhibition. The Clerk read the title of the concurrent resolution. The text of the concurrent resolution is as follows: H. Con. Res. 25 Resolved by the House of Representatives (the Senate concurring), SECTION 1. USE OF THE CAPITOL GROUNDS FOR NATIONAL PEACE OFFICERS MEMORIAL SERVICE. (a) In General.--The Grand Lodge of the Fraternal Order of Police and its auxiliary shall be permitted to sponsor a public event, the 34th Annual National Peace Officers Memorial Service (in this resolution referred to as the ``Memorial Service''), on the Capitol Grounds, in order to honor the law enforcement officers who died in the line of duty during 2014. (b) Date of Memorial Service.--The Memorial Service shall be held on May 15, 2015, or on such other date as the Speaker of the House of Representatives and the Committee on Rules and Administration of the Senate jointly designate, with preparation for the event to begin on May 12, 2015. SEC. 2. USE OF THE CAPITOL GROUNDS FOR NATIONAL HONOR GUARD AND PIPE BAND EXHIBITION. (a) In General.--The Grand Lodge of the Fraternal Order of Police and its auxiliary shall be permitted to sponsor a public event, the National Honor Guard and Pipe Band Exhibition (in this resolution referred to as the ``Exhibition''), on the Capitol Grounds, in order to allow law enforcement representatives to exhibit their ability to demonstrate Honor Guard programs and provide for a bag pipe exhibition. (b) Date of Exhibition.--The exhibition shall be held on May 14, 2015, or on such [[Page H2334]] other date as the Speaker of the House of Representatives and the Committee on Rules and Administration of the Senate jointly designate. SEC. 3. TERMS AND CONDITIONS. (a) In General.--Under conditions to be prescribed by the Architect of the Capitol and the Capitol Police Board, the event shall be-- (1) free of admission charge and open to the public; and (2) arranged not to interfere with the needs of Congress.

SEC. 4. EVENT PREPARATIONS. Subject to the approval of the Architect of the Capitol, the sponsors referred to in section 3(b) are authorized to erect upon the Capitol Grounds such stage, sound amplification devices, and other related structures and equipment, as may be required for the Memorial Service and Exhibition. SEC. 5. ENFORCEMENT OF RESTRICTIONS. The Capitol Police Board shall provide for enforcement of the restrictions contained in section 5104(c) of title 40, United States Code, concerning sales, advertisements, displays, and solicitations on the Capitol Grounds, as well as other restrictions applicable to the Capitol Grounds, in connection with the events. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Barletta) and the gentlewoman from Maryland (Ms. Edwards) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Pennsylvania. {time} 1630 General Leave Mr. BARLETTA. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous materials on H. Con. Res. 25. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Pennsylvania? There was no objection. Mr. BARLETTA. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. H. Con. Res. 25 authorizes the use of the Capitol Grounds for the annual National Peace Officers Memorial Service and a National Honor Guard and Pipe Band Exhibition. I am pleased to be the sponsor of this resolution, along with the gentleman from Indiana (Mr. Carson). These events are held each year as part of Police Week, to honor the men and women who sacrificed their lives in the line of duty. This year, over 125 Federal, State, and local law enforcement officers will be honored for their ultimate sacrifice: giving their lives in the line of duty. Four of these officers are from Pennsylvania, including one from near my district, Corporal Bryon Dickson II of the Pennsylvania State Police. Corporal Dickson was killed in September of 2014 after he and Trooper Alex Douglass were shot during an ambush targeting police officers outside the Blooming Grove barracks in northeastern Pennsylvania. The suspect, Eric Frein, cowardly hid in the woods while local, State, and Federal law enforcement searched for him. He was finally captured after a 7-week manhunt. Corporal Dickson was a United States Marine Corps veteran and served with the Pennsylvania State Police for 7 years. He left behind a wife and two young sons. Three other Pennsylvania officers will also be honored, including Officer Richard Champion of the Perryopolis Borough Police Department, who was killed during a vehicle pursuit in December; Trooper David Kedra of the Pennsylvania State Police, who was accidentally shot during a training exercise; and Sergeant Sheryl Pierce of the South Londonderry Township Police Department, who died from a deadly illness contracted while carrying out her duties. The sacrifices of these officers and the sacrifices of those like them should not be forgotten. These tragic episodes should serve to remind all citizens of the dangerous jobs our men and women of law enforcement courageously volunteer for. They put their lives on the line to protect us daily, and for that we should always remain grateful. I support passage of this resolution, and I reserve the balance of my time. Ms. EDWARDS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, H. Con. Res. 25 authorizes the use of the Capitol Grounds for the annual National Peace Officers Memorial Service on May 15 and a National Honor Guard and Pipe Band Exhibition. Both events will be coordinated with the Architect of the Capitol and the Capitol Police. The National Peace Officers Memorial will honor law enforcement officers who were killed in the line of duty in 2014. According to preliminary estimates, over 125 law enforcement officers were killed in the line of duty just this last year, a 24 percent increase over the 102 officers killed in 2013. Firearms-related incidents were the leading cause of death among law enforcement officers in 2014, with 50 officers slain by firearms. The second leading cause of death among law enforcement officers was traffic-related fatalities, with 49 officers killed in that manner. In the State of Maryland, there was one law enforcement officer killed in the line of duty in 2014, Officer Jamel Claggett from the Charles County Sheriff's Office. Mr. Speaker, I know that we are honoring and recognizing peace officers who were killed in the line of duty in 2014, but I would like to make a personal note that in the State of Maryland alone, just since the beginning of this year, three officers were killed and one police dog was also killed in the line of duty: Just a couple of weeks ago, Federal Protective Service Officer Lawrence Buckner was killed outside of the Census Bureau on April 9; just a few weeks before that, Prince George's County Police Officer Brennan Rabain was killed in an automobile accident on March 7; just prior to that, in January, a police officer from Baltimore, Craig Chandler, was also killed in a vehicle accident; a canine, Bella, from the Maryland Division of Correction in Maryland was killed in a fire incident also just a few weeks ago. It is a stark reminder of the jeopardy that officers place themselves in and a reminder of what they do every single day to protect each and every one of us. I have such a deep admiration and appreciation for the fallen officers who will be honored on May 15 and the ultimate sacrifices they have made on behalf of all of our local communities. I urge Members to join me in supporting this tribute to our law enforcement officers across the country who died in the line of duty in 2014. I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. BARLETTA. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H. Con. Res. 25, which authorizes the use of the Capitol grounds for the National Peace Officers Memorial Service and the National Honor Guard and Pipe Band Exhibition. It is altogether fitting and proper that we do this. The National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial is the nation's monument to law enforcement officers who have died in the line of duty. Dedicated on October 15, 1991, the Memorial honors federal, state and local law enforcement officers who have made the ultimate sacrifice for the safety and protection of our nation and its people. Carved on its walls are the names of 20,538 officers who have been killed in the line of duty throughout U.S. history, dating back to the first known death in 1791. Added to the Wall this year will be the names of the 117 police officers killed in the line of duty in 2014. Mr. Speaker, enshrined on the Memorial Wall of Honor also are the names of 1,695 fallen peace officers from the state of Texas, the most of any state, including 114 members of the Houston Police Department who gave their lives to keep their city safe. I ask unanimous consent to include a list of these fallen heroes from Houston, Texas. Mr. Speaker, today there are more than 900,000 law enforcement personnel serving the people of our country, the highest amount ever. About 12 percent of them are female. These brave men and women risk their lives to keep the peace and keep us safe but they are too often taken by the violence they are working to prevent. Every year, a law enforcement officer is killed somewhere in the United States every 60 hours, and there are also 58,930 assaults against our law officers each year, resulting in 15,404 injuries. Mr. Speaker, as a member of the Law Enforcement Caucus I am proud to represent the people of the 18th Congressional District of Texas in paying tribute to the 117 fallen heroes who will be joining the 20,538 gallant [[Page H2335]] men and women who gave the last full measure of devotion to the communities they took an oath to protect and serve. Mr. Speaker, I ask for a moment of silence in memory of the officers whose names will be added to the National Peace Officers Memorial Wall of Honor.

(a) in general.--the grand lodge of the fraternal order of police and its auxiliary shall be permitted to sponsor a public event, the 34th annual national peace officers memorial service (in this resolution referred to as the ``memorial service''), on the capitol grounds, in order to honor the law enforcement officers who died in the line of duty during 2014. (b) date of memorial service.--the memorial service shall be held on may 15, 2015, or on such other date as the speaker of the house of representatives and the committee on rules and administration of the senate jointly designate, with preparation for the event to begin on may 12, 2015. sec. 2. use of the capitol grounds for national honor guard and pipe band exhibition. (a) in general.--the grand lodge of the fraternal order of police and its auxiliary shall be permitted to sponsor a public event, the national honor guard and pipe band exhibition (in this resolution referred to as the ``exhibition''), on the capitol grounds, in order to allow law enforcement representatives to exhibit their ability to demonstrate honor guard programs and provide for a bag pipe exhibition. (b) date of exhibition.--the exhibition shall be held on may 14, 2015, or on such [[page h2334]] other date as the speaker of the house of representatives and the committee on rules and administration of the senate jointly designate. sec. 3. terms and conditions.

events. sec. 4. event preparations. subject to the approval of the architect of the capitol, the sponsors referred to in section 3(b) are authorized to erect upon the capitol grounds such stage, sound amplification devices, and other related structures and equipment, as may be required for the memorial service and exhibition. sec. 5. enforcement of restrictions. the capitol police board shall provide for enforcement of the restrictions contained in section 5104(c) of title 40, united states code, concerning sales, advertisements, displays, and solicitations on the capitol grounds, as well as other restrictions applicable to the capitol grounds, in connection with the events. the speaker pro tempore. pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from pennsylvania (mr. barletta) and the gentlewoman from maryland (ms. edwards) each will control 20 minutes. the chair recognizes the gentleman from pennsylvania. {time} 1630 general leave mr. barletta. mr. speaker, i ask unanimous consent that all members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous materials on h. con. res. 25. the speaker pro tempore. is there objection to the request of the gentleman from pennsylvania? there was no objection. mr. barletta. mr. speaker, i yield myself such time as i may consume. h. con. res. 25 authorizes the use of the capitol grounds for the annual national peace officers memorial service and a national honor guard and pipe band exhibition. i am pleased to be the sponsor of this resolution, along with the gentleman from indiana (mr. carson). these events are held each year as part of police week, to honor the men and women who sacrificed their lives in the line of duty. this year, over 125 federal, state, and local law enforcement officers will be honored for their ultimate sacrifice: giving their lives in the line of duty. four of these officers are from pennsylvania, including one from near my district, corporal bryon dickson ii of the pennsylvania state police. corporal dickson was killed in september of 2014 after he and trooper alex douglass were shot during an ambush targeting police officers outside the blooming grove barracks in northeastern pennsylvania. the suspect, eric frein, cowardly hid in the woods while local, state, and federal law enforcement searched for him. he was finally captured after a 7-week manhunt. corporal dickson was a united states marine corps veteran and served with the pennsylvania state police for 7 years. he left behind a wife and two young sons. three other pennsylvania officers will also be honored, including officer richard champion of the perryopolis borough police department, who was killed during a vehicle pursuit in december; trooper david kedra of the pennsylvania state police, who was accidentally shot during a training exercise; and sergeant sheryl pierce of the south londonderry township police department, who died from a deadly illness contracted while carrying out her duties. the sacrifices of these officers and the sacrifices of those like them should not be forgotten. these tragic episodes should serve to remind all citizens of the dangerous jobs our men and women of law enforcement courageously volunteer for. they put their lives on the line to protect us daily, and for that we should always remain grateful. i support passage of this resolution, and i reserve the balance of my time. ms. edwards. mr. speaker, i yield myself such time as i may consume. mr. speaker, h. con. res. 25 authorizes the use of the capitol grounds for the annual national peace officers memorial service on may 15 and a national honor guard and pipe band exhibition. both events will be coordinated with the architect of the capitol and the capitol police. the national peace officers memorial will honor law enforcement officers who were killed in the line of duty in 2014. according to preliminary estimates, over 125 law enforcement officers were killed in the line of duty just this last year, a 24 percent increase over the 102 officers killed in 2013. firearms-related incidents were the leading cause of death among law enforcement officers in 2014, with 50 officers slain by firearms. the second leading cause of death among law enforcement officers was traffic-related fatalities, with 49 officers killed in that manner. in the state of maryland, there was one law enforcement officer killed in the line of duty in 2014, officer jamel claggett from the charles county sheriff's office. mr. speaker, i know that we are honoring and recognizing peace officers who were killed in the line of duty in 2014, but i would like to make a personal note that in the state of maryland alone, just since the beginning of this year, three officers were killed and one police dog was also killed in the line of duty: just a couple of weeks ago, federal protective service officer lawrence buckner was killed outside of the census bureau on april 9; just a few weeks before that, prince george's county police officer brennan rabain was killed in an automobile accident on march 7; just prior to that, in january, a police officer from baltimore, craig chandler, was also killed in a vehicle accident; a canine, bella, from the maryland division of correction in maryland was killed in a fire incident also just a few weeks ago. it is a stark reminder of the jeopardy that officers place themselves in and a reminder of what they do every single day to protect each and every one of us. i have such a deep admiration and appreciation for the fallen officers who will be honored on may 15 and the ultimate sacrifices they have made on behalf of all of our local communities. i urge members to join me in supporting this tribute to our law enforcement officers across the country who died in the line of duty in 2014. i yield back the balance of my time. mr. barletta. mr. speaker, i yield back the balance of my time. ms. jackson lee. mr. speaker, i rise in strong support of h. con. res. 25, which authorizes the use of the capitol grounds for the national peace officers memorial service and the national honor guard and pipe band exhibition. it is altogether fitting and proper that we do this. the national law enforcement officers memorial is the nation's monument to law enforcement officers who have died in the line of duty. dedicated on october 15, 1991, the memorial honors federal, state and local law enforcement officers who have made the ultimate sacrifice for the safety and protection of our nation and its people. carved on its walls are the names of 20,538 officers who have been killed in the line of duty throughout u.s. history, dating back to the first known death in 1791. added to the wall this year will be the names of the 117 police officers killed in the line of duty in 2014. mr. speaker, enshrined on the memorial wall of honor also are the names of 1,695 fallen peace officers from the state of texas, the most of any state, including 114 members of the houston police department who gave their lives to keep their city safe. i ask unanimous consent to include a list of these fallen heroes from houston, texas. mr. speaker, today there are more than 900,000 law enforcement personnel serving the people of our country, the highest amount ever. about 12 percent of them are female. these brave men and women risk their lives to keep the peace and keep us safe but they are too often taken by the violence they are working to prevent. every year, a law enforcement officer is killed somewhere in the united states every 60 hours, and there are also 58,930 assaults against our law officers each year, resulting in 15,404 injuries. mr. speaker, as a member of the law enforcement caucus i am proud to represent the people of the 18th congressional district of texas in paying tribute to the 117 fallen heroes who will be joining the 20,538 gallant [[page h2335]] men and women who gave the last full measure of devotion to the communities they took an oath to protect and serve. mr. speaker, i ask for a moment of silence in memory of the officers whose names will be added to the national peace officers memorial wall of honor. houston law enforcement officers memorialized on the wall of honor 1. timothy scott abernethy, end of watch: december 7, 2008, houston, texas, p.d. 2.

CREC-2015-04-21-pt1-PgH2335,CREC-2015-04-21,114,BUREAU OF CONSUMER FINANCIAL PROTECTION ADVISORY BOARDS ACT,"[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 58 (Tuesday, April 21, 2015)] [House] [Pages H2335-H2343] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] BUREAU OF CONSUMER FINANCIAL PROTECTION ADVISORY BOARDS ACT general leave Mr. NEUGEBAUER. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and submit extraneous materials on the bill, H.R. 1195, to amend the Consumer Financial Protection Act of 2010 to establish advisory boards, and for other purposes. The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Pittenger). Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Texas? There was no objection. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to House Resolution 200 and rule XVIII, the Chair declares the House in the Committee of the Whole House on the state of the Union for the consideration of the bill, H.R. 1195. The Chair appoints the gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. Duncan) to preside over the Committee of the Whole. {time} 1637 In the Committee of the Whole Accordingly, the House resolved itself into the Committee of the Whole House on the state of the Union for the consideration of the bill (H.R. 1195) to amend the Consumer Financial Protection Act of 2010 to establish advisory boards, and for other purposes, with Mr. Duncan of Tennessee in the chair. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The CHAIR. Pursuant to the rule, the bill is considered read the first time. The gentleman from Texas (Mr. Neugebauer) and the gentlewoman from California (Ms. Maxine Waters) each will control 30 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Texas. Mr. NEUGEBAUER. Mr. Chairman, today the House considers H.R. 1195, the Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection Advisory Boards Act. This bill is essential to provide small businesses a voice in the regulatory process and to help ensure community banks and credit unions continue to have a voice at the CFPB going forward. Small businesses are the backbone of our economy, yet our regulatory system silences these hard-working Americans. Regulations meant for large corporations trickle down and have disproportionate impacts on Main Street businesses. We must remember that these businesses are, by and large, owned and operated by our neighbors and friends. They represent a life's work and a vision of the American Dream. The CFPB was created to protect consumers in the financial marketplace, and it would seem impossible to responsibly undertake this endeavor of protecting the American consumer without consulting institutions that are most closely associated with the American consumer: small businesses and community financial institutions. H.R. 1195 is a straightforward and bipartisan piece of legislation. It would amend the Dodd-Frank Act to create a small business advisory board to advise the CFPB. This bill would also codify two other advisory committees created by Director Cordray: the Credit Union Advisory Council and the Community Bank Advisory Council. [[Page H2336]] Under H.R. 1195, each board or council would advise the CFPB regarding concerns of its established membership. The Director of the CFPB would be required to appoint at least 15, but not more than 20, members to each board or council. This bill is publicly supported by the following organizations: the Credit Union National Association, the National Association of Federal Credit Unions, the Texas Land Title Association, the American Land Title Association, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the Independent Community Bankers of America. Mr. Chairman, this is a truly a commonsense and bipartisan bill. Last Congress, an identical piece of legislation passed the House by voice vote. This Congress, H.R. 1195 passed out of the committee by a vote of 53-5. The ranking member, who is with us today, has voted for this bill two times, yet we find ourselves here today debating the merits of providing a voice for small businesses and community financial institutions. This week, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton was questioned about the health of American businesses. She said she was ``surprised'' to learn that small businesses were struggling. Mr. Chairman, H.R. 1195 is just one small and commonsense step to providing a voice for our small businesses and community financial institutions in the regulatory process. It helps ensure that politicians and Washington bureaucrats aren't surprised to learn of the plight and struggles of these Main Street pillars. It gives these hard- working Americans a voice and a seat at the table. Now, Democrats are going to say that our disagreement is with how the bill is paid for. Well, let me address that for a minute. House rules require that any increase in mandatory spending be offset with a reduction in mandatory spending elsewhere. The CBO says H.R. 1195 will cost $9 million, in total, over the next 10 years. Republicans simply reduced the maximum amount that the CFPB can draw from the Fed over the same 10-year period to offset this cost. To put this into perspective, the CFPB, by statute, can draw approximately $6.7 billion over the next 10 years. This offset that we are debating today amounts to 0.1 percent of this amount. If Democrats really want to claim that a 0.1 percent reduction in the $6.7 billion that CFPB can spend over the next decade really threatens the Bureau's mission, perhaps it is time to examine the Bureau's current spending practices. I am quite confident that we can debate spending problems at the CFPB for the rest of the afternoon, should we need to. Just to reiterate, H.R. 1195 will not cut spending on consumer protection. Let me repeat that. Just to reiterate, H.R. 1195 will not cut spending on consumer protection. It will provide a voice for small businesses. Let's help our small businesses succeed. Let's help Main Street prosper, and let's vote today to move H.R. 1195 forward. With that, I reserve the balance of my time. Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Chairman, I want the Members of the House to pay very close attention to this bill today because this bill represents tricks and games in ways that people don't often understand. But this is a prime example of how you take a good idea and mess it up. So I rise today in opposition to H.R. 1195, a measure that is, again, a shining example of how far Republicans will go to squander compromise, consensus, and good faith to advance an ideological anticonsumer agenda. The bill before us today is just the latest instance of Financial Services Committee Republicans snatching defeat from the jaws of victory. {time} 1645 It makes clear their commitment to do all they can to undercut the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. Let me say that again. They have spent so much time--amendment after amendment, attempt after attempt-- to try and gut and dismantle the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, and they have gone so far with this bill to undermine our efforts to be of assistance to small businesses and include them in a stronger advisory way to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau because they hate the Bureau so much. Well, again, they do all they can to undercut this Bureau, an agency with an extraordinary record of success protecting consumers, reining in bad actors, and ensuring that we do not return to the predatory practices that put this Nation on the verge of economic collapse less than 10 years ago. Mr. Chairman, as originally written, H.R. 1195 was a good and decent measure offered by my colleague, Mr. Heck from Washington State, and, again, I applaud him for his leadership. The straightforward proposal offered by Mr. Heck would codify two of the advisory boards that the CFPB voluntarily created related to community banks and credit unions, while also creating a new small business advisory board for small businesses. Along with many other requirements of the Bureau, these boards create additional avenues for input from the entities that they have been given the power to regulate under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform Act. So here is what we are talking about. The Bureau itself had created a number of advisory committees. Mr. Heck saw room for strengthening the ability of small businesses to have an advisory role, and so he created this bill. But, because, again, my friends on the opposite side of the aisle, the Republicans, hate the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau so much, they decided that they were going to play tricks and games and create an opportunity to reduce the funding so they could try and limit the Bureau's ability to do its work by adding all of these amendments. I am going to point out the tricks of these amendments as we go along here today. So in a rare show of bipartisanship, the Financial Services Committee passed H.R. 1195 by a vote of 53-5. Many of my Democratic colleagues supported the proposal, just as we have supported the many efforts of the CFPB to be responsive to the unique needs of small businesses, community banks, and credit unions. But, as usual, that bipartisanship was short-lived, as Chairman Hensarling added an amendment designed to pay for this measure by undermining the CFPB's authority and independent funding. I find it ironic that this House has determined now is the time to offset the cost of legislation. Don't forget, we have the pay-for kings and queens on that side of the aisle. They said, they worked for, and they made a big issue that everything must be paid for, except when they decide to try and slip something in that they don't pay for. And they have done that on this floor with some of these bills that we will be talking about. But with this bill, they decided a new kind of trick; and that is, let's find a way to take it from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau because not only will this pay for it, but this will reduce their ability to do their job paying for other things. Just last week, the House majority voted to repeal the estate tax without paying for it at a staggering cost of $269 billion. At a time when far too many Americans are struggling with stagnant wages and historic income inequality, my Republican counterparts seem all too willing to add to the Nation's deficit in order to pass giveaways for the richest 0.2 percent of Americans. Yet when it comes to a reasonable bill to enhance the voice of small businesses, community banks, and credit unions, which they claim to care so much about, the Republicans insist that the only way to pass the legislation is by cutting the CFPB--an agency that 84 percent of small-business owners support, according to polling from the small- business majority. The truth of the matter is that, after several years of attempting to cap CFPB funding, the Republicans have chosen to transform Mr. Heck's bill into a vehicle to make drastic cuts to the CFPB's budget. While my colleagues on the other side of the aisle will claim otherwise, the CFPB itself estimates Chairman Hensarling's poison pill amendment will cut its budget by about $45 million over the next 5 years and by $100 million over the next 10 years, capping it substantially less than the amount that they are currently able to request. [[Page H2337]] That means this vote is one to weaken an agency with the explicit mission of standing up for consumers and taxpayers who have been subject to the deceptive practices of unscrupulous corporations. The chairman's amendment guarantees that this otherwise bipartisan proposal will never become law, garnering significant opposition in the Senate and a veto threat from the Obama administration, who said this measure was ``solely intended to impede the CFPB's ability to carry out its mission of protecting consumers in the financial markets,'' and further, they said, ``could result in, among other things, undermining critical protections for families from abusive and predatory financial products.'' Mr. Chairman, Republicans could have chosen any number of offsets to account for the cost of this proposal or, as they have done so many times before, waive their CutGo rules. Make no mistake about the intent of the Hensarling amendment. It is designed to back Democrats into a corner by attaching an unacceptable provision cutting CFPB's budget to a proposal that Democrats supported in committee. The important work of the CFPB will not be undermined on our watch, and this backdoor attempt to cut its budget sets a dangerous precedent of using bipartisan bills as a way to sneak through measures that undermine the Bureau's independence and its ability to protect consumers. Mr. Chairman, we don't understand on this side of the aisle why it is that our Republican friends hate the CFPB so much and have done so much to undermine them, to undercut them, and to try to reduce their funding. They know as well as we know that prior to the establishment of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau that we put into Dodd- Frank's reforms, consumers had no protections in the Government of the United States of America. Our regulatory agencies were not doing their jobs. They say they were focused on safety and soundness. But who was working for the consumers? Nobody. And so now we have a Bureau working for the consumers that is doing a wonderful job. And here we have every attempt that you can dream of, every scheme that you can think of, being levied by our friends on the opposite side of the aisle because they want to kill the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. As I have said, this is not going to happen on our watch. They can try any trick that they want. We are on to it. With that, Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. NEUGEBAUER. Mr. Chairman, I would just remind the ranking member that the Republicans, during the Rules Committee hearing, asked if they had a pay-for that they would like to offer in substitute for that, and they chose not to. So I think what we are hearing is that the minority is choosing to say that small businesses in this country aren't worth $9 million. And what $9 million is is, in 3 minutes, that will be the increase in our national debt in this country. So Republicans do take our deficit seriously, and we take the rules of this House seriously because the rules of the House require that when you have an increase in mandatory spending, you have to have an offset for that. What Republicans were trying to do is follow the rules of the House. It is now my pleasure, Mr. Chairman, to yield as much time as he may consume to the gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. Pittenger), one of the primary sponsors of this legislation. Mr. PITTENGER. Mr. Chairman, I do rise today in support of H.R. 1195, the Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection Advisory Boards Act. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau continues to issue regulations designed for massive, systemic-risk financial institutions without considering how those same rules harm small businesses, community banks, and credit unions. That is why my good friend and colleague, Congressman Denny Heck, joined with me to establish a small business advisory board within the CFPB. The goal is simple: to advise and consult with the CFPB on how any proposed regulations would impact the small-business community. Members of the small business advisory board must represent a small business dealing with financial services products. The legislation also encourages the CFPB Director to ensure participation of women- and minority-owned small businesses when appointing members to the board. H.R. 1195 also makes permanent the Credit Union Advisory Council and the Community Bank Advisory Council, both of which are currently voluntary and can be eliminated at any time at the discretion of the CFPB Director. Credit unions and community banks are struggling under enormous compliance burdens designed for too-big-to-fail banks. They are hiring compliance officers instead of loan officers, meaning less access to capital for small businesses to grow and to create jobs. Clear and open communication between the CFPB, small businesses, community banks, and credit unions will improve rulemaking and lead to better outcomes for consumers. H.R. 1195 is supported by the Credit Union National Association, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the American Land Title Association, and the independent community bankers association. This legislation also enjoys strong bipartisan support, having passed out of the Financial Services Committee by a vote of 53-5. Allow me a moment to address the concern that was raised by the ranking member and other Democrat colleagues in their objection to how we propose to pay for the advisory boards. The CBO estimates this legislation will cost taxpayers $9 million over a 10-year period. In those same years, the CFPB will have access to $6.7 billion in operating funds. We propose making a very small reduction--just 0.1 percent--in the amount the CFPB is allowed to draw, which will pay for the advisory boards without additional cost to taxpayers. If the CFPB can't find $9 million in savings over 10 years out of a total potential draw of $6.7 billion, then they need another advisory board of small-business owners who will travel to D.C. and teach the CFPB how to budget. Mr. Chairman, our economy is growing today at a tepid pace of 2.2 percent. We have in reality about 12 percent unemployment when you consider the underemployed and when you consider those who have given up. Small banks and other lending institutions are under enormous compliance restrictions and guidelines, the same as the major banks. They need a voice at the table. We need opportunity. We need people to be able to expand their businesses, and yet they can't get capital through these small banking lending institutions. That is what this bill is all about. It is all about jobs. It is all about families and people's lives and their futures. The CFPB is supposed to be focused on protecting consumers, not protecting bureaucratic fiefdoms and perks. Our commonsense, bipartisan legislation helps focus the CFPB on their sole, core mission of benefiting consumers. Small businesses create jobs. Bureaucrats create rules. Please join me in supporting H.R. 1195 so that heavyhanded D.C. regulators are forced to take time to consider how their burdensome and unnecessary regulations negatively impact small business and make necessary adjustments to protect consumers while allowing small businesses, credit unions, and community banks to help grow the economy and create good-paying jobs. Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to support this bill. Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Chairman, I yield 10 minutes to the gentleman from Washington (Mr. Heck). He is the next gentleman that you are going to hear from this side of the aisle. He is the author of the legislation that certainly would have given small businesses a seat at the table of the CFPB. He worked very hard on this bill, and he is one of those persons on our committee who reaches across the aisle all the time on bipartisan efforts. {time} 1700 Mr. HECK of Washington. Mr. Chairman, in a gesture of reaching across the aisle, let us be clear that prior to this bill's arrival at the Rules Committee, it was Mr. Pittenger and myself who worked in a collaborative and in a bipartisan way, hard for nearly the last 2 years, to get it to this point where we might have an opportunity to vote upon it. I cannot exaggerate to you how saddened I am, how much I regret, and [[Page H2338]] how surreal I find it that I stand here now and ask my colleagues to please vote ``no'' against my bill, oppose the bill that I have worked so hard on for nearly 2 years. Its content, prior to its arrival in Rules, had been laid out commonsensically: codify the Credit Union Advisory Council; codify the Small Community Bank Advisory Council; and create a nonbank advisory board for the appraisers, the title insurers, the real estate agents, escrow company, all people that the Bureau regulates and with whom they should have an iterative conversation going with respect to the proposed regulations. It wasn't easy getting here even before Rules. There was a lot of back and forth, a lot of compromising along the way. We had to allay fears from the consumer groups that this was a Trojan horse. We accepted amendments; we broadened the bill; we did a lot of things together, but with a collaborative spirit and the support of the ranking member, we did pass the bill out of committee 53-5, and then a torch was put to it. A torch was put to it. As has been described, the bill now includes a so-called pay-for amendment to lower the cap of available funds to CFPB by $45 million by the year 2020 and $100 million by the year 2025. It is bad policy; it is bad precedent, and it is completely unnecessary. The amendment was inserted under color of being a pay-for. Well, I have got a couple problems with that. The first is obvious. CBO projection is $9 million. We are talking about a cap that cost $45 million and $100 million. It is a multiple of it--or $75 million to $100 million by last count. The second, of course, is the fact about how the rule is applied, which has been heralded here, and, in fact, genuflected as an important rule to provide for pay-fors when there are expenditures caused by proposed legislation. The motivation is, frankly, inscrutable to me. I honestly don't know how you do it with a straight face. Literally, a matter of hours ago, voting for $300 billion, with a ``b,'' with no PAYGO or pay-for and to stand up here and say, Well, we absolutely have to have a pay-for for $9 million over 10 years, but $300 billion was okay, I say sincerely: I don't know how you do that with a straight face. Frankly, there is so much about this that I find surreal. Much in the debate was about questioned architectural practices by the agency. The truth of the matter is GSA took over construction, what, 2-plus years ago? If that is the issue, write an amendment to the GSA budget; don't punish CFPB. It has been argued that this funding is unique; therefore, it has to be curtailed, unrelated to the underlying purpose of the bill. Maybe that is true. Check the history. It was a Republican who wanted it funded by the Fed--Mr. Shelby, I believe. That may be unique in that way. It has been suggested CFPB is nonbudgeted--again, unrelated to the underlying purpose of the bill. Well, guess what, so is every other bank, regulator, agency in the Federal Government: the FDIC, the OCC, the Fed itself, FHFA, and NCUA. They are all nonbudgeted; but, no, let's pick this one out of the pack and punish it. There is so much about this that is surreal to me. I believe that there is a bit of a trial under way here today, and we are laying a marker down on April 21 on whether or not we are actually going to be able to function in a bipartisan way. We did. It took hard work, 18- plus months with Mr. Pittenger, 53-5 in committee; and now, as I say, we are putting a torch to it. We are going to decide. This is a test. Are we going to use the CFPB as a piggybank to pay for all other manner of agendas? Are we going to ask them to swallow this poison pill in the goal of getting a bipartisan bill passed? It is a test of whether or not we are going to do that. It is an experiment to see how radically--and it is radical--we can change bills and still keep ``yes'' votes in the name of consistency, although there is certainly no consistency between the pay-fors provided in this proposed legislation and that for legislation that passed last week. By the way, in addition to the estate tax and the sales and use tax totalling over $300 billion, we did two CFPB bills last week, too. Nobody offered pay-fors on those, so it isn't consistent. This is surreal, standing here, asking you to oppose the bill that I have worked so hard on with Mr. Pittenger. It is surreal. I am reminded of my favorite passage in ``Through the Looking Glass.'' If I had a world of my own, everything would be nonsense. Nothing would be what it is because everything would be what it isn't. And contrariwise, what is, it wouldn't be. And what it wouldn't be, it would. You see? This is surreal; but I say my strongest assertion that what is the most sad about this--and I have said this in Rules, and I am going to say it now--you know, you know you are killing this bill. You are killing it and evidently don't care, 18 months of hard work out the window to do something good and worthwhile, but you know you are killing the bill. You know you are killing it because you are not passing here veto-proof; and the administration has, as the ranking member suggested, already issued the Statement of Administration Policy. I will go one further. This bill will never see the light of day in the United States Senate. You are killing the bill that we worked on for 2 years to help nonbank businesses have a better structured institutionalized relationship, which is as it should be, and you are doing it by inconsistently applying a House rule for which you grant waivers left and right when you were of a mind. This is good legislation. My friend from North Carolina has worked hard. Frankly--and I will say it--he deserves better than this. This bill deserves better than this. The businesses that are regulated by CFPB deserve better than this, than to kill this bill, which is what you are assuredly doing. Vote ``no'' on my bill. The CHAIR. The Chair reminds Members to direct their remarks to the Chair. Mr. NEUGEBAUER. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself 1 minute. I appreciate the gentleman's comments. I just want to remind him that the GSA only took over the management of the project, not the budget, so GSA doesn't have control over this entity's budget. I think the thing that is troubling to me is my colleagues are talking about a drastic cut. You have got an entity that can draw $6.7 billion over a 10-year period, and $7 million is a drastic cut. Basically, the CBO says that this bill now is revenue neutral, and these numbers that are coming of $45 million, those are CFPB's numbers, but these are the nonpartisan CBO numbers. I think one of the things we have to do is we have to deal in the facts and reality here, and this is a very small amount of money. At this time, Mr. Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Dold). Mr. DOLD. Mr. Chairman, I thank the chairman for yielding the time. Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong support of the Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection Advisory Boards Act. I want to thank my friend from North Carolina for his work, and I want to thank my friend from Washington for his work as well on what really should be a bipartisan bill. Honestly, I think the American public, Mr. Chairman, will take a look at what is happening here on the floor and are going to be baffled by it as well. As a small-business owner, let me just tell you, Mr. Chairman, there are nearly 29 million small businesses in our Nation; 99 percent of all employer firms in the United States are considered small businesses; over 56 million Americans work in these small businesses; and two- thirds of all net new jobs. Last I checked, the labor force participation rate is near a three- decade low, so the net new jobs that we are looking for are created by small business. Two-thirds are created by small business. This is a bill that would basically say to the CFPB: we want you to have a small business advisory board. With all of the businesses that are out there, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, an agency in Washington that sets the rules and regulations with far-reaching impacts into our economy, completely fails to ensure that small businesses have a permanent seat at the table when the CFPB is making decisions, making decisions that impact the lives of millions of Americans and businesses across the land. [[Page H2339]] This is a commonsense piece of legislation. If we are going to talk about small businesses, my goodness, please, let's talk about having small business representation at the table. Mr. Chairman, there are a lot of decisions that get made in this Chamber. There are a lot of decisions that get made in Washington. I have to tell you, one of the things that I try to do is I try to surround myself with people that it impacts. If we are going to talk about health care, I try to surround myself with physicians and patients and nurses, to try to get their input in terms of how this bill or how a bill that comes to the floor would impact them. Surround yourself with people that might know more about a topic than you do; educate yourself. The fact that the CFPB doesn't already have a small business advisory board or small business voice at the table is unacceptable-- unacceptable in today's day and age. This is something that we need to support. Frankly, I want it to be a bipartisan bill. I think the underlying substance of it is bipartisan, and only at the last minute are we talking about not making this a bipartisan bill over the pay-for. Mr. Chairman, I want you to think about this for a second as a business that gets regulated time and again. They don't come with a pay-for there. Basically, they say: this is what we need you to do, and you find a way to pay for it. The CHAIR. The time of the gentleman has expired. Mr. NEUGEBAUER. I yield the gentleman an additional 1 minute. Mr. DOLD. This body is, in essence, saying to the CFPB, Mr. Chairman, to the CFPB and Director Cordray, we are saying: please get small business input into what you are thinking. In order to do that, the dollars that are out there, Mr. Chairman, are talking about trying to fly people in, small businesses in. That is where the dollars are coming from. We think the CBO has scored this at about $9 million out of nearly a $7 billion budget over 10 years. Surely, this can't be the thing that is killing the bill. There has got to be something bigger that is killing the bill because, frankly, the American public, Mr. Chairman, are going to roll their eyes and say: you have got to be kidding me. We are going to disregard small businesses from being able to come in and weigh in on something that is going to drastically impact the economy because they don't want to take what could potentially be $9 million in airfare and other things to try to make sure they can get the small business advisory board to come to Washington. If we find that there is a problem, I will be the first one to reach across the aisle to say we need to fix this. This is a problem that we need to solve, and I encourage my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support this bill to get small businesses engaged. Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Chairman, I first need to remind the gentleman from Illinois that Mr. Heck worked hard to put small business advisory at the table and to codify the other businesses that the CFPB had already put at the table. They snatched it right away from the table. They took away small business. I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. Ellison), who is the cochair of the Progressive Caucus and a member of the Financial Services Committee. {time} 1715 Mr. ELLISON. I would like to thank the gentlewoman for the time. Mr. Chairman, I will just remind my colleagues that, yes, the bill was bipartisan, but the amendment was not. The amendment, which was rigidly partisan, is what has put this good idea in a space of being very partisan on this House floor. You would have thought that after the hard work that Mr. Heck had put into this bill that maybe somebody would have listened to him and would have said, ``Mr. Heck, you have put your time in on this bill. We are not going to do this to your bill. We are going to stick with that bipartisanship that we had all along,'' but that kind of consideration has gone missing in this place. The truth is, Mr. Chairman, that the Republican leadership has brought us another bill in a long series of bills to weaken the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, and no small-business person who is listening to this debate should be bamboozled, tricked, or led astray in believing that the rhetoric on this floor is about helping them. The fact is that a lot of small-business people are protected by predatory lenders that the CFPB stops. A lot of small-business people open their businesses with a credit card. They rely on the CFPB to keep the predation away from them. They, in fact, are the beneficiaries of the work of the CFPB's. All of these bills to attack the CFPB harm the American people. These bills make it easier to steer customers into costly loans that strip their wealth and limit their economic mobility. These bills divert CFPB resources from protecting consumers to costly, unnecessary, bureaucratic activities. Last week, we had a bill to repeal the CFPB rules that protect buyers of manufactured homes from what had been before Dodd-Frank a predatory market. Enough Democrats voted ``no'' on H.R. 650 to sustain the President's veto. That is a good thing. We should not remove consumer protections for high-cost loans that are targeted at buyers of manufactured homes. Also last week, the GOP brought another bill which would weaken the CFPB protections against controlled business arrangements in real estate transactions. Today, the Republican majority considers what is a good idea. H.R. 1195 would require the CFPB to establish a small business advisory council. It is a pretty fair idea. You could argue that it is already there, but if you don't believe it is, it is not at all a highly objectionable bill. In fact, it has merit. What is wrong with a little bit more input from small business? That is a good thing. The fact of the matter is that it is a Trojan horse that is being used to attack the CFPB all over again. My question is this: Why would you want to destroy an organization that has identified $5.3 billion, which is the approximate amount of relief to consumers ordered by the CFPB enforcement actions? It is $5.3 billion that hard-working Americans have saved from predatory lenders. Why in the world, unless you favor predation in financial markets, would you be against the CFPB? There are 15 million consumers who receive relief because of the CFPB, and I hope they let their voices be heard all across the United States against these people who relentlessly try to rip down the CFPB. $208 million is the amount of money that has been ordered to be paid in civil penalties as a result of CFPB's enforcement actions against people who do not help the market but who distort the market. The CFPB helps business because good, honest, decent businesses--and America is full of them, the ones that play by the rules--get harmed when a cheater goes without being punished. When a business that cuts corners and abuses consumers does not get eliminated from the market or punished because of its bad behavior, it means that playing by the rules is no longer profitable or the thing to do. The CFPB makes the market work as it should. There were 145 banks and credit unions under the CFPB's supervisory authority as of June 2014. That is a good thing. There are 30 million consumers with debts in collection, and larger debt collection companies are now under Federal supervision for the first time because of the CFPB. The CFPB is a good institution. Vote ``no'' on this Trojan horse bill. Mr. NEUGEBAUER. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself 1 minute. I am delighted to hear that my colleagues on the other side of the aisle are concerned about $9 million. I wish they had been as concerned when we had hearings and we found out that the CFPB is going to spend $216 million on the luxury renovations of a building that they do not own and when we found out that the taxpayers are also going to get to fund a two-story waterfall that falls into sunken gardens and that has a four-story glass staircase. How about the spending of $14 million on marketing and advertising? How about the $61.3 million they spent on management consulting fees? [[Page H2340]] It should be an affront to small businesses around the country that an organization that can't control its spending is being asked not to spend an additional $9 million so that small businesses can have a voice at the table. Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. Pittenger). Mr. PITTENGER. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Chairman, really what we are talking about are the merits of entitling this enormous agency, the largest in the history of this country, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, to be accountable to nobody, not to be accountable to the executive branch and not to be accountable to the Congress. They are able to do whatever they want to do. They make all of their own rules. They determine the winners, and they determine the losers. They have zero accountability. Let's discuss their funding of $6.7 billion over a 10-year period. Yes, what we are talking about is an offset to pay for an advisory board to protect small business--$9 million. That is 0.1 percent. Let's look at the priorities then of the CFPB's. Truly, would any of us lease a building, not own it, and spend $260 million on renovations? That is more per square foot than of any luxury hotel in Las Vegas. Yes, how about a two-story waterfall into a sunken garden? How magnificent. Is that more important than an advisory board that is for small business to ensure that we can create jobs? How about a green roof and a four-story glass staircase? It costs millions. Is that more important than an advisory board for small business? How about a tree bosk and a timber porch--how lovely--so that employees can have a place of restful contemplation and meditation? Do bureaucrats really need a serene place to rest while they are on the job? Are they that concerned about their plight? My goodness. Here are struggling, hardworking, tax-paying Americans who are trying to build their businesses, who are trying to find capital, who are looking to community banks that are under siege with burdensome regulations. It is the same as the major banks. This isn't right. This makes no sense. This is not fair. We need to get priority where priority is due. Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from Wisconsin (Ms. Moore). She serves on the Financial Services Committee and is a strong supporter of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau's. Ms. MOORE. Thank you so much, Madam Ranking Member. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to H.R. 1195 and not because I don't think it is a wonderful idea that Mr. Heck has come up with, along with his colleague from the Republican side, for a small business advisory panel within the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. Prior to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, we had example, after example, after example of Wall Street's preying on consumers and treating working class Americans just like an ATM in order to feather their bonuses; but here, today, we find yet another not so veiled attempt to defund the CFPB. I guess I could take the PAYGO rules a little bit more seriously if just last week we had not repealed the estate tax to the tune of $270 billion for the 6,000 wealthiest Americans. It is a tax from which only 6,000 people will benefit. I am certainly not looking for a pay-for. I am just pointing out the hypocrisy of the notion that we have got to offset this $9 million for the CFPB. As has been mentioned, the CFPB has returned $5.3 billion to more than 15 million consumers who have been harmed by financial fraud, and I think PAYGO is just more of a convenient excuse to cut the CFPB than an actual principle that we follow here. I urge my colleagues to stand up for American consumers. Oppose these attempts to attack the CFPB and to expose our constituents to these emboldened financial fraud centers. Let's reject H.R. 1195. Mr. NEUGEBAUER. Mr. Chairman, may I inquire as to how much time is remaining on both sides. The CHAIR. The gentleman from Texas has 11\1/2\ minutes remaining, and the gentlewoman from California has 5 minutes remaining. Mr. NEUGEBAUER. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time. Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from Maryland (Ms. Edwards). Ms. EDWARDS. I thank the ranking member for yielding. Mr. Chairman, I came to this floor opposed to this version of H.R. 1195, and as I have listened to the debate, I have become even more opposed to the legislation. Most fifth graders know a Trojan horse when they see one, and today's legislation is, indeed, a Trojan horse. Let me tell you why. Once again, Republicans are trying to roll back and limit consumer protections. Once again, they are attacking the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau by adding burdensome legislation that replicates what the Bureau is already doing and by stripping funding from the CFPB in future years. Let's remember that this was the agency that was created to prevent the very abusive practices that led to the 2008 financial crisis; yet here they go, pretending to help small businesses and community banks and credit unions but are gutting the agency that is responsible for protecting consumers. Just 6 years ago, we saw the fallout of the financial crisis right in my district in Prince George's County and in Baltimore City, where homeowners lost their homes. It was Black and Latino families who suffered the most in Prince George's County and Baltimore City, and it is not over for us. Many of those homeowners were small-business owners, and they used their homes to leverage their businesses. They can't do that anymore because they are still underwater and because the rules are still set against them. We are still in crisis, and we need a robust, unencumbered, unburdened Consumer Financial Protection Bureau to protect consumers, homeowners, and small businesses that are still struggling and are vulnerable. We need a robust lifeline CFPB as our credit unions and community banks are struggling. They need real relief that is hidden behind this Trojan horse legislation. Many of my Republican colleagues have long opposed the CFPB, and they have long sought to dismantle it. This legislation is no different, and it needs to be defeated. If they want bipartisan legislation, we need to start all over again and do something that really is in the interest of consumers. Mr. NEUGEBAUER. Mr. Chairman, we have no further speakers, and I reserve the balance of my time. Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I think that we have done a very good job on this side of the aisle of exposing what is happening on the opposite side of the aisle as simply an attempt to try and gut and demean the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. {time} 1730 Let me just deal with this argument that they made about the cost of renovation for the CFPB. Bloomberg Businessweek, in an article, entitled, ``Republican Attacks on a CFPB Office Renovation Don't Add Up,'' found that Republicans took liberties with their math. Using data from a report prepared by the CFPB's inspector general, Bloomberg found that renovation would only cost $421 per square foot, if you inflate the price by including rental of temporary space and paying for movers, compared to the GOP claim of $590. Actual construction costs are only $283 per square foot, half of what the Republicans claim. However, and I think this is very interesting, there is one very expensive renovation happening in Washington, D.C., right now. It is the Cannon House Office Building, which houses Members and committees of the House of Representatives. All end costs for the renovation of the Cannon Building approved by Speaker Boehner will be $753 million, or $911 per square foot, much pricier than the Bellagio or the Burj Khalifa. If we want to talk about what is high cost, take a look at ourselves right here in Congress for what we are doing. Having said that, I just wonder why the continued attempts on the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. Maybe it is because somebody else is being protected. Let's look at some of the work of the Bureau: a January 2015 settlement [[Page H2341]] against J.P. Morgan and Wells Fargo for $35.7 million after uncovering a scheme where loan officers illegally referred customers to affiliated businesses in exchange for cash and marketing services. Look at a July 2014 settlement against Rome Finance for $92 million for a predatory lending scheme that targeted servicemembers by hiding finance charges, withholding information from billing statements, and engaging in illegal debt collection practices. Another settlement from July 2014 against payday lender ACE Cash Express for $10 million for intentionally trapping consumers in a cycle of debt, a practice formalized in their employee training materials, as well as illegal debt collection practices, including harassment. I could go on and on and on how the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau has taken on some of the biggest corporations, the biggest businesses in this country to protect consumers. What is it you are afraid of? What is it you are worried about? Why are you trying to kill the agency that is protecting consumers rather than applauding them for making sure that the consumers don't continue to be taken advantage of the way they were prior to 2008 when we didn't have any consumer protection? I ask you to question yourselves about why you hate the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau so much. I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. NEUGEBAUER. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself the balance of my time. I have read H.R. 1195. Let me tell you what it doesn't do first. It doesn't shut down the CFPB. It doesn't keep the Bureau from carrying out its mission of consumer protection--so all of those things that the other side has been saying that the CFPB has been doing in a positive way, they can continue to do that--nor will the employees of CFPB have to take a pay cut, nor will the construction project and the other consulting fees that they keep passing out be impacted in any way. So the charge on the other side that somehow Republicans are trying to kill CFPB, I think you need to go back and read the bill. The bill doesn't say anything about killing the CFPB. What does H.R. 1195 do? It provides a voice for small businesses in this country, the number one job creators in America, the people that are day in and day out on the front line in our communities. It allows them to have a voice with an agency that has a huge impact on the future of this country. It also codifies and makes sure that community banks and credit unions have a voice at the table in the future. One of the bill's sponsors said he was sad. I am sad. I am sad that people today are on this floor arguing that paying for a program that will provide a voice for our small businesses is a point of contention, that somehow we are not acting in a bipartisan way. This is a bipartisan bill. It passed by voice vote in the last Congress. It passed overwhelmingly, I think 55-5, in the Committee on Financial Services just a week ago. I think we have to focus on what this bill does. This bill does make sure that small businesses have a voice moving forward. If we have a government that doesn't listen to the people, then we do not have good government. So this bill is about good government. It is about saying to the American people: Hey, the bureaucrats may not have all the answers, so it is good to bring the people that have been out there that are running businesses that have some expertise in those areas that this agency is trying to regulate and set precedence for, it is good for government to listen to the people. So, Mr. Chairman, I encourage my colleagues to pass and vote for H.R. 1195. I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. CUMMINGS. Mr. Chair, as originally introduced, H.R. 1195 was that rare piece of legislation with bipartisan support. It supported the simple proposition that the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) could benefit from the guidance of advisory councils comprised of representatives from small businesses, credit unions, and community banks. As introduced, the legislation would have required the CFPB to hear from small business representatives regarding the impact of proposed rules on financial products used by consumers for family and household purposes. The bill also encouraged the CFPB to ensure the participation of credits unions and community banks that serve traditionally underserved communities. The CFPB--and all relevant government agencies--should continue to focus on expanding banking opportunities in underserved communities, which are too often subjected to the worst forms of predatory financial practices. According to the Corporation for Enterprise Development, my hometown of Baltimore, Maryland, is one of the top ten unbanked large cities in the country--13.9 percent of residents have no checking or savings account, and more than one in four residents is underbanked. Too many of these folks rely on alternative financial services like check- cashing stores, rent-to-own agreements, or pawnshops. While Maryland has instituted a 33 percent usury cap and storefront payday lending operations do not exist in the state, Maryland residents with small-dollar credit needs have continued to turn to on-line lenders--lenders that are too often perpetrating fraudulent and abusive practices. But this does not need to be the reality in Baltimore or any American city. According to the Urban Institute, the small-dollar credit market in the United States reached approximately $21.4 billion in 2012. Credit unions and community banks across the country have begun to tap into this market by experimenting with small-dollar, short-term loans that help consumers stretch their monthly budgets or pay for emergency expenses without trapping them in a cycle of debt. The CFPB has taken a critical first step toward reforming the small- dollar industry by releasing proposals for a potential rule that would require short-term lenders to either ensure borrowers have the ability to repay their loans or to provide affordable repayment plans. This is why I was so disappointed by a recent amendment to H.R. 1195 from the Rules Committee that would pay for the new advisory councils the bill would create by capping or reducing the CFPB budget by $45 million over five years and $100 million over ten years. In contrast, the Congressional Budget Office has estimated that the new councils would cost only $9 million over ten years--confirming that the new amendment is nothing more than an attempt to slash the CFPB budget. By transforming a simple bill into a major budget cut, this amendment is simply another in a series of continuing attacks on the work of the CFPB, which has provided $5.3 billion in relief to consumers since its creation. Just as the CFPB embarks on its latest effort to protect consumers from predatory and abusive practices, we simply cannot afford a weakened consumer protection agency. As amended, H.R. 1195 is not only a disappointment--it's an insult to the same underserved communities the bill would have helped the CFPB to better serve. I urge my colleagues to reject this bill and its attempt to undercut protections for working American families. The CHAIR. All time for general debate has expired.

Amendment No. 1 Offered by Ms. Kuster The CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 1 printed in part D of House Report 114-74. Ms. KUSTER. Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk, amendment No. 1, and I offer that amendment at this time. The CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment. The text of the amendment is as follows: Page 4, beginning on line 19, strike ``is encouraged to ensure the participation of'' and insert ``shall include members representing''. Page 5, beginning on line 12, strike ``is encouraged to ensure the participation of'' and insert ``shall include members representing''. Page 6, beginning on line 6, strike ``is encouraged to ensure the participation of'' and insert ``shall include members representing''. The CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 200, the gentlewoman from New Hampshire (Ms. Kuster) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from New Hampshire. Ms. KUSTER. Mr. Chair, my amendment is straightforward. The underlying bill encourages but does not require the Director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau to include women-owned small businesses and minority-owned small businesses in the membership of the small business advisory board. The bill also encourages the Director to include financial institutions predominantly serving traditionally underserved communities in the membership of the Credit Union Advisory Council and the Community Bank Advisory Council. My amendment would simply change the underlying bill to make the inclusion of these groups a requirement, to ensure that a broad and diverse range of voices are included in these bodies. Federal regulators should listen to stakeholders when writing new rules for our economy, and this amendment will help ensure that these advisory boards are more representative of the American people. I urge support for my amendment, and I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. NEUGEBAUER. Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition to this amendment. The CHAIR. The gentleman from Texas is recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. NEUGEBAUER. Mr. Chairman, the underlying language in this bill was a bipartisan agreement that was worked out in the last Congress. When we were marking up this bill previously, it was brought up that minority representation would be important to this bill, and so the chairman of the committee, Mr. Hensarling, actually stopped the deliberation there and worked in a bipartisan way across the aisle with Ms. Waters to make sure that we put language in the bill that would encourage the Director to make sure that women and minorities' business concerns on the small business advisory board were taken into consideration. We have addressed that, and we kept that language that was agreed to and, by the way, was passed by a voice vote. Mr. Pittenger accepted that amendment, and the bill reported out of the committee 53-5. So, basically, we have kept our word and kept in the spirit of the agreement that was negotiated in the previous Congress, and that language is in this underlying bill. I would encourage folks not to vote for this amendment. I reserve the balance of my time. Ms. KUSTER. Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. NEUGEBAUER. Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time. The CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentlewoman from New Hampshire (Ms. Kuster). The question was taken; and the Chair announced that the noes appeared to have it. Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Chair, I demand a recorded vote. The CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further proceedings on the amendment offered by the gentlewoman from New Hampshire will be postponed. Amendment No. 2 Offered by Ms. Kuster The CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 2 printed in part D of House Report 114-74. Ms. KUSTER. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk, amendment No. 2. I offer that amendment at this time. The CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment. The text of the amendment is as follows: Page 4, line 20, strike ``minority- and women-owned'' and insert ``minority-, women-, and veteran-owned''. The CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 200, the gentlewoman from New Hampshire (Ms. Kuster) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes. [[Page H2343]] The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from New Hampshire. Ms. KUSTER. Mr. Chair, the underlying bill before us today authorizes a small business advisory board to advise the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau on small business concerns and practices. I agree that small businesses must have a seat at the table when Federal regulators make decisions with wide-ranging consequences for our economy, and I appreciate that this legislation already encourages the participation of women-owned and minority-owned small businesses on the board. Women and minority entrepreneurs often have unique perspectives and concerns, and the CFPB would be well served by seeking and heeding their input. Similarly, as a member of the Committee on Veterans' Affairs, I believe that veteran entrepreneurs have unique perspectives and experiences in the economy, and I believe that the small business advisory board would be strengthened by the inclusion of veteran small- business owners. To that end, my amendment simply encourages the CFPB Director to also include veteran-owned small businesses in the membership of the small business advisory board. After fighting to protect the American Dream for all of us, many veterans have realized that same American Dream by starting their own business upon their return to civilian life. We owe it to our returning heroes to support their success. I urge support for my amendment, and I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. NEUGEBAUER. Madam Chair, I claim the time in opposition to this amendment, although I am not opposed to it. The Acting CHAIR (Ms. Foxx). Without objection, the gentleman from Texas is recognized for 5 minutes. There was no objection. Mr. NEUGEBAUER. I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from New Hampshire (Mr. Guinta). Mr. GUINTA. I would like to thank Chairman Neugebauer for yielding me this time. Madam Chair, it is an honor to stand alongside my fellow Granite State colleague in support of her amendment. Our State of New Hampshire has one of the highest populations of veterans per capita in the United States. Because of this, both the gentlelady from New Hampshire and myself understand the importance of working together to support our Nation's veterans and veteran-owned businesses. There are hundreds of veteran-owned businesses just in New Hampshire alone, and we need to ensure that our commitment does not end with their term of commitment to our military. I thank the gentlelady from New Hampshire for her amendment. I urge my colleagues both on the committee and in the full House to support this amendment. I would encourage them to support H.R. 1195, despite the objections of the 0.0015 percent in the pay-for that was earlier discussed. Mr. NEUGEBAUER. Madam Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume to say that we support this. It is a thoughtful amendment. I yield back the balance of my time. {time} 1745 Ms. KUSTER. Madam Chair, I yield such time as she may consume to the gentlewoman from California (Ms. Maxine Waters). Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Madam Chairman, I rise in support of this amendment. I would like to thank the gentlewoman from New Hampshire for offering this measure, which will ensure that the concerns of our Nation's veteran-owned businesses are represented on the small business advisory board this legislation creates. Madam Chairman, our Nation's veterans heroically put their lives on the line for this country. And when they come home and decide to start a small business, they are carrying forth that patriotic duty by taking another risk for the betterment of our Nation. Just as our Nation has a responsibility to care for those who return from battle, we too have a duty to ensure those who have served in our Armed Forces have a voice at the table, in whatever vocation they enter. Early on, the CFPB recognized the unique needs of servicemembers, veterans, and their families by creating an office targeted to address their needs. Likewise, small businesses owned by veterans comprise a subset of our Nation's economic backbone that should not be ignored. This amendment ensures that the CFPB is made aware of their views, perspectives, and interests in the same manner as all small-business owners. But Madam Chairman, while I support this amendment and believe in its goals, I remain strongly opposed to the underlying bill, which would impose cuts to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and would set a precedent that could ultimately lead to a time when the Nation's leading consumer advocate is cash-strapped, underfunded, and financially unable to ensure that the views of veteran business owners--or any other business owners--are appropriately taken into account. Ms. KUSTER. Madam Chair, I yield back the balance of my time. The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentlewoman from New Hampshire (Ms. Kuster). The amendment was agreed to. Mr. NEUGEBAUER. Madam Chair, I move that the Committee do now rise. The motion was agreed to. Accordingly, the Committee rose; and the Speaker pro tempore (Mr. Guinta) having assumed the chair, Ms. Foxx, Acting Chair of the Committee of the Whole House on the state of the Union, reported that that Committee, having had under consideration the bill (H.R. 1195) to amend the Consumer Financial Protection Act of 2010 to establish advisory boards, and for other purposes, had come to no resolution thereon. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 58 (Tuesday, April 21, 2015)] [House] [Pages H2335-H2343] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] BUREAU OF CONSUMER FINANCIAL PROTECTION ADVISORY BOARDS ACT general leave Mr. NEUGEBAUER. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and submit extraneous materials on the bill, H.R. 1195, to amend the Consumer Financial Protection Act of 2010 to establish advisory boards, and for other purposes. The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Pittenger). Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Texas? There was no objection. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to House Resolution 200 and rule XVIII, the Chair declares the House in the Committee of the Whole House on the state of the Union for the consideration of the bill, H.R. 1195. The Chair appoints the gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. Duncan) to preside over the Committee of the Whole. {time} 1637 In the Committee of the Whole Accordingly, the House resolved itself into the Committee of the Whole House on the state of the Union for the consideration of the bill (H.R. 1195) to amend the Consumer Financial Protection Act of 2010 to establish advisory boards, and for other purposes, with Mr. Duncan of Tennessee in the chair. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The CHAIR. Pursuant to the rule, the bill is considered read the first time. The gentleman from Texas (Mr. Neugebauer) and the gentlewoman from California (Ms. Maxine Waters) each will control 30 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Texas. Mr. NEUGEBAUER. Mr. Chairman, today the House considers H.R. 1195, the Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection Advisory Boards Act. This bill is essential to provide small businesses a voice in the regulatory process and to help ensure community banks and credit unions continue to have a voice at the CFPB going forward. Small businesses are the backbone of our economy, yet our regulatory system silences these hard-working Americans. Regulations meant for large corporations trickle down and have disproportionate impacts on Main Street businesses. We must remember that these businesses are, by and large, owned and operated by our neighbors and friends. They represent a life's work and a vision of the American Dream. The CFPB was created to protect consumers in the financial marketplace, and it would seem impossible to responsibly undertake this endeavor of protecting the American consumer without consulting institutions that are most closely associated with the American consumer: small businesses and community financial institutions. H.R. 1195 is a straightforward and bipartisan piece of legislation. It would amend the Dodd-Frank Act to create a small business advisory board to advise the CFPB. This bill would also codify two other advisory committees created by Director Cordray: the Credit Union Advisory Council and the Community Bank Advisory Council. [[Page H2336]] Under H.R. 1195, each board or council would advise the CFPB regarding concerns of its established membership. The Director of the CFPB would be required to appoint at least 15, but not more than 20, members to each board or council. This bill is publicly supported by the following organizations: the Credit Union National Association, the National Association of Federal Credit Unions, the Texas Land Title Association, the American Land Title Association, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the Independent Community Bankers of America. Mr. Chairman, this is a truly a commonsense and bipartisan bill. Last Congress, an identical piece of legislation passed the House by voice vote. This Congress, H.R. 1195 passed out of the committee by a vote of 53-5. The ranking member, who is with us today, has voted for this bill two times, yet we find ourselves here today debating the merits of providing a voice for small businesses and community financial institutions. This week, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton was questioned about the health of American businesses. She said she was ``surprised'' to learn that small businesses were struggling. Mr. Chairman, H.R. 1195 is just one small and commonsense step to providing a voice for our small businesses and community financial institutions in the regulatory process. It helps ensure that politicians and Washington bureaucrats aren't surprised to learn of the plight and struggles of these Main Street pillars. It gives these hard- working Americans a voice and a seat at the table. Now, Democrats are going to say that our disagreement is with how the bill is paid for. Well, let me address that for a minute. House rules require that any increase in mandatory spending be offset with a reduction in mandatory spending elsewhere. The CBO says H.R. 1195 will cost $9 million, in total, over the next 10 years. Republicans simply reduced the maximum amount that the CFPB can draw from the Fed over the same 10-year period to offset this cost. To put this into perspective, the CFPB, by statute, can draw approximately $6.7 billion over the next 10 years. This offset that we are debating today amounts to 0.1 percent of this amount. If Democrats really want to claim that a 0.1 percent reduction in the $6.7 billion that CFPB can spend over the next decade really threatens the Bureau's mission, perhaps it is time to examine the Bureau's current spending practices. I am quite confident that we can debate spending problems at the CFPB for the rest of the afternoon, should we need to. Just to reiterate, H.R. 1195 will not cut spending on consumer protection. Let me repeat that. Just to reiterate, H.R. 1195 will not cut spending on consumer protection. It will provide a voice for small businesses. Let's help our small businesses succeed. Let's help Main Street prosper, and let's vote today to move H.R. 1195 forward. With that, I reserve the balance of my time. Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Chairman, I want the Members of the House to pay very close attention to this bill today because this bill represents tricks and games in ways that people don't often understand. But this is a prime example of how you take a good idea and mess it up. So I rise today in opposition to H.R. 1195, a measure that is, again, a shining example of how far Republicans will go to squander compromise, consensus, and good faith to advance an ideological anticonsumer agenda. The bill before us today is just the latest instance of Financial Services Committee Republicans snatching defeat from the jaws of victory. {time} 1645 It makes clear their commitment to do all they can to undercut the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. Let me say that again. They have spent so much time--amendment after amendment, attempt after attempt-- to try and gut and dismantle the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, and they have gone so far with this bill to undermine our efforts to be of assistance to small businesses and include them in a stronger advisory way to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau because they hate the Bureau so much. Well, again, they do all they can to undercut this Bureau, an agency with an extraordinary record of success protecting consumers, reining in bad actors, and ensuring that we do not return to the predatory practices that put this Nation on the verge of economic collapse less than 10 years ago. Mr. Chairman, as originally written, H.R. 1195 was a good and decent measure offered by my colleague, Mr. Heck from Washington State, and, again, I applaud him for his leadership. The straightforward proposal offered by Mr. Heck would codify two of the advisory boards that the CFPB voluntarily created related to community banks and credit unions, while also creating a new small business advisory board for small businesses. Along with many other requirements of the Bureau, these boards create additional avenues for input from the entities that they have been given the power to regulate under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform Act. So here is what we are talking about. The Bureau itself had created a number of advisory committees. Mr. Heck saw room for strengthening the ability of small businesses to have an advisory role, and so he created this bill. But, because, again, my friends on the opposite side of the aisle, the Republicans, hate the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau so much, they decided that they were going to play tricks and games and create an opportunity to reduce the funding so they could try and limit the Bureau's ability to do its work by adding all of these amendments. I am going to point out the tricks of these amendments as we go along here today. So in a rare show of bipartisanship, the Financial Services Committee passed H.R. 1195 by a vote of 53-5. Many of my Democratic colleagues supported the proposal, just as we have supported the many efforts of the CFPB to be responsive to the unique needs of small businesses, community banks, and credit unions. But, as usual, that bipartisanship was short-lived, as Chairman Hensarling added an amendment designed to pay for this measure by undermining the CFPB's authority and independent funding. I find it ironic that this House has determined now is the time to offset the cost of legislation. Don't forget, we have the pay-for kings and queens on that side of the aisle. They said, they worked for, and they made a big issue that everything must be paid for, except when they decide to try and slip something in that they don't pay for. And they have done that on this floor with some of these bills that we will be talking about. But with this bill, they decided a new kind of trick; and that is, let's find a way to take it from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau because not only will this pay for it, but this will reduce their ability to do their job paying for other things. Just last week, the House majority voted to repeal the estate tax without paying for it at a staggering cost of $269 billion. At a time when far too many Americans are struggling with stagnant wages and historic income inequality, my Republican counterparts seem all too willing to add to the Nation's deficit in order to pass giveaways for the richest 0.2 percent of Americans. Yet when it comes to a reasonable bill to enhance the voice of small businesses, community banks, and credit unions, which they claim to care so much about, the Republicans insist that the only way to pass the legislation is by cutting the CFPB--an agency that 84 percent of small-business owners support, according to polling from the small- business majority. The truth of the matter is that, after several years of attempting to cap CFPB funding, the Republicans have chosen to transform Mr. Heck's bill into a vehicle to make drastic cuts to the CFPB's budget. While my colleagues on the other side of the aisle will claim otherwise, the CFPB itself estimates Chairman Hensarling's poison pill amendment will cut its budget by about $45 million over the next 5 years and by $100 million over the next 10 years, capping it substantially less than the amount that they are currently able to request. [[Page H2337]] That means this vote is one to weaken an agency with the explicit mission of standing up for consumers and taxpayers who have been subject to the deceptive practices of unscrupulous corporations. The chairman's amendment guarantees that this otherwise bipartisan proposal will never become law, garnering significant opposition in the Senate and a veto threat from the Obama administration, who said this measure was ``solely intended to impede the CFPB's ability to carry out its mission of protecting consumers in the financial markets,'' and further, they said, ``could result in, among other things, undermining critical protections for families from abusive and predatory financial products.'' Mr. Chairman, Republicans could have chosen any number of offsets to account for the cost of this proposal or, as they have done so many times before, waive their CutGo rules. Make no mistake about the intent of the Hensarling amendment. It is designed to back Democrats into a corner by attaching an unacceptable provision cutting CFPB's budget to a proposal that Democrats supported in committee. The important work of the CFPB will not be undermined on our watch, and this backdoor attempt to cut its budget sets a dangerous precedent of using bipartisan bills as a way to sneak through measures that undermine the Bureau's independence and its ability to protect consumers. Mr. Chairman, we don't understand on this side of the aisle why it is that our Republican friends hate the CFPB so much and have done so much to undermine them, to undercut them, and to try to reduce their funding. They know as well as we know that prior to the establishment of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau that we put into Dodd- Frank's reforms, consumers had no protections in the Government of the United States of America. Our regulatory agencies were not doing their jobs. They say they were focused on safety and soundness. But who was working for the consumers? Nobody. And so now we have a Bureau working for the consumers that is doing a wonderful job. And here we have every attempt that you can dream of, every scheme that you can think of, being levied by our friends on the opposite side of the aisle because they want to kill the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. As I have said, this is not going to happen on our watch. They can try any trick that they want. We are on to it. With that, Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. NEUGEBAUER. Mr. Chairman, I would just remind the ranking member that the Republicans, during the Rules Committee hearing, asked if they had a pay-for that they would like to offer in substitute for that, and they chose not to. So I think what we are hearing is that the minority is choosing to say that small businesses in this country aren't worth $9 million. And what $9 million is is, in 3 minutes, that will be the increase in our national debt in this country. So Republicans do take our deficit seriously, and we take the rules of this House seriously because the rules of the House require that when you have an increase in mandatory spending, you have to have an offset for that. What Republicans were trying to do is follow the rules of the House. It is now my pleasure, Mr. Chairman, to yield as much time as he may consume to the gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. Pittenger), one of the primary sponsors of this legislation. Mr. PITTENGER. Mr. Chairman, I do rise today in support of H.R. 1195, the Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection Advisory Boards Act. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau continues to issue regulations designed for massive, systemic-risk financial institutions without considering how those same rules harm small businesses, community banks, and credit unions. That is why my good friend and colleague, Congressman Denny Heck, joined with me to establish a small business advisory board within the CFPB. The goal is simple: to advise and consult with the CFPB on how any proposed regulations would impact the small-business community. Members of the small business advisory board must represent a small business dealing with financial services products. The legislation also encourages the CFPB Director to ensure participation of women- and minority-owned small businesses when appointing members to the board. H.R. 1195 also makes permanent the Credit Union Advisory Council and the Community Bank Advisory Council, both of which are currently voluntary and can be eliminated at any time at the discretion of the CFPB Director. Credit unions and community banks are struggling under enormous compliance burdens designed for too-big-to-fail banks. They are hiring compliance officers instead of loan officers, meaning less access to capital for small businesses to grow and to create jobs. Clear and open communication between the CFPB, small businesses, community banks, and credit unions will improve rulemaking and lead to better outcomes for consumers. H.R. 1195 is supported by the Credit Union National Association, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the American Land Title Association, and the independent community bankers association. This legislation also enjoys strong bipartisan support, having passed out of the Financial Services Committee by a vote of 53-5. Allow me a moment to address the concern that was raised by the ranking member and other Democrat colleagues in their objection to how we propose to pay for the advisory boards. The CBO estimates this legislation will cost taxpayers $9 million over a 10-year period. In those same years, the CFPB will have access to $6.7 billion in operating funds. We propose making a very small reduction--just 0.1 percent--in the amount the CFPB is allowed to draw, which will pay for the advisory boards without additional cost to taxpayers. If the CFPB can't find $9 million in savings over 10 years out of a total potential draw of $6.7 billion, then they need another advisory board of small-business owners who will travel to D.C. and teach the CFPB how to budget. Mr. Chairman, our economy is growing today at a tepid pace of 2.2 percent. We have in reality about 12 percent unemployment when you consider the underemployed and when you consider those who have given up. Small banks and other lending institutions are under enormous compliance restrictions and guidelines, the same as the major banks. They need a voice at the table. We need opportunity. We need people to be able to expand their businesses, and yet they can't get capital through these small banking lending institutions. That is what this bill is all about. It is all about jobs. It is all about families and people's lives and their futures. The CFPB is supposed to be focused on protecting consumers, not protecting bureaucratic fiefdoms and perks. Our commonsense, bipartisan legislation helps focus the CFPB on their sole, core mission of benefiting consumers. Small businesses create jobs. Bureaucrats create rules. Please join me in supporting H.R. 1195 so that heavyhanded D.C. regulators are forced to take time to consider how their burdensome and unnecessary regulations negatively impact small business and make necessary adjustments to protect consumers while allowing small businesses, credit unions, and community banks to help grow the economy and create good-paying jobs. Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to support this bill. Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Chairman, I yield 10 minutes to the gentleman from Washington (Mr. Heck). He is the next gentleman that you are going to hear from this side of the aisle. He is the author of the legislation that certainly would have given small businesses a seat at the table of the CFPB. He worked very hard on this bill, and he is one of those persons on our committee who reaches across the aisle all the time on bipartisan efforts. {time} 1700 Mr. HECK of Washington. Mr. Chairman, in a gesture of reaching across the aisle, let us be clear that prior to this bill's arrival at the Rules Committee, it was Mr. Pittenger and myself who worked in a collaborative and in a bipartisan way, hard for nearly the last 2 years, to get it to this point where we might have an opportunity to vote upon it. I cannot exaggerate to you how saddened I am, how much I regret, and [[Page H2338]] how surreal I find it that I stand here now and ask my colleagues to please vote ``no'' against my bill, oppose the bill that I have worked so hard on for nearly 2 years. Its content, prior to its arrival in Rules, had been laid out commonsensically: codify the Credit Union Advisory Council; codify the Small Community Bank Advisory Council; and create a nonbank advisory board for the appraisers, the title insurers, the real estate agents, escrow company, all people that the Bureau regulates and with whom they should have an iterative conversation going with respect to the proposed regulations. It wasn't easy getting here even before Rules. There was a lot of back and forth, a lot of compromising along the way. We had to allay fears from the consumer groups that this was a Trojan horse. We accepted amendments; we broadened the bill; we did a lot of things together, but with a collaborative spirit and the support of the ranking member, we did pass the bill out of committee 53-5, and then a torch was put to it. A torch was put to it. As has been described, the bill now includes a so-called pay-for amendment to lower the cap of available funds to CFPB by $45 million by the year 2020 and $100 million by the year 2025. It is bad policy; it is bad precedent, and it is completely unnecessary. The amendment was inserted under color of being a pay-for. Well, I have got a couple problems with that. The first is obvious. CBO projection is $9 million. We are talking about a cap that cost $45 million and $100 million. It is a multiple of it--or $75 million to $100 million by last count. The second, of course, is the fact about how the rule is applied, which has been heralded here, and, in fact, genuflected as an important rule to provide for pay-fors when there are expenditures caused by proposed legislation. The motivation is, frankly, inscrutable to me. I honestly don't know how you do it with a straight face. Literally, a matter of hours ago, voting for $300 billion, with a ``b,'' with no PAYGO or pay-for and to stand up here and say, Well, we absolutely have to have a pay-for for $9 million over 10 years, but $300 billion was okay, I say sincerely: I don't know how you do that with a straight face. Frankly, there is so much about this that I find surreal. Much in the debate was about questioned architectural practices by the agency. The truth of the matter is GSA took over construction, what, 2-plus years ago? If that is the issue, write an amendment to the GSA budget; don't punish CFPB. It has been argued that this funding is unique; therefore, it has to be curtailed, unrelated to the underlying purpose of the bill. Maybe that is true. Check the history. It was a Republican who wanted it funded by the Fed--Mr. Shelby, I believe. That may be unique in that way. It has been suggested CFPB is nonbudgeted--again, unrelated to the underlying purpose of the bill. Well, guess what, so is every other bank, regulator, agency in the Federal Government: the FDIC, the OCC, the Fed itself, FHFA, and NCUA. They are all nonbudgeted; but, no, let's pick this one out of the pack and punish it. There is so much about this that is surreal to me. I believe that there is a bit of a trial under way here today, and we are laying a marker down on April 21 on whether or not we are actually going to be able to function in a bipartisan way. We did. It took hard work, 18- plus months with Mr. Pittenger, 53-5 in committee; and now, as I say, we are putting a torch to it. We are going to decide. This is a test. Are we going to use the CFPB as a piggybank to pay for all other manner of agendas? Are we going to ask them to swallow this poison pill in the goal of getting a bipartisan bill passed? It is a test of whether or not we are going to do that. It is an experiment to see how radically--and it is radical--we can change bills and still keep ``yes'' votes in the name of consistency, although there is certainly no consistency between the pay-fors provided in this proposed legislation and that for legislation that passed last week. By the way, in addition to the estate tax and the sales and use tax totalling over $300 billion, we did two CFPB bills last week, too. Nobody offered pay-fors on those, so it isn't consistent. This is surreal, standing here, asking you to oppose the bill that I have worked so hard on with Mr. Pittenger. It is surreal. I am reminded of my favorite passage in ``Through the Looking Glass.'' If I had a world of my own, everything would be nonsense. Nothing would be what it is because everything would be what it isn't. And contrariwise, what is, it wouldn't be. And what it wouldn't be, it would. You see? This is surreal; but I say my strongest assertion that what is the most sad about this--and I have said this in Rules, and I am going to say it now--you know, you know you are killing this bill. You are killing it and evidently don't care, 18 months of hard work out the window to do something good and worthwhile, but you know you are killing the bill. You know you are killing it because you are not passing here veto-proof; and the administration has, as the ranking member suggested, already issued the Statement of Administration Policy. I will go one further. This bill will never see the light of day in the United States Senate. You are killing the bill that we worked on for 2 years to help nonbank businesses have a better structured institutionalized relationship, which is as it should be, and you are doing it by inconsistently applying a House rule for which you grant waivers left and right when you were of a mind. This is good legislation. My friend from North Carolina has worked hard. Frankly--and I will say it--he deserves better than this. This bill deserves better than this. The businesses that are regulated by CFPB deserve better than this, than to kill this bill, which is what you are assuredly doing. Vote ``no'' on my bill. The CHAIR. The Chair reminds Members to direct their remarks to the Chair. Mr. NEUGEBAUER. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself 1 minute. I appreciate the gentleman's comments. I just want to remind him that the GSA only took over the management of the project, not the budget, so GSA doesn't have control over this entity's budget. I think the thing that is troubling to me is my colleagues are talking about a drastic cut. You have got an entity that can draw $6.7 billion over a 10-year period, and $7 million is a drastic cut. Basically, the CBO says that this bill now is revenue neutral, and these numbers that are coming of $45 million, those are CFPB's numbers, but these are the nonpartisan CBO numbers. I think one of the things we have to do is we have to deal in the facts and reality here, and this is a very small amount of money. At this time, Mr. Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Dold). Mr. DOLD. Mr. Chairman, I thank the chairman for yielding the time. Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong support of the Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection Advisory Boards Act. I want to thank my friend from North Carolina for his work, and I want to thank my friend from Washington for his work as well on what really should be a bipartisan bill. Honestly, I think the American public, Mr. Chairman, will take a look at what is happening here on the floor and are going to be baffled by it as well. As a small-business owner, let me just tell you, Mr. Chairman, there are nearly 29 million small businesses in our Nation; 99 percent of all employer firms in the United States are considered small businesses; over 56 million Americans work in these small businesses; and two- thirds of all net new jobs. Last I checked, the labor force participation rate is near a three- decade low, so the net new jobs that we are looking for are created by small business. Two-thirds are created by small business. This is a bill that would basically say to the CFPB: we want you to have a small business advisory board. With all of the businesses that are out there, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, an agency in Washington that sets the rules and regulations with far-reaching impacts into our economy, completely fails to ensure that small businesses have a permanent seat at the table when the CFPB is making decisions, making decisions that impact the lives of millions of Americans and businesses across the land. [[Page H2339]] This is a commonsense piece of legislation. If we are going to talk about small businesses, my goodness, please, let's talk about having small business representation at the table. Mr. Chairman, there are a lot of decisions that get made in this Chamber. There are a lot of decisions that get made in Washington. I have to tell you, one of the things that I try to do is I try to surround myself with people that it impacts. If we are going to talk about health care, I try to surround myself with physicians and patients and nurses, to try to get their input in terms of how this bill or how a bill that comes to the floor would impact them. Surround yourself with people that might know more about a topic than you do; educate yourself. The fact that the CFPB doesn't already have a small business advisory board or small business voice at the table is unacceptable-- unacceptable in today's day and age. This is something that we need to support. Frankly, I want it to be a bipartisan bill. I think the underlying substance of it is bipartisan, and only at the last minute are we talking about not making this a bipartisan bill over the pay-for. Mr. Chairman, I want you to think about this for a second as a business that gets regulated time and again. They don't come with a pay-for there. Basically, they say: this is what we need you to do, and you find a way to pay for it. The CHAIR. The time of the gentleman has expired. Mr. NEUGEBAUER. I yield the gentleman an additional 1 minute. Mr. DOLD. This body is, in essence, saying to the CFPB, Mr. Chairman, to the CFPB and Director Cordray, we are saying: please get small business input into what you are thinking. In order to do that, the dollars that are out there, Mr. Chairman, are talking about trying to fly people in, small businesses in. That is where the dollars are coming from. We think the CBO has scored this at about $9 million out of nearly a $7 billion budget over 10 years. Surely, this can't be the thing that is killing the bill. There has got to be something bigger that is killing the bill because, frankly, the American public, Mr. Chairman, are going to roll their eyes and say: you have got to be kidding me. We are going to disregard small businesses from being able to come in and weigh in on something that is going to drastically impact the economy because they don't want to take what could potentially be $9 million in airfare and other things to try to make sure they can get the small business advisory board to come to Washington. If we find that there is a problem, I will be the first one to reach across the aisle to say we need to fix this. This is a problem that we need to solve, and I encourage my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support this bill to get small businesses engaged. Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Chairman, I first need to remind the gentleman from Illinois that Mr. Heck worked hard to put small business advisory at the table and to codify the other businesses that the CFPB had already put at the table. They snatched it right away from the table. They took away small business. I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. Ellison), who is the cochair of the Progressive Caucus and a member of the Financial Services Committee. {time} 1715 Mr. ELLISON. I would like to thank the gentlewoman for the time. Mr. Chairman, I will just remind my colleagues that, yes, the bill was bipartisan, but the amendment was not. The amendment, which was rigidly partisan, is what has put this good idea in a space of being very partisan on this House floor. You would have thought that after the hard work that Mr. Heck had put into this bill that maybe somebody would have listened to him and would have said, ``Mr. Heck, you have put your time in on this bill. We are not going to do this to your bill. We are going to stick with that bipartisanship that we had all along,'' but that kind of consideration has gone missing in this place. The truth is, Mr. Chairman, that the Republican leadership has brought us another bill in a long series of bills to weaken the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, and no small-business person who is listening to this debate should be bamboozled, tricked, or led astray in believing that the rhetoric on this floor is about helping them. The fact is that a lot of small-business people are protected by predatory lenders that the CFPB stops. A lot of small-business people open their businesses with a credit card. They rely on the CFPB to keep the predation away from them. They, in fact, are the beneficiaries of the work of the CFPB's. All of these bills to attack the CFPB harm the American people. These bills make it easier to steer customers into costly loans that strip their wealth and limit their economic mobility. These bills divert CFPB resources from protecting consumers to costly, unnecessary, bureaucratic activities. Last week, we had a bill to repeal the CFPB rules that protect buyers of manufactured homes from what had been before Dodd-Frank a predatory market. Enough Democrats voted ``no'' on H.R. 650 to sustain the President's veto. That is a good thing. We should not remove consumer protections for high-cost loans that are targeted at buyers of manufactured homes. Also last week, the GOP brought another bill which would weaken the CFPB protections against controlled business arrangements in real estate transactions. Today, the Republican majority considers what is a good idea. H.R. 1195 would require the CFPB to establish a small business advisory council. It is a pretty fair idea. You could argue that it is already there, but if you don't believe it is, it is not at all a highly objectionable bill. In fact, it has merit. What is wrong with a little bit more input from small business? That is a good thing. The fact of the matter is that it is a Trojan horse that is being used to attack the CFPB all over again. My question is this: Why would you want to destroy an organization that has identified $5.3 billion, which is the approximate amount of relief to consumers ordered by the CFPB enforcement actions? It is $5.3 billion that hard-working Americans have saved from predatory lenders. Why in the world, unless you favor predation in financial markets, would you be against the CFPB? There are 15 million consumers who receive relief because of the CFPB, and I hope they let their voices be heard all across the United States against these people who relentlessly try to rip down the CFPB. $208 million is the amount of money that has been ordered to be paid in civil penalties as a result of CFPB's enforcement actions against people who do not help the market but who distort the market. The CFPB helps business because good, honest, decent businesses--and America is full of them, the ones that play by the rules--get harmed when a cheater goes without being punished. When a business that cuts corners and abuses consumers does not get eliminated from the market or punished because of its bad behavior, it means that playing by the rules is no longer profitable or the thing to do. The CFPB makes the market work as it should. There were 145 banks and credit unions under the CFPB's supervisory authority as of June 2014. That is a good thing. There are 30 million consumers with debts in collection, and larger debt collection companies are now under Federal supervision for the first time because of the CFPB. The CFPB is a good institution. Vote ``no'' on this Trojan horse bill. Mr. NEUGEBAUER. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself 1 minute. I am delighted to hear that my colleagues on the other side of the aisle are concerned about $9 million. I wish they had been as concerned when we had hearings and we found out that the CFPB is going to spend $216 million on the luxury renovations of a building that they do not own and when we found out that the taxpayers are also going to get to fund a two-story waterfall that falls into sunken gardens and that has a four-story glass staircase. How about the spending of $14 million on marketing and advertising? How about the $61.3 million they spent on management consulting fees? [[Page H2340]] It should be an affront to small businesses around the country that an organization that can't control its spending is being asked not to spend an additional $9 million so that small businesses can have a voice at the table. Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. Pittenger). Mr. PITTENGER. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Chairman, really what we are talking about are the merits of entitling this enormous agency, the largest in the history of this country, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, to be accountable to nobody, not to be accountable to the executive branch and not to be accountable to the Congress. They are able to do whatever they want to do. They make all of their own rules. They determine the winners, and they determine the losers. They have zero accountability. Let's discuss their funding of $6.7 billion over a 10-year period. Yes, what we are talking about is an offset to pay for an advisory board to protect small business--$9 million. That is 0.1 percent. Let's look at the priorities then of the CFPB's. Truly, would any of us lease a building, not own it, and spend $260 million on renovations? That is more per square foot than of any luxury hotel in Las Vegas. Yes, how about a two-story waterfall into a sunken garden? How magnificent. Is that more important than an advisory board that is for small business to ensure that we can create jobs? How about a green roof and a four-story glass staircase? It costs millions. Is that more important than an advisory board for small business? How about a tree bosk and a timber porch--how lovely--so that employees can have a place of restful contemplation and meditation? Do bureaucrats really need a serene place to rest while they are on the job? Are they that concerned about their plight? My goodness. Here are struggling, hardworking, tax-paying Americans who are trying to build their businesses, who are trying to find capital, who are looking to community banks that are under siege with burdensome regulations. It is the same as the major banks. This isn't right. This makes no sense. This is not fair. We need to get priority where priority is due. Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from Wisconsin (Ms. Moore). She serves on the Financial Services Committee and is a strong supporter of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau's. Ms. MOORE. Thank you so much, Madam Ranking Member. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to H.R. 1195 and not because I don't think it is a wonderful idea that Mr. Heck has come up with, along with his colleague from the Republican side, for a small business advisory panel within the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. Prior to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, we had example, after example, after example of Wall Street's preying on consumers and treating working class Americans just like an ATM in order to feather their bonuses; but here, today, we find yet another not so veiled attempt to defund the CFPB. I guess I could take the PAYGO rules a little bit more seriously if just last week we had not repealed the estate tax to the tune of $270 billion for the 6,000 wealthiest Americans. It is a tax from which only 6,000 people will benefit. I am certainly not looking for a pay-for. I am just pointing out the hypocrisy of the notion that we have got to offset this $9 million for the CFPB. As has been mentioned, the CFPB has returned $5.3 billion to more than 15 million consumers who have been harmed by financial fraud, and I think PAYGO is just more of a convenient excuse to cut the CFPB than an actual principle that we follow here. I urge my colleagues to stand up for American consumers. Oppose these attempts to attack the CFPB and to expose our constituents to these emboldened financial fraud centers. Let's reject H.R. 1195. Mr. NEUGEBAUER. Mr. Chairman, may I inquire as to how much time is remaining on both sides. The CHAIR. The gentleman from Texas has 11\1/2\ minutes remaining, and the gentlewoman from California has 5 minutes remaining. Mr. NEUGEBAUER. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time. Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from Maryland (Ms. Edwards). Ms. EDWARDS. I thank the ranking member for yielding. Mr. Chairman, I came to this floor opposed to this version of H.R. 1195, and as I have listened to the debate, I have become even more opposed to the legislation. Most fifth graders know a Trojan horse when they see one, and today's legislation is, indeed, a Trojan horse. Let me tell you why. Once again, Republicans are trying to roll back and limit consumer protections. Once again, they are attacking the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau by adding burdensome legislation that replicates what the Bureau is already doing and by stripping funding from the CFPB in future years. Let's remember that this was the agency that was created to prevent the very abusive practices that led to the 2008 financial crisis; yet here they go, pretending to help small businesses and community banks and credit unions but are gutting the agency that is responsible for protecting consumers. Just 6 years ago, we saw the fallout of the financial crisis right in my district in Prince George's County and in Baltimore City, where homeowners lost their homes. It was Black and Latino families who suffered the most in Prince George's County and Baltimore City, and it is not over for us. Many of those homeowners were small-business owners, and they used their homes to leverage their businesses. They can't do that anymore because they are still underwater and because the rules are still set against them. We are still in crisis, and we need a robust, unencumbered, unburdened Consumer Financial Protection Bureau to protect consumers, homeowners, and small businesses that are still struggling and are vulnerable. We need a robust lifeline CFPB as our credit unions and community banks are struggling. They need real relief that is hidden behind this Trojan horse legislation. Many of my Republican colleagues have long opposed the CFPB, and they have long sought to dismantle it. This legislation is no different, and it needs to be defeated. If they want bipartisan legislation, we need to start all over again and do something that really is in the interest of consumers. Mr. NEUGEBAUER. Mr. Chairman, we have no further speakers, and I reserve the balance of my time. Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I think that we have done a very good job on this side of the aisle of exposing what is happening on the opposite side of the aisle as simply an attempt to try and gut and demean the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. {time} 1730 Let me just deal with this argument that they made about the cost of renovation for the CFPB. Bloomberg Businessweek, in an article, entitled, ``Republican Attacks on a CFPB Office Renovation Don't Add Up,'' found that Republicans took liberties with their math. Using data from a report prepared by the CFPB's inspector general, Bloomberg found that renovation would only cost $421 per square foot, if you inflate the price by including rental of temporary space and paying for movers, compared to the GOP claim of $590. Actual construction costs are only $283 per square foot, half of what the Republicans claim. However, and I think this is very interesting, there is one very expensive renovation happening in Washington, D.C., right now. It is the Cannon House Office Building, which houses Members and committees of the House of Representatives. All end costs for the renovation of the Cannon Building approved by Speaker Boehner will be $753 million, or $911 per square foot, much pricier than the Bellagio or the Burj Khalifa. If we want to talk about what is high cost, take a look at ourselves right here in Congress for what we are doing. Having said that, I just wonder why the continued attempts on the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. Maybe it is because somebody else is being protected. Let's look at some of the work of the Bureau: a January 2015 settlement [[Page H2341]] against J.P. Morgan and Wells Fargo for $35.7 million after uncovering a scheme where loan officers illegally referred customers to affiliated businesses in exchange for cash and marketing services. Look at a July 2014 settlement against Rome Finance for $92 million for a predatory lending scheme that targeted servicemembers by hiding finance charges, withholding information from billing statements, and engaging in illegal debt collection practices. Another settlement from July 2014 against payday lender ACE Cash Express for $10 million for intentionally trapping consumers in a cycle of debt, a practice formalized in their employee training materials, as well as illegal debt collection practices, including harassment. I could go on and on and on how the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau has taken on some of the biggest corporations, the biggest businesses in this country to protect consumers. What is it you are afraid of? What is it you are worried about? Why are you trying to kill the agency that is protecting consumers rather than applauding them for making sure that the consumers don't continue to be taken advantage of the way they were prior to 2008 when we didn't have any consumer protection? I ask you to question yourselves about why you hate the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau so much. I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. NEUGEBAUER. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself the balance of my time. I have read H.R. 1195. Let me tell you what it doesn't do first. It doesn't shut down the CFPB. It doesn't keep the Bureau from carrying out its mission of consumer protection--so all of those things that the other side has been saying that the CFPB has been doing in a positive way, they can continue to do that--nor will the employees of CFPB have to take a pay cut, nor will the construction project and the other consulting fees that they keep passing out be impacted in any way. So the charge on the other side that somehow Republicans are trying to kill CFPB, I think you need to go back and read the bill. The bill doesn't say anything about killing the CFPB. What does H.R. 1195 do? It provides a voice for small businesses in this country, the number one job creators in America, the people that are day in and day out on the front line in our communities. It allows them to have a voice with an agency that has a huge impact on the future of this country. It also codifies and makes sure that community banks and credit unions have a voice at the table in the future. One of the bill's sponsors said he was sad. I am sad. I am sad that people today are on this floor arguing that paying for a program that will provide a voice for our small businesses is a point of contention, that somehow we are not acting in a bipartisan way. This is a bipartisan bill. It passed by voice vote in the last Congress. It passed overwhelmingly, I think 55-5, in the Committee on Financial Services just a week ago. I think we have to focus on what this bill does. This bill does make sure that small businesses have a voice moving forward. If we have a government that doesn't listen to the people, then we do not have good government. So this bill is about good government. It is about saying to the American people: Hey, the bureaucrats may not have all the answers, so it is good to bring the people that have been out there that are running businesses that have some expertise in those areas that this agency is trying to regulate and set precedence for, it is good for government to listen to the people. So, Mr. Chairman, I encourage my colleagues to pass and vote for H.R. 1195. I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. CUMMINGS. Mr. Chair, as originally introduced, H.R. 1195 was that rare piece of legislation with bipartisan support. It supported the simple proposition that the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) could benefit from the guidance of advisory councils comprised of representatives from small businesses, credit unions, and community banks. As introduced, the legislation would have required the CFPB to hear from small business representatives regarding the impact of proposed rules on financial products used by consumers for family and household purposes. The bill also encouraged the CFPB to ensure the participation of credits unions and community banks that serve traditionally underserved communities. The CFPB--and all relevant government agencies--should continue to focus on expanding banking opportunities in underserved communities, which are too often subjected to the worst forms of predatory financial practices. According to the Corporation for Enterprise Development, my hometown of Baltimore, Maryland, is one of the top ten unbanked large cities in the country--13.9 percent of residents have no checking or savings account, and more than one in four residents is underbanked. Too many of these folks rely on alternative financial services like check- cashing stores, rent-to-own agreements, or pawnshops. While Maryland has instituted a 33 percent usury cap and storefront payday lending operations do not exist in the state, Maryland residents with small-dollar credit needs have continued to turn to on-line lenders--lenders that are too often perpetrating fraudulent and abusive practices. But this does not need to be the reality in Baltimore or any American city. According to the Urban Institute, the small-dollar credit market in the United States reached approximately $21.4 billion in 2012. Credit unions and community banks across the country have begun to tap into this market by experimenting with small-dollar, short-term loans that help consumers stretch their monthly budgets or pay for emergency expenses without trapping them in a cycle of debt. The CFPB has taken a critical first step toward reforming the small- dollar industry by releasing proposals for a potential rule that would require short-term lenders to either ensure borrowers have the ability to repay their loans or to provide affordable repayment plans. This is why I was so disappointed by a recent amendment to H.R. 1195 from the Rules Committee that would pay for the new advisory councils the bill would create by capping or reducing the CFPB budget by $45 million over five years and $100 million over ten years. In contrast, the Congressional Budget Office has estimated that the new councils would cost only $9 million over ten years--confirming that the new amendment is nothing more than an attempt to slash the CFPB budget. By transforming a simple bill into a major budget cut, this amendment is simply another in a series of continuing attacks on the work of the CFPB, which has provided $5.3 billion in relief to consumers since its creation. Just as the CFPB embarks on its latest effort to protect consumers from predatory and abusive practices, we simply cannot afford a weakened consumer protection agency. As amended, H.R. 1195 is not only a disappointment--it's an insult to the same underserved communities the bill would have helped the CFPB to better serve. I urge my colleagues to reject this bill and its attempt to undercut protections for working American families. The CHAIR. All time for general debate has expired.

Amendment No. 1 Offered by Ms. Kuster The CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 1 printed in part D of House Report 114-74. Ms. KUSTER. Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk, amendment No. 1, and I offer that amendment at this time. The CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment. The text of the amendment is as follows: Page 4, beginning on line 19, strike ``is encouraged to ensure the participation of'' and insert ``shall include members representing''. Page 5, beginning on line 12, strike ``is encouraged to ensure the participation of'' and insert ``shall include members representing''. Page 6, beginning on line 6, strike ``is encouraged to ensure the participation of'' and insert ``shall include members representing''. The CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 200, the gentlewoman from New Hampshire (Ms. Kuster) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from New Hampshire. Ms. KUSTER. Mr. Chair, my amendment is straightforward. The underlying bill encourages but does not require the Director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau to include women-owned small businesses and minority-owned small businesses in the membership of the small business advisory board. The bill also encourages the Director to include financial institutions predominantly serving traditionally underserved communities in the membership of the Credit Union Advisory Council and the Community Bank Advisory Council. My amendment would simply change the underlying bill to make the inclusion of these groups a requirement, to ensure that a broad and diverse range of voices are included in these bodies. Federal regulators should listen to stakeholders when writing new rules for our economy, and this amendment will help ensure that these advisory boards are more representative of the American people. I urge support for my amendment, and I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. NEUGEBAUER. Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition to this amendment. The CHAIR. The gentleman from Texas is recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. NEUGEBAUER. Mr. Chairman, the underlying language in this bill was a bipartisan agreement that was worked out in the last Congress. When we were marking up this bill previously, it was brought up that minority representation would be important to this bill, and so the chairman of the committee, Mr. Hensarling, actually stopped the deliberation there and worked in a bipartisan way across the aisle with Ms. Waters to make sure that we put language in the bill that would encourage the Director to make sure that women and minorities' business concerns on the small business advisory board were taken into consideration. We have addressed that, and we kept that language that was agreed to and, by the way, was passed by a voice vote. Mr. Pittenger accepted that amendment, and the bill reported out of the committee 53-5. So, basically, we have kept our word and kept in the spirit of the agreement that was negotiated in the previous Congress, and that language is in this underlying bill. I would encourage folks not to vote for this amendment. I reserve the balance of my time. Ms. KUSTER. Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. NEUGEBAUER. Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time. The CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentlewoman from New Hampshire (Ms. Kuster). The question was taken; and the Chair announced that the noes appeared to have it. Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Chair, I demand a recorded vote. The CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further proceedings on the amendment offered by the gentlewoman from New Hampshire will be postponed. Amendment No. 2 Offered by Ms. Kuster The CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 2 printed in part D of House Report 114-74. Ms. KUSTER. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk, amendment No. 2. I offer that amendment at this time. The CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment. The text of the amendment is as follows: Page 4, line 20, strike ``minority- and women-owned'' and insert ``minority-, women-, and veteran-owned''. The CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 200, the gentlewoman from New Hampshire (Ms. Kuster) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes. [[Page H2343]] The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from New Hampshire. Ms. KUSTER. Mr. Chair, the underlying bill before us today authorizes a small business advisory board to advise the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau on small business concerns and practices. I agree that small businesses must have a seat at the table when Federal regulators make decisions with wide-ranging consequences for our economy, and I appreciate that this legislation already encourages the participation of women-owned and minority-owned small businesses on the board. Women and minority entrepreneurs often have unique perspectives and concerns, and the CFPB would be well served by seeking and heeding their input. Similarly, as a member of the Committee on Veterans' Affairs, I believe that veteran entrepreneurs have unique perspectives and experiences in the economy, and I believe that the small business advisory board would be strengthened by the inclusion of veteran small- business owners. To that end, my amendment simply encourages the CFPB Director to also include veteran-owned small businesses in the membership of the small business advisory board. After fighting to protect the American Dream for all of us, many veterans have realized that same American Dream by starting their own business upon their return to civilian life. We owe it to our returning heroes to support their success. I urge support for my amendment, and I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. NEUGEBAUER. Madam Chair, I claim the time in opposition to this amendment, although I am not opposed to it. The Acting CHAIR (Ms. Foxx). Without objection, the gentleman from Texas is recognized for 5 minutes. There was no objection. Mr. NEUGEBAUER. I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from New Hampshire (Mr. Guinta). Mr. GUINTA. I would like to thank Chairman Neugebauer for yielding me this time. Madam Chair, it is an honor to stand alongside my fellow Granite State colleague in support of her amendment. Our State of New Hampshire has one of the highest populations of veterans per capita in the United States. Because of this, both the gentlelady from New Hampshire and myself understand the importance of working together to support our Nation's veterans and veteran-owned businesses. There are hundreds of veteran-owned businesses just in New Hampshire alone, and we need to ensure that our commitment does not end with their term of commitment to our military. I thank the gentlelady from New Hampshire for her amendment. I urge my colleagues both on the committee and in the full House to support this amendment. I would encourage them to support H.R. 1195, despite the objections of the 0.0015 percent in the pay-for that was earlier discussed. Mr. NEUGEBAUER. Madam Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume to say that we support this. It is a thoughtful amendment. I yield back the balance of my time. {time} 1745 Ms. KUSTER. Madam Chair, I yield such time as she may consume to the gentlewoman from California (Ms. Maxine Waters). Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Madam Chairman, I rise in support of this amendment. I would like to thank the gentlewoman from New Hampshire for offering this measure, which will ensure that the concerns of our Nation's veteran-owned businesses are represented on the small business advisory board this legislation creates. Madam Chairman, our Nation's veterans heroically put their lives on the line for this country. And when they come home and decide to start a small business, they are carrying forth that patriotic duty by taking another risk for the betterment of our Nation. Just as our Nation has a responsibility to care for those who return from battle, we too have a duty to ensure those who have served in our Armed Forces have a voice at the table, in whatever vocation they enter. Early on, the CFPB recognized the unique needs of servicemembers, veterans, and their families by creating an office targeted to address their needs. Likewise, small businesses owned by veterans comprise a subset of our Nation's economic backbone that should not be ignored. This amendment ensures that the CFPB is made aware of their views, perspectives, and interests in the same manner as all small-business owners. But Madam Chairman, while I support this amendment and believe in its goals, I remain strongly opposed to the underlying bill, which would impose cuts to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and would set a precedent that could ultimately lead to a time when the Nation's leading consumer advocate is cash-strapped, underfunded, and financially unable to ensure that the views of veteran business owners--or any other business owners--are appropriately taken into account. Ms. KUSTER. Madam Chair, I yield back the balance of my time. The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentlewoman from New Hampshire (Ms. Kuster). The amendment was agreed to. Mr. NEUGEBAUER. Madam Chair, I move that the Committee do now rise. The motion was agreed to. Accordingly, the Committee rose; and the Speaker pro tempore (Mr. Guinta) having assumed the chair, Ms. Foxx, Acting Chair of the Committee of the Whole House on the state of the Union, reported that that Committee, having had under consideration the bill (H.R. 1195) to amend the Consumer Financial Protection Act of 2010 to establish advisory boards, and for other purposes, had come to no resolution thereon. ____________________","Congressional Record, Volume 161 Issue 58 (Tuesday, April 21, 2015) [Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 58 (Tuesday, April 21, 2015)] [House] [Pages H2335-H2343] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] BUREAU OF CONSUMER FINANCIAL PROTECTION ADVISORY BOARDS ACT general leave Mr. NEUGEBAUER. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and submit extraneous materials on the bill, H.R. 1195, to amend the Consumer Financial Protection Act of 2010 to establish advisory boards, and for other purposes. The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Pittenger). Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Texas? There was no objection. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to House Resolution 200 and rule XVIII, the Chair declares the House in the Committee of the Whole House on the state of the Union for the consideration of the bill, H.R. 1195. The Chair appoints the gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. Duncan) to preside over the Committee of the Whole. {time} 1637 In the Committee of the Whole Accordingly, the House resolved itself into the Committee of the Whole House on the state of the Union for the consideration of the bill (H.R. 1195) to amend the Consumer Financial Protection Act of 2010 to establish advisory boards, and for other purposes, with Mr. Duncan of Tennessee in the chair. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The CHAIR. Pursuant to the rule, the bill is considered read the first time. The gentleman from Texas (Mr. Neugebauer) and the gentlewoman from California (Ms. Maxine Waters) each will control 30 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Texas. Mr. NEUGEBAUER. Mr. Chairman, today the House considers H.R. 1195, the Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection Advisory Boards Act. This bill is essential to provide small businesses a voice in the regulatory process and to help ensure community banks and credit unions continue to have a voice at the CFPB going forward. Small businesses are the backbone of our economy, yet our regulatory system silences these hard-working Americans. Regulations meant for large corporations trickle down and have disproportionate impacts on Main Street businesses. We must remember that these businesses are, by and large, owned and operated by our neighbors and friends. They represent a life's work and a vision of the American Dream. The CFPB was created to protect consumers in the financial marketplace, and it would seem impossible to responsibly undertake this endeavor of protecting the American consumer without consulting institutions that are most closely associated with the American consumer: small businesses and community financial institutions. H.R. 1195 is a straightforward and bipartisan piece of legislation. It would amend the Dodd-Frank Act to create a small business advisory board to advise the CFPB. This bill would also codify two other advisory committees created by Director Cordray: the Credit Union Advisory Council and the Community Bank Advisory Council. [[Page H2336]] Under H.R. 1195, each board or council would advise the CFPB regarding concerns of its established membership. The Director of the CFPB would be required to appoint at least 15, but not more than 20, members to each board or council. This bill is publicly supported by the following organizations: the Credit Union National Association, the National Association of Federal Credit Unions, the Texas Land Title Association, the American Land Title Association, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the Independent Community Bankers of America. Mr. Chairman, this is a truly a commonsense and bipartisan bill. Last Congress, an identical piece of legislation passed the House by voice vote. This Congress, H.R. 1195 passed out of the committee by a vote of 53-5. The ranking member, who is with us today, has voted for this bill two times, yet we find ourselves here today debating the merits of providing a voice for small businesses and community financial institutions. This week, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton was questioned about the health of American businesses. She said she was ``surprised'' to learn that small businesses were struggling. Mr. Chairman, H.R. 1195 is just one small and commonsense step to providing a voice for our small businesses and community financial institutions in the regulatory process. It helps ensure that politicians and Washington bureaucrats aren't surprised to learn of the plight and struggles of these Main Street pillars. It gives these hard- working Americans a voice and a seat at the table. Now, Democrats are going to say that our disagreement is with how the bill is paid for. Well, let me address that for a minute. House rules require that any increase in mandatory spending be offset with a reduction in mandatory spending elsewhere. The CBO says H.R. 1195 will cost $9 million, in total, over the next 10 years. Republicans simply reduced the maximum amount that the CFPB can draw from the Fed over the same 10-year period to offset this cost. To put this into perspective, the CFPB, by statute, can draw approximately $6.7 billion over the next 10 years. This offset that we are debating today amounts to 0.1 percent of this amount. If Democrats really want to claim that a 0.1 percent reduction in the $6.7 billion that CFPB can spend over the next decade really threatens the Bureau's mission, perhaps it is time to examine the Bureau's current spending practices. I am quite confident that we can debate spending problems at the CFPB for the rest of the afternoon, should we need to. Just to reiterate, H.R. 1195 will not cut spending on consumer protection. Let me repeat that. Just to reiterate, H.R. 1195 will not cut spending on consumer protection. It will provide a voice for small businesses. Let's help our small businesses succeed. Let's help Main Street prosper, and let's vote today to move H.R. 1195 forward. With that, I reserve the balance of my time. Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Chairman, I want the Members of the House to pay very close attention to this bill today because this bill represents tricks and games in ways that people don't often understand. But this is a prime example of how you take a good idea and mess it up. So I rise today in opposition to H.R. 1195, a measure that is, again, a shining example of how far Republicans will go to squander compromise, consensus, and good faith to advance an ideological anticonsumer agenda. The bill before us today is just the latest instance of Financial Services Committee Republicans snatching defeat from the jaws of victory. {time} 1645 It makes clear their commitment to do all they can to undercut the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. Let me say that again. They have spent so much time--amendment after amendment, attempt after attempt-- to try and gut and dismantle the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, and they have gone so far with this bill to undermine our efforts to be of assistance to small businesses and include them in a stronger advisory way to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau because they hate the Bureau so much. Well, again, they do all they can to undercut this Bureau, an agency with an extraordinary record of success protecting consumers, reining in bad actors, and ensuring that we do not return to the predatory practices that put this Nation on the verge of economic collapse less than 10 years ago. Mr. Chairman, as originally written, H.R. 1195 was a good and decent measure offered by my colleague, Mr. Heck from Washington State, and, again, I applaud him for his leadership. The straightforward proposal offered by Mr. Heck would codify two of the advisory boards that the CFPB voluntarily created related to community banks and credit unions, while also creating a new small business advisory board for small businesses. Along with many other requirements of the Bureau, these boards create additional avenues for input from the entities that they have been given the power to regulate under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform Act. So here is what we are talking about. The Bureau itself had created a number of advisory committees. Mr. Heck saw room for strengthening the ability of small businesses to have an advisory role, and so he created this bill. But, because, again, my friends on the opposite side of the aisle, the Republicans, hate the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau so much, they decided that they were going to play tricks and games and create an opportunity to reduce the funding so they could try and limit the Bureau's ability to do its work by adding all of these amendments. I am going to point out the tricks of these amendments as we go along here today. So in a rare show of bipartisanship, the Financial Services Committee passed H.R. 1195 by a vote of 53-5. Many of my Democratic colleagues supported the proposal, just as we have supported the many efforts of the CFPB to be responsive to the unique needs of small businesses, community banks, and credit unions. But, as usual, that bipartisanship was short-lived, as Chairman Hensarling added an amendment designed to pay for this measure by undermining the CFPB's authority and independent funding. I find it ironic that this House has determined now is the time to offset the cost of legislation. Don't forget, we have the pay-for kings and queens on that side of the aisle. They said, they worked for, and they made a big issue that everything must be paid for, except when they decide to try and slip something in that they don't pay for. And they have done that on this floor with some of these bills that we will be talking about. But with this bill, they decided a new kind of trick; and that is, let's find a way to take it from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau because not only will this pay for it, but this will reduce their ability to do their job paying for other things. Just last week, the House majority voted to repeal the estate tax without paying for it at a staggering cost of $269 billion. At a time when far too many Americans are struggling with stagnant wages and historic income inequality, my Republican counterparts seem all too willing to add to the Nation's deficit in order to pass giveaways for the richest 0.2 percent of Americans. Yet when it comes to a reasonable bill to enhance the voice of small businesses, community banks, and credit unions, which they claim to care so much about, the Republicans insist that the only way to pass the legislation is by cutting the CFPB--an agency that 84 percent of small-business owners support, according to polling from the small- business majority. The truth of the matter is that, after several years of attempting to cap CFPB funding, the Republicans have chosen to transform Mr. Heck's bill into a vehicle to make drastic cuts to the CFPB's budget. While my colleagues on the other side of the aisle will claim otherwise, the CFPB itself estimates Chairman Hensarling's poison pill amendment will cut its budget by about $45 million over the next 5 years and by $100 million over the next 10 years, capping it substantially less than the amount that they are currently able to request. [[Page H2337]] That means this vote is one to weaken an agency with the explicit mission of standing up for consumers and taxpayers who have been subject to the deceptive practices of unscrupulous corporations. The chairman's amendment guarantees that this otherwise bipartisan proposal will never become law, garnering significant opposition in the Senate and a veto threat from the Obama administration, who said this measure was ``solely intended to impede the CFPB's ability to carry out its mission of protecting consumers in the financial markets,'' and further, they said, ``could result in, among other things, undermining critical protections for families from abusive and predatory financial products.'' Mr. Chairman, Republicans could have chosen any number of offsets to account for the cost of this proposal or, as they have done so many times before, waive their CutGo rules. Make no mistake about the intent of the Hensarling amendment. It is designed to back Democrats into a corner by attaching an unacceptable provision cutting CFPB's budget to a proposal that Democrats supported in committee. The important work of the CFPB will not be undermined on our watch, and this backdoor attempt to cut its budget sets a dangerous precedent of using bipartisan bills as a way to sneak through measures that undermine the Bureau's independence and its ability to protect consumers. Mr. Chairman, we don't understand on this side of the aisle why it is that our Republican friends hate the CFPB so much and have done so much to undermine them, to undercut them, and to try to reduce their funding. They know as well as we know that prior to the establishment of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau that we put into Dodd- Frank's reforms, consumers had no protections in the Government of the United States of America. Our regulatory agencies were not doing their jobs. They say they were focused on safety and soundness. But who was working for the consumers? Nobody. And so now we have a Bureau working for the consumers that is doing a wonderful job. And here we have every attempt that you can dream of, every scheme that you can think of, being levied by our friends on the opposite side of the aisle because they want to kill the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. As I have said, this is not going to happen on our watch. They can try any trick that they want. We are on to it. With that, Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. NEUGEBAUER. Mr. Chairman, I would just remind the ranking member that the Republicans, during the Rules Committee hearing, asked if they had a pay-for that they would like to offer in substitute for that, and they chose not to. So I think what we are hearing is that the minority is choosing to say that small businesses in this country aren't worth $9 million. And what $9 million is is, in 3 minutes, that will be the increase in our national debt in this country. So Republicans do take our deficit seriously, and we take the rules of this House seriously because the rules of the House require that when you have an increase in mandatory spending, you have to have an offset for that. What Republicans were trying to do is follow the rules of the House. It is now my pleasure, Mr. Chairman, to yield as much time as he may consume to the gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. Pittenger), one of the primary sponsors of this legislation. Mr. PITTENGER. Mr. Chairman, I do rise today in support of H.R. 1195, the Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection Advisory Boards Act. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau continues to issue regulations designed for massive, systemic-risk financial institutions without considering how those same rules harm small businesses, community banks, and credit unions. That is why my good friend and colleague, Congressman Denny Heck, joined with me to establish a small business advisory board within the CFPB. The goal is simple: to advise and consult with the CFPB on how any proposed regulations would impact the small-business community. Members of the small business advisory board must represent a small business dealing with financial services products. The legislation also encourages the CFPB Director to ensure participation of women- and minority-owned small businesses when appointing members to the board. H.R. 1195 also makes permanent the Credit Union Advisory Council and the Community Bank Advisory Council, both of which are currently voluntary and can be eliminated at any time at the discretion of the CFPB Director. Credit unions and community banks are struggling under enormous compliance burdens designed for too-big-to-fail banks. They are hiring compliance officers instead of loan officers, meaning less access to capital for small businesses to grow and to create jobs. Clear and open communication between the CFPB, small businesses, community banks, and credit unions will improve rulemaking and lead to better outcomes for consumers. H.R. 1195 is supported by the Credit Union National Association, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the American Land Title Association, and the independent community bankers association. This legislation also enjoys strong bipartisan support, having passed out of the Financial Services Committee by a vote of 53-5. Allow me a moment to address the concern that was raised by the ranking member and other Democrat colleagues in their objection to how we propose to pay for the advisory boards. The CBO estimates this legislation will cost taxpayers $9 million over a 10-year period. In those same years, the CFPB will have access to $6.7 billion in operating funds. We propose making a very small reduction--just 0.1 percent--in the amount the CFPB is allowed to draw, which will pay for the advisory boards without additional cost to taxpayers. If the CFPB can't find $9 million in savings over 10 years out of a total potential draw of $6.7 billion, then they need another advisory board of small-business owners who will travel to D.C. and teach the CFPB how to budget. Mr. Chairman, our economy is growing today at a tepid pace of 2.2 percent. We have in reality about 12 percent unemployment when you consider the underemployed and when you consider those who have given up. Small banks and other lending institutions are under enormous compliance restrictions and guidelines, the same as the major banks. They need a voice at the table. We need opportunity. We need people to be able to expand their businesses, and yet they can't get capital through these small banking lending institutions. That is what this bill is all about. It is all about jobs. It is all about families and people's lives and their futures. The CFPB is supposed to be focused on protecting consumers, not protecting bureaucratic fiefdoms and perks. Our commonsense, bipartisan legislation helps focus the CFPB on their sole, core mission of benefiting consumers. Small businesses create jobs. Bureaucrats create rules. Please join me in supporting H.R. 1195 so that heavyhanded D.C. regulators are forced to take time to consider how their burdensome and unnecessary regulations negatively impact small business and make necessary adjustments to protect consumers while allowing small businesses, credit unions, and community banks to help grow the economy and create good-paying jobs. Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to support this bill. Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Chairman, I yield 10 minutes to the gentleman from Washington (Mr. Heck). He is the next gentleman that you are going to hear from this side of the aisle. He is the author of the legislation that certainly would have given small businesses a seat at the table of the CFPB. He worked very hard on this bill, and he is one of those persons on our committee who reaches across the aisle all the time on bipartisan efforts. {time} 1700 Mr. HECK of Washington. Mr. Chairman, in a gesture of reaching across the aisle, let us be clear that prior to this bill's arrival at the Rules Committee, it was Mr. Pittenger and myself who worked in a collaborative and in a bipartisan way, hard for nearly the last 2 years, to get it to this point where we might have an opportunity to vote upon it. I cannot exaggerate to you how saddened I am, how much I regret, and [[Page H2338]] how surreal I find it that I stand here now and ask my colleagues to please vote ``no'' against my bill, oppose the bill that I have worked so hard on for nearly 2 years. Its content, prior to its arrival in Rules, had been laid out commonsensically: codify the Credit Union Advisory Council; codify the Small Community Bank Advisory Council; and create a nonbank advisory board for the appraisers, the title insurers, the real estate agents, escrow company, all people that the Bureau regulates and with whom they should have an iterative conversation going with respect to the proposed regulations. It wasn't easy getting here even before Rules. There was a lot of back and forth, a lot of compromising along the way. We had to allay fears from the consumer groups that this was a Trojan horse. We accepted amendments; we broadened the bill; we did a lot of things together, but with a collaborative spirit and the support of the ranking member, we did pass the bill out of committee 53-5, and then a torch was put to it. A torch was put to it. As has been described, the bill now includes a so-called pay-for amendment to lower the cap of available funds to CFPB by $45 million by the year 2020 and $100 million by the year 2025. It is bad policy; it is bad precedent, and it is completely unnecessary. The amendment was inserted under color of being a pay-for. Well, I have got a couple problems with that. The first is obvious. CBO projection is $9 million. We are talking about a cap that cost $45 million and $100 million. It is a multiple of it--or $75 million to $100 million by last count. The second, of course, is the fact about how the rule is applied, which has been heralded here, and, in fact, genuflected as an important rule to provide for pay-fors when there are expenditures caused by proposed legislation. The motivation is, frankly, inscrutable to me. I honestly don't know how you do it with a straight face. Literally, a matter of hours ago, voting for $300 billion, with a ``b,'' with no PAYGO or pay-for and to stand up here and say, Well, we absolutely have to have a pay-for for $9 million over 10 years, but $300 billion was okay, I say sincerely: I don't know how you do that with a straight face. Frankly, there is so much about this that I find surreal. Much in the debate was about questioned architectural practices by the agency. The truth of the matter is GSA took over construction, what, 2-plus years ago? If that is the issue, write an amendment to the GSA budget; don't punish CFPB. It has been argued that this funding is unique; therefore, it has to be curtailed, unrelated to the underlying purpose of the bill. Maybe that is true. Check the history. It was a Republican who wanted it funded by the Fed--Mr. Shelby, I believe. That may be unique in that way. It has been suggested CFPB is nonbudgeted--again, unrelated to the underlying purpose of the bill. Well, guess what, so is every other bank, regulator, agency in the Federal Government: the FDIC, the OCC, the Fed itself, FHFA, and NCUA. They are all nonbudgeted; but, no, let's pick this one out of the pack and punish it. There is so much about this that is surreal to me. I believe that there is a bit of a trial under way here today, and we are laying a marker down on April 21 on whether or not we are actually going to be able to function in a bipartisan way. We did. It took hard work, 18- plus months with Mr. Pittenger, 53-5 in committee; and now, as I say, we are putting a torch to it. We are going to decide. This is a test. Are we going to use the CFPB as a piggybank to pay for all other manner of agendas? Are we going to ask them to swallow this poison pill in the goal of getting a bipartisan bill passed? It is a test of whether or not we are going to do that. It is an experiment to see how radically--and it is radical--we can change bills and still keep ``yes'' votes in the name of consistency, although there is certainly no consistency between the pay-fors provided in this proposed legislation and that for legislation that passed last week. By the way, in addition to the estate tax and the sales and use tax totalling over $300 billion, we did two CFPB bills last week, too. Nobody offered pay-fors on those, so it isn't consistent. This is surreal, standing here, asking you to oppose the bill that I have worked so hard on with Mr. Pittenger. It is surreal. I am reminded of my favorite passage in ``Through the Looking Glass.'' If I had a world of my own, everything would be nonsense. Nothing would be what it is because everything would be what it isn't. And contrariwise, what is, it wouldn't be. And what it wouldn't be, it would. You see? This is surreal; but I say my strongest assertion that what is the most sad about this--and I have said this in Rules, and I am going to say it now--you know, you know you are killing this bill. You are killing it and evidently don't care, 18 months of hard work out the window to do something good and worthwhile, but you know you are killing the bill. You know you are killing it because you are not passing here veto-proof; and the administration has, as the ranking member suggested, already issued the Statement of Administration Policy. I will go one further. This bill will never see the light of day in the United States Senate. You are killing the bill that we worked on for 2 years to help nonbank businesses have a better structured institutionalized relationship, which is as it should be, and you are doing it by inconsistently applying a House rule for which you grant waivers left and right when you were of a mind. This is good legislation. My friend from North Carolina has worked hard. Frankly--and I will say it--he deserves better than this. This bill deserves better than this. The businesses that are regulated by CFPB deserve better than this, than to kill this bill, which is what you are assuredly doing. Vote ``no'' on my bill. The CHAIR. The Chair reminds Members to direct their remarks to the Chair. Mr. NEUGEBAUER. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself 1 minute. I appreciate the gentleman's comments. I just want to remind him that the GSA only took over the management of the project, not the budget, so GSA doesn't have control over this entity's budget. I think the thing that is troubling to me is my colleagues are talking about a drastic cut. You have got an entity that can draw $6.7 billion over a 10-year period, and $7 million is a drastic cut. Basically, the CBO says that this bill now is revenue neutral, and these numbers that are coming of $45 million, those are CFPB's numbers, but these are the nonpartisan CBO numbers. I think one of the things we have to do is we have to deal in the facts and reality here, and this is a very small amount of money. At this time, Mr. Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Dold). Mr. DOLD. Mr. Chairman, I thank the chairman for yielding the time. Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong support of the Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection Advisory Boards Act. I want to thank my friend from North Carolina for his work, and I want to thank my friend from Washington for his work as well on what really should be a bipartisan bill. Honestly, I think the American public, Mr. Chairman, will take a look at what is happening here on the floor and are going to be baffled by it as well. As a small-business owner, let me just tell you, Mr. Chairman, there are nearly 29 million small businesses in our Nation; 99 percent of all employer firms in the United States are considered small businesses; over 56 million Americans work in these small businesses; and two- thirds of all net new jobs. Last I checked, the labor force participation rate is near a three- decade low, so the net new jobs that we are looking for are created by small business. Two-thirds are created by small business. This is a bill that would basically say to the CFPB: we want you to have a small business advisory board. With all of the businesses that are out there, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, an agency in Washington that sets the rules and regulations with far-reaching impacts into our economy, completely fails to ensure that small businesses have a permanent seat at the table when the CFPB is making decisions, making decisions that impact the lives of millions of Americans and businesses across the land. [[Page H2339]] This is a commonsense piece of legislation. If we are going to talk about small businesses, my goodness, please, let's talk about having small business representation at the table. Mr. Chairman, there are a lot of decisions that get made in this Chamber. There are a lot of decisions that get made in Washington. I have to tell you, one of the things that I try to do is I try to surround myself with people that it impacts. If we are going to talk about health care, I try to surround myself with physicians and patients and nurses, to try to get their input in terms of how this bill or how a bill that comes to the floor would impact them. Surround yourself with people that might know more about a topic than you do; educate yourself. The fact that the CFPB doesn't already have a small business advisory board or small business voice at the table is unacceptable-- unacceptable in today's day and age. This is something that we need to support. Frankly, I want it to be a bipartisan bill. I think the underlying substance of it is bipartisan, and only at the last minute are we talking about not making this a bipartisan bill over the pay-for. Mr. Chairman, I want you to think about this for a second as a business that gets regulated time and again. They don't come with a pay-for there. Basically, they say: this is what we need you to do, and you find a way to pay for it. The CHAIR. The time of the gentleman has expired. Mr. NEUGEBAUER. I yield the gentleman an additional 1 minute. Mr. DOLD. This body is, in essence, saying to the CFPB, Mr. Chairman, to the CFPB and Director Cordray, we are saying: please get small business input into what you are thinking. In order to do that, the dollars that are out there, Mr. Chairman, are talking about trying to fly people in, small businesses in. That is where the dollars are coming from. We think the CBO has scored this at about $9 million out of nearly a $7 billion budget over 10 years. Surely, this can't be the thing that is killing the bill. There has got to be something bigger that is killing the bill because, frankly, the American public, Mr. Chairman, are going to roll their eyes and say: you have got to be kidding me. We are going to disregard small businesses from being able to come in and weigh in on something that is going to drastically impact the economy because they don't want to take what could potentially be $9 million in airfare and other things to try to make sure they can get the small business advisory board to come to Washington. If we find that there is a problem, I will be the first one to reach across the aisle to say we need to fix this. This is a problem that we need to solve, and I encourage my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support this bill to get small businesses engaged. Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Chairman, I first need to remind the gentleman from Illinois that Mr. Heck worked hard to put small business advisory at the table and to codify the other businesses that the CFPB had already put at the table. They snatched it right away from the table. They took away small business. I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. Ellison), who is the cochair of the Progressive Caucus and a member of the Financial Services Committee. {time} 1715 Mr. ELLISON. I would like to thank the gentlewoman for the time. Mr. Chairman, I will just remind my colleagues that, yes, the bill was bipartisan, but the amendment was not. The amendment, which was rigidly partisan, is what has put this good idea in a space of being very partisan on this House floor. You would have thought that after the hard work that Mr. Heck had put into this bill that maybe somebody would have listened to him and would have said, ``Mr. Heck, you have put your time in on this bill. We are not going to do this to your bill. We are going to stick with that bipartisanship that we had all along,'' but that kind of consideration has gone missing in this place. The truth is, Mr. Chairman, that the Republican leadership has brought us another bill in a long series of bills to weaken the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, and no small-business person who is listening to this debate should be bamboozled, tricked, or led astray in believing that the rhetoric on this floor is about helping them. The fact is that a lot of small-business people are protected by predatory lenders that the CFPB stops. A lot of small-business people open their businesses with a credit card. They rely on the CFPB to keep the predation away from them. They, in fact, are the beneficiaries of the work of the CFPB's. All of these bills to attack the CFPB harm the American people. These bills make it easier to steer customers into costly loans that strip their wealth and limit their economic mobility. These bills divert CFPB resources from protecting consumers to costly, unnecessary, bureaucratic activities. Last week, we had a bill to repeal the CFPB rules that protect buyers of manufactured homes from what had been before Dodd-Frank a predatory market. Enough Democrats voted ``no'' on H.R. 650 to sustain the President's veto. That is a good thing. We should not remove consumer protections for high-cost loans that are targeted at buyers of manufactured homes. Also last week, the GOP brought another bill which would weaken the CFPB protections against controlled business arrangements in real estate transactions. Today, the Republican majority considers what is a good idea. H.R. 1195 would require the CFPB to establish a small business advisory council. It is a pretty fair idea. You could argue that it is already there, but if you don't believe it is, it is not at all a highly objectionable bill. In fact, it has merit. What is wrong with a little bit more input from small business? That is a good thing. The fact of the matter is that it is a Trojan horse that is being used to attack the CFPB all over again. My question is this: Why would you want to destroy an organization that has identified $5.3 billion, which is the approximate amount of relief to consumers ordered by the CFPB enforcement actions? It is $5.3 billion that hard-working Americans have saved from predatory lenders. Why in the world, unless you favor predation in financial markets, would you be against the CFPB? There are 15 million consumers who receive relief because of the CFPB, and I hope they let their voices be heard all across the United States against these people who relentlessly try to rip down the CFPB. $208 million is the amount of money that has been ordered to be paid in civil penalties as a result of CFPB's enforcement actions against people who do not help the market but who distort the market. The CFPB helps business because good, honest, decent businesses--and America is full of them, the ones that play by the rules--get harmed when a cheater goes without being punished. When a business that cuts corners and abuses consumers does not get eliminated from the market or punished because of its bad behavior, it means that playing by the rules is no longer profitable or the thing to do. The CFPB makes the market work as it should. There were 145 banks and credit unions under the CFPB's supervisory authority as of June 2014. That is a good thing. There are 30 million consumers with debts in collection, and larger debt collection companies are now under Federal supervision for the first time because of the CFPB. The CFPB is a good institution. Vote ``no'' on this Trojan horse bill. Mr. NEUGEBAUER. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself 1 minute. I am delighted to hear that my colleagues on the other side of the aisle are concerned about $9 million. I wish they had been as concerned when we had hearings and we found out that the CFPB is going to spend $216 million on the luxury renovations of a building that they do not own and when we found out that the taxpayers are also going to get to fund a two-story waterfall that falls into sunken gardens and that has a four-story glass staircase. How about the spending of $14 million on marketing and advertising? How about the $61.3 million they spent on management consulting fees? [[Page H2340]] It should be an affront to small businesses around the country that an organization that can't control its spending is being asked not to spend an additional $9 million so that small businesses can have a voice at the table. Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. Pittenger). Mr. PITTENGER. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Chairman, really what we are talking about are the merits of entitling this enormous agency, the largest in the history of this country, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, to be accountable to nobody, not to be accountable to the executive branch and not to be accountable to the Congress. They are able to do whatever they want to do. They make all of their own rules. They determine the winners, and they determine the losers. They have zero accountability. Let's discuss their funding of $6.7 billion over a 10-year period. Yes, what we are talking about is an offset to pay for an advisory board to protect small business--$9 million. That is 0.1 percent. Let's look at the priorities then of the CFPB's. Truly, would any of us lease a building, not own it, and spend $260 million on renovations? That is more per square foot than of any luxury hotel in Las Vegas. Yes, how about a two-story waterfall into a sunken garden? How magnificent. Is that more important than an advisory board that is for small business to ensure that we can create jobs? How about a green roof and a four-story glass staircase? It costs millions. Is that more important than an advisory board for small business? How about a tree bosk and a timber porch--how lovely--so that employees can have a place of restful contemplation and meditation? Do bureaucrats really need a serene place to rest while they are on the job? Are they that concerned about their plight? My goodness. Here are struggling, hardworking, tax-paying Americans who are trying to build their businesses, who are trying to find capital, who are looking to community banks that are under siege with burdensome regulations. It is the same as the major banks. This isn't right. This makes no sense. This is not fair. We need to get priority where priority is due. Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from Wisconsin (Ms. Moore). She serves on the Financial Services Committee and is a strong supporter of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau's. Ms. MOORE. Thank you so much, Madam Ranking Member. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to H.R. 1195 and not because I don't think it is a wonderful idea that Mr. Heck has come up with, along with his colleague from the Republican side, for a small business advisory panel within the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. Prior to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, we had example, after example, after example of Wall Street's preying on consumers and treating working class Americans just like an ATM in order to feather their bonuses; but here, today, we find yet another not so veiled attempt to defund the CFPB. I guess I could take the PAYGO rules a little bit more seriously if just last week we had not repealed the estate tax to the tune of $270 billion for the 6,000 wealthiest Americans. It is a tax from which only 6,000 people will benefit. I am certainly not looking for a pay-for. I am just pointing out the hypocrisy of the notion that we have got to offset this $9 million for the CFPB. As has been mentioned, the CFPB has returned $5.3 billion to more than 15 million consumers who have been harmed by financial fraud, and I think PAYGO is just more of a convenient excuse to cut the CFPB than an actual principle that we follow here. I urge my colleagues to stand up for American consumers. Oppose these attempts to attack the CFPB and to expose our constituents to these emboldened financial fraud centers. Let's reject H.R. 1195. Mr. NEUGEBAUER. Mr. Chairman, may I inquire as to how much time is remaining on both sides. The CHAIR. The gentleman from Texas has 11\1/2\ minutes remaining, and the gentlewoman from California has 5 minutes remaining. Mr. NEUGEBAUER. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time. Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from Maryland (Ms. Edwards). Ms. EDWARDS. I thank the ranking member for yielding. Mr. Chairman, I came to this floor opposed to this version of H.R. 1195, and as I have listened to the debate, I have become even more opposed to the legislation. Most fifth graders know a Trojan horse when they see one, and today's legislation is, indeed, a Trojan horse. Let me tell you why. Once again, Republicans are trying to roll back and limit consumer protections. Once again, they are attacking the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau by adding burdensome legislation that replicates what the Bureau is already doing and by stripping funding from the CFPB in future years. Let's remember that this was the agency that was created to prevent the very abusive practices that led to the 2008 financial crisis; yet here they go, pretending to help small businesses and community banks and credit unions but are gutting the agency that is responsible for protecting consumers. Just 6 years ago, we saw the fallout of the financial crisis right in my district in Prince George's County and in Baltimore City, where homeowners lost their homes. It was Black and Latino families who suffered the most in Prince George's County and Baltimore City, and it is not over for us. Many of those homeowners were small-business owners, and they used their homes to leverage their businesses. They can't do that anymore because they are still underwater and because the rules are still set against them. We are still in crisis, and we need a robust, unencumbered, unburdened Consumer Financial Protection Bureau to protect consumers, homeowners, and small businesses that are still struggling and are vulnerable. We need a robust lifeline CFPB as our credit unions and community banks are struggling. They need real relief that is hidden behind this Trojan horse legislation. Many of my Republican colleagues have long opposed the CFPB, and they have long sought to dismantle it. This legislation is no different, and it needs to be defeated. If they want bipartisan legislation, we need to start all over again and do something that really is in the interest of consumers. Mr. NEUGEBAUER. Mr. Chairman, we have no further speakers, and I reserve the balance of my time. Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I think that we have done a very good job on this side of the aisle of exposing what is happening on the opposite side of the aisle as simply an attempt to try and gut and demean the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. {time} 1730 Let me just deal with this argument that they made about the cost of renovation for the CFPB. Bloomberg Businessweek, in an article, entitled, ``Republican Attacks on a CFPB Office Renovation Don't Add Up,'' found that Republicans took liberties with their math. Using data from a report prepared by the CFPB's inspector general, Bloomberg found that renovation would only cost $421 per square foot, if you inflate the price by including rental of temporary space and paying for movers, compared to the GOP claim of $590. Actual construction costs are only $283 per square foot, half of what the Republicans claim. However, and I think this is very interesting, there is one very expensive renovation happening in Washington, D.C., right now. It is the Cannon House Office Building, which houses Members and committees of the House of Representatives. All end costs for the renovation of the Cannon Building approved by Speaker Boehner will be $753 million, or $911 per square foot, much pricier than the Bellagio or the Burj Khalifa. If we want to talk about what is high cost, take a look at ourselves right here in Congress for what we are doing. Having said that, I just wonder why the continued attempts on the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. Maybe it is because somebody else is being protected. Let's look at some of the work of the Bureau: a January 2015 settlement [[Page H2341]] against J.P. Morgan and Wells Fargo for $35.7 million after uncovering a scheme where loan officers illegally referred customers to affiliated businesses in exchange for cash and marketing services. Look at a July 2014 settlement against Rome Finance for $92 million for a predatory lending scheme that targeted servicemembers by hiding finance charges, withholding information from billing statements, and engaging in illegal debt collection practices. Another settlement from July 2014 against payday lender ACE Cash Express for $10 million for intentionally trapping consumers in a cycle of debt, a practice formalized in their employee training materials, as well as illegal debt collection practices, including harassment. I could go on and on and on how the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau has taken on some of the biggest corporations, the biggest businesses in this country to protect consumers. What is it you are afraid of? What is it you are worried about? Why are you trying to kill the agency that is protecting consumers rather than applauding them for making sure that the consumers don't continue to be taken advantage of the way they were prior to 2008 when we didn't have any consumer protection? I ask you to question yourselves about why you hate the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau so much. I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. NEUGEBAUER. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself the balance of my time. I have read H.R. 1195. Let me tell you what it doesn't do first. It doesn't shut down the CFPB. It doesn't keep the Bureau from carrying out its mission of consumer protection--so all of those things that the other side has been saying that the CFPB has been doing in a positive way, they can continue to do that--nor will the employees of CFPB have to take a pay cut, nor will the construction project and the other consulting fees that they keep passing out be impacted in any way. So the charge on the other side that somehow Republicans are trying to kill CFPB, I think you need to go back and read the bill. The bill doesn't say anything about killing the CFPB. What does H.R. 1195 do? It provides a voice for small businesses in this country, the number one job creators in America, the people that are day in and day out on the front line in our communities. It allows them to have a voice with an agency that has a huge impact on the future of this country. It also codifies and makes sure that community banks and credit unions have a voice at the table in the future. One of the bill's sponsors said he was sad. I am sad. I am sad that people today are on this floor arguing that paying for a program that will provide a voice for our small businesses is a point of contention, that somehow we are not acting in a bipartisan way. This is a bipartisan bill. It passed by voice vote in the last Congress. It passed overwhelmingly, I think 55-5, in the Committee on Financial Services just a week ago. I think we have to focus on what this bill does. This bill does make sure that small businesses have a voice moving forward. If we have a government that doesn't listen to the people, then we do not have good government. So this bill is about good government. It is about saying to the American people: Hey, the bureaucrats may not have all the answers, so it is good to bring the people that have been out there that are running businesses that have some expertise in those areas that this agency is trying to regulate and set precedence for, it is good for government to listen to the people. So, Mr. Chairman, I encourage my colleagues to pass and vote for H.R. 1195. I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. CUMMINGS. Mr. Chair, as originally introduced, H.R. 1195 was that rare piece of legislation with bipartisan support. It supported the simple proposition that the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) could benefit from the guidance of advisory councils comprised of representatives from small businesses, credit unions, and community banks. As introduced, the legislation would have required the CFPB to hear from small business representatives regarding the impact of proposed rules on financial products used by consumers for family and household purposes. The bill also encouraged the CFPB to ensure the participation of credits unions and community banks that serve traditionally underserved communities. The CFPB--and all relevant government agencies--should continue to focus on expanding banking opportunities in underserved communities, which are too often subjected to the worst forms of predatory financial practices. According to the Corporation for Enterprise Development, my hometown of Baltimore, Maryland, is one of the top ten unbanked large cities in the country--13.9 percent of residents have no checking or savings account, and more than one in four residents is underbanked. Too many of these folks rely on alternative financial services like check- cashing stores, rent-to-own agreements, or pawnshops. While Maryland has instituted a 33 percent usury cap and storefront payday lending operations do not exist in the state, Maryland residents with small-dollar credit needs have continued to turn to on-line lenders--lenders that are too often perpetrating fraudulent and abusive practices. But this does not need to be the reality in Baltimore or any American city. According to the Urban Institute, the small-dollar credit market in the United States reached approximately $21.4 billion in 2012. Credit unions and community banks across the country have begun to tap into this market by experimenting with small-dollar, short-term loans that help consumers stretch their monthly budgets or pay for emergency expenses without trapping them in a cycle of debt. The CFPB has taken a critical first step toward reforming the small- dollar industry by releasing proposals for a potential rule that would require short-term lenders to either ensure borrowers have the ability to repay their loans or to provide affordable repayment plans. This is why I was so disappointed by a recent amendment to H.R. 1195 from the Rules Committee that would pay for the new advisory councils the bill would create by capping or reducing the CFPB budget by $45 million over five years and $100 million over ten years. In contrast, the Congressional Budget Office has estimated that the new councils would cost only $9 million over ten years--confirming that the new amendment is nothing more than an attempt to slash the CFPB budget. By transforming a simple bill into a major budget cut, this amendment is simply another in a series of continuing attacks on the work of the CFPB, which has provided $5.3 billion in relief to consumers since its creation. Just as the CFPB embarks on its latest effort to protect consumers from predatory and abusive practices, we simply cannot afford a weakened consumer protection agency. As amended, H.R. 1195 is not only a disappointment--it's an insult to the same underserved communities the bill would have helped the CFPB to better serve. I urge my colleagues to reject this bill and its attempt to undercut protections for working American families. The CHAIR. All time for general debate has expired.

Amendment No. 1 Offered by Ms. Kuster The CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 1 printed in part D of House Report 114-74. Ms. KUSTER. Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk, amendment No. 1, and I offer that amendment at this time. The CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment. The text of the amendment is as follows: Page 4, beginning on line 19, strike ``is encouraged to ensure the participation of'' and insert ``shall include members representing''. Page 5, beginning on line 12, strike ``is encouraged to ensure the participation of'' and insert ``shall include members representing''. Page 6, beginning on line 6, strike ``is encouraged to ensure the participation of'' and insert ``shall include members representing''. The CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 200, the gentlewoman from New Hampshire (Ms. Kuster) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from New Hampshire. Ms. KUSTER. Mr. Chair, my amendment is straightforward. The underlying bill encourages but does not require the Director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau to include women-owned small businesses and minority-owned small businesses in the membership of the small business advisory board. The bill also encourages the Director to include financial institutions predominantly serving traditionally underserved communities in the membership of the Credit Union Advisory Council and the Community Bank Advisory Council. My amendment would simply change the underlying bill to make the inclusion of these groups a requirement, to ensure that a broad and diverse range of voices are included in these bodies. Federal regulators should listen to stakeholders when writing new rules for our economy, and this amendment will help ensure that these advisory boards are more representative of the American people. I urge support for my amendment, and I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. NEUGEBAUER. Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition to this amendment. The CHAIR. The gentleman from Texas is recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. NEUGEBAUER. Mr. Chairman, the underlying language in this bill was a bipartisan agreement that was worked out in the last Congress. When we were marking up this bill previously, it was brought up that minority representation would be important to this bill, and so the chairman of the committee, Mr. Hensarling, actually stopped the deliberation there and worked in a bipartisan way across the aisle with Ms. Waters to make sure that we put language in the bill that would encourage the Director to make sure that women and minorities' business concerns on the small business advisory board were taken into consideration. We have addressed that, and we kept that language that was agreed to and, by the way, was passed by a voice vote. Mr. Pittenger accepted that amendment, and the bill reported out of the committee 53-5. So, basically, we have kept our word and kept in the spirit of the agreement that was negotiated in the previous Congress, and that language is in this underlying bill. I would encourage folks not to vote for this amendment. I reserve the balance of my time. Ms. KUSTER. Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. NEUGEBAUER. Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time. The CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentlewoman from New Hampshire (Ms. Kuster). The question was taken; and the Chair announced that the noes appeared to have it. Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Chair, I demand a recorded vote. The CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further proceedings on the amendment offered by the gentlewoman from New Hampshire will be postponed. Amendment No. 2 Offered by Ms. Kuster The CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 2 printed in part D of House Report 114-74. Ms. KUSTER. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk, amendment No. 2. I offer that amendment at this time. The CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment. The text of the amendment is as follows: Page 4, line 20, strike ``minority- and women-owned'' and insert ``minority-, women-, and veteran-owned''. The CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 200, the gentlewoman from New Hampshire (Ms. Kuster) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes. [[Page H2343]] The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from New Hampshire. Ms. KUSTER. Mr. Chair, the underlying bill before us today authorizes a small business advisory board to advise the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau on small business concerns and practices. I agree that small businesses must have a seat at the table when Federal regulators make decisions with wide-ranging consequences for our economy, and I appreciate that this legislation already encourages the participation of women-owned and minority-owned small businesses on the board. Women and minority entrepreneurs often have unique perspectives and concerns, and the CFPB would be well served by seeking and heeding their input. Similarly, as a member of the Committee on Veterans' Affairs, I believe that veteran entrepreneurs have unique perspectives and experiences in the economy, and I believe that the small business advisory board would be strengthened by the inclusion of veteran small- business owners. To that end, my amendment simply encourages the CFPB Director to also include veteran-owned small businesses in the membership of the small business advisory board. After fighting to protect the American Dream for all of us, many veterans have realized that same American Dream by starting their own business upon their return to civilian life. We owe it to our returning heroes to support their success. I urge support for my amendment, and I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. NEUGEBAUER. Madam Chair, I claim the time in opposition to this amendment, although I am not opposed to it. The Acting CHAIR (Ms. Foxx). Without objection, the gentleman from Texas is recognized for 5 minutes. There was no objection. Mr. NEUGEBAUER. I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from New Hampshire (Mr. Guinta). Mr. GUINTA. I would like to thank Chairman Neugebauer for yielding me this time. Madam Chair, it is an honor to stand alongside my fellow Granite State colleague in support of her amendment. Our State of New Hampshire has one of the highest populations of veterans per capita in the United States. Because of this, both the gentlelady from New Hampshire and myself understand the importance of working together to support our Nation's veterans and veteran-owned businesses. There are hundreds of veteran-owned businesses just in New Hampshire alone, and we need to ensure that our commitment does not end with their term of commitment to our military. I thank the gentlelady from New Hampshire for her amendment. I urge my colleagues both on the committee and in the full House to support this amendment. I would encourage them to support H.R. 1195, despite the objections of the 0.0015 percent in the pay-for that was earlier discussed. Mr. NEUGEBAUER. Madam Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume to say that we support this. It is a thoughtful amendment. I yield back the balance of my time. {time} 1745 Ms. KUSTER. Madam Chair, I yield such time as she may consume to the gentlewoman from California (Ms. Maxine Waters). Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Madam Chairman, I rise in support of this amendment. I would like to thank the gentlewoman from New Hampshire for offering this measure, which will ensure that the concerns of our Nation's veteran-owned businesses are represented on the small business advisory board this legislation creates. Madam Chairman, our Nation's veterans heroically put their lives on the line for this country. And when they come home and decide to start a small business, they are carrying forth that patriotic duty by taking another risk for the betterment of our Nation. Just as our Nation has a responsibility to care for those who return from battle, we too have a duty to ensure those who have served in our Armed Forces have a voice at the table, in whatever vocation they enter. Early on, the CFPB recognized the unique needs of servicemembers, veterans, and their families by creating an office targeted to address their needs. Likewise, small businesses owned by veterans comprise a subset of our Nation's economic backbone that should not be ignored. This amendment ensures that the CFPB is made aware of their views, perspectives, and interests in the same manner as all small-business owners. But Madam Chairman, while I support this amendment and believe in its goals, I remain strongly opposed to the underlying bill, which would impose cuts to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and would set a precedent that could ultimately lead to a time when the Nation's leading consumer advocate is cash-strapped, underfunded, and financially unable to ensure that the views of veteran business owners--or any other business owners--are appropriately taken into account. Ms. KUSTER. Madam Chair, I yield back the balance of my time. The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentlewoman from New Hampshire (Ms. Kuster). The amendment was agreed to. Mr. NEUGEBAUER. Madam Chair, I move that the Committee do now rise. The motion was agreed to. Accordingly, the Committee rose; and the Speaker pro tempore (Mr. Guinta) having assumed the chair, Ms. Foxx, Acting Chair of the Committee of the Whole House on the state of the Union, reported that that Committee, having had under consideration the bill (H.R. 1195) to amend the Consumer Financial Protection Act of 2010 to establish advisory boards, and for other purposes, had come to no resolution thereon. ____________________",package_114_99.csv,67265,67265,67333,"[congressional record volume 161, number 58 (tuesday, april 21, 2015)] [house] [pages h2335-h2343] from the congressional record online through the government publishing office [ www.gpo.gov ] bureau of consumer financial protection advisory boards act general leave mr. neugebauer. mr. speaker, i ask unanimous consent that all members have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and submit extraneous materials on the bill, h.r. 1195, to amend the consumer financial protection act of 2010 to establish advisory boards, and for other purposes. the speaker pro tempore (mr. pittenger). is there objection to the request of the gentleman from texas? there was no objection. the speaker pro tempore. pursuant to house resolution 200 and rule xviii, the chair declares the house in the committee of the whole house on the state of the union for the consideration of the bill, h.r. 1195. the chair appoints the gentleman from tennessee (mr. duncan) to preside over the committee of the whole. {time} 1637 in the committee of the whole accordingly, the house resolved itself into the committee of the whole house on the state of the union for the consideration of the bill (h.r. 1195) to amend the consumer financial protection act of 2010 to establish advisory boards, and for other purposes, with mr. duncan of tennessee in the chair. the clerk read the title of the bill. the chair. pursuant to the rule, the bill is considered read the first time. the gentleman from texas (mr. neugebauer) and the gentlewoman from california (ms. maxine waters) each will control 30 minutes. the chair recognizes the gentleman from texas. mr. neugebauer. mr. chairman, today the house considers h.r. 1195, the bureau of consumer financial protection advisory boards act. this bill is essential to provide small businesses a voice in the regulatory process and to help ensure community banks and credit unions continue to have a voice at the cfpb going forward. small businesses are the backbone of our economy, yet our regulatory system silences these hard-working americans. regulations meant for large corporations trickle down and have disproportionate impacts on main street businesses. we must remember that these businesses are, by and large, owned and operated by our neighbors and friends. they represent a life's work and a vision of the american dream. the cfpb was created to protect consumers in the financial marketplace, and it would seem impossible to responsibly undertake this endeavor of protecting the american consumer without consulting institutions that are most closely associated with the american consumer: small businesses and community financial institutions. h.r. 1195 is a straightforward and bipartisan piece of legislation. it would amend the dodd-frank act to create a small business advisory board to advise the cfpb. this bill would also codify two other advisory committees created by director cordray: the credit union advisory council and the community bank advisory council. [[page h2336]] under h.r. 1195, each board or council would advise the cfpb regarding concerns of its established membership. the director of the cfpb would be required to appoint at least 15, but not more than 20, members to each board or council. this bill is publicly supported by the following organizations: the credit union national association, the national association of federal credit unions, the texas land title association, the american land title association, the u.s. chamber of commerce, the independent community bankers of america. mr. chairman, this is a truly a commonsense and bipartisan bill. last congress, an identical piece of legislation passed the house by voice vote. this congress, h.r. 1195 passed out of the committee by a vote of 53-5. the ranking member, who is with us today, has voted for this bill two times, yet we find ourselves here today debating the merits of providing a voice for small businesses and community financial institutions. this week, former secretary of state hillary clinton was questioned about the health of american businesses. she said she was ``surprised'' to learn that small businesses were struggling. mr. chairman, h.r. 1195 is just one small and commonsense step to providing a voice for our small businesses and community financial institutions in the regulatory process. it helps ensure that politicians and washington bureaucrats aren't surprised to learn of the plight and struggles of these main street pillars. it gives these hard- working americans a voice and a seat at the table. now, democrats are going to say that our disagreement is with how the bill is paid for. well, let me address that for a minute. house rules require that any increase in mandatory spending be offset with a reduction in mandatory spending elsewhere. the cbo says h.r. 1195 will cost $9 million, in total, over the next 10 years. republicans simply reduced the maximum amount that the cfpb can draw from the fed over the same 10-year period to offset this cost. to put this into perspective, the cfpb, by statute, can draw approximately $6.7 billion over the next 10 years. this offset that we are debating today amounts to 0.1 percent of this amount. if democrats really want to claim that a 0.1 percent reduction in the $6.7 billion that cfpb can spend over the next decade really threatens the bureau's mission, perhaps it is time to examine the bureau's current spending practices. i am quite confident that we can debate spending problems at the cfpb for the rest of the afternoon, should we need to. just to reiterate, h.r. 1195 will not cut spending on consumer protection. let me repeat that. just to reiterate, h.r. 1195 will not cut spending on consumer protection. it will provide a voice for small businesses. let's help our small businesses succeed. let's help main street prosper, and let's vote today to move h.r. 1195 forward. with that, i reserve the balance of my time. ms. maxine waters of california. mr. chair, i yield myself such time as i may consume. mr. chairman, i want the members of the house to pay very close attention to this bill today because this bill represents tricks and games in ways that people don't often understand. but this is a prime example of how you take a good idea and mess it up. so i rise today in opposition to h.r. 1195, a measure that is, again, a shining example of how far republicans will go to squander compromise, consensus, and good faith to advance an ideological anticonsumer agenda. the bill before us today is just the latest instance of financial services committee republicans snatching defeat from the jaws of victory. {time} 1645 it makes clear their commitment to do all they can to undercut the consumer financial protection bureau. let me say that again. they have spent so much time--amendment after amendment, attempt after attempt-- to try and gut and dismantle the consumer financial protection bureau, and they have gone so far with this bill to undermine our efforts to be of assistance to small businesses and include them in a stronger advisory way to the consumer financial protection bureau because they hate the bureau so much. well, again, they do all they can to undercut this bureau, an agency with an extraordinary record of success protecting consumers, reining in bad actors, and ensuring that we do not return to the predatory practices that put this nation on the verge of economic collapse less than 10 years ago. mr. chairman, as originally written, h.r. 1195 was a good and decent measure offered by my colleague, mr. heck from washington state, and, again, i applaud him for his leadership. the straightforward proposal offered by mr. heck would codify two of the advisory boards that the cfpb voluntarily created related to community banks and credit unions, while also creating a new small business advisory board for small businesses. along with many other requirements of the bureau, these boards create additional avenues for input from the entities that they have been given the power to regulate under the dodd-frank wall street reform act. so here is what we are talking about. the bureau itself had created a number of advisory committees. mr. heck saw room for strengthening the ability of small businesses to have an advisory role, and so he created this bill. but, because, again, my friends on the opposite side of the aisle, the republicans, hate the consumer financial protection bureau so much, they decided that they were going to play tricks and games and create an opportunity to reduce the funding so they could try and limit the bureau's ability to do its work by adding all of these amendments. i am going to point out the tricks of these amendments as we go along here today. so in a rare show of bipartisanship, the financial services committee passed h.r. 1195 by a vote of 53-5. many of my democratic colleagues supported the proposal, just as we have supported the many efforts of the cfpb to be responsive to the unique needs of small businesses, community banks, and credit unions. but, as usual, that bipartisanship was short-lived, as chairman hensarling added an amendment designed to pay for this measure by undermining the cfpb's authority and independent funding. i find it ironic that this house has determined now is the time to offset the cost of legislation. don't forget, we have the pay-for kings and queens on that side of the aisle. they said, they worked for, and they made a big issue that everything must be paid for, except when they decide to try and slip something in that they don't pay for. and they have done that on this floor with some of these bills that we will be talking about. but with this bill, they decided a new kind of trick; and that is, let's find a way to take it from the consumer financial protection bureau because not only will this pay for it, but this will reduce their ability to do their job paying for other things. just last week, the house majority voted to repeal the estate tax without paying for it at a staggering cost of $269 billion. at a time when far too many americans are struggling with stagnant wages and historic income inequality, my republican counterparts seem all too willing to add to the nation's deficit in order to pass giveaways for the richest 0.2 percent of americans. yet when it comes to a reasonable bill to enhance the voice of small businesses, community banks, and credit unions, which they claim to care so much about, the republicans insist that the only way to pass the legislation is by cutting the cfpb--an agency that 84 percent of small-business owners support, according to polling from the small- business majority. the truth of the matter is that, after several years of attempting to cap cfpb funding, the republicans have chosen to transform mr. heck's bill into a vehicle to make drastic cuts to the cfpb's budget. while my colleagues on the other side of the aisle will claim otherwise, the cfpb itself estimates chairman hensarling's poison pill amendment will cut its budget by about $45 million over the next 5 years and by $100 million over the next 10 years, capping it substantially less than the amount that they are currently able to request. [[page h2337]] that means this vote is one to weaken an agency with the explicit mission of standing up for consumers and taxpayers who have been subject to the deceptive practices of unscrupulous corporations. the chairman's amendment guarantees that this otherwise bipartisan proposal will never become law, garnering significant opposition in the senate and a veto threat from the obama administration, who said this measure was ``solely intended to impede the cfpb's ability to carry out its mission of protecting consumers in the financial markets,'' and further, they said, ``could result in, among other things, undermining critical protections for families from abusive and predatory financial products.'' mr. chairman, republicans could have chosen any number of offsets to account for the cost of this proposal or, as they have done so many times before, waive their cutgo rules. make no mistake about the intent of the hensarling amendment. it is designed to back democrats into a corner by attaching an unacceptable provision cutting cfpb's budget to a proposal that democrats supported in committee. the important work of the cfpb will not be undermined on our watch, and this backdoor attempt to cut its budget sets a dangerous precedent of using bipartisan bills as a way to sneak through measures that undermine the bureau's independence and its ability to protect consumers. mr. chairman, we don't understand on this side of the aisle why it is that our republican friends hate the cfpb so much and have done so much to undermine them, to undercut them, and to try to reduce their funding. they know as well as we know that prior to the establishment of the consumer financial protection bureau that we put into dodd- frank's reforms, consumers had no protections in the government of the united states of america. our regulatory agencies were not doing their jobs. they say they were focused on safety and soundness. but who was working for the consumers? nobody. and so now we have a bureau working for the consumers that is doing a wonderful job. and here we have every attempt that you can dream of, every scheme that you can think of, being levied by our friends on the opposite side of the aisle because they want to kill the consumer financial protection bureau. as i have said, this is not going to happen on our watch. they can try any trick that they want. we are on to it. with that, mr. chairman, i reserve the balance of my time. mr. neugebauer. mr. chairman, i would just remind the ranking member that the republicans, during the rules committee hearing, asked if they had a pay-for that they would like to offer in substitute for that, and they chose not to. so i think what we are hearing is that the minority is choosing to say that small businesses in this country aren't worth $9 million. and what $9 million is is, in 3 minutes, that will be the increase in our national debt in this country. so republicans do take our deficit seriously, and we take the rules of this house seriously because the rules of the house require that when you have an increase in mandatory spending, you have to have an offset for that. what republicans were trying to do is follow the rules of the house. it is now my pleasure, mr. chairman, to yield as much time as he may consume to the gentleman from north carolina (mr. pittenger), one of the primary sponsors of this legislation. mr. pittenger. mr. chairman, i do rise today in support of h.r. 1195, the bureau of consumer financial protection advisory boards act. the consumer financial protection bureau continues to issue regulations designed for massive, systemic-risk financial institutions without considering how those same rules harm small businesses, community banks, and credit unions. that is why my good friend and colleague, congressman denny heck, joined with me to establish a small business advisory board within the cfpb. the goal is simple: to advise and consult with the cfpb on how any proposed regulations would impact the small-business community. members of the small business advisory board must represent a small business dealing with financial services products. the legislation also encourages the cfpb director to ensure participation of women- and minority-owned small businesses when appointing members to the board. h.r. 1195 also makes permanent the credit union advisory council and the community bank advisory council, both of which are currently voluntary and can be eliminated at any time at the discretion of the cfpb director. credit unions and community banks are struggling under enormous compliance burdens designed for too-big-to-fail banks. they are hiring compliance officers instead of loan officers, meaning less access to capital for small businesses to grow and to create jobs. clear and open communication between the cfpb, small businesses, community banks, and credit unions will improve rulemaking and lead to better outcomes for consumers. h.r. 1195 is supported by the credit union national association, the u.s. chamber of commerce, the american land title association, and the independent community bankers association. this legislation also enjoys strong bipartisan support, having passed out of the financial services committee by a vote of 53-5. allow me a moment to address the concern that was raised by the ranking member and other democrat colleagues in their objection to how we propose to pay for the advisory boards. the cbo estimates this legislation will cost taxpayers $9 million over a 10-year period. in those same years, the cfpb will have access to $6.7 billion in operating funds. we propose making a very small reduction--just 0.1 percent--in the amount the cfpb is allowed to draw, which will pay for the advisory boards without additional cost to taxpayers. if the cfpb can't find $9 million in savings over 10 years out of a total potential draw of $6.7 billion, then they need another advisory board of small-business owners who will travel to d.c. and teach the cfpb how to budget. mr. chairman, our economy is growing today at a tepid pace of 2.2 percent. we have in reality about 12 percent unemployment when you consider the underemployed and when you consider those who have given up. small banks and other lending institutions are under enormous compliance restrictions and guidelines, the same as the major banks. they need a voice at the table. we need opportunity. we need people to be able to expand their businesses, and yet they can't get capital through these small banking lending institutions. that is what this bill is all about. it is all about jobs. it is all about families and people's lives and their futures. the cfpb is supposed to be focused on protecting consumers, not protecting bureaucratic fiefdoms and perks. our commonsense, bipartisan legislation helps focus the cfpb on their sole, core mission of benefiting consumers. small businesses create jobs. bureaucrats create rules. please join me in supporting h.r. 1195 so that heavyhanded d.c. regulators are forced to take time to consider how their burdensome and unnecessary regulations negatively impact small business and make necessary adjustments to protect consumers while allowing small businesses, credit unions, and community banks to help grow the economy and create good-paying jobs. mr. chairman, i urge my colleagues to support this bill. ms. maxine waters of california. mr. chairman, i yield 10 minutes to the gentleman from washington (mr. heck). he is the next gentleman that you are going to hear from this side of the aisle. he is the author of the legislation that certainly would have given small businesses a seat at the table of the cfpb. he worked very hard on this bill, and he is one of those persons on our committee who reaches across the aisle all the time on bipartisan efforts. {time} 1700 mr. heck of washington. mr. chairman, in a gesture of reaching across the aisle, let us be clear that prior to this bill's arrival at the rules committee, it was mr. pittenger and myself who worked in a collaborative and in a bipartisan way, hard for nearly the last 2 years, to get it to this point where we might have an opportunity to vote upon it. i cannot exaggerate to you how saddened i am, how much i regret, and [[page h2338]] how surreal i find it that i stand here now and ask my colleagues to please vote ``no'' against my bill, oppose the bill that i have worked so hard on for nearly 2 years. its content, prior to its arrival in rules, had been laid out commonsensically: codify the credit union advisory council; codify the small community bank advisory council; and create a nonbank advisory board for the appraisers, the title insurers, the real estate agents, escrow company, all people that the bureau regulates and with whom they should have an iterative conversation going with respect to the proposed regulations. it wasn't easy getting here even before rules. there was a lot of back and forth, a lot of compromising along the way. we had to allay fears from the consumer groups that this was a trojan horse. we accepted amendments; we broadened the bill; we did a lot of things together, but with a collaborative spirit and the support of the ranking member, we did pass the bill out of committee 53-5, and then a torch was put to it. a torch was put to it. as has been described, the bill now includes a so-called pay-for amendment to lower the cap of available funds to cfpb by $45 million by the year 2020 and $100 million by the year 2025. it is bad policy; it is bad precedent, and it is completely unnecessary. the amendment was inserted under color of being a pay-for. well, i have got a couple problems with that. the first is obvious. cbo projection is $9 million. we are talking about a cap that cost $45 million and $100 million. it is a multiple of it--or $75 million to $100 million by last count. the second, of course, is the fact about how the rule is applied, which has been heralded here, and, in fact, genuflected as an important rule to provide for pay-fors when there are expenditures caused by proposed legislation. the motivation is, frankly, inscrutable to me. i honestly don't know how you do it with a straight face. literally, a matter of hours ago, voting for $300 billion, with a ``b,'' with no paygo or pay-for and to stand up here and say, well, we absolutely have to have a pay-for for $9 million over 10 years, but $300 billion was okay, i say sincerely: i don't know how you do that with a straight face. frankly, there is so much about this that i find surreal. much in the debate was about questioned architectural practices by the agency. the truth of the matter is gsa took over construction, what, 2-plus years ago? if that is the issue, write an amendment to the gsa budget; don't punish cfpb. it has been argued that this funding is unique; therefore, it has to be curtailed, unrelated to the underlying purpose of the bill. maybe that is true. check the history. it was a republican who wanted it funded by the fed--mr. shelby, i believe. that may be unique in that way. it has been suggested cfpb is nonbudgeted--again, unrelated to the underlying purpose of the bill. well, guess what, so is every other bank, regulator, agency in the federal government: the fdic, the occ, the fed itself, fhfa, and ncua. they are all nonbudgeted; but, no, let's pick this one out of the pack and punish it. there is so much about this that is surreal to me. i believe that there is a bit of a trial under way here today, and we are laying a marker down on april 21 on whether or not we are actually going to be able to function in a bipartisan way. we did. it took hard work, 18- plus months with mr. pittenger, 53-5 in committee; and now, as i say, we are putting a torch to it. we are going to decide. this is a test. are we going to use the cfpb as a piggybank to pay for all other manner of agendas? are we going to ask them to swallow this poison pill in the goal of getting a bipartisan bill passed? it is a test of whether or not we are going to do that. it is an experiment to see how radically--and it is radical--we can change bills and still keep ``yes'' votes in the name of consistency, although there is certainly no consistency between the pay-fors provided in this proposed legislation and that for legislation that passed last week. by the way, in addition to the estate tax and the sales and use tax totalling over $300 billion, we did two cfpb bills last week, too. nobody offered pay-fors on those, so it isn't consistent. this is surreal, standing here, asking you to oppose the bill that i have worked so hard on with mr. pittenger. it is surreal. i am reminded of my favorite passage in ``through the looking glass.'' if i had a world of my own, everything would be nonsense. nothing would be what it is because everything would be what it isn't. and contrariwise, what is, it wouldn't be. and what it wouldn't be, it would. you see? this is surreal; but i say my strongest assertion that what is the most sad about this--and i have said this in rules, and i am going to say it now--you know, you know you are killing this bill. you are killing it and evidently don't care, 18 months of hard work out the window to do something good and worthwhile, but you know you are killing the bill. you know you are killing it because you are not passing here veto-proof; and the administration has, as the ranking member suggested, already issued the statement of administration policy. i will go one further. this bill will never see the light of day in the united states senate. you are killing the bill that we worked on for 2 years to help nonbank businesses have a better structured institutionalized relationship, which is as it should be, and you are doing it by inconsistently applying a house rule for which you grant waivers left and right when you were of a mind. this is good legislation. my friend from north carolina has worked hard. frankly--and i will say it--he deserves better than this. this bill deserves better than this. the businesses that are regulated by cfpb deserve better than this, than to kill this bill, which is what you are assuredly doing. vote ``no'' on my bill. the chair. the chair reminds members to direct their remarks to the chair. mr. neugebauer. mr. chairman, i yield myself 1 minute. i appreciate the gentleman's comments. i just want to remind him that the gsa only took over the management of the project, not the budget, so gsa doesn't have control over this entity's budget. i think the thing that is troubling to me is my colleagues are talking about a drastic cut. you have got an entity that can draw $6.7 billion over a 10-year period, and $7 million is a drastic cut. basically, the cbo says that this bill now is revenue neutral, and these numbers that are coming of $45 million, those are cfpb's numbers, but these are the nonpartisan cbo numbers. i think one of the things we have to do is we have to deal in the facts and reality here, and this is a very small amount of money. at this time, mr. chairman, i yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from illinois (mr. dold). mr. dold. mr. chairman, i thank the chairman for yielding the time. mr. chairman, i rise in strong support of the bureau of consumer financial protection advisory boards act. i want to thank my friend from north carolina for his work, and i want to thank my friend from washington for his work as well on what really should be a bipartisan bill. honestly, i think the american public, mr. chairman, will take a look at what is happening here on the floor and are going to be baffled by it as well. as a small-business owner, let me just tell you, mr. chairman, there are nearly 29 million small businesses in our nation; 99 percent of all employer firms in the united states are considered small businesses; over 56 million americans work in these small businesses; and two- thirds of all net new jobs. last i checked, the labor force participation rate is near a three- decade low, so the net new jobs that we are looking for are created by small business. two-thirds are created by small business. this is a bill that would basically say to the cfpb: we want you to have a small business advisory board. with all of the businesses that are out there, the consumer financial protection bureau, an agency in washington that sets the rules and regulations with far-reaching impacts into our economy, completely fails to ensure that small businesses have a permanent seat at the table when the cfpb is making decisions, making decisions that impact the lives of millions of americans and businesses across the land. [[page h2339]] this is a commonsense piece of legislation. if we are going to talk about small businesses, my goodness, please, let's talk about having small business representation at the table. mr. chairman, there are a lot of decisions that get made in this chamber. there are a lot of decisions that get made in washington. i have to tell you, one of the things that i try to do is i try to surround myself with people that it impacts. if we are going to talk about health care, i try to surround myself with physicians and patients and nurses, to try to get their input in terms of how this bill or how a bill that comes to the floor would impact them. surround yourself with people that might know more about a topic than you do; educate yourself. the fact that the cfpb doesn't already have a small business advisory board or small business voice at the table is unacceptable-- unacceptable in today's day and age. this is something that we need to support. frankly, i want it to be a bipartisan bill. i think the underlying substance of it is bipartisan, and only at the last minute are we talking about not making this a bipartisan bill over the pay-for. mr. chairman, i want you to think about this for a second as a business that gets regulated time and again. they don't come with a pay-for there. basically, they say: this is what we need you to do, and you find a way to pay for it. the chair. the time of the gentleman has expired. mr. neugebauer. i yield the gentleman an additional 1 minute. mr. dold. this body is, in essence, saying to the cfpb, mr. chairman, to the cfpb and director cordray, we are saying: please get small business input into what you are thinking. in order to do that, the dollars that are out there, mr. chairman, are talking about trying to fly people in, small businesses in. that is where the dollars are coming from. we think the cbo has scored this at about $9 million out of nearly a $7 billion budget over 10 years. surely, this can't be the thing that is killing the bill. there has got to be something bigger that is killing the bill because, frankly, the american public, mr. chairman, are going to roll their eyes and say: you have got to be kidding me. we are going to disregard small businesses from being able to come in and weigh in on something that is going to drastically impact the economy because they don't want to take what could potentially be $9 million in airfare and other things to try to make sure they can get the small business advisory board to come to washington. if we find that there is a problem, i will be the first one to reach across the aisle to say we need to fix this. this is a problem that we need to solve, and i encourage my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support this bill to get small businesses engaged. ms. maxine waters of california. mr. chairman, i first need to remind the gentleman from illinois that mr. heck worked hard to put small business advisory at the table and to codify the other businesses that the cfpb had already put at the table. they snatched it right away from the table. they took away small business. i yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from minnesota (mr. ellison), who is the cochair of the progressive caucus and a member of the financial services committee. {time} 1715 mr. ellison. i would like to thank the gentlewoman for the time. mr. chairman, i will just remind my colleagues that, yes, the bill was bipartisan, but the amendment was not. the amendment, which was rigidly partisan, is what has put this good idea in a space of being very partisan on this house floor. you would have thought that after the hard work that mr. heck had put into this bill that maybe somebody would have listened to him and would have said, ``mr. heck, you have put your time in on this bill. we are not going to do this to your bill. we are going to stick with that bipartisanship that we had all along,'' but that kind of consideration has gone missing in this place. the truth is, mr. chairman, that the republican leadership has brought us another bill in a long series of bills to weaken the consumer financial protection bureau, and no small-business person who is listening to this debate should be bamboozled, tricked, or led astray in believing that the rhetoric on this floor is about helping them. the fact is that a lot of small-business people are protected by predatory lenders that the cfpb stops. a lot of small-business people open their businesses with a credit card. they rely on the cfpb to keep the predation away from them. they, in fact, are the beneficiaries of the work of the cfpb's. all of these bills to attack the cfpb harm the american people. these bills make it easier to steer customers into costly loans that strip their wealth and limit their economic mobility. these bills divert cfpb resources from protecting consumers to costly, unnecessary, bureaucratic activities. last week, we had a bill to repeal the cfpb rules that protect buyers of manufactured homes from what had been before dodd-frank a predatory market. enough democrats voted ``no'' on h.r. 650 to sustain the president's veto. that is a good thing. we should not remove consumer protections for high-cost loans that are targeted at buyers of manufactured homes. also last week, the gop brought another bill which would weaken the cfpb protections against controlled business arrangements in real estate transactions. today, the republican majority considers what is a good idea. h.r. 1195 would require the cfpb to establish a small business advisory council. it is a pretty fair idea. you could argue that it is already there, but if you don't believe it is, it is not at all a highly objectionable bill. in fact, it has merit. what is wrong with a little bit more input from small business? that is a good thing. the fact of the matter is that it is a trojan horse that is being used to attack the cfpb all over again. my question is this: why would you want to destroy an organization that has identified $5.3 billion, which is the approximate amount of relief to consumers ordered by the cfpb enforcement actions? it is $5.3 billion that hard-working americans have saved from predatory lenders. why in the world, unless you favor predation in financial markets, would you be against the cfpb? there are 15 million consumers who receive relief because of the cfpb, and i hope they let their voices be heard all across the united states against these people who relentlessly try to rip down the cfpb. $208 million is the amount of money that has been ordered to be paid in civil penalties as a result of cfpb's enforcement actions against people who do not help the market but who distort the market. the cfpb helps business because good, honest, decent businesses--and america is full of them, the ones that play by the rules--get harmed when a cheater goes without being punished. when a business that cuts corners and abuses consumers does not get eliminated from the market or punished because of its bad behavior, it means that playing by the rules is no longer profitable or the thing to do. the cfpb makes the market work as it should. there were 145 banks and credit unions under the cfpb's supervisory authority as of june 2014. that is a good thing. there are 30 million consumers with debts in collection, and larger debt collection companies are now under federal supervision for the first time because of the cfpb. the cfpb is a good institution. vote ``no'' on this trojan horse bill. mr. neugebauer. mr. chairman, i yield myself 1 minute. i am delighted to hear that my colleagues on the other side of the aisle are concerned about $9 million. i wish they had been as concerned when we had hearings and we found out that the cfpb is going to spend $216 million on the luxury renovations of a building that they do not own and when we found out that the taxpayers are also going to get to fund a two-story waterfall that falls into sunken gardens and that has a four-story glass staircase. how about the spending of $14 million on marketing and advertising? how about the $61.3 million they spent on management consulting fees? [[page h2340]] it should be an affront to small businesses around the country that an organization that can't control its spending is being asked not to spend an additional $9 million so that small businesses can have a voice at the table. mr. chairman, i yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from north carolina (mr. pittenger). mr. pittenger. thank you, mr. chairman. mr. chairman, really what we are talking about are the merits of entitling this enormous agency, the largest in the history of this country, the consumer financial protection bureau, to be accountable to nobody, not to be accountable to the executive branch and not to be accountable to the congress. they are able to do whatever they want to do. they make all of their own rules. they determine the winners, and they determine the losers. they have zero accountability. let's discuss their funding of $6.7 billion over a 10-year period. yes, what we are talking about is an offset to pay for an advisory board to protect small business--$9 million. that is 0.1 percent. let's look at the priorities then of the cfpb's. truly, would any of us lease a building, not own it, and spend $260 million on renovations? that is more per square foot than of any luxury hotel in las vegas. yes, how about a two-story waterfall into a sunken garden? how magnificent. is that more important than an advisory board that is for small business to ensure that we can create jobs? how about a green roof and a four-story glass staircase? it costs millions. is that more important than an advisory board for small business? how about a tree bosk and a timber porch--how lovely--so that employees can have a place of restful contemplation and meditation? do bureaucrats really need a serene place to rest while they are on the job? are they that concerned about their plight? my goodness. here are struggling, hardworking, tax-paying americans who are trying to build their businesses, who are trying to find capital, who are looking to community banks that are under siege with burdensome regulations. it is the same as the major banks. this isn't right. this makes no sense. this is not fair. we need to get priority where priority is due. ms. maxine waters of california. mr. chairman, i yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from wisconsin (ms. moore). she serves on the financial services committee and is a strong supporter of the consumer financial protection bureau's. ms. moore. thank you so much, madam ranking member. mr. chairman, i rise in opposition to h.r. 1195 and not because i don't think it is a wonderful idea that mr. heck has come up with, along with his colleague from the republican side, for a small business advisory panel within the consumer financial protection bureau. prior to the consumer financial protection bureau, we had example, after example, after example of wall street's preying on consumers and treating working class americans just like an atm in order to feather their bonuses; but here, today, we find yet another not so veiled attempt to defund the cfpb. i guess i could take the paygo rules a little bit more seriously if just last week we had not repealed the estate tax to the tune of $270 billion for the 6,000 wealthiest americans. it is a tax from which only 6,000 people will benefit. i am certainly not looking for a pay-for. i am just pointing out the hypocrisy of the notion that we have got to offset this $9 million for the cfpb. as has been mentioned, the cfpb has returned $5.3 billion to more than 15 million consumers who have been harmed by financial fraud, and i think paygo is just more of a convenient excuse to cut the cfpb than an actual principle that we follow here. i urge my colleagues to stand up for american consumers. oppose these attempts to attack the cfpb and to expose our constituents to these emboldened financial fraud centers. let's reject h.r. 1195. mr. neugebauer. mr. chairman, may i inquire as to how much time is remaining on both sides. the chair. the gentleman from texas has 11\1/2\ minutes remaining, and the gentlewoman from california has 5 minutes remaining. mr. neugebauer. mr. chairman, i reserve the balance of my time. ms. maxine waters of california. mr. chairman, i yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from maryland (ms. edwards). ms. edwards. i thank the ranking member for yielding. mr. chairman, i came to this floor opposed to this version of h.r. 1195, and as i have listened to the debate, i have become even more opposed to the legislation. most fifth graders know a trojan horse when they see one, and today's legislation is, indeed, a trojan horse. let me tell you why. once again, republicans are trying to roll back and limit consumer protections. once again, they are attacking the consumer financial protection bureau by adding burdensome legislation that replicates what the bureau is already doing and by stripping funding from the cfpb in future years. let's remember that this was the agency that was created to prevent the very abusive practices that led to the 2008 financial crisis; yet here they go, pretending to help small businesses and community banks and credit unions but are gutting the agency that is responsible for protecting consumers. just 6 years ago, we saw the fallout of the financial crisis right in my district in prince george's county and in baltimore city, where homeowners lost their homes. it was black and latino families who suffered the most in prince george's county and baltimore city, and it is not over for us. many of those homeowners were small-business owners, and they used their homes to leverage their businesses. they can't do that anymore because they are still underwater and because the rules are still set against them. we are still in crisis, and we need a robust, unencumbered, unburdened consumer financial protection bureau to protect consumers, homeowners, and small businesses that are still struggling and are vulnerable. we need a robust lifeline cfpb as our credit unions and community banks are struggling. they need real relief that is hidden behind this trojan horse legislation. many of my republican colleagues have long opposed the cfpb, and they have long sought to dismantle it. this legislation is no different, and it needs to be defeated. if they want bipartisan legislation, we need to start all over again and do something that really is in the interest of consumers. mr. neugebauer. mr. chairman, we have no further speakers, and i reserve the balance of my time. ms. maxine waters of california. mr. chairman, i yield myself such time as i may consume. i think that we have done a very good job on this side of the aisle of exposing what is happening on the opposite side of the aisle as simply an attempt to try and gut and demean the consumer financial protection bureau. {time} 1730 let me just deal with this argument that they made about the cost of renovation for the cfpb. bloomberg businessweek, in an article, entitled, ``republican attacks on a cfpb office renovation don't add up,'' found that republicans took liberties with their math. using data from a report prepared by the cfpb's inspector general, bloomberg found that renovation would only cost $421 per square foot, if you inflate the price by including rental of temporary space and paying for movers, compared to the gop claim of $590. actual construction costs are only $283 per square foot, half of what the republicans claim. however, and i think this is very interesting, there is one very expensive renovation happening in washington, d.c., right now. it is the cannon house office building, which houses members and committees of the house of representatives. all end costs for the renovation of the cannon building approved by speaker boehner will be $753 million, or $911 per square foot, much pricier than the bellagio or the burj khalifa. if we want to talk about what is high cost, take a look at ourselves right here in congress for what we are doing. having said that, i just wonder why the continued attempts on the consumer financial protection bureau. maybe it is because somebody else is being protected. let's look at some of the work of the bureau: a january 2015 settlement [[page h2341]] against j.p. morgan and wells fargo for $35.7 million after uncovering a scheme where loan officers illegally referred customers to affiliated businesses in exchange for cash and marketing services. look at a july 2014 settlement against rome finance for $92 million for a predatory lending scheme that targeted servicemembers by hiding finance charges, withholding information from billing statements, and engaging in illegal debt collection practices. another settlement from july 2014 against payday lender ace cash express for $10 million for intentionally trapping consumers in a cycle of debt, a practice formalized in their employee training materials, as well as illegal debt collection practices, including harassment. i could go on and on and on how the consumer financial protection bureau has taken on some of the biggest corporations, the biggest businesses in this country to protect consumers. what is it you are afraid of? what is it you are worried about? why are you trying to kill the agency that is protecting consumers rather than applauding them for making sure that the consumers don't continue to be taken advantage of the way they were prior to 2008 when we didn't have any consumer protection? i ask you to question yourselves about why you hate the consumer financial protection bureau so much. i yield back the balance of my time. mr. neugebauer. mr. chairman, i yield myself the balance of my time. i have read h.r. 1195. let me tell you what it doesn't do first. it doesn't shut down the cfpb. it doesn't keep the bureau from carrying out its mission of consumer protection--so all of those things that the other side has been saying that the cfpb has been doing in a positive way, they can continue to do that--nor will the employees of cfpb have to take a pay cut, nor will the construction project and the other consulting fees that they keep passing out be impacted in any way. so the charge on the other side that somehow republicans are trying to kill cfpb, i think you need to go back and read the bill. the bill doesn't say anything about killing the cfpb. what does h.r. 1195 do? it provides a voice for small businesses in this country, the number one job creators in america, the people that are day in and day out on the front line in our communities. it allows them to have a voice with an agency that has a huge impact on the future of this country. it also codifies and makes sure that community banks and credit unions have a voice at the table in the future. one of the bill's sponsors said he was sad. i am sad. i am sad that people today are on this floor arguing that paying for a program that will provide a voice for our small businesses is a point of contention, that somehow we are not acting in a bipartisan way. this is a bipartisan bill. it passed by voice vote in the last congress. it passed overwhelmingly, i think 55-5, in the committee on financial services just a week ago. i think we have to focus on what this bill does. this bill does make sure that small businesses have a voice moving forward. if we have a government that doesn't listen to the people, then we do not have good government. so this bill is about good government. it is about saying to the american people: hey, the bureaucrats may not have all the answers, so it is good to bring the people that have been out there that are running businesses that have some expertise in those areas that this agency is trying to regulate and set precedence for, it is good for government to listen to the people. so, mr. chairman, i encourage my colleagues to pass and vote for h.r. 1195. i yield back the balance of my time. mr. cummings. mr. chair, as originally introduced, h.r. 1195 was that rare piece of legislation with bipartisan support. it supported the simple proposition that the consumer financial protection bureau (cfpb) could benefit from the guidance of advisory councils comprised of representatives from small businesses, credit unions, and community banks. as introduced, the legislation would have required the cfpb to hear from small business representatives regarding the impact of proposed rules on financial products used by consumers for family and household purposes. the bill also encouraged the cfpb to ensure the participation of credits unions and community banks that serve traditionally underserved communities. the cfpb--and all relevant government agencies--should continue to focus on expanding banking opportunities in underserved communities, which are too often subjected to the worst forms of predatory financial practices. according to the corporation for enterprise development, my hometown of baltimore, maryland, is one of the top ten unbanked large cities in the country--13.9 percent of residents have no checking or savings account, and more than one in four residents is underbanked. too many of these folks rely on alternative financial services like check- cashing stores, rent-to-own agreements, or pawnshops. while maryland has instituted a 33 percent usury cap and storefront payday lending operations do not exist in the state, maryland residents with small-dollar credit needs have continued to turn to on-line lenders--lenders that are too often perpetrating fraudulent and abusive practices. but this does not need to be the reality in baltimore or any american city. according to the urban institute, the small-dollar credit market in the united states reached approximately $21.4 billion in 2012. credit unions and community banks across the country have begun to tap into this market by experimenting with small-dollar, short-term loans that help consumers stretch their monthly budgets or pay for emergency expenses without trapping them in a cycle of debt. the cfpb has taken a critical first step toward reforming the small- dollar industry by releasing proposals for a potential rule that would require short-term lenders to either ensure borrowers have the ability to repay their loans or to provide affordable repayment plans. this is why i was so disappointed by a recent amendment to h.r. 1195 from the rules committee that would pay for the new advisory councils the bill would create by capping or reducing the cfpb budget by $45 million over five years and $100 million over ten years. in contrast, the congressional budget office has estimated that the new councils would cost only $9 million over ten years--confirming that the new amendment is nothing more than an attempt to slash the cfpb budget. by transforming a simple bill into a major budget cut, this amendment is simply another in a series of continuing attacks on the work of the cfpb, which has provided $5.3 billion in relief to consumers since its creation. just as the cfpb embarks on its latest effort to protect consumers from predatory and abusive practices, we simply cannot afford a weakened consumer protection agency. as amended, h.r. 1195 is not only a disappointment--it's an insult to the same underserved communities the bill would have helped the cfpb to better serve. i urge my colleagues to reject this bill and its attempt to undercut protections for working american families. the chair. all time for general debate has expired. pursuant to the rule, the bill shall be considered for amendment under the 5-minute rule. the amendment printed in part c of house report 114-74 shall be considered as adopted, and the bill, as amended, shall be considered as read. the text of the bill, as amended, is as follows: h.r. 1195 be it enacted by the senate and house of representatives of the united states of america in congress assembled, section

and the chair announced that the noes appeared to have it. ms. maxine waters of california. mr. chair, i demand a recorded vote. the chair. pursuant to clause 6 of rule xviii, further proceedings on the amendment offered by the gentlewoman from new hampshire will be postponed. amendment no. 2 offered by ms. kuster the chair. it is now in order to consider amendment no. 2 printed in part d of house report 114-74. ms. kuster. mr. chairman, i have an amendment at the desk, amendment no. 2. i offer that amendment at this time. the chair. the clerk will designate the amendment. the text of the amendment is as follows: page 4, line 20, strike ``minority- and women-owned'' and insert ``minority-, women-, and veteran-owned''. the chair. pursuant to house resolution 200, the gentlewoman from new hampshire (ms. kuster) and a member opposed each will control 5 minutes. [[page h2343]] the chair recognizes the gentlewoman from new hampshire. ms. kuster. mr. chair, the underlying bill before us today authorizes a small business advisory board to advise the consumer financial protection bureau on small business concerns and practices. i agree that small businesses must have a seat at the table when federal regulators make decisions with wide-ranging consequences for our economy, and i appreciate that this legislation already encourages the participation of women-owned and minority-owned small businesses on the board. women and minority entrepreneurs often have unique perspectives and concerns, and the cfpb would be well served by seeking and heeding their input. similarly, as a member of the committee on veterans' affairs, i believe that veteran entrepreneurs have unique perspectives and experiences in the economy, and i believe that the small business advisory board would be strengthened by the inclusion of veteran small- business owners. to that end, my amendment simply encourages the cfpb director to also include veteran-owned small businesses in the membership of the small business advisory board. after fighting to protect the american dream for all of us, many veterans have realized that same american dream by starting their own business upon their return to civilian life. we owe it to our returning heroes to support their success. i urge support for my amendment, and i reserve the balance of my time. mr. neugebauer. madam chair, i claim the time in opposition to this amendment, although i am not opposed to it. the acting chair (ms. foxx). without objection, the gentleman from texas is recognized for 5 minutes. there was no objection. mr. neugebauer. i yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from new hampshire (mr. guinta). mr. guinta. i would like to thank chairman neugebauer for yielding me this time. madam chair, it is an honor to stand alongside my fellow granite state colleague in support of her amendment. our state of new hampshire has one of the highest populations of veterans per capita in the united states. because of this, both the gentlelady from new hampshire and myself understand the importance of working together to support our nation's veterans and veteran-owned businesses. there are hundreds of veteran-owned businesses just in new hampshire alone, and we need to ensure that our commitment does not end with their term of commitment to our military. i thank the gentlelady from new hampshire for her amendment. i urge my colleagues both on the committee and in the full house to support this amendment. i would encourage them to support h.r. 1195, despite the objections of the 0.0015 percent in the pay-for that was earlier discussed. mr. neugebauer. madam chair, i yield myself such time as i may consume to say that we support this. it is a thoughtful amendment. i yield back the balance of my time. {time} 1745 ms. kuster. madam chair, i yield such time as she may consume to the gentlewoman from california (ms. maxine waters). ms. maxine waters of california. madam chairman, i rise in support of this amendment. i would like to thank the gentlewoman from new hampshire for offering this measure, which will ensure that the concerns of our nation's veteran-owned businesses are represented on the small business advisory board this legislation creates. madam chairman, our nation's veterans heroically put their lives on the line for this country. and when they come home and decide to start a small business, they are carrying forth that patriotic duty by taking another risk for the betterment of our nation. just as our nation has a responsibility to care for those who return from battle, we too have a duty to ensure those who have served in our armed forces have a voice at the table, in whatever vocation they enter. early on, the cfpb recognized the unique needs of servicemembers, veterans, and their families by creating an office targeted to address their needs. likewise, small businesses owned by veterans comprise a subset of our nation's economic backbone that should not be ignored. this amendment ensures that the cfpb is made aware of their views, perspectives, and interests in the same manner as all small-business owners. but madam chairman, while i support this amendment and believe in its goals, i remain strongly opposed to the underlying bill, which would impose cuts to the consumer financial protection bureau and would set a precedent that could ultimately lead to a time when the nation's leading consumer advocate is cash-strapped, underfunded, and financially unable to ensure that the views of veteran business owners--or any other business owners--are appropriately taken into account. ms. kuster. madam chair, i yield back the balance of my time. the acting chair. the question is on the amendment offered by the gentlewoman from new hampshire (ms. kuster). the amendment was agreed to. mr. neugebauer. madam chair, i move that the committee do now rise. the motion was agreed to. accordingly, the committee rose; and the speaker pro tempore (mr. guinta) having assumed the chair, ms. foxx, acting chair of the committee of the whole house on the state of the union, reported that that committee, having had under consideration the bill (h.r. 1195) to amend the consumer financial protection act of 2010 to establish advisory boards, and for other purposes, had come to no resolution thereon. ____________________",67265

DOC. NO. 114-28) The SPEAKER pro tempore laid before the House the following message from the President of the United States; which was read and, together with the accompanying papers, referred to the Committee on Foreign Affairs and ordered to be printed: To the Congress of the United States: I am pleased to transmit to the Congress, pursuant to subsections 123 b. and 123 d. of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended (42 U.S.C. 2153(b), (d)) (the ``Act''), the text of a proposed Agreement for Cooperation Between the Government of the United States of America and the Government of the People's Republic of China Concerning Peaceful Uses of Nuclear Energy (the ``Agreement''). I am also pleased to transmit my written approval, authorization, and determination concerning the Agreement, and an unclassified Nuclear Proliferation Assessment Statement (NPAS) concerning the Agreement. (In accordance with section 123 of the Act, as amended by Title XII of the Foreign Affairs Reform and Restructuring Act of 1998 (Public Law 105-277), two classified annexes to the NPAS, prepared by the Secretary of State, in consultation with the Director of National Intelligence, summarizing relevant classified information, will be submitted to the Congress separately.) The joint memorandum submitted to me by the Secretaries of State and Energy and a letter from the Chairman of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission stating the views of the Commission are also enclosed. An addendum to the NPAS containing a comprehensive analysis of China's export control system with respect to nuclear-related matters, including interactions with other countries of proliferation concern and the actual or suspected nuclear, dual-use, or missile- related transfers to such countries, pursuant to section 102A(w) of the National Security Act of 1947 (50 U.S.C. 3024(w)), is being submitted separately by the Director of National Intelligence. The proposed Agreement has been negotiated in accordance with the Act and other applicable law. In my judgment, it meets all applicable statutory requirements and will advance the nonproliferation and other foreign policy interests of the United States. The proposed Agreement provides a comprehensive framework for peaceful [[Page H2344]] nuclear cooperation with China based on a mutual commitment to nuclear nonproliferation. It would permit the transfer of material, equipment (including reactors), components, information, and technology for nuclear research and nuclear power production. It does not permit transfers of any Restricted Data. Transfers of sensitive nuclear technology, sensitive nuclear facilities, and major critical components of such facilities may only occur if the Agreement is amended to cover such transfers. In the event of termination, key nonproliferation conditions and controls continue with respect to material, equipment, and components subject to the Agreement. The proposed Agreement would obligate the United States and China to work together to enhance their efforts to familiarize commercial entities in their respective countries about the requirements of the Agreement as well as national export controls and policies applicable to exports and imports subject to the Agreement. It would have a term of 30 years from the date of its entry into force. Either party may terminate the proposed Agreement on at least 1 year's written notice to the other party. Since the 1980s, China has become a party to several nonproliferation treaties and conventions and worked to bring its domestic export control authorities in line with international standards. China joined the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons in 1992 as a nuclear weapon state, brought into force an Additional Protocol to its International Atomic Energy Agency safeguards agreement in 2002, and joined the Nuclear Suppliers Group in 2004. China is a party to the Convention on the Physical Protection of Nuclear Material, which establishes international standards of physical protection for use, storage, and transport of nuclear material, and has ratified the 2005 Amendment to the Convention. A more detailed discussion of China's civil nuclear program and its nuclear nonproliferation policies and practices, including its nuclear export policies and practices, is provided in the NPAS and in two classified annexes to the NPAS submitted to you separately. As noted above, the Director of National Intelligence will provide an addendum to the NPAS containing a comprehensive analysis of the export control system of China with respect to nuclear-related matters. I have considered the views and recommendations of the interested departments and agencies in reviewing the proposed Agreement and have determined that its performance will promote, and will not constitute an unreasonable risk to, the common defense and security. Accordingly, I have approved the proposed Agreement and authorized its execution and urge that the Congress give it favorable consideration. This transmission shall constitute a submittal for purposes of both sections 123 b. and 123 d. of the Act. My Administration is prepared to begin immediately the consultations with the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and the House Foreign Affairs Committee as provided in section 123 b.

(in accordance with section 123 of the act, as amended by title xii of the foreign affairs reform and restructuring act of 1998 (public law 105-277), two classified annexes to the npas, prepared by the secretary of state, in consultation with the director of national intelligence, summarizing relevant classified information, will be submitted to the congress separately.) the joint memorandum submitted to me by the secretaries of state and energy and a letter from the chairman of the nuclear regulatory commission stating the views of the commission are also enclosed. an addendum to the npas containing a comprehensive analysis of china's export control system with respect to nuclear-related matters, including interactions with other countries of proliferation concern and the actual or suspected nuclear, dual-use, or missile- related transfers to such countries, pursuant to section 102a(w) of the national security act of 1947 (50 u.s.c. 3024(w)), is being submitted separately by the director of national intelligence. the proposed agreement has been negotiated in accordance with the act and other applicable law. in my judgment, it meets all applicable statutory requirements and will advance the nonproliferation and other foreign policy interests of the united states. the proposed agreement provides a comprehensive framework for peaceful [[page h2344]] nuclear cooperation with china based on a mutual commitment to nuclear nonproliferation. it would permit the transfer of material, equipment (including reactors), components, information, and technology for nuclear research and nuclear power production. it does not permit transfers of any restricted data. transfers of sensitive nuclear technology, sensitive nuclear facilities, and major critical components of such facilities may only occur if the agreement is amended to cover such transfers. in the event of termination, key nonproliferation conditions and controls continue with respect to material, equipment, and components subject to the agreement. the proposed agreement would obligate the united states and china to work together to enhance their efforts to familiarize commercial entities in their respective countries about the requirements of the agreement as well as national export controls and policies applicable to exports and imports subject to the agreement. it would have a term of 30 years from the date of its entry into force. either party may terminate the proposed agreement on at least 1 year's written notice to the other party. since the 1980s, china has become a party to several nonproliferation treaties and conventions and worked to bring its domestic export control authorities in line with international standards. china joined the treaty on the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons in 1992 as a nuclear weapon state, brought into force an additional protocol to its international atomic energy agency safeguards agreement in 2002, and joined the nuclear suppliers group in 2004. china is a party to the convention on the physical protection of nuclear material, which establishes international standards of physical protection for use, storage, and transport of nuclear material, and has ratified the 2005 amendment to the convention. a more detailed discussion of china's civil nuclear program and its nuclear nonproliferation policies and practices, including its nuclear export policies and practices, is provided in the npas and in two classified annexes to the npas submitted to you separately. as noted above, the director of national intelligence will provide an addendum to the npas containing a comprehensive analysis of the export control system of china with respect to nuclear-related matters. i have considered the views and recommendations of the interested departments and agencies in reviewing the proposed agreement and have determined that its performance will promote, and will not constitute an unreasonable risk to, the common defense and security. accordingly, i have approved the proposed agreement and authorized its execution and urge that the congress give it favorable consideration. this transmission shall constitute a submittal for purposes of both sections 123 b. and 123 d. of the act. my administration is prepared to begin immediately the consultations with the senate foreign relations committee and the house foreign affairs committee as provided in section 123 b. upon completion of the 30 days of continuous session review provided for in section 123 b., the 60 days of continuous session review provided for in section 123 d. shall commence. barack obama. the white house, april 21, 2015. ____________________",5969

We are at a critical juncture in America's rebalance to the Asia- Pacific region, and I really believe that further cooperation between the United States, Japan, and Korea will play a pivotal role towards peace and prosperity throughout the world. Next week, Japanese Prime Minister Abe will make a historic visit to Capitol Hill as the first ever Japanese Prime Minister to deliver an address to a joint session of Congress. That address must be honest. That address has to address Japan's wartime history. It has to honestly address Japan's atrocities and enslavement of thousands of women who have been forced to work as sex slaves, or comfort women. To ignore past atrocities, Mr. Speaker, is to ensure a very troubling future. These wounds need to be closed, and they need to be healed. Prime Minister Abe can attain that closure, can attain that healing by exposing those wounds to the light of the truth--and an apology.

A lifelong Naperville resident, Mayor Pradel has spent his life in service to the community that he loves. George was born and raised in Naperville, and after a 3-year detour in the Marine Corps, he returned home to become a police officer. Known around town as ``Officer Friendly,'' he served on the force for 30 years. One of his proudest achievements during his time as an officer was the dedication of Safety Town, a miniature town that teaches children about public safety and how to avoid danger. In 1995, he was first elected and has served as mayor for a record- setting 20 years, during a time of great expansion and growth for the city. The mayor has led Naperville with his signature mix of charm and compassion. His annual tradition of delivering the State of the City Address in a tuxedo and silk tophat will certainly be missed. Mayor Pradel is also a devoted husband to his beloved wife, Pat, and is a dedicated father to his children and foster children.

This was not the first we have heard about screeners exceeding their authority to abuse passengers. We have read about the pat-downs and strip searches of young children, senior citizens, and cancer patients. Instead of reining in screeners, TSA has unilaterally given them the appearance of even greater authority--metal badges, blue uniforms, and the title of ``officer.'' When you dress someone up like a policeman and call him ``officer,'' you are misleading passengers about his actual authority. Most people see a badge and a uniform, and they comply with the screener's demands even when those demands are abusive. That has to end. I have introduced the Stopping TSA Abuses Act to prohibit the TSA from giving screeners metal badges, police-like uniforms, and the title ``officer.'' It reserves those rights for sworn officers who have actually completed law enforcement training. When you see someone wearing a Federal badge and uniform, you should have the faith that he actually has received the proper training.

Under the Speaker's announced policy of January 6, 2015, the gentleman from California (Mr. Honda) is recognized for 60 minutes as the designee of the minority leader. General Leave Mr. HONDA. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous material on the subject of my Special Order. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from California? There was no objection. Mr. HONDA. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to address the ongoing horror and nightmare that is violence against women. Whether in times of conflict or disaster, too often we see the worst battles fought on women and girls' bodies. Tonight, Mr. Speaker, I am honored to recognize one woman who has survived unspeakable violence. She is a survivor. At 87 years old, she traveled all the way from South Korea. Her name is Lee Yong-Soo, known to everyone as Grandmother Lee. She has become the voice of justice, peace, and reconciliation. In 1944, 16-year-old Yong-Soo Lee of Tasegu, Korea, was lured by a friend of hers to meet with an older Japanese man. The man took the two of them and three other teenaged girls by train, then ship to Taiwan. There, the girls were forced into sexual slavery, serving four to five Japanese soldiers every day for a year. Ms. Lee suffered beatings and torture, was infected with venereal disease, was fed paltry amounts, faced temperatures so cold that ice formed on her body, and was never allowed outside. Only the end of World War II brought her relief. Ms. Lee is just one example of the over 200,000 women from Korea, China, the Philippines, Burma, Thailand, Vietnam, Malaysia, Taiwan, Indonesia, and East Timor who were kidnapped and sexually enslaved by the Japanese Imperial Army during World War II. These so-called comfort women suffered serious physical, emotional, and psychological damages as a result of their ordeal. Of her 200,000 sisters, Grandmother Lee is but one out of a handful of survivors across Asia Pacific still alive. Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton was right when she reportedly called these victims, rather than ``comfort women,'' ``sex slaves.'' When Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe addresses a joint meeting of Congress next week on April 29, he has the opportunity to do right by these women. He can make a full, unequivocal, and formal apology on behalf of the Japanese Government. The Prime Minister's visit is indeed a historic one. He will be the first Japanese Prime Minister to address a joint meeting of Congress. He will address this institution on the occasion of the 70th anniversary of the end of World War II and the 50th anniversary of the normalization between Korea and Japan. Prime Minister Abe will address this hallowed Chamber, where President Roosevelt delivered an address to our body as America entered war. There is much to be expected and anticipated in next week's address. According to yesterday's editorial by The New York Times, the success of Prime Minister Abe's visit ``depends on whether and how honestly Mr. Abe confronts Japan's wartime history, including its decision to wage war, its brutal occupation of China and Korea, its atrocities and its enslavement of thousands of women forced to work as sex slaves or `comfort women' in wartime brothels.'' Mr. Speaker, in 2007, the House of Representatives sent a profound message to the Government of Japan by passing H. Res. 121, which I authored. The resolution stated: ``That it is the sense of the House of Representatives that the Government of Japan: ``(1) should formally acknowledge, apologize, and accept historical responsibility in a clear and unequivocal manner for its Imperial Armed Forces' coercion of young women into sexual slavery, known to the world as comfort women, during its colonial and wartime occupation of Asia and the Pacific Islands from the 1930s through the duration of World War II; ``( 2) would help to resolve recurring questions about the sincerity and status of prior statements if the Prime Minister of Japan were to make such an apology as a public statement in his official capacity; ``(3) should clearly and publicly refute any claims that the sexual enslavement and trafficking of the comfort women for the Japanese Imperial Armed Forces never occurred; and [[Page H2348]] ``(4) should educate current and future generations about this horrible crime while following the recommendations of the international community with respect to the comfort women.'' And yet the Japanese Government has continued to fail to address this resolution. To be fair, the Government of Japan has made important and appreciated efforts to face its history. In 1993, Chief Cabinet Secretary Yohei Kono issued a statement saying the Japanese military was involved in establishing the comfort stations. He said the women- girls, really from Korea and elsewhere, had been recruited against their own will. This was based upon many documents. In 1995, on the occasion of the 50th anniversary of the end of World War II, then Prime Minister Tomiichi Murayama admitted Japan's ``colonial rule and aggression caused tremendous damage and suffering to the people of many countries, particularly to those of Asian nations. ``In the hope that no such mistake be made in the future, I regard, in a spirit of humility, these irrefutable facts of history, and express here once again my feelings of deep remorse and state my heartfelt apology.'' Yet in 2006, during Abe's first term as Prime Minister, he unleashed an international firestorm of criticism when he undermined the 1993 Kono Statement, incorrectly alleging that no documentary evidence existed of Japan's complicity in setting up and running the comfort women stations. There was, in fact, plenty of evidence, including the extensive personal testimonies of the survivors, who spoke of being raped 10, 20, up to 50 times per day. In addition, many international bodies have issued recommendations and conclusions on Japan's history and actions. In 2003, the U.N. committee that evaluates Japan's compliance with the Convention Against Torture and Other Cruel Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment expressed concern regarding inadequate remedies for the victims of sexual slavery and violence, particularly survivors of Japan's military sexual slavery practice during World War II. This committee also recommended that Japan ``provide education to address the discriminatory roots of sexual and gender-based violence violations, and provide rehabilitation measures to the victims.'' In 2008, the committee that accesses Japan's implementation of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights concluded that Japan should ``accept legal responsibility and apologize unreservedly for the `comfort women' system . . . and take immediate and effective legislative and administrative measures to adequately compensate all survivors . . . educate students and the general public about the issue, and to refute and sanction any attempts to defame the victims or deny the events.'' Talking about educating students, the books, the textbooks in Japan, still do not address the history of the military action in Asia during World War II. Following the passage of H. Res. 121, many countries followed suit and passed their own resolutions: Taiwan, Canada, Netherlands, the European Union, and South Korea. Mr. Speaker, there is nothing more important right now than for a democratic country like Japan to apologize for its past mistakes. A government is a living, breathing organism that is responsible for its past, present, and its future. Yet, as The New York Times editorial said, ``history should have been settled. That it is not settled is largely the fault of Mr. Abe and his right-wing political allies who keep questioning history and even trying to rewrite it.'' Last year, I, along with 17 of my House colleagues, wrote to the Ambassador of Japan to the U.S., calling the timing and context of the Japanese Government report on the Kono Statement regrettable, unfortunate, unacceptable, and destabilizing. Also, last year, the Abe administration tried and then failed to get the United Nations to partially retract the authoritative 1996 report, which called on Japan to apologize to the victims and pay reparations to the survivors who had been forced into sex slavery during the war. Most notably, this year, the Japanese Government tried unsuccessfully to change passages in a history textbook about the comfort women during World War II. I believe the budget of Japan Prime Minister Abe was able to secure almost half a billion dollars to effect that kind of change wherever they deemed necessary. Now, some say that Japan has apologized enough and it is time to move on. To those people I would say, given these continued revisionist attempts, for every step forward toward peace and reconciliation, the Government of Japan takes two steps backwards. Enough is enough. Seventy years later, it is time for Prime Minister Abe to be clear and unequivocal and issue an irrefutable apology, something that carries the weight of his government. The German Chancellor Angela Merkel has urged Prime Minister Abe to face Japan's history. Germany knows something about this. After World War II, it engaged in a painful national coming to terms with the past that ripped open old wounds so that they could properly heal. In 1970, on a cold and wet day in Warsaw, then-German Chancellor Willy Brandt laid down a wreath at the memorial of the Jewish ghetto. Then he fell to his knees in front of the memorial. As a reporter who witnessed this event wrote later: ``If this man, who wasn't responsible for the crime, who wasn't there in those years, now decides to walk through the former Warsaw ghetto and to kneel down--then it's clear he doesn't kneel there for his own sake . . . he confesses a guilt that he doesn't have to carry, and he asks for a forgiveness that he himself doesn't need. Then he kneels there for Germany.'' {time} 1930 And so 70 years later, Grandmother Lee and the hundreds of thousands of souls of the departed continue to wait for their justice and peace. As someone who was put into an internment camp as an infant, I know firsthand that governments must not be ignorant of their pasts. In 1942, during World War II, my country, my government, put aside the constitutional rights of Japanese Americans and systematically incarcerated thousands of us--120,000. We were U.S. citizens, but we also looked like the enemy. Decades later, we, the Japanese American community, fought for an apology from our own government. In 1988, Congress passed and President Ronald Reagan signed into law H.R. 442, the Civil Liberties Act of 1988. This was a formal apology to United States citizens of Japanese ancestry who were unjustly put into internment camps during World War II. Our government made a mistake, but they apologized for it and healed many wounds as a result. Even though 40 years have passed, it still warmed my heart to hear my government say, ``We're sorry.'' Japan must now do the same. They must show the maturity of a democratic country, apologize for their mistake, and thereby gain the trust of their sister Asian nations. Violence against women continues today. According to the World Health Organization, women aged 15 to 44 are more at risk from rape and domestic violence than cancer, car accidents, war, and malaria. By 1993, the Zenica Centre for the Registration of War and Genocide Crime in Bosnia-Herzegovina had documented 40,000 cases of war-related rape. Of a sample of Rwandan women surveyed in 1999, 39 percent reported being raped during the 1994 genocide, and 72 percent said they knew someone who had been raped. An estimated 23,000, to 46,000 Kosovar Albanian women are believed to have been raped between August 1998 and August 1999, the height of the conflict with Serbia. In 2003, 74 percent of a random sample of 399 Liberian refugee women living in camps in Sierra Leone reported being sexually abused prior to being displaced from their homes in Liberia. Fifty-five percent of them experienced sexual violence during displacement. Even today, the U.N. labeled the Democratic Republic of Congo as the ``rape capital of the world.'' There are rape camps that are destroying the lives of babies, young people--boys and girls--and women and men. In the DRC, 48 women are raped every hour. [[Page H2349]] In addition, according to a recent Human Rights Watch report, the extremist group ISIL has carried out systematic rape and other sexual violence against Yazidi women and girls in northern Iraq. ISIS forces took several thousand Yazidi civilians into custody in northern Iraq's province in August 2014, according to Kurdistan officials and community leaders. Witnesses said that fighters systematically separated young women and girls from their families and other captives and moved them from one location to another inside Iraq and Syria. The 11 women and 9 girls Human Rights Watch interviewed had escaped between September 2014 and January 2015. Half, including two 12-year- old girls, said they had been raped--some multiple times and by several ISIS fighters. Nearly all of them said they had been forced into marriage; sold--in some cases, a number of times; or given as ``gifts.'' The women and girls also witnessed other captives being abused. Violence against women must stop. Today, there are fewer than 100 surviving Comfort Women women across the Asia Pacific. Each year, this number declines. The survivors are dying by the day. They deserve the justice that has been due to them for the past 70 years. They deserve the justice that has been denied them. These women want and deserve an official apology. In 1991, with the swift courage of Kim Hak-sun, she brought to light her story of being a sex slave to the Japanese Imperial Army. Her story was the spark that ignited the flames of justice. Since then, we have the courageous survivors, such as Grandmother Lee, who continues to be a voice for the voiceless. We also have the courage of Ms. Jan Ruff O'Herne, who now resides in Australia. Ms. O'Herne was born in Java in the former Dutch East Indies, known today as Indonesia. When she was 19 years old, Japanese troops invaded Java. They were interned in Japanese prison camps. Two years later, she was selected, along with several other girls, and was told by the Japanese military that they were there for the sexual pleasure of the Japanese military. As Ms. O'Herne relayed during the 2007 House Foreign Affairs hearing on Protecting the Human Rights of Comfort Women, a Japanese officer ran his sword all over her body and forced himself on her. The trauma these women--these girls--endured is unimaginable. That is why my patience for securing justice for the dignity of these victims is running out. The opportunity to speak to a joint session of Congress is an honor that is reserved for the heads of state of our closest allies. It is my sincere hope that, for Ms. O'Herne's sake, for Kim Hak-sun's sake, for Grandmother Lee's sake, Prime Minister Abe will take the privilege to address the joint meeting of Congress and finally and firmly apologize and commit to educating the future generations honestly and humbly. The spirit of these women--these girls--deserves no less. In closing, I am going to quote Grandmother Lee's comments when she testified before our subcommittee in 2007. She said: If you cannot apologize to me, give me back my youth. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Ms. MENG. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to express my deep concern for women around the world who are targeted victims of violence. It is estimated that 1 out of every 3 women around the world will be beaten, coerced into sex, or otherwise abused in her lifetime. Women in areas of conflict are in even more danger. We know that rape and sexual assault are tools of war used around the world to terrorize entire communities. Displaced, refugee and stateless women are at an increased risk of violence, and they are often forced to exchange sex for food and humanitarian supplies. These tactics are not new, they have been used as tools of war throughout the centuries and these despicable practices have been ignored for far too long. Today, sitting in the House Gallery, is Grandmother Yong Soo Lee, a courageous survivor of war. In the 1930s and 1940s, women and girls were forced to provide sexual services for Japanese soldiers. These women are known as comfort women, and Grandmother Lee is one of the few remaining survivors still alive. Every country, including our own, has made mistakes in the past. At one time or another, each country has had to apologize for actions unbefitting its values and principles. Since the end of World War II, Japan has been one of the United States' most important allies and we have enjoyed a successful partnership based on respect and cooperation. However, the historical record on comfort women must be universally accepted, without wavering on the horrific details. In 1993, the Chief Cabinet Secretary Yohei Kono apologized to the victims and admitted responsibility by the Japanese military. Despite this apology, in the past twelve years, government officials have made statements that seem to call the Kono Statement into question. These discrepancies are an impediment to a successful tri-lateral relationship between the United States, Japan, and the Republic of Korea. Prime Minster Shinzo Abe's scheduled address to a joint meeting of Congress next week is a landmark moment for U.S.-Japan relations. I look forward to hearing Prime Minister Abe speak and it is my hope he uses this opportunity to clarify any remarks that have been interpreted as a revocation of the Kono Statement. Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I thank Congressman Honda for hosting this very important Special Order this evening. Domestic violence is the leading cause of injury for women in America. More often than not, cases of violence against women go unreported. Over 80% of women who were victimized experienced significant short- term and long-term impacts related to the violence and were more likely to experience Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder and long-term chronic diseases such as asthma and diabetes. Every year in the United States, 1,000 to 1,600 women die at the hands of their male partners, often after a long, escalating pattern of battering. In 2009, 111 women were killed by their former or current husband, intimate partner or boyfriend in the State of Texas. Domestic violence is the leading cause of injury for women in America. Every nine seconds a woman in the United States is assaulted or beaten by stalkers or her partner. Another form of violence against women is sex trafficking. Trafficking ensnares millions of women and girls in modern-day slavery. According to the FBI, sex trafficking is the fastest-growing business of organized crime and the third-largest criminal enterprise in the world. More than 300,000 American children are at risk of becoming victims of sex trafficking annually in what is estimated to be a $9.8 billion industry. Women and girls represent 55 per cent of the estimated 20.9 million victims of forced labor worldwide and 98 per cent of the estimated 4.5 million forced into sexual exploitation. Similar to current sex trafficking crimes is the past atrocity of the crimes that were committed towards the Korean women. The ``comfort women'' system of forced military prostitution by the Government of Japan, considered unprecedented in its cruelty and magnitude, included gang rape, forced abortions, humiliation, and sexual violence resulting in mutilation, death, or eventual suicide in one of the largest cases of human trafficking in the 20th century. Today, there are now only just 59 known survivors that were comfort Korean victims. There are about 200,000 women are estimated to have worked as comfort women in Japan's military brothels. Today, the comfort women issue remains taboo and controversial topic, just like other violent crimes committed to women. These women are not victims but also survivors, survivors from a brutal crime. The comfort women issue is not just about the past, but it is very relevant today. The world's strength to oppose killing today is made greater by accountability, for actions present, but also past. It's weakened by denial of accountability and obfuscation of past acts. History is a continuum that affects today and tomorrow. Women everywhere should not be victims of such an atrocity. It's much harder to get tomorrow right if we get yesterday wrong. Today, we call on to the Japanese government to apologize to the few women who continue to live with the shame of the crimes committed against them. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 58 (Tuesday, April 21, 2015)] [House] [Pages H2347-H2349] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under the Speaker's announced policy of January 6, 2015, the gentleman from California (Mr. Honda) is recognized for 60 minutes as the designee of the minority leader. General Leave Mr. HONDA. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous material on the subject of my Special Order. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from California? There was no objection. Mr. HONDA. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to address the ongoing horror and nightmare that is violence against women. Whether in times of conflict or disaster, too often we see the worst battles fought on women and girls' bodies. Tonight, Mr. Speaker, I am honored to recognize one woman who has survived unspeakable violence. She is a survivor. At 87 years old, she traveled all the way from South Korea. Her name is Lee Yong-Soo, known to everyone as Grandmother Lee. She has become the voice of justice, peace, and reconciliation. In 1944, 16-year-old Yong-Soo Lee of Tasegu, Korea, was lured by a friend of hers to meet with an older Japanese man. The man took the two of them and three other teenaged girls by train, then ship to Taiwan. There, the girls were forced into sexual slavery, serving four to five Japanese soldiers every day for a year. Ms. Lee suffered beatings and torture, was infected with venereal disease, was fed paltry amounts, faced temperatures so cold that ice formed on her body, and was never allowed outside. Only the end of World War II brought her relief. Ms. Lee is just one example of the over 200,000 women from Korea, China, the Philippines, Burma, Thailand, Vietnam, Malaysia, Taiwan, Indonesia, and East Timor who were kidnapped and sexually enslaved by the Japanese Imperial Army during World War II. These so-called comfort women suffered serious physical, emotional, and psychological damages as a result of their ordeal. Of her 200,000 sisters, Grandmother Lee is but one out of a handful of survivors across Asia Pacific still alive. Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton was right when she reportedly called these victims, rather than ``comfort women,'' ``sex slaves.'' When Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe addresses a joint meeting of Congress next week on April 29, he has the opportunity to do right by these women. He can make a full, unequivocal, and formal apology on behalf of the Japanese Government. The Prime Minister's visit is indeed a historic one. He will be the first Japanese Prime Minister to address a joint meeting of Congress. He will address this institution on the occasion of the 70th anniversary of the end of World War II and the 50th anniversary of the normalization between Korea and Japan. Prime Minister Abe will address this hallowed Chamber, where President Roosevelt delivered an address to our body as America entered war. There is much to be expected and anticipated in next week's address. According to yesterday's editorial by The New York Times, the success of Prime Minister Abe's visit ``depends on whether and how honestly Mr. Abe confronts Japan's wartime history, including its decision to wage war, its brutal occupation of China and Korea, its atrocities and its enslavement of thousands of women forced to work as sex slaves or `comfort women' in wartime brothels.'' Mr. Speaker, in 2007, the House of Representatives sent a profound message to the Government of Japan by passing H. Res. 121, which I authored. The resolution stated: ``That it is the sense of the House of Representatives that the Government of Japan: ``(1) should formally acknowledge, apologize, and accept historical responsibility in a clear and unequivocal manner for its Imperial Armed Forces' coercion of young women into sexual slavery, known to the world as comfort women, during its colonial and wartime occupation of Asia and the Pacific Islands from the 1930s through the duration of World War II; ``( 2) would help to resolve recurring questions about the sincerity and status of prior statements if the Prime Minister of Japan were to make such an apology as a public statement in his official capacity; ``(3) should clearly and publicly refute any claims that the sexual enslavement and trafficking of the comfort women for the Japanese Imperial Armed Forces never occurred; and [[Page H2348]] ``(4) should educate current and future generations about this horrible crime while following the recommendations of the international community with respect to the comfort women.'' And yet the Japanese Government has continued to fail to address this resolution. To be fair, the Government of Japan has made important and appreciated efforts to face its history. In 1993, Chief Cabinet Secretary Yohei Kono issued a statement saying the Japanese military was involved in establishing the comfort stations. He said the women- girls, really from Korea and elsewhere, had been recruited against their own will. This was based upon many documents. In 1995, on the occasion of the 50th anniversary of the end of World War II, then Prime Minister Tomiichi Murayama admitted Japan's ``colonial rule and aggression caused tremendous damage and suffering to the people of many countries, particularly to those of Asian nations. ``In the hope that no such mistake be made in the future, I regard, in a spirit of humility, these irrefutable facts of history, and express here once again my feelings of deep remorse and state my heartfelt apology.'' Yet in 2006, during Abe's first term as Prime Minister, he unleashed an international firestorm of criticism when he undermined the 1993 Kono Statement, incorrectly alleging that no documentary evidence existed of Japan's complicity in setting up and running the comfort women stations. There was, in fact, plenty of evidence, including the extensive personal testimonies of the survivors, who spoke of being raped 10, 20, up to 50 times per day. In addition, many international bodies have issued recommendations and conclusions on Japan's history and actions. In 2003, the U.N. committee that evaluates Japan's compliance with the Convention Against Torture and Other Cruel Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment expressed concern regarding inadequate remedies for the victims of sexual slavery and violence, particularly survivors of Japan's military sexual slavery practice during World War II. This committee also recommended that Japan ``provide education to address the discriminatory roots of sexual and gender-based violence violations, and provide rehabilitation measures to the victims.'' In 2008, the committee that accesses Japan's implementation of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights concluded that Japan should ``accept legal responsibility and apologize unreservedly for the `comfort women' system . . . and take immediate and effective legislative and administrative measures to adequately compensate all survivors . . . educate students and the general public about the issue, and to refute and sanction any attempts to defame the victims or deny the events.'' Talking about educating students, the books, the textbooks in Japan, still do not address the history of the military action in Asia during World War II. Following the passage of H. Res. 121, many countries followed suit and passed their own resolutions: Taiwan, Canada, Netherlands, the European Union, and South Korea. Mr. Speaker, there is nothing more important right now than for a democratic country like Japan to apologize for its past mistakes. A government is a living, breathing organism that is responsible for its past, present, and its future. Yet, as The New York Times editorial said, ``history should have been settled. That it is not settled is largely the fault of Mr. Abe and his right-wing political allies who keep questioning history and even trying to rewrite it.'' Last year, I, along with 17 of my House colleagues, wrote to the Ambassador of Japan to the U.S., calling the timing and context of the Japanese Government report on the Kono Statement regrettable, unfortunate, unacceptable, and destabilizing. Also, last year, the Abe administration tried and then failed to get the United Nations to partially retract the authoritative 1996 report, which called on Japan to apologize to the victims and pay reparations to the survivors who had been forced into sex slavery during the war. Most notably, this year, the Japanese Government tried unsuccessfully to change passages in a history textbook about the comfort women during World War II. I believe the budget of Japan Prime Minister Abe was able to secure almost half a billion dollars to effect that kind of change wherever they deemed necessary. Now, some say that Japan has apologized enough and it is time to move on. To those people I would say, given these continued revisionist attempts, for every step forward toward peace and reconciliation, the Government of Japan takes two steps backwards. Enough is enough. Seventy years later, it is time for Prime Minister Abe to be clear and unequivocal and issue an irrefutable apology, something that carries the weight of his government. The German Chancellor Angela Merkel has urged Prime Minister Abe to face Japan's history. Germany knows something about this. After World War II, it engaged in a painful national coming to terms with the past that ripped open old wounds so that they could properly heal. In 1970, on a cold and wet day in Warsaw, then-German Chancellor Willy Brandt laid down a wreath at the memorial of the Jewish ghetto. Then he fell to his knees in front of the memorial. As a reporter who witnessed this event wrote later: ``If this man, who wasn't responsible for the crime, who wasn't there in those years, now decides to walk through the former Warsaw ghetto and to kneel down--then it's clear he doesn't kneel there for his own sake . . . he confesses a guilt that he doesn't have to carry, and he asks for a forgiveness that he himself doesn't need. Then he kneels there for Germany.'' {time} 1930 And so 70 years later, Grandmother Lee and the hundreds of thousands of souls of the departed continue to wait for their justice and peace. As someone who was put into an internment camp as an infant, I know firsthand that governments must not be ignorant of their pasts. In 1942, during World War II, my country, my government, put aside the constitutional rights of Japanese Americans and systematically incarcerated thousands of us--120,000. We were U.S. citizens, but we also looked like the enemy. Decades later, we, the Japanese American community, fought for an apology from our own government. In 1988, Congress passed and President Ronald Reagan signed into law H.R. 442, the Civil Liberties Act of 1988. This was a formal apology to United States citizens of Japanese ancestry who were unjustly put into internment camps during World War II. Our government made a mistake, but they apologized for it and healed many wounds as a result. Even though 40 years have passed, it still warmed my heart to hear my government say, ``We're sorry.'' Japan must now do the same. They must show the maturity of a democratic country, apologize for their mistake, and thereby gain the trust of their sister Asian nations. Violence against women continues today. According to the World Health Organization, women aged 15 to 44 are more at risk from rape and domestic violence than cancer, car accidents, war, and malaria. By 1993, the Zenica Centre for the Registration of War and Genocide Crime in Bosnia-Herzegovina had documented 40,000 cases of war-related rape. Of a sample of Rwandan women surveyed in 1999, 39 percent reported being raped during the 1994 genocide, and 72 percent said they knew someone who had been raped. An estimated 23,000, to 46,000 Kosovar Albanian women are believed to have been raped between August 1998 and August 1999, the height of the conflict with Serbia. In 2003, 74 percent of a random sample of 399 Liberian refugee women living in camps in Sierra Leone reported being sexually abused prior to being displaced from their homes in Liberia. Fifty-five percent of them experienced sexual violence during displacement. Even today, the U.N. labeled the Democratic Republic of Congo as the ``rape capital of the world.'' There are rape camps that are destroying the lives of babies, young people--boys and girls--and women and men. In the DRC, 48 women are raped every hour. [[Page H2349]] In addition, according to a recent Human Rights Watch report, the extremist group ISIL has carried out systematic rape and other sexual violence against Yazidi women and girls in northern Iraq. ISIS forces took several thousand Yazidi civilians into custody in northern Iraq's province in August 2014, according to Kurdistan officials and community leaders. Witnesses said that fighters systematically separated young women and girls from their families and other captives and moved them from one location to another inside Iraq and Syria. The 11 women and 9 girls Human Rights Watch interviewed had escaped between September 2014 and January 2015. Half, including two 12-year- old girls, said they had been raped--some multiple times and by several ISIS fighters. Nearly all of them said they had been forced into marriage; sold--in some cases, a number of times; or given as ``gifts.'' The women and girls also witnessed other captives being abused. Violence against women must stop. Today, there are fewer than 100 surviving Comfort Women women across the Asia Pacific. Each year, this number declines. The survivors are dying by the day. They deserve the justice that has been due to them for the past 70 years. They deserve the justice that has been denied them. These women want and deserve an official apology.

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from California? There was no objection. Mr. HONDA. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to address the ongoing horror and nightmare that is violence against women. Whether in times of conflict or disaster, too often we see the worst battles fought on women and girls' bodies. Tonight, Mr. Speaker, I am honored to recognize one woman who has survived unspeakable violence. She is a survivor. At 87 years old, she traveled all the way from South Korea. Her name is Lee Yong-Soo, known to everyone as Grandmother Lee. She has become the voice of justice, peace, and reconciliation. In 1944, 16-year-old Yong-Soo Lee of Tasegu, Korea, was lured by a friend of hers to meet with an older Japanese man. The man took the two of them and three other teenaged girls by train, then ship to Taiwan. There, the girls were forced into sexual slavery, serving four to five Japanese soldiers every day for a year. Ms. Lee suffered beatings and torture, was infected with venereal disease, was fed paltry amounts, faced temperatures so cold that ice formed on her body, and was never allowed outside. Only the end of World War II brought her relief. Ms. Lee is just one example of the over 200,000 women from Korea, China, the Philippines, Burma, Thailand, Vietnam, Malaysia, Taiwan, Indonesia, and East Timor who were kidnapped and sexually enslaved by the Japanese Imperial Army during World War II. These so-called comfort women suffered serious physical, emotional, and psychological damages as a result of their ordeal. Of her 200,000 sisters, Grandmother Lee is but one out of a handful of survivors across Asia Pacific still alive. Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton was right when she reportedly called these victims, rather than ``comfort women,'' ``sex slaves.'' When Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe addresses a joint meeting of Congress next week on April 29, he has the opportunity to do right by these women. He can make a full, unequivocal, and formal apology on behalf of the Japanese Government. The Prime Minister's visit is indeed a historic one. He will be the first Japanese Prime Minister to address a joint meeting of Congress. He will address this institution on the occasion of the 70th anniversary of the end of World War II and the 50th anniversary of the normalization between Korea and Japan. Prime Minister Abe will address this hallowed Chamber, where President Roosevelt delivered an address to our body as America entered war. There is much to be expected and anticipated in next week's address. According to yesterday's editorial by The New York Times, the success of Prime Minister Abe's visit ``depends on whether and how honestly Mr. Abe confronts Japan's wartime history, including its decision to wage war, its brutal occupation of China and Korea, its atrocities and its enslavement of thousands of women forced to work as sex slaves or `comfort women' in wartime brothels.'' Mr. Speaker, in 2007, the House of Representatives sent a profound message to the Government of Japan by passing H. Res. 121, which I authored. The resolution stated: ``That it is the sense of the House of Representatives that the Government of Japan: ``(1) should formally acknowledge, apologize, and accept historical responsibility in a clear and unequivocal manner for its Imperial Armed Forces' coercion of young women into sexual slavery, known to the world as comfort women, during its colonial and wartime occupation of Asia and the Pacific Islands from the 1930s through the duration of World War II; ``( 2) would help to resolve recurring questions about the sincerity and status of prior statements if the Prime Minister of Japan were to make such an apology as a public statement in his official capacity; ``(3) should clearly and publicly refute any claims that the sexual enslavement and trafficking of the comfort women for the Japanese Imperial Armed Forces never occurred; and [[Page H2348]] ``(4) should educate current and future generations about this horrible crime while following the recommendations of the international community with respect to the comfort women.'' And yet the Japanese Government has continued to fail to address this resolution. To be fair, the Government of Japan has made important and appreciated efforts to face its history. In 1993, Chief Cabinet Secretary Yohei Kono issued a statement saying the Japanese military was involved in establishing the comfort stations. He said the women- girls, really from Korea and elsewhere, had been recruited against their own will. This was based upon many documents. In 1995, on the occasion of the 50th anniversary of the end of World War II, then Prime Minister Tomiichi Murayama admitted Japan's ``colonial rule and aggression caused tremendous damage and suffering to the people of many countries, particularly to those of Asian nations. ``In the hope that no such mistake be made in the future, I regard, in a spirit of humility, these irrefutable facts of history, and express here once again my feelings of deep remorse and state my heartfelt apology.'' Yet in 2006, during Abe's first term as Prime Minister, he unleashed an international firestorm of criticism when he undermined the 1993 Kono Statement, incorrectly alleging that no documentary evidence existed of Japan's complicity in setting up and running the comfort women stations. There was, in fact, plenty of evidence, including the extensive personal testimonies of the survivors, who spoke of being raped 10, 20, up to 50 times per day. In addition, many international bodies have issued recommendations and conclusions on Japan's history and actions. In 2003, the U.N. committee that evaluates Japan's compliance with the Convention Against Torture and Other Cruel Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment expressed concern regarding inadequate remedies for the victims of sexual slavery and violence, particularly survivors of Japan's military sexual slavery practice during World War II. This committee also recommended that Japan ``provide education to address the discriminatory roots of sexual and gender-based violence violations, and provide rehabilitation measures to the victims.'' In 2008, the committee that accesses Japan's implementation of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights concluded that Japan should ``accept legal responsibility and apologize unreservedly for the `comfort women' system . . . and take immediate and effective legislative and administrative measures to adequately compensate all survivors . . . educate students and the general public about the issue, and to refute and sanction any attempts to defame the victims or deny the events.'' Talking about educating students, the books, the textbooks in Japan, still do not address the history of the military action in Asia during World War II. Following the passage of H. Res. 121, many countries followed suit and passed their own resolutions: Taiwan, Canada, Netherlands, the European Union, and South Korea. Mr. Speaker, there is nothing more important right now than for a democratic country like Japan to apologize for its past mistakes. A government is a living, breathing organism that is responsible for its past, present, and its future. Yet, as The New York Times editorial said, ``history should have been settled. That it is not settled is largely the fault of Mr. Abe and his right-wing political allies who keep questioning history and even trying to rewrite it.'' Last year, I, along with 17 of my House colleagues, wrote to the Ambassador of Japan to the U.S., calling the timing and context of the Japanese Government report on the Kono Statement regrettable, unfortunate, unacceptable, and destabilizing. Also, last year, the Abe administration tried and then failed to get the United Nations to partially retract the authoritative 1996 report, which called on Japan to apologize to the victims and pay reparations to the survivors who had been forced into sex slavery during the war. Most notably, this year, the Japanese Government tried unsuccessfully to change passages in a history textbook about the comfort women during World War II. I believe the budget of Japan Prime Minister Abe was able to secure almost half a billion dollars to effect that kind of change wherever they deemed necessary. Now, some say that Japan has apologized enough and it is time to move on. To those people I would say, given these continued revisionist attempts, for every step forward toward peace and reconciliation, the Government of Japan takes two steps backwards. Enough is enough. Seventy years later, it is time for Prime Minister Abe to be clear and unequivocal and issue an irrefutable apology, something that carries the weight of his government. The German Chancellor Angela Merkel has urged Prime Minister Abe to face Japan's history. Germany knows something about this. After World War II, it engaged in a painful national coming to terms with the past that ripped open old wounds so that they could properly heal. In 1970, on a cold and wet day in Warsaw, then-German Chancellor Willy Brandt laid down a wreath at the memorial of the Jewish ghetto. Then he fell to his knees in front of the memorial. As a reporter who witnessed this event wrote later: ``If this man, who wasn't responsible for the crime, who wasn't there in those years, now decides to walk through the former Warsaw ghetto and to kneel down--then it's clear he doesn't kneel there for his own sake . . . he confesses a guilt that he doesn't have to carry, and he asks for a forgiveness that he himself doesn't need. Then he kneels there for Germany.'' {time} 1930 And so 70 years later, Grandmother Lee and the hundreds of thousands of souls of the departed continue to wait for their justice and peace. As someone who was put into an internment camp as an infant, I know firsthand that governments must not be ignorant of their pasts. In 1942, during World War II, my country, my government, put aside the constitutional rights of Japanese Americans and systematically incarcerated thousands of us--120,000. We were U.S. citizens, but we also looked like the enemy. Decades later, we, the Japanese American community, fought for an apology from our own government. In 1988, Congress passed and President Ronald Reagan signed into law H.R. 442, the Civil Liberties Act of 1988. This was a formal apology to United States citizens of Japanese ancestry who were unjustly put into internment camps during World War II. Our government made a mistake, but they apologized for it and healed many wounds as a result. Even though 40 years have passed, it still warmed my heart to hear my government say, ``We're sorry.'' Japan must now do the same. They must show the maturity of a democratic country, apologize for their mistake, and thereby gain the trust of their sister Asian nations. Violence against women continues today. According to the World Health Organization, women aged 15 to 44 are more at risk from rape and domestic violence than cancer, car accidents, war, and malaria. By 1993, the Zenica Centre for the Registration of War and Genocide Crime in Bosnia-Herzegovina had documented 40,000 cases of war-related rape. Of a sample of Rwandan women surveyed in 1999, 39 percent reported being raped during the 1994 genocide, and 72 percent said they knew someone who had been raped. An estimated 23,000, to 46,000 Kosovar Albanian women are believed to have been raped between August 1998 and August 1999, the height of the conflict with Serbia. In 2003, 74 percent of a random sample of 399 Liberian refugee women living in camps in Sierra Leone reported being sexually abused prior to being displaced from their homes in Liberia. Fifty-five percent of them experienced sexual violence during displacement. Even today, the U.N. labeled the Democratic Republic of Congo as the ``rape capital of the world.'' There are rape camps that are destroying the lives of babies, young people--boys and girls--and women and men. In the DRC, 48 women are raped every hour. [[Page H2349]] In addition, according to a recent Human Rights Watch report, the extremist group ISIL has carried out systematic rape and other sexual violence against Yazidi women and girls in northern Iraq. ISIS forces took several thousand Yazidi civilians into custody in northern Iraq's province in August 2014, according to Kurdistan officials and community leaders. Witnesses said that fighters systematically separated young women and girls from their families and other captives and moved them from one location to another inside Iraq and Syria. The 11 women and 9 girls Human Rights Watch interviewed had escaped between September 2014 and January 2015. Half, including two 12-year- old girls, said they had been raped--some multiple times and by several ISIS fighters. Nearly all of them said they had been forced into marriage; sold--in some cases, a number of times; or given as ``gifts.'' The women and girls also witnessed other captives being abused. Violence against women must stop. Today, there are fewer than 100 surviving Comfort Women women across the Asia Pacific. Each year, this number declines. The survivors are dying by the day. They deserve the justice that has been due to them for the past 70 years. They deserve the justice that has been denied them. These women want and deserve an official apology. In 1991, with the swift courage of Kim Hak-sun, she brought to light her story of being a sex slave to the Japanese Imperial Army. Her story was the spark that ignited the flames of justice. Since then, we have the courageous survivors, such as Grandmother Lee, who continues to be a voice for the voiceless. We also have the courage of Ms. Jan Ruff O'Herne, who now resides in Australia. Ms. O'Herne was born in Java in the former Dutch East Indies, known today as Indonesia. When she was 19 years old, Japanese troops invaded Java. They were interned in Japanese prison camps. Two years later, she was selected, along with several other girls, and was told by the Japanese military that they were there for the sexual pleasure of the Japanese military. As Ms. O'Herne relayed during the 2007 House Foreign Affairs hearing on Protecting the Human Rights of Comfort Women, a Japanese officer ran his sword all over her body and forced himself on her. The trauma these women--these girls--endured is unimaginable. That is why my patience for securing justice for the dignity of these victims is running out. The opportunity to speak to a joint session of Congress is an honor that is reserved for the heads of state of our closest allies. It is my sincere hope that, for Ms. O'Herne's sake, for Kim Hak-sun's sake, for Grandmother Lee's sake, Prime Minister Abe will take the privilege to address the joint meeting of Congress and finally and firmly apologize and commit to educating the future generations honestly and humbly. The spirit of these women--these girls--deserves no less. In closing, I am going to quote Grandmother Lee's comments when she testified before our subcommittee in 2007. She said: If you cannot apologize to me, give me back my youth. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Ms. MENG. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to express my deep concern for women around the world who are targeted victims of violence. It is estimated that 1 out of every 3 women around the world will be beaten, coerced into sex, or otherwise abused in her lifetime. Women in areas of conflict are in even more danger. We know that rape and sexual assault are tools of war used around the world to terrorize entire communities. Displaced, refugee and stateless women are at an increased risk of violence, and they are often forced to exchange sex for food and humanitarian supplies. These tactics are not new, they have been used as tools of war throughout the centuries and these despicable practices have been ignored for far too long. Today, sitting in the House Gallery, is Grandmother Yong Soo Lee, a courageous survivor of war. In the 1930s and 1940s, women and girls were forced to provide sexual services for Japanese soldiers. These women are known as comfort women, and Grandmother Lee is one of the few remaining survivors still alive. Every country, including our own, has made mistakes in the past. At one time or another, each country has had to apologize for actions unbefitting its values and principles. Since the end of World War II, Japan has been one of the United States' most important allies and we have enjoyed a successful partnership based on respect and cooperation. However, the historical record on comfort women must be universally accepted, without wavering on the horrific details. In 1993, the Chief Cabinet Secretary Yohei Kono apologized to the victims and admitted responsibility by the Japanese military. Despite this apology, in the past twelve years, government officials have made statements that seem to call the Kono Statement into question. These discrepancies are an impediment to a successful tri-lateral relationship between the United States, Japan, and the Republic of Korea. Prime Minster Shinzo Abe's scheduled address to a joint meeting of Congress next week is a landmark moment for U.S.-Japan relations. I look forward to hearing Prime Minister Abe speak and it is my hope he uses this opportunity to clarify any remarks that have been interpreted as a revocation of the Kono Statement. Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I thank Congressman Honda for hosting this very important Special Order this evening. Domestic violence is the leading cause of injury for women in America. More often than not, cases of violence against women go unreported. Over 80% of women who were victimized experienced significant short- term and long-term impacts related to the violence and were more likely to experience Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder and long-term chronic diseases such as asthma and diabetes. Every year in the United States, 1,000 to 1,600 women die at the hands of their male partners, often after a long, escalating pattern of battering. In 2009, 111 women were killed by their former or current husband, intimate partner or boyfriend in the State of Texas. Domestic violence is the leading cause of injury for women in America. Every nine seconds a woman in the United States is assaulted or beaten by stalkers or her partner. Another form of violence against women is sex trafficking. Trafficking ensnares millions of women and girls in modern-day slavery. According to the FBI, sex trafficking is the fastest-growing business of organized crime and the third-largest criminal enterprise in the world. More than 300,000 American children are at risk of becoming victims of sex trafficking annually in what is estimated to be a $9.8 billion industry. Women and girls represent 55 per cent of the estimated 20.9 million victims of forced labor worldwide and 98 per cent of the estimated 4.5 million forced into sexual exploitation. Similar to current sex trafficking crimes is the past atrocity of the crimes that were committed towards the Korean women. The ``comfort women'' system of forced military prostitution by the Government of Japan, considered unprecedented in its cruelty and magnitude, included gang rape, forced abortions, humiliation, and sexual violence resulting in mutilation, death, or eventual suicide in one of the largest cases of human trafficking in the 20th century. Today, there are now only just 59 known survivors that were comfort Korean victims. There are about 200,000 women are estimated to have worked as comfort women in Japan's military brothels. Today, the comfort women issue remains taboo and controversial topic, just like other violent crimes committed to women. These women are not victims but also survivors, survivors from a brutal crime. The comfort women issue is not just about the past, but it is very relevant today. The world's strength to oppose killing today is made greater by accountability, for actions present, but also past. It's weakened by denial of accountability and obfuscation of past acts. History is a continuum that affects today and tomorrow. Women everywhere should not be victims of such an atrocity. It's much harder to get tomorrow right if we get yesterday wrong. Today, we call on to the Japanese government to apologize to the few women who continue to live with the shame of the crimes committed against them.

through the government publishing office [ www.gpo.gov ] violence against women the speaker pro tempore. under the speaker's announced policy of january 6, 2015, the gentleman from california (mr. honda) is recognized for 60 minutes as the designee of the minority leader. general leave mr. honda. mr. speaker, i ask unanimous consent that all members have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous material on the subject of my special order. the speaker pro tempore. is there objection to the request of the gentleman from california? there was no objection. mr. honda. mr. speaker, i rise today to address the ongoing horror and nightmare that is violence against women. whether in times of conflict or disaster, too often we see the worst battles fought on women and girls' bodies. tonight, mr. speaker, i am honored to recognize one woman who has survived unspeakable violence. she is a survivor. at 87 years old, she traveled all the way from south korea. her name is lee yong-soo, known to everyone as grandmother lee. she has become the voice of justice, peace, and reconciliation. in 1944, 16-year-old yong-soo lee of tasegu, korea, was lured by a friend of hers to meet with an older japanese man. the man took the two of them and three other teenaged girls by train, then ship to taiwan. there, the girls were forced into sexual slavery, serving four to five japanese soldiers every day for a year. ms. lee suffered beatings and torture, was infected with venereal disease, was fed paltry amounts, faced temperatures so cold that ice formed on her body, and was never allowed outside. only the end of world war ii brought her relief. ms. lee is just one example of the over 200,000 women from korea, china, the philippines, burma, thailand, vietnam, malaysia, taiwan, indonesia, and east timor who were kidnapped and sexually enslaved by the japanese imperial army during world war ii. these so-called comfort women suffered serious physical, emotional, and psychological damages as a result of their ordeal. of her 200,000 sisters, grandmother lee is but one out of a handful of survivors across asia pacific still alive. former secretary of state hillary clinton was right when she reportedly called these victims, rather than ``comfort women,'' ``sex slaves.'' when japanese prime minister shinzo abe addresses a joint meeting of congress next week on april 29, he has the opportunity to do right by these women. he can make a full, unequivocal, and formal apology on behalf of the japanese government. the prime minister's visit is indeed a historic one. he will be the first japanese prime minister to address a joint meeting of congress. he will address this institution on the occasion of the 70th anniversary of the end of world war ii and the 50th anniversary of the normalization between korea and japan. prime minister abe will address this hallowed chamber, where president roosevelt delivered an address to our body as america entered war. there is much to be expected and anticipated in next week's address. according to yesterday's editorial by the new york times, the success of prime minister abe's visit ``depends on whether and how honestly mr. abe confronts japan's wartime history, including its decision to wage war, its brutal occupation of china and korea, its atrocities and its enslavement of thousands of women forced to work as sex slaves or `comfort women' in wartime brothels.'' mr. speaker, in 2007, the house of representatives sent a profound message to the government of japan by passing h. res. 121, which i authored. the resolution stated: ``that it is the sense of the house of representatives that the government of japan: ``(1) should formally acknowledge, apologize, and accept historical responsibility in a clear and unequivocal manner for its imperial armed forces' coercion of young women into sexual slavery, known to the world as comfort women, during its colonial and wartime occupation of asia and the pacific islands from the 1930s through the duration of world war ii; ``( 2) would help to resolve recurring questions about the sincerity and status of prior statements if the prime minister of japan were to make such an apology as a public statement in his official capacity; ``(3) should clearly and publicly refute any claims that the sexual enslavement and trafficking of the comfort women for the japanese imperial armed forces never occurred; and [[page h2348]] ``(4) should educate current and future generations about this horrible crime while following the recommendations of the international community with respect to the comfort women.'' and yet the japanese government has continued to fail to address this resolution. to be fair, the government of japan has made important and appreciated efforts to face its history. in 1993, chief cabinet secretary yohei kono issued a statement saying the japanese military was involved in establishing the comfort stations. he said the women- girls, really from korea and elsewhere, had been recruited against their own will. this was based upon many documents. in 1995, on the occasion of the 50th anniversary of the end of world war ii, then prime minister tomiichi murayama admitted japan's ``colonial rule and aggression caused tremendous damage and suffering to the people of many countries, particularly to those of asian nations. ``in the hope that no such mistake be made in the future, i regard, in a spirit of humility, these irrefutable facts of history, and express here once again my feelings of deep remorse and state my heartfelt apology.'' yet in 2006, during abe's first term as prime minister, he unleashed an international firestorm of criticism when he undermined the 1993 kono statement, incorrectly alleging that no documentary evidence existed of japan's complicity in setting up and running the comfort women stations. there was, in fact, plenty of evidence, including the extensive personal testimonies of the survivors, who spoke of being raped 10, 20, up to 50 times per day. in addition, many international bodies have issued recommendations and conclusions on japan's history and actions. in 2003, the u.n. committee that evaluates japan's compliance with the convention against torture and other cruel inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment expressed concern regarding inadequate remedies for the victims of sexual slavery and violence, particularly survivors of japan's military sexual slavery practice during world war ii. this committee also recommended that japan ``provide education to address the discriminatory roots of sexual and gender-based violence violations, and provide rehabilitation measures to the victims.'' in 2008, the committee that accesses japan's implementation of the international covenant on civil and political rights concluded that japan should ``accept legal responsibility and apologize unreservedly for the `comfort women' system . . . and take immediate and effective legislative and administrative measures to adequately compensate all survivors . . . educate students and the general public about the issue, and to refute and sanction any attempts to defame the victims or deny the events.'' talking about educating students, the books, the textbooks in japan, still do not address the history of the military action in asia during world war ii. following the passage of h. res. 121, many countries followed suit and passed their own resolutions: taiwan, canada, netherlands, the european union, and south korea. mr. speaker, there is nothing more important right now than for a democratic country like japan to apologize for its past mistakes. a government is a living, breathing organism that is responsible for its past, present, and its future. yet, as the new york times editorial said, ``history should have been settled. that it is not settled is largely the fault of mr. abe and his right-wing political allies who keep questioning history and even trying to rewrite it.'' last year, i, along with 17 of my house colleagues, wrote to the ambassador of japan to the u.s., calling the timing and context of the japanese government report on the kono statement regrettable, unfortunate, unacceptable, and destabilizing. also, last year, the abe administration tried and then failed to get the united nations to partially retract the authoritative 1996 report, which called on japan to apologize to the victims and pay reparations to the survivors who had been forced into sex slavery during the war. most notably, this year, the japanese government tried unsuccessfully to change passages in a history textbook about the comfort women during world war ii. i believe the budget of japan prime minister abe was able to secure almost half a billion dollars to effect that kind of change wherever they deemed necessary. now, some say that japan has apologized enough and it is time to move on. to those people i would say, given these continued revisionist attempts, for every step forward toward peace and reconciliation, the government of japan takes two steps backwards. enough is enough. seventy years later, it is time for prime minister abe to be clear and unequivocal and issue an irrefutable apology, something that carries the weight of his government. the german chancellor angela merkel has urged prime minister abe to face japan's history. germany knows something about this. after world war ii, it engaged in a painful national coming to terms with the past that ripped open old wounds so that they could properly heal. in 1970, on a cold and wet day in warsaw, then-german chancellor willy brandt laid down a wreath at the memorial of the jewish ghetto. then he fell to his knees in front of the memorial. as a reporter who witnessed this event wrote later: ``if this man, who wasn't responsible for the crime, who wasn't there in those years, now decides to walk through the former warsaw ghetto and to kneel down--then it's clear he doesn't kneel there for his own sake . . . he confesses a guilt that he doesn't have to carry, and he asks for a forgiveness that he himself doesn't need. then he kneels there for germany.'' {time} 1930 and so 70 years later, grandmother lee and the hundreds of thousands of souls of the departed continue to wait for their justice and peace. as someone who was put into an internment camp as an infant, i know firsthand that governments must not be ignorant of their pasts. in 1942, during world war ii, my country, my government, put aside the constitutional rights of japanese americans and systematically incarcerated thousands of us--120,000. we were u.s. citizens, but we also looked like the enemy. decades later, we, the japanese american community, fought for an apology from our own government. in 1988, congress passed and president ronald reagan signed into law h.r. 442, the civil liberties act of 1988. this was a formal apology to united states citizens of japanese ancestry who were unjustly put into internment camps during world war ii. our government made a mistake, but they apologized for it and healed many wounds as a result. even though 40 years have passed, it still warmed my heart to hear my government say, ``we're sorry.'' japan must now do the same. they must show the maturity of a democratic country, apologize for their mistake, and thereby gain the trust of their sister asian nations. violence against women continues today. according to the world health organization, women aged 15 to 44 are more at risk from rape and domestic violence than cancer, car accidents, war, and malaria. by 1993, the zenica centre for the registration of war and genocide crime in bosnia-herzegovina had documented 40,000 cases of war-related rape. of a sample of rwandan women surveyed in 1999, 39 percent reported being raped during the 1994 genocide, and 72 percent said they knew someone who had been raped. an estimated 23,000, to 46,000 kosovar albanian women are believed to have been raped between august 1998 and august 1999, the height of the conflict with serbia. in 2003, 74 percent of a random sample of 399 liberian refugee women living in camps in sierra leone reported being sexually abused prior to being displaced from their homes in liberia. fifty-five percent of them experienced sexual violence during displacement. even today, the u.n. labeled the democratic republic of congo as the ``rape capital of the world.'' there are rape camps that are destroying the lives of babies, young people--boys and girls--and women and men. in the drc, 48 women are raped every hour. [[page h2349]] in addition, according to a recent human rights watch report, the extremist group isil has carried out systematic rape and other sexual violence against yazidi women and girls in northern iraq. isis forces took several thousand yazidi civilians into custody in northern iraq's province in august 2014, according to kurdistan officials and community leaders. witnesses said that fighters systematically separated young women and girls from their families and other captives and moved them from one location to another inside iraq and syria. the 11 women and 9 girls human rights watch interviewed had escaped between september 2014 and january 2015. half, including two 12-year- old girls, said they had been raped--some multiple times and by several isis fighters. nearly all of them said they had been forced into marriage; sold--in some cases, a number of times; or given as ``gifts.'' the women and girls also witnessed other captives being abused. violence against women must stop. today, there are fewer than 100 surviving comfort women women across the asia pacific. each year, this number declines. the survivors are dying by the day. they deserve the justice that has been due to them for the past 70 years. they deserve the justice that has been denied them. these women want and deserve an official apology. in 1991, with the swift courage of kim hak-sun, she brought to

who continues to be a voice for the voiceless. we also have the courage of ms. jan ruff o'herne, who now resides in australia. ms. o'herne was born in java in the former dutch east indies, known today as indonesia. when she was 19 years old, japanese troops invaded java. they were interned in japanese prison camps. two years later, she was selected, along with several other girls, and was told by

america. more often than not, cases of violence against women go unreported. over 80% of women who were victimized experienced significant short- term and long-term impacts related to the violence and were more likely to experience post-traumatic stress disorder and long-term chronic diseases such as asthma and diabetes. every year in the united states, 1,000 to 1,600 women die at the hands of their male partners, often after a long, escalating pattern of battering. in 2009, 111 women were killed by their former or current husband, intimate partner or boyfriend in the state of texas. domestic violence is the leading cause of injury for women in america. every nine seconds a woman in the united states is assaulted or beaten by stalkers or her partner. another form of violence against women is sex trafficking. trafficking ensnares millions of women and girls in modern-day slavery. according to the fbi, sex trafficking is the fastest-growing business of organized crime and the third-largest criminal enterprise in the world. more than 300,000 american children are at risk of becoming victims of sex trafficking annually in what is estimated to be a $9.8 billion industry. women and girls represent 55 per cent of the estimated 20.9 million victims of forced labor worldwide and 98 per cent of the estimated 4.5 million forced into sexual exploitation. similar to current sex trafficking crimes is the past atrocity of the crimes that were committed towards the korean women. the ``comfort women'' system of forced military prostitution by the government of japan, considered unprecedented in its cruelty and magnitude, included gang rape, forced abortions, humiliation, and sexual violence resulting in mutilation, death, or eventual suicide in one of the largest cases of human trafficking in the 20th century. today, there are now only just 59 known survivors that were comfort korean victims. there are about 200,000 women are estimated to have worked as comfort women in japan's military brothels. today, the comfort women issue remains taboo and controversial topic, just like other violent crimes committed to women. these women are not victims but also survivors, survivors from a brutal crime. the comfort women issue is not just about the past, but it is very relevant today. the world's strength to oppose killing today is made greater by accountability, for actions present, but also past. it's weakened by denial of accountability and obfuscation of past acts. history is a continuum that affects today and tomorrow. women everywhere should not be victims of such an atrocity. it's much harder to get tomorrow right if we get yesterday wrong. today, we call on to the japanese government to apologize to the few women who continue to live with the shame of the crimes committed against them. ____________________",21101

CREC-2015-04-21-pt1-PgH2349,CREC-2015-04-21,114,SAN JACINTO DAY,"[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 58 (Tuesday, April 21, 2015)] [House] [Pages H2349-H2352] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] SAN JACINTO DAY The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Abraham). Under the Speaker's announced policy of January 6, 2015, the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Poe) is recognized for 60 minutes as the designee of the majority leader. Mr. POE of Texas. Mr. Speaker, today is April 21, 2015. April 21 is an important day. It is an important day not [[Page H2350]] only in Texas history, but I think in world history. But it is more important to my mother. Because today, Mr. Speaker, my mother is 90 years young. When I was growing up in Texas, April 21 was a holiday. We did not go to school on April 21 in Houston. And my mother told me the reason we did not go to school was because it was her birthday and everybody got off from school on her birthday. Of course, I believed her--and she still says that is the reason we get off--but it wasn't until I took fourth-grade Texas history that I learned there was another reason why April 21 was an important day and a holiday. It is called San Jacinto Day, Mr. Speaker. San Jacinto Day is based upon Texas history that occurred on April 21, 1836--179 years ago. That was the day that the Battle of San Jacinto took place on the marshy plains where Buffalo Bayou meets the San Jacinto River, near the Gulf of Mexico, in a place that we now call Harrisburg, which is near Houston, Texas. It was a battle that was successful for liberty and freedom for people who lived in Texas. The Battle of San Jacinto was won by Sam Houston defeating the invading Mexican army led by Santa Anna. And I will get back to that in a moment. I think it is important, though, we have a little history lesson so we understand why this battle for freedom is so important to all people who believe in freedom. Texas, Mr. Speaker, was wanted by a lot of folks. The French claimed Texas. Of course, the Comanches, the Apaches, and a lot of other Native American tribes claimed Texas--and wanted Texas. But Spain controlled Texas for a great number of years. From 1690 to about 1821, Texas as we know it was part of Spain. In fact, we still have Spanish land grants in Texas, where people own land that they can trace back to the Spanish when they controlled Texas. In about 1821, a portion of Spain--Spanish Texas and Spanish Mexico, if you will--decided they wanted independence from Spain. So, Mexico as we now know it had their war of independence from the European power of Spain, and they were successful in defeating the Spanish and declaring independence and becoming a democratic republic south of the border called the Republic of Mexico. That was 1821. Texas was a part of that revolution and that rebellion. Texans fought in those battles. And all went well until about 1835, when a person by the name of Santa Anna took over the Presidency of Mexico--a republic, a democracy--and made himself a military dictator. He abolished the Constitution--dictators have a habit of doing that, even to this day-- dismissed the assembly or Congress, and he was in total control of Mexico. Now, this did not set well with people in Mexico, which includes what we now know as Texas. Here is a map of the region in about the time of 1821 to 1836. This portion here was Texas. It was part of another state in Mexico called Coahuila. When dictator Santa Anna took control of this entire area, 11 of the states rebelled. They wanted their own independence from their dictator, who destroyed the democracy, or the democratic Republic of Mexico. Several of the states rebelled. In fact, some were somewhat successful. The Republic of Yucatan lasted for a while, went back to Mexico, gained independence again, and was a republic for about 7 years in the 1840s, and then joined Mexico again. There were several other states--and I will put in the Record the names of those states--that wanted independence from Mexico, to go their own way, and some were more successful than others. And what Santa Anna did is assemble his army. He went through Mexico, retaking this land, putting down the rebellion of all of the individuals who were trying to be independent from the Mexican dictator. After he had successfully done that, he moved across the Rio Grande River, where those Texans were causing the same type of controversy of wanting freedom and independence. And what started the actual fighting between the people of Texas--and they were of all races. Tejanos is a special unique name of Texans of Spanish or Mexican birth. Tejanos, Anglos, and Blacks in that area wanted independence. Not all, but many of them did. And there was a controversy, and there were political disputes with the Mexican government. But what set it all off occurred in a small, little town of Gonzales, Texas. In Gonzales, Texas, they had a cannon. It wasn't really much of a cannon, but it was a cannon. And it was to protect themselves from the Karankawas, the Apaches, and other folks. {time} 1945 The Mexican Government decided they were going over to take that cannon away from the settlers. The settlers objected. They said, You can't have it. They made themselves a flag that said, ``Come and take it.'' We still have that flag. ``Come and take it.'' It had a cannon with the words ``Come and take it.'' So the Mexican military shows up. The settlers have a skirmish with the Mexican military. Shots were fired. I don't think anybody was really hurt too bad, but the Mexican Army retreated. They left Gonzalez, but they left without the cannon. It is an interesting note that the Texas war of independence started because government tried to take the firearms, the weapons, the guns of the people. If you recall American history, Mr. Speaker, which I know you know quite well, there is a little place called Lexington and Concord, up in Massachusetts, where the British tried to take the guns from the colonists, to take the guns from the armory at Lexington and Concord. The colonists objected. The shot heard around the world started the American war of independence, successful just like the Texas war of independence was successful, but the fighting started when the government showed up to take the weapons of the settlers. In any event, the Battle of Gonzalez took place. The fighting was on. Texans moved into Bexar, which is now San Antonio, which was the central city in the Republic, or in Texas, and took that away from the Mexican military that was there, ran them out of town, and that was toward December of 1835. Then we get to early part of 1836, and this part of history is what most Americans are aware of: Santa Anna now is coming across the Rio Grande River with his three armies to retake Texas and make it part of Mexico again, as he had done with these other rebellious states in Mexico. He showed up at a little place, a beat-up old Spanish church that was over 100 years old at the time, in February of 1836. We call it the Alamo, the cradle of Texas liberty. Assembled at the Alamo, in Bexar--San Antonio, if you will, same place--were 187 Texas volunteers. Now, most of them were not from Texas. In fact, the only natives there were the Tejanos. Eleven Tejanos fought in the Texas revolution at the Alamo, but they were from all the States, 13 foreign countries, and of all races, volunteers, led by my favorite person--William Barret Travis, a South Carolina lawyer--came to Texas; and he is 27, the commander of the Alamo. Santa Anna's army, historians disagree on how many thousands there were, but there were a lot of them; and, after 13 days--we all know the rest of the story. After 13 days of holding the Mexican Army at bay and Santa Anna, Santa Anna was able to breach the walls and kill all of the defenders, all the volunteers at the Alamo. After that occurred, people who lived in Texas started moving from that direction of central Texas towards the east, towards Louisiana. It is called the Runaway Scrape. Why were they running? Because the Mexican armies have invaded Texas and are coming after the settlers in that portion of the State, that portion of Texas--so Sam Houston, who had already come to Texas, was building an army to fight and defend the State of Texas and to fight and defend, from the invaders, Texas liberty. He was building this army. It is interesting how he got to Texas. Sam Houston was famous in his own right before he made it to Texas. He was from Tennessee. He was an attorney general, Member of Congress--twice elected to Congress--and Governor of Tennessee. [[Page H2351]] He eventually left the Governorship and came back to Washington, Mr. Speaker, and advocated on behalf of the Cherokee Indians who he was living with in what is now Oklahoma. He got into a dispute with an Ohio Congressman named Stanbery. Stanbery had impugned the integrity of Sam Houston, and Sam Houston didn't like that. That conversation, apparently, by Stanbery occurred on this House floor. One morning, Sam Houston is coming out of his home, his dwelling over here on Pennsylvania Avenue, and he sees Stanbery. Sam Houston carried a cane. You may see the pictures of Sam Houston with his cane. Sam Houston comes upon--I get all choked up telling the story, Mr. Speaker. Sam Houston comes up on Stanbery. He is walking down the street. Sam Houston, remembering the bad things that Stanbery said about him on the House floor, and he starts to thrash Stanbery with his cane, beats him pretty bad. Stanbery had a pistol. He pulls it out of his vest. He pokes the pistol in Sam Houston's chest and pulls the trigger. The gun misfired; and, therefore, Sam Houston lived. He was tried on this House floor for demeaning a Member of Congress. The Supreme Court sat in judgment of him. The trial lasted a month. Sam Houston took the House floor and talked over a full day, defending himself. After the trial was over, Sam Houston was found guilty, ordered to pay a $500 fine for demeaning a Member of Congress. Sam Houston was represented by Francis Scott Key--yes, the same lawyer that wrote our Star-Spangled Banner. Rather than pay the fine, rather than deal with Congress anymore and Mr. Stanbery, he left Washington and ended up in Texas and became a political figure there. They loved Sam Houston when he came to Texas. They didn't care about his troubles here in Washington, D.C., and he was made general of the Texas Army. So the Alamo takes place. William Barret Travis, the commander, they were all killed. Sam Houston builds his army, and he is ready to defend Texas against the invading army from Santa Anna. That brings us to April 21. Sam Houston did not engage Santa Anna quickly. In fact, he kept moving east. He got as close as he could to Louisiana, and then he moved south, down towards the Gulf of Mexico. Santa Anna is chasing him. Finally, Sam Houston stopped on those marshy plains of San Jacinto, where Buffalo Bayou meets the San Jacinto River--Santa Anna's army, about 1,800; Houston's army, 700, 800--outnumbered. Remember, Santa Anna's armies had yet to be defeated, in all those battles in Mexico, Alamo, a place called Goliad, where Santa Anna killed all the Texas defenders, yet to be defeated. Sam Houston has yet to fight a battle. They assemble there, April 19, 1836. Most battles, even today, are fought when the sun comes up, sunrise; and they were then. They were for thousands of years. Everybody expected battle on April 22 at sunrise, but the Texas Army did not want to wait, so on the afternoon of April 21, there was a council of war. Sam Houston decided that now is as good a time as any. Well, less than a mile away was Santa Anna's army, but it is in the afternoon. Many of the soldiers in Santa Anna's army were taking a siesta. Legend has it that Santa Anna was occupied with a mixed-race lady by the name of Emily Morgan. She was keeping him busy during this time. I don't know if that is true or not. We believe it is true. We named buildings after Emily Morgan. We call her the Yellow Rose of Texas. We still honor ladies in Texas by calling them the yellow rose. But anyway, so he is busy. The Texans line up in one column. There weren't a lot of them; there were only 700 or 800 of them. They didn't have uniforms. They were wearing buckskins and frontier clothes. They have bowie knives and pistols in their belts, tomahawks, rifles. Juan Seguin, Hispanic Tejano, his cavalry are riding the flanks, protecting the flanks, also didn't have uniforms. So that the Texans would not mistake them for the enemy, Juan Sequin had all of his cavalry put in their sombreros, their hats, a playing card so they would know that these are the good guys and they wouldn't mistake them for the enemy. They are marching in a single file, if you can imagine this, this odd-looking bunch of folks. Leading them was a fife guy--a fifer, on a fife--another person carrying a flag. It was Miss Liberty that they were carrying the flag of. Miss Liberty was a partially nude female with the word ``liberty'' written across her. The fifer, he only knew one song. It was called ``Come to the Bower.'' The Bower was a house of ill repute, so he is playing this house of ill repute song on his fife, and the Texas Army is marching down the hill, ready. The Mexican Army, not prepared, no scouts, no lookouts, no one is watching; and they charge in broad daylight in the middle of the afternoon, when battles are never fought. Santa Anna was caught napping. The Mexican Army was caught by surprise. In 18 minutes, a lot shorter time than I have already talked, Mr. Speaker, the battle started, and it was ended. Half the Mexican Army was killed, the other half captured. More were captured than were in the Texas Army. Texas casualties, nine were killed. The enemy was caught by total surprise. They were caught fleeing. Santa Anna changed his clothes, took off his fancy general, Presidential uniform and put on the uniform of a Mexican private, but he was caught, and he was brought to Sam Houston, who happened to be one of the few that were wounded. He was shot in the ankle off his horse. The Texans wanted to hang Santa Anna right there from the closest oak tree. Sam Houston was not about to have a lynching of the enemy leader, and he held him for bargaining power later, to get a better deal for Texas independence. The Texans at San Jacinto, like at the Alamo, all volunteers, they came from every place. They were of all races. They came from several foreign countries. They came from many of the States. One was from Rhode Island, another from Vermont; several were from New York. In fact, several New Yorkers helped in Texas' independence, at the Alamo and at San Jacinto, but from most of the States and, as I said, foreign countries as well. {time} 2000 They succeeded in defeating Santa Anna. Texas declared independence earlier that year, on March 2, 1836, about 6 weeks before the Battle of San Jacinto, declared independence from Mexico. And it was won. It was successful on April 21, 1836, which we call San Jacinto Day today. After that battle was over with, military historians say it was one of the most decisive battles in Western Hemisphere history because of the massive amount of land that changed hands because of one battle. After the Battle of San Jacinto, you can see what modern-day Texas looks like right through here, this area. Texas not only claimed what is now modern-day Texas, but it claimed parts of Oklahoma, New Mexico, Colorado, Kansas, and all the way up to Wyoming. This was the Republic of Texas in April of 1836. This land was all claimed by Texas. Texas established a constitution, a government, and became an independent, free nation that lasted for 9 years. Sam Houston, of course, was the President of the Republic of Texas and got elected twice to the Republic of Texas. The Republic of Texas, as I said, lasted for 9 years, and then the majority of Texans wanted to join the United States. It was not an easy task. Many people in the United States didn't want Texas in the Union. Primarily the way for Texas to get into the Union was a treaty because Texas was a country. The United States is a country. There would be a treaty, and Texas would come in as a State. As we know, those folks down the hallway in the Senate, it takes two-thirds of them to approve a treaty. Two-thirds of the States in the United States would never have approved Texas coming into the Union, so how did Texas become a part of the Union? They changed it to a joint resolution. It just takes a majority vote to get a joint resolution passed in the Senate. So Texas came into the Union [[Page H2352]] after several tries unsuccessfully when, apparently, a Louisiana Senator changed his vote from ``no'' to ``yes,'' and Texas came in under a joint resolution. Thus, the Republic of Texas was no more and became a State in the Union in 1845, in December of 1845. When it came into the Union, Texas was allowed to fly its flag at the same height as the United States flag. If you come to Texas, you will notice there are a lot of Texas flags flying at the same level as the American flag. Texas is allowed to divide into five States. We are not going to do that. People would debate who would be called Texas and what would the other four be called. So we are not going to divide into five States. But we have the ability, and we have the right to decide and to divide into five States. But going back to Texas and the way it was when it came into the Union, what happened to all this land? Well, Texas had mounted a lot of debt and, to pay off its debt to the United States and to its creditors, sold this land to the Federal Government and wiped the slate clean. Therefore, Texas now looks like what we all know it looks like. The rest of that land went to the Union. I mentioned and talked to you tonight, Mr. Speaker, about San Jacinto Day, not so much because it is really San Jacinto Day, but about the people who were there 179 years ago. I mentioned there were all types of folks. But similar to our ancestors in the colonial days who said ``no'' to oppression, they weren't going to tolerate it. We still have oppression throughout the world. We have governments and dictators, military dictators oppressing their people. A lot of times, they can't do anything about it, those people. They would like to be free and independent, but they are not. Those folks back in 1836 made a decision that it was more important to them to be free than it was to be safe, secure in their own personal life. So they were willing to give their life for freedom. That is not a trite statement. We have had people from all over the United States who have done that since then, have fought for America, fought for liberty, fought for freedom, even for other people. They have sacrificed their lives so that other people can enjoy those words that most people have never enjoyed, ``freedom'' and ``liberty.'' And when a dictator or any other powerful government shows up, some people have the ability to step up and say: I am not going to take it. I will give up my life so that there can be a free nation. So we are grateful for those folks in 1836, on San Jacinto Day, and the ones at the Alamo who all died and the others who died and the ones that fought and lived, sacrificed their land to make sure that freedom rings in our State. Texans are proud of their history. I mentioned that I learned about San Jacinto Day in Texas history. Kids growing up in Texas today have to take Texas history twice, in the fourth grade and the seventh grade, where they learn about the history of our State. Our history is different than the Thirteen Colonies' history. It received its independence, but it was not from England; it was from a Mexican dictator. And we appreciate that. We appreciate those folks--Sam Houston, William Barret Travis, Davy Crockett, Jim Bowie--all those many men and women who sacrificed life and their well-being so that we could be an independent nation that tyrants will not rule. They will not be successful. They will be defeated. And we should admire people like that. I think we do here in the House of Representatives and in the United States. We have had people like that in all of our history. That is what makes us a unique nation, because we can go all the way back to the American War for Independence and trace all of the history; and in much of it, the United States was at war and fighting for our liberty, and we thank those people. We are still involved in war throughout the world today, the people fighting for America. So we are grateful for them, and we are grateful for those folks--Sam Houston and all of his boys of summer and boys of spring--that fought at the Battle of San Jacinto. One hundred years after the battle, Texans built a monument similar to the one down the street, the Washington Monument. We have all seen the Washington Monument. If you come to the battlefield of San Jacinto, you will see a similar monument, but it has a big star on the top of it. It is taller than the Washington Monument because it is in Texas, and the star makes it taller than the Washington Monument. As a side note, the Texas State capitol is also taller than this Capitol. That was built later. And we honor those folks with that monument. We honor them on San Jacinto Day, today. It is not a holiday anymore. Kids don't get out of school. But it is still my mother's birthday. I don't know if she is watching or not, but she is certainly celebrating her birthday down in Texas. So on behalf of those of us here, we commend those folks at the Battle of San Jacinto. And I also want to wish my mom a happy birthday on this April 21, 2015. And that is just the way it is, Mr. Speaker. I yield back the balance of my time. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 58 (Tuesday, April 21, 2015)] [House] [Pages H2349-H2352] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] SAN JACINTO DAY The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Abraham).

Mr. Speaker, today is April 21, 2015. April 21 is an important day. It is an important day not [[Page H2350]] only in Texas history, but I think in world history. But it is more important to my mother. Because today, Mr. Speaker, my mother is 90 years young. When I was growing up in Texas, April 21 was a holiday. We did not go to school on April 21 in Houston.

Sam Houston took the House floor and talked over a full day, defending himself. After the trial was over, Sam Houston was found guilty, ordered to pay a $500 fine for demeaning a Member of Congress. Sam Houston was represented by Francis Scott Key--yes, the same lawyer that wrote our Star-Spangled Banner. Rather than pay the fine, rather than deal with Congress anymore and Mr. Stanbery, he left Washington and ended up in Texas and became a political figure there. They loved Sam Houston when he came to Texas. They didn't care about his troubles here in Washington, D.C., and he was made general of the Texas Army. So the Alamo takes place. William Barret Travis, the commander, they were all killed. Sam Houston builds his army, and he is ready to defend Texas against the invading army from Santa Anna. That brings us to April 21. Sam Houston did not engage Santa Anna quickly. In fact, he kept moving east. He got as close as he could to Louisiana, and then he moved south, down towards the Gulf of Mexico. Santa Anna is chasing him. Finally, Sam Houston stopped on those marshy plains of San Jacinto, where Buffalo Bayou meets the San Jacinto River--Santa Anna's army, about 1,800; Houston's army, 700, 800--outnumbered. Remember, Santa Anna's armies had yet to be defeated, in all those battles in Mexico, Alamo, a place called Goliad, where Santa Anna killed all the Texas defenders, yet to be defeated. Sam Houston has yet to fight a battle. They assemble there, April 19, 1836. Most battles, even today, are fought when the sun comes up, sunrise; and they were then. They were for thousands of years. Everybody expected battle on April 22 at sunrise, but the Texas Army did not want to wait, so on the afternoon of April 21, there was a council of war. Sam Houston decided that now is as good a time as any. Well, less than a mile away was Santa Anna's army, but it is in the afternoon. Many of the soldiers in Santa Anna's army were taking a siesta. Legend has it that Santa Anna was occupied with a mixed-race lady by the name of Emily Morgan. She was keeping him busy during this time. I don't know if that is true or not. We believe it is true. We named buildings after Emily Morgan. We call her the Yellow Rose of Texas. We still honor ladies in Texas by calling them the yellow rose. But anyway, so he is busy. The Texans line up in one column. There weren't a lot of them; there were only 700 or 800 of them. They didn't have uniforms. They were wearing buckskins and frontier clothes. They have bowie knives and pistols in their belts, tomahawks, rifles. Juan Seguin, Hispanic Tejano, his cavalry are riding the flanks, protecting the flanks, also didn't have uniforms. So that the Texans would not mistake them for the enemy, Juan Sequin had all of his cavalry put in their sombreros, their hats, a playing card so they would know that these are the good guys and they wouldn't mistake them for the enemy. They are marching in a single file, if you can imagine this, this odd-looking bunch of folks. Leading them was a fife guy--a fifer, on a fife--another person carrying a flag. It was Miss Liberty that they were carrying the flag of. Miss Liberty was a partially nude female with the word ``liberty'' written across her. The fifer, he only knew one song. It was called ``Come to the Bower.'' The Bower was a house of ill repute, so he is playing this house of ill repute song on his fife, and the Texas Army is marching down the hill, ready. The Mexican Army, not prepared, no scouts, no lookouts, no one is watching; and they charge in broad daylight in the middle of the afternoon, when battles are never fought. Santa Anna was caught napping. The Mexican Army was caught by surprise. In 18 minutes, a lot shorter time than I have already talked, Mr. Speaker, the battle started, and it was ended. Half the Mexican Army was killed, the other half captured. More were captured than were in the Texas Army. Texas casualties, nine were killed. The enemy was caught by total surprise. They were caught fleeing. Santa Anna changed his clothes, took off his fancy general, Presidential uniform and put on the uniform of a Mexican private, but he was caught, and he was brought to Sam Houston, who happened to be one of the few that were wounded. He was shot in the ankle off his horse. The Texans wanted to hang Santa Anna right there from the closest oak tree. Sam Houston was not about to have a lynching of the enemy leader, and he held him for bargaining power later, to get a better deal for Texas independence. The Texans at San Jacinto, like at the Alamo, all volunteers, they came from every place. They were of all races. They came from several foreign countries. They came from many of the States. One was from Rhode Island, another from Vermont; several were from New York. In fact, several New Yorkers helped in Texas' independence, at the Alamo and at San Jacinto, but from most of the States and, as I said, foreign countries as well. {time} 2000 They succeeded in defeating Santa Anna. Texas declared independence earlier that year, on March 2, 1836, about 6 weeks before the Battle of San Jacinto, declared independence from Mexico. And it was won. It was successful on April 21, 1836, which we call San Jacinto Day today. After that battle was over with, military historians say it was one of the most decisive battles in Western Hemisphere history because of the massive amount of land that changed hands because of one battle. After the Battle of San Jacinto, you can see what modern-day Texas looks like right through here, this area. Texas not only claimed what is now modern-day Texas, but it claimed parts of Oklahoma, New Mexico, Colorado, Kansas, and all the way up to Wyoming. This was the Republic of Texas in April of 1836. This land was all claimed by Texas. Texas established a constitution, a government, and became an independent, free nation that lasted for 9 years. Sam Houston, of course, was the President of the Republic of Texas and got elected twice to the Republic of Texas. The Republic of Texas, as I said, lasted for 9 years, and then the majority of Texans wanted to join the United States. It was not an easy task. Many people in the United States didn't want Texas in the Union. Primarily the way for Texas to get into the Union was a treaty because Texas was a country. The United States is a country. There would be a treaty, and Texas would come in as a State. As we know, those folks down the hallway in the Senate, it takes two-thirds of them to approve a treaty. Two-thirds of the States in the United States would never have approved Texas coming into the Union, so how did Texas become a part of the Union? They changed it to a joint resolution. It just takes a majority vote to get a joint resolution passed in the Senate. So Texas came into the Union [[Page H2352]] after several tries unsuccessfully when, apparently, a Louisiana Senator changed his vote from ``no'' to ``yes,'' and Texas came in under a joint resolution. Thus, the Republic of Texas was no more and became a State in the Union in 1845, in December of 1845. When it came into the Union, Texas was allowed to fly its flag at the same height as the United States flag. If you come to Texas, you will notice there are a lot of Texas flags flying at the same level as the American flag. Texas is allowed to divide into five States. We are not going to do that. People would debate who would be called Texas and what would the other four be called. So we are not going to divide into five States. But we have the ability, and we have the right to decide and to divide into five States. But going back to Texas and the way it was when it came into the Union, what happened to all this land? Well, Texas had mounted a lot of debt and, to pay off its debt to the United States and to its creditors, sold this land to the Federal Government and wiped the slate clean. Therefore, Texas now looks like what we all know it looks like. The rest of that land went to the Union. I mentioned and talked to you tonight, Mr. Speaker, about San Jacinto Day, not so much because it is really San Jacinto Day, but about the people who were there 179 years ago. I mentioned there were all types of folks. But similar to our ancestors in the colonial days who said ``no'' to oppression, they weren't going to tolerate it. We still have oppression throughout the world. We have governments and dictators, military dictators oppressing their people. A lot of times, they can't do anything about it, those people. They would like to be free and independent, but they are not. Those folks back in 1836 made a decision that it was more important to them to be free than it was to be safe, secure in their own personal life. So they were willing to give their life for freedom. That is not a trite statement. We have had people from all over the United States who have done that since then, have fought for America, fought for liberty, fought for freedom, even for other people. They have sacrificed their lives so that other people can enjoy those words that most people have never enjoyed, ``freedom'' and ``liberty.'' And when a dictator or any other powerful government shows up, some people have the ability to step up and say: I am not going to take it. I will give up my life so that there can be a free nation. So we are grateful for those folks in 1836, on San Jacinto Day, and the ones at the Alamo who all died and the others who died and the ones that fought and lived, sacrificed their land to make sure that freedom rings in our State. Texans are proud of their history. I mentioned that I learned about San Jacinto Day in Texas history. Kids growing up in Texas today have to take Texas history twice, in the fourth grade and the seventh grade, where they learn about the history of our State. Our history is different than the Thirteen Colonies' history. It received its independence, but it was not from England; it was from a Mexican dictator. And we appreciate that. We appreciate those folks--Sam Houston, William Barret Travis, Davy Crockett, Jim Bowie--all those many men and women who sacrificed life and their well-being so that we could be an independent nation that tyrants will not rule. They will not be successful. They will be defeated. And we should admire people like that. I think we do here in the House of Representatives and in the United States. We have had people like that in all of our history. That is what makes us a unique nation, because we can go all the way back to the American War for Independence and trace all of the history; and in much of it, the United States was at war and fighting for our liberty, and we thank those people. We are still involved in war throughout the world today, the people fighting for America. So we are grateful for them, and we are grateful for those folks--Sam Houston and all of his boys of summer and boys of spring--that fought at the Battle of San Jacinto. One hundred years after the battle, Texans built a monument similar to the one down the street, the Washington Monument. We have all seen the Washington Monument. If you come to the battlefield of San Jacinto, you will see a similar monument, but it has a big star on the top of it. It is taller than the Washington Monument because it is in Texas, and the star makes it taller than the Washington Monument. As a side note, the Texas State capitol is also taller than this Capitol. That was built later. And we honor those folks with that monument. We honor them on San Jacinto Day, today. It is not a holiday anymore. Kids don't get out of school. But it is still my mother's birthday. I don't know if she is watching or not, but she is certainly celebrating her birthday down in Texas. So on behalf of those of us here, we commend those folks at the Battle of San Jacinto. And I also want to wish my mom a happy birthday on this April 21, 2015. And that is just the way it is, Mr. Speaker. I yield back the balance of my time. ____________________","Congressional Record, Volume 161 Issue 58 (Tuesday, April 21, 2015) [Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 58 (Tuesday, April 21, 2015)] [House] [Pages H2349-H2352] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] SAN JACINTO DAY The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Abraham). Under the Speaker's announced policy of January 6, 2015, the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Poe) is recognized for 60 minutes as the designee of the majority leader. Mr. POE of Texas. Mr. Speaker, today is April 21, 2015. April 21 is an important day. It is an important day not [[Page H2350]] only in Texas history, but I think in world history. But it is more important to my mother. Because today, Mr. Speaker, my mother is 90 years young. When I was growing up in Texas, April 21 was a holiday. We did not go to school on April 21 in Houston. And my mother told me the reason we did not go to school was because it was her birthday and everybody got off from school on her birthday. Of course, I believed her--and she still says that is the reason we get off--but it wasn't until I took fourth-grade Texas history that I learned there was another reason why April 21 was an important day and a holiday. It is called San Jacinto Day, Mr. Speaker. San Jacinto Day is based upon Texas history that occurred on April 21, 1836--179 years ago. That was the day that the Battle of San Jacinto took place on the marshy plains where Buffalo Bayou meets the San Jacinto River, near the Gulf of Mexico, in a place that we now call Harrisburg, which is near Houston, Texas. It was a battle that was successful for liberty and freedom for people who lived in Texas. The Battle of San Jacinto was won by Sam Houston defeating the invading Mexican army led by Santa Anna. And I will get back to that in a moment. I think it is important, though, we have a little history lesson so we understand why this battle for freedom is so important to all people who believe in freedom. Texas, Mr. Speaker, was wanted by a lot of folks. The French claimed Texas. Of course, the Comanches, the Apaches, and a lot of other Native American tribes claimed Texas--and wanted Texas. But Spain controlled Texas for a great number of years. From 1690 to about 1821, Texas as we know it was part of Spain. In fact, we still have Spanish land grants in Texas, where people own land that they can trace back to the Spanish when they controlled Texas. In about 1821, a portion of Spain--Spanish Texas and Spanish Mexico, if you will--decided they wanted independence from Spain. So, Mexico as we now know it had their war of independence from the European power of Spain, and they were successful in defeating the Spanish and declaring independence and becoming a democratic republic south of the border called the Republic of Mexico. That was 1821. Texas was a part of that revolution and that rebellion. Texans fought in those battles. And all went well until about 1835, when a person by the name of Santa Anna took over the Presidency of Mexico--a republic, a democracy--and made himself a military dictator. He abolished the Constitution--dictators have a habit of doing that, even to this day-- dismissed the assembly or Congress, and he was in total control of Mexico. Now, this did not set well with people in Mexico, which includes what we now know as Texas. Here is a map of the region in about the time of 1821 to 1836. This portion here was Texas. It was part of another state in Mexico called Coahuila. When dictator Santa Anna took control of this entire area, 11 of the states rebelled. They wanted their own independence from their dictator, who destroyed the democracy, or the democratic Republic of Mexico. Several of the states rebelled. In fact, some were somewhat successful. The Republic of Yucatan lasted for a while, went back to Mexico, gained independence again, and was a republic for about 7 years in the 1840s, and then joined Mexico again. There were several other states--and I will put in the Record the names of those states--that wanted independence from Mexico, to go their own way, and some were more successful than others. And what Santa Anna did is assemble his army. He went through Mexico, retaking this land, putting down the rebellion of all of the individuals who were trying to be independent from the Mexican dictator. After he had successfully done that, he moved across the Rio Grande River, where those Texans were causing the same type of controversy of wanting freedom and independence. And what started the actual fighting between the people of Texas--and they were of all races. Tejanos is a special unique name of Texans of Spanish or Mexican birth. Tejanos, Anglos, and Blacks in that area wanted independence. Not all, but many of them did. And there was a controversy, and there were political disputes with the Mexican government. But what set it all off occurred in a small, little town of Gonzales, Texas. In Gonzales, Texas, they had a cannon. It wasn't really much of a cannon, but it was a cannon. And it was to protect themselves from the Karankawas, the Apaches, and other folks. {time} 1945 The Mexican Government decided they were going over to take that cannon away from the settlers. The settlers objected. They said, You can't have it. They made themselves a flag that said, ``Come and take it.'' We still have that flag. ``Come and take it.'' It had a cannon with the words ``Come and take it.'' So the Mexican military shows up. The settlers have a skirmish with the Mexican military. Shots were fired. I don't think anybody was really hurt too bad, but the Mexican Army retreated. They left Gonzalez, but they left without the cannon. It is an interesting note that the Texas war of independence started because government tried to take the firearms, the weapons, the guns of the people. If you recall American history, Mr. Speaker, which I know you know quite well, there is a little place called Lexington and Concord, up in Massachusetts, where the British tried to take the guns from the colonists, to take the guns from the armory at Lexington and Concord. The colonists objected. The shot heard around the world started the American war of independence, successful just like the Texas war of independence was successful, but the fighting started when the government showed up to take the weapons of the settlers. In any event, the Battle of Gonzalez took place. The fighting was on. Texans moved into Bexar, which is now San Antonio, which was the central city in the Republic, or in Texas, and took that away from the Mexican military that was there, ran them out of town, and that was toward December of 1835. Then we get to early part of 1836, and this part of history is what most Americans are aware of: Santa Anna now is coming across the Rio Grande River with his three armies to retake Texas and make it part of Mexico again, as he had done with these other rebellious states in Mexico. He showed up at a little place, a beat-up old Spanish church that was over 100 years old at the time, in February of 1836. We call it the Alamo, the cradle of Texas liberty. Assembled at the Alamo, in Bexar--San Antonio, if you will, same place--were 187 Texas volunteers. Now, most of them were not from Texas. In fact, the only natives there were the Tejanos. Eleven Tejanos fought in the Texas revolution at the Alamo, but they were from all the States, 13 foreign countries, and of all races, volunteers, led by my favorite person--William Barret Travis, a South Carolina lawyer--came to Texas; and he is 27, the commander of the Alamo. Santa Anna's army, historians disagree on how many thousands there were, but there were a lot of them; and, after 13 days--we all know the rest of the story. After 13 days of holding the Mexican Army at bay and Santa Anna, Santa Anna was able to breach the walls and kill all of the defenders, all the volunteers at the Alamo. After that occurred, people who lived in Texas started moving from that direction of central Texas towards the east, towards Louisiana. It is called the Runaway Scrape. Why were they running? Because the Mexican armies have invaded Texas and are coming after the settlers in that portion of the State, that portion of Texas--so Sam Houston, who had already come to Texas, was building an army to fight and defend the State of Texas and to fight and defend, from the invaders, Texas liberty. He was building this army. It is interesting how he got to Texas. Sam Houston was famous in his own right before he made it to Texas. He was from Tennessee. He was an attorney general, Member of Congress--twice elected to Congress--and Governor of Tennessee. [[Page H2351]] He eventually left the Governorship and came back to Washington, Mr. Speaker, and advocated on behalf of the Cherokee Indians who he was living with in what is now Oklahoma. He got into a dispute with an Ohio Congressman named Stanbery. Stanbery had impugned the integrity of Sam Houston, and Sam Houston didn't like that. That conversation, apparently, by Stanbery occurred on this House floor. One morning, Sam Houston is coming out of his home, his dwelling over here on Pennsylvania Avenue, and he sees Stanbery. Sam Houston carried a cane. You may see the pictures of Sam Houston with his cane. Sam Houston comes upon--I get all choked up telling the story, Mr. Speaker. Sam Houston comes up on Stanbery. He is walking down the street. Sam Houston, remembering the bad things that Stanbery said about him on the House floor, and he starts to thrash Stanbery with his cane, beats him pretty bad. Stanbery had a pistol. He pulls it out of his vest. He pokes the pistol in Sam Houston's chest and pulls the trigger. The gun misfired; and, therefore, Sam Houston lived. He was tried on this House floor for demeaning a Member of Congress. The Supreme Court sat in judgment of him. The trial lasted a month. Sam Houston took the House floor and talked over a full day, defending himself. After the trial was over, Sam Houston was found guilty, ordered to pay a $500 fine for demeaning a Member of Congress. Sam Houston was represented by Francis Scott Key--yes, the same lawyer that wrote our Star-Spangled Banner. Rather than pay the fine, rather than deal with Congress anymore and Mr. Stanbery, he left Washington and ended up in Texas and became a political figure there. They loved Sam Houston when he came to Texas. They didn't care about his troubles here in Washington, D.C., and he was made general of the Texas Army. So the Alamo takes place. William Barret Travis, the commander, they were all killed. Sam Houston builds his army, and he is ready to defend Texas against the invading army from Santa Anna. That brings us to April 21. Sam Houston did not engage Santa Anna quickly. In fact, he kept moving east. He got as close as he could to Louisiana, and then he moved south, down towards the Gulf of Mexico. Santa Anna is chasing him. Finally, Sam Houston stopped on those marshy plains of San Jacinto, where Buffalo Bayou meets the San Jacinto River--Santa Anna's army, about 1,800; Houston's army, 700, 800--outnumbered. Remember, Santa Anna's armies had yet to be defeated, in all those battles in Mexico, Alamo, a place called Goliad, where Santa Anna killed all the Texas defenders, yet to be defeated. Sam Houston has yet to fight a battle. They assemble there, April 19, 1836. Most battles, even today, are fought when the sun comes up, sunrise; and they were then. They were for thousands of years. Everybody expected battle on April 22 at sunrise, but the Texas Army did not want to wait, so on the afternoon of April 21, there was a council of war. Sam Houston decided that now is as good a time as any. Well, less than a mile away was Santa Anna's army, but it is in the afternoon. Many of the soldiers in Santa Anna's army were taking a siesta. Legend has it that Santa Anna was occupied with a mixed-race lady by the name of Emily Morgan. She was keeping him busy during this time. I don't know if that is true or not. We believe it is true. We named buildings after Emily Morgan. We call her the Yellow Rose of Texas. We still honor ladies in Texas by calling them the yellow rose. But anyway, so he is busy. The Texans line up in one column. There weren't a lot of them; there were only 700 or 800 of them. They didn't have uniforms. They were wearing buckskins and frontier clothes. They have bowie knives and pistols in their belts, tomahawks, rifles. Juan Seguin, Hispanic Tejano, his cavalry are riding the flanks, protecting the flanks, also didn't have uniforms. So that the Texans would not mistake them for the enemy, Juan Sequin had all of his cavalry put in their sombreros, their hats, a playing card so they would know that these are the good guys and they wouldn't mistake them for the enemy. They are marching in a single file, if you can imagine this, this odd-looking bunch of folks. Leading them was a fife guy--a fifer, on a fife--another person carrying a flag. It was Miss Liberty that they were carrying the flag of. Miss Liberty was a partially nude female with the word ``liberty'' written across her. The fifer, he only knew one song. It was called ``Come to the Bower.'' The Bower was a house of ill repute, so he is playing this house of ill repute song on his fife, and the Texas Army is marching down the hill, ready. The Mexican Army, not prepared, no scouts, no lookouts, no one is watching; and they charge in broad daylight in the middle of the afternoon, when battles are never fought. Santa Anna was caught napping. The Mexican Army was caught by surprise. In 18 minutes, a lot shorter time than I have already talked, Mr. Speaker, the battle started, and it was ended. Half the Mexican Army was killed, the other half captured. More were captured than were in the Texas Army. Texas casualties, nine were killed. The enemy was caught by total surprise. They were caught fleeing. Santa Anna changed his clothes, took off his fancy general, Presidential uniform and put on the uniform of a Mexican private, but he was caught, and he was brought to Sam Houston, who happened to be one of the few that were wounded. He was shot in the ankle off his horse. The Texans wanted to hang Santa Anna right there from the closest oak tree. Sam Houston was not about to have a lynching of the enemy leader, and he held him for bargaining power later, to get a better deal for Texas independence. The Texans at San Jacinto, like at the Alamo, all volunteers, they came from every place. They were of all races. They came from several foreign countries. They came from many of the States. One was from Rhode Island, another from Vermont; several were from New York. In fact, several New Yorkers helped in Texas' independence, at the Alamo and at San Jacinto, but from most of the States and, as I said, foreign countries as well. {time} 2000 They succeeded in defeating Santa Anna. Texas declared independence earlier that year, on March 2, 1836, about 6 weeks before the Battle of San Jacinto, declared independence from Mexico. And it was won. It was successful on April 21, 1836, which we call San Jacinto Day today. After that battle was over with, military historians say it was one of the most decisive battles in Western Hemisphere history because of the massive amount of land that changed hands because of one battle. After the Battle of San Jacinto, you can see what modern-day Texas looks like right through here, this area. Texas not only claimed what is now modern-day Texas, but it claimed parts of Oklahoma, New Mexico, Colorado, Kansas, and all the way up to Wyoming. This was the Republic of Texas in April of 1836. This land was all claimed by Texas. Texas established a constitution, a government, and became an independent, free nation that lasted for 9 years. Sam Houston, of course, was the President of the Republic of Texas and got elected twice to the Republic of Texas. The Republic of Texas, as I said, lasted for 9 years, and then the majority of Texans wanted to join the United States. It was not an easy task. Many people in the United States didn't want Texas in the Union. Primarily the way for Texas to get into the Union was a treaty because Texas was a country. The United States is a country. There would be a treaty, and Texas would come in as a State. As we know, those folks down the hallway in the Senate, it takes two-thirds of them to approve a treaty. Two-thirds of the States in the United States would never have approved Texas coming into the Union, so how did Texas become a part of the Union? They changed it to a joint resolution. It just takes a majority vote to get a joint resolution passed in the Senate. So Texas came into the Union [[Page H2352]] after several tries unsuccessfully when, apparently, a Louisiana Senator changed his vote from ``no'' to ``yes,'' and Texas came in under a joint resolution. Thus, the Republic of Texas was no more and became a State in the Union in 1845, in December of 1845. When it came into the Union, Texas was allowed to fly its flag at the same height as the United States flag. If you come to Texas, you will notice there are a lot of Texas flags flying at the same level as the American flag. Texas is allowed to divide into five States. We are not going to do that. People would debate who would be called Texas and what would the other four be called. So we are not going to divide into five States. But we have the ability, and we have the right to decide and to divide into five States. But going back to Texas and the way it was when it came into the Union, what happened to all this land? Well, Texas had mounted a lot of debt and, to pay off its debt to the United States and to its creditors, sold this land to the Federal Government and wiped the slate clean. Therefore, Texas now looks like what we all know it looks like. The rest of that land went to the Union. I mentioned and talked to you tonight, Mr. Speaker, about San Jacinto Day, not so much because it is really San Jacinto Day, but about the people who were there 179 years ago. I mentioned there were all types of folks. But similar to our ancestors in the colonial days who said ``no'' to oppression, they weren't going to tolerate it. We still have oppression throughout the world. We have governments and dictators, military dictators oppressing their people. A lot of times, they can't do anything about it, those people. They would like to be free and independent, but they are not. Those folks back in 1836 made a decision that it was more important to them to be free than it was to be safe, secure in their own personal life. So they were willing to give their life for freedom. That is not a trite statement. We have had people from all over the United States who have done that since then, have fought for America, fought for liberty, fought for freedom, even for other people. They have sacrificed their lives so that other people can enjoy those words that most people have never enjoyed, ``freedom'' and ``liberty.'' And when a dictator or any other powerful government shows up, some people have the ability to step up and say: I am not going to take it. I will give up my life so that there can be a free nation. So we are grateful for those folks in 1836, on San Jacinto Day, and the ones at the Alamo who all died and the others who died and the ones that fought and lived, sacrificed their land to make sure that freedom rings in our State. Texans are proud of their history. I mentioned that I learned about San Jacinto Day in Texas history. Kids growing up in Texas today have to take Texas history twice, in the fourth grade and the seventh grade, where they learn about the history of our State. Our history is different than the Thirteen Colonies' history. It received its independence, but it was not from England; it was from a Mexican dictator. And we appreciate that. We appreciate those folks--Sam Houston, William Barret Travis, Davy Crockett, Jim Bowie--all those many men and women who sacrificed life and their well-being so that we could be an independent nation that tyrants will not rule. They will not be successful. They will be defeated. And we should admire people like that. I think we do here in the House of Representatives and in the United States. We have had people like that in all of our history. That is what makes us a unique nation, because we can go all the way back to the American War for Independence and trace all of the history; and in much of it, the United States was at war and fighting for our liberty, and we thank those people. We are still involved in war throughout the world today, the people fighting for America. So we are grateful for them, and we are grateful for those folks--Sam Houston and all of his boys of summer and boys of spring--that fought at the Battle of San Jacinto. One hundred years after the battle, Texans built a monument similar to the one down the street, the Washington Monument. We have all seen the Washington Monument. If you come to the battlefield of San Jacinto, you will see a similar monument, but it has a big star on the top of it. It is taller than the Washington Monument because it is in Texas, and the star makes it taller than the Washington Monument. As a side note, the Texas State capitol is also taller than this Capitol. That was built later. And we honor those folks with that monument. We honor them on San Jacinto Day, today. It is not a holiday anymore. Kids don't get out of school. But it is still my mother's birthday. I don't know if she is watching or not, but she is certainly celebrating her birthday down in Texas. So on behalf of those of us here, we commend those folks at the Battle of San Jacinto. And I also want to wish my mom a happy birthday on this April 21, 2015. And that is just the way it is, Mr. Speaker. I yield back the balance of my time. ____________________",package_114_99.csv,21831,21831,21899,"[congressional record volume 161, number 58 (tuesday, april 21, 2015)] [house] [pages h2349-h2352] from the congressional record online through the government publishing office [ www.gpo.gov ] san jacinto day the speaker pro tempore (mr. abraham). under the speaker's announced policy of january 6, 2015, the gentleman from texas (mr. poe) is recognized for 60 minutes as the designee of the majority leader. mr. poe of texas. mr. speaker, today is april 21, 2015. april 21 is an important day. it is an important day not [[page h2350]] only in texas history, but i think in world history. but it is more important to my mother. because today, mr. speaker, my mother is 90 years young. when i was growing up in texas, april 21 was a holiday. we did not go to school on april 21 in houston. and my mother told me the reason we did not go to school was because it was her birthday and everybody got off from school on her birthday. of course, i believed her--and she still says that is the reason we get off--but it wasn't until i took fourth-grade texas history that i learned there was another reason why april 21 was an important day and a holiday. it is called san jacinto day, mr. speaker. san jacinto day is based upon texas history that occurred on april 21, 1836--179 years ago. that was the day that the battle of san jacinto took place on the marshy plains where buffalo bayou meets the san jacinto river, near the gulf of mexico, in a place that we now call harrisburg, which is near houston, texas. it was a battle that was successful for liberty and freedom for people who lived in texas. the battle of san jacinto was won by sam houston defeating the invading mexican army led by santa anna. and i will get back to that in a moment. i think it is important, though, we have a little history lesson so we understand why this battle for freedom is so important to all people who believe in freedom. texas, mr. speaker, was wanted by a lot of folks. the french claimed texas. of course, the comanches, the apaches, and a lot of other native american tribes claimed texas--and wanted texas. but spain controlled texas for a great number of years. from 1690 to about 1821, texas as we know it was part of spain. in fact, we still have spanish land grants in texas, where people own land that they can trace back to the spanish when they controlled texas. in about 1821, a portion of spain--spanish texas and spanish mexico, if you will--decided they wanted independence from spain. so, mexico as we now know it had their war of independence from the european power of spain, and they were successful in defeating the spanish and declaring independence and becoming a democratic republic south of the border called the republic of mexico. that was 1821. texas was a part of that revolution and that rebellion. texans fought in those battles. and all went well until about 1835, when a person by the name of santa anna took over the presidency of mexico--a republic, a democracy--and made himself a military dictator. he abolished the constitution--dictators have a habit of doing that, even to this day-- dismissed the assembly or congress, and he was in total control of mexico. now, this did not set well with people in mexico, which includes what we now know as texas. here is a map of the region in about the time of 1821 to 1836. this portion here was texas. it was part of another state in mexico called coahuila. when dictator santa anna took control of this entire area, 11 of the states rebelled. they wanted their own independence from their dictator, who destroyed the democracy, or the democratic republic of mexico. several of the states rebelled. in fact, some were somewhat successful. the republic of yucatan lasted for a while, went back to mexico, gained independence again, and was a republic for about 7 years in the 1840s, and then joined mexico again. there were several other states--and i will put in the record the names of those states--that wanted independence from mexico, to go their own way, and some were more successful than others. and what santa anna did is assemble his army. he went through mexico, retaking this land, putting down the rebellion of all of the individuals who were trying to be independent from the mexican dictator. after he had successfully done that, he moved across the rio grande river, where those texans were causing the same type of controversy of wanting freedom and independence. and what started the actual fighting between the people of texas--and they were of all races. tejanos is a special unique name of texans of spanish or mexican birth. tejanos, anglos, and blacks in that area wanted independence. not all, but many of them did. and there was a controversy, and there were political disputes with the mexican government. but what set it all off occurred in a small, little town of gonzales, texas. in gonzales, texas, they had a cannon. it wasn't really much of a cannon, but it was a cannon. and it was to protect themselves from the karankawas, the apaches, and other folks. {time} 1945 the mexican government decided they were going over to take that cannon away from the settlers. the settlers objected. they said, you can't have it. they made themselves a flag that said, ``come and take it.'' we still have that flag. ``come and take it.'' it had a cannon with the words ``come and take it.'' so the mexican military shows up. the settlers have a skirmish with the mexican military. shots were fired. i don't think anybody was really hurt too bad, but the mexican army retreated. they left gonzalez, but they left without the cannon. it is an interesting note that the texas war of independence started because government tried to take the firearms, the weapons, the guns of the people. if you recall american history, mr. speaker, which i know you know quite well, there is a little place called lexington and concord, up in massachusetts, where the british tried to take the guns from the colonists, to take the guns from the armory at lexington and concord. the colonists objected. the shot heard around the world started the american war of independence, successful just like the texas war of independence was successful, but the fighting started when the government showed up to take the weapons of the settlers. in any event, the battle of gonzalez took place. the fighting was on. texans moved into bexar, which is now san antonio, which was the central city in the republic, or in texas, and took that away from the mexican military that was there, ran them out of town, and that was toward december of 1835. then we get to early part of 1836, and this part of history is what most americans are aware of: santa anna now is coming across the rio grande river with his three armies to retake texas and make it part of mexico again, as he had done with these other rebellious states in mexico. he showed up at a little place, a beat-up old spanish church that was over 100 years old at the time, in february of 1836. we call it the alamo, the cradle of texas liberty. assembled at the alamo, in bexar--san antonio, if you will, same place--were 187 texas volunteers. now, most of them were not from texas. in fact, the only natives there were the tejanos. eleven tejanos fought in the texas revolution at the alamo, but they were from all the states, 13 foreign countries, and of all races, volunteers, led by my favorite person--william barret travis, a south carolina lawyer--came to texas; and he is 27, the commander of the alamo. santa anna's army, historians disagree on how many thousands there were, but there were a lot of them; and, after 13 days--we all know the rest of the story. after 13 days of holding the mexican army at bay and santa anna, santa anna was able to breach the walls and kill all of the defenders, all the volunteers at the alamo. after that occurred, people who lived in texas started moving from that direction of central texas towards the east, towards louisiana. it is called the runaway scrape. why were they running? because the mexican armies have invaded texas and are coming after the settlers in that portion of the state, that portion of texas--so sam houston, who had already come to texas, was building an army to fight and defend the state of texas and to fight and defend, from the invaders, texas liberty. he was building this army. it is interesting how he got to texas. sam houston was famous in his own right before he made it to texas. he was from tennessee. he was an attorney general, member of congress--twice elected to congress--and governor of tennessee. [[page h2351]] he eventually left the governorship and came back to washington, mr. speaker, and advocated on behalf of the cherokee indians who he was living with in what is now oklahoma. he got into a dispute with an ohio congressman named stanbery. stanbery had impugned the integrity of sam houston, and sam houston didn't like that. that conversation, apparently, by stanbery occurred on this house floor. one morning, sam houston is coming out of his home, his dwelling over here on pennsylvania avenue, and he sees stanbery. sam houston carried a cane. you may see the pictures of sam houston with his cane. sam houston comes upon--i get all choked up telling the story, mr. speaker. sam houston comes up on stanbery. he is walking down the street. sam houston, remembering the bad things that stanbery said about him on the house floor, and he starts to thrash stanbery with his cane, beats him pretty bad. stanbery had a pistol. he pulls it out of his vest. he pokes the pistol in sam houston's chest and pulls the trigger. the gun misfired; and, therefore, sam houston lived. he was tried on this house floor for demeaning a member of congress. the supreme court sat in judgment of him. the trial lasted a month. sam houston took the house floor and talked over a full day, defending himself. after the trial was over, sam houston was found guilty, ordered to pay a $500 fine for demeaning a member of congress. sam houston was represented by francis scott key--yes, the same lawyer that wrote our star-spangled banner. rather than pay the fine, rather than deal with congress anymore and mr. stanbery, he left washington and ended up in texas and became a political figure there. they loved sam houston when he came to texas. they didn't care about his troubles here in washington, d.c., and he was made general of the texas army. so the alamo takes place. william barret travis, the commander, they were all killed. sam houston builds his army, and he is ready to defend texas against the invading army from santa anna. that brings us to april 21. sam houston did not engage santa anna quickly. in fact, he kept moving east. he got as close as he could to louisiana, and then he moved south, down towards the gulf of mexico. santa anna is chasing him. finally, sam houston stopped on those marshy plains of san jacinto, where buffalo bayou meets the san jacinto river--santa anna's army, about 1,800; houston's army, 700, 800--outnumbered. remember, santa anna's armies had yet to be defeated, in all those battles in mexico, alamo, a place called goliad, where santa anna killed all the texas defenders, yet to be defeated. sam houston has yet to fight a battle. they assemble there, april 19, 1836. most battles, even today, are fought when the sun comes up, sunrise; and they were then. they were for thousands of years. everybody expected battle on april 22 at sunrise, but the texas army did not want to wait, so on the afternoon of april 21, there was a council of war. sam houston decided that now is as good a time as any. well, less than a mile away was santa anna's army, but it is in the afternoon. many of the soldiers in santa anna's army were taking a siesta. legend has it that santa anna was occupied with a mixed-race lady by the name of emily morgan. she was keeping him busy during this time. i don't know if that is true or not. we believe it is true. we named buildings after emily morgan. we call her the yellow rose of texas. we still honor ladies in texas by calling them the yellow rose. but anyway, so he is busy. the texans line up in one column. there weren't a lot of them; there were only 700 or 800 of them. they didn't have uniforms. they were wearing buckskins and frontier clothes. they have bowie knives and pistols in their belts, tomahawks, rifles. juan seguin, hispanic tejano, his cavalry are riding the flanks, protecting the flanks, also didn't have uniforms. so that the texans would not mistake them for the enemy, juan sequin had all of his cavalry put in their sombreros, their hats, a playing card so they would know that these are the good guys and they wouldn't mistake them for the enemy. they are marching in a single file, if you can imagine this, this odd-looking bunch of folks. leading them was a fife guy--a fifer, on a fife--another person carrying a flag. it was miss liberty that they were carrying the flag of. miss liberty was a partially nude female with the word ``liberty'' written across her. the fifer, he only knew one song. it was called ``come to the bower.'' the bower was a house of ill repute, so he is playing this house of ill repute song on his fife, and the texas army is marching down the hill, ready. the mexican army, not prepared, no scouts, no lookouts, no one is watching; and they charge in broad daylight in the middle of the afternoon, when battles are never fought. santa anna was caught napping. the mexican army was caught by surprise. in 18 minutes, a lot shorter time than i have already talked, mr. speaker, the battle started, and it was ended. half the mexican army was killed, the other half captured. more were captured than were in the texas army. texas casualties, nine were killed. the enemy was caught by total surprise. they were caught fleeing. santa anna changed his clothes, took off his fancy general, presidential uniform and put on the uniform of a mexican private, but he was caught, and he was brought to sam houston, who happened to be one of the few that were wounded. he was shot in the ankle off his horse. the texans wanted to hang santa anna right there from the closest oak tree. sam houston was not about to have a lynching of the enemy leader, and he held him for bargaining power later, to get a better deal for texas independence. the texans at san jacinto, like at the alamo, all volunteers, they came from every place. they were of all races. they came from several foreign countries. they came from many of the states. one was from rhode island, another from vermont; several were from new york. in fact, several new yorkers helped in texas' independence, at the alamo and at san jacinto, but from most of the states and, as i said, foreign countries as well. {time} 2000 they succeeded in defeating santa anna. texas declared independence earlier that year, on march 2, 1836, about 6 weeks before the battle of san jacinto, declared independence from mexico. and it was won. it was successful on april 21, 1836, which we call san jacinto day today. after that battle was over with, military historians say it was one of the most decisive battles in western hemisphere history because of the massive amount of land that changed hands because of one battle. after the battle of san jacinto, you can see what modern-day texas looks like right through here, this area. texas not only claimed what is now modern-day texas, but it claimed parts of oklahoma, new mexico, colorado, kansas, and all the way up to wyoming. this was the republic of texas in april of 1836. this land was all claimed by texas. texas established a constitution, a government, and became an independent, free nation that lasted for 9 years. sam houston, of course, was the president of the republic of texas and got elected twice to the republic of texas. the republic of texas, as i said, lasted for 9 years, and then the majority of texans wanted to join the united states. it was not an easy task. many people in the united states didn't want texas in the union. primarily the way for texas to get into the union was a treaty because texas was a country. the united states is a country. there would be a treaty, and texas would come in as a state. as we know, those folks down the hallway in the senate, it takes two-thirds of them to approve a treaty. two-thirds of the states in the united states would never have approved texas coming into the union, so how did texas become a part of the union? they changed it to a joint resolution. it just takes a majority vote to get a joint resolution passed in the senate. so texas came into the union [[page h2352]] after several tries unsuccessfully when, apparently, a louisiana senator changed his vote from ``no'' to ``yes,'' and texas came in under a joint resolution. thus, the republic of texas was no more and became a state in the union in 1845, in december of 1845. when it came into the union, texas was allowed to fly its flag at the same height as the united states flag. if you come to texas, you will notice there are a lot of texas flags flying at the same level as the american flag. texas is allowed to divide into five states. we are not going to do that. people would debate who would be called texas and what would the other four be called. so we are not going to divide into five states. but we have the ability, and we have the right to decide and to divide into five states. but going back to texas and the way it was when it came into the union, what happened to all this land? well, texas had mounted a lot of debt and, to pay off its debt to the united states and to its creditors, sold this land to the federal government and wiped the slate clean. therefore, texas now looks like what we all know it looks like. the rest of that land went to the union. i mentioned and talked to you tonight, mr. speaker, about san jacinto day, not so much because it is really san jacinto day, but about the people who were there 179 years ago. i mentioned there were all types of folks. but similar to our ancestors in the colonial days who said ``no'' to oppression, they weren't going to tolerate it. we still have oppression throughout the world. we have governments and dictators, military dictators oppressing their people. a lot of times, they can't do anything about it, those people. they would like to be free and independent, but they are not. those folks back in 1836 made a decision that it was more important to them to be free than it was to be safe, secure in their own personal life. so they were willing to give their life for freedom. that is not a trite statement. we have had people from all over the united states who have done that since then, have fought for america, fought for liberty, fought for freedom, even for other people. they have sacrificed their lives so that other people can enjoy those words that most people have never enjoyed, ``freedom'' and ``liberty.'' and when a dictator or any other powerful government shows up, some people have the ability to step up and say: i am not going to take it. i will give up my life so that there can be a free nation. so we are grateful for those folks in 1836, on san jacinto day, and the ones at the alamo who all died and the others who died and the ones that fought and lived, sacrificed their land to make sure that freedom rings in our state. texans are proud of their history. i mentioned that i learned about san jacinto day in texas history. kids growing up in texas today have to take texas history twice, in the fourth grade and the seventh grade, where they learn about the history of our state. our history is different than the thirteen colonies' history. it received its independence, but it was not from england; it was from a mexican dictator. and we appreciate that. we appreciate those folks--sam houston, william barret travis, davy crockett, jim bowie--all those many men and women who sacrificed life and their well-being so that we could be an independent nation that tyrants will not rule. they will not be successful. they will be defeated. and we should admire people like that. i think we do here in the house of representatives and in the united states. we have had people like that in all of our history. that is what makes us a unique nation, because we can go all the way back to the american war for independence and trace all of the history; and in much of it, the united states was at war and fighting for our liberty, and we thank those people. we are still involved in war throughout the world today, the people fighting for america. so we are grateful for them, and we are grateful for those folks--sam houston and all of his boys of summer and boys of spring--that fought at the battle of san jacinto. one hundred years after the battle, texans built a monument similar to the one down the street, the washington monument. we have all seen the washington monument. if you come to the battlefield of san jacinto, you will see a similar monument, but it has a big star on the top of it. it is taller than the washington monument because it is in texas, and the star makes it taller than the washington monument. as a side note, the texas state capitol is also taller than this capitol. that was built later. and we honor those folks with that monument. we honor them on san jacinto day, today. it is not a holiday anymore. kids don't get out of school. but it is still my mother's birthday. i don't know if she is watching or not, but she is certainly celebrating her birthday down in texas. so on behalf of those of us here, we commend those folks at the battle of san jacinto. and i also want to wish my mom a happy birthday on this april 21, 2015. and that is just the way it is, mr. speaker. i yield back the balance of my time. ____________________",21831

Mr. President, President Obama recently proclaimed this to be National Crime Victims' Rights Week, a stark reminder of the countless victims of modern slavery who continue to suffer horrifying exploitation at the hands of human traffickers, a stark reminder of the need to pass the Justice for Victims of Trafficking Act. It is a bill that victims groups and advocates call ``the most comprehensive and thoughtful piece of anti-trafficking legislation currently pending.'' It provides unprecedented support to domestic victims of trafficking who are all too often invisible and underserved. This group further said: ``As leaders in the anti-trafficking, anti- violence, child welfare, civil rights, runaway and homeless youth, and human rights movements, we urge Congress to pass this critical piece of legislation.'' There have been good-faith negotiations to resolve the impasse that has prevented the Senate from moving forward on this bill. I am glad that we can now say there is a bipartisan proposal that would allow us to complete action on this important legislation so we can provide help to the victims who desperately need it.

She has worked consistently to arrive at the conclusion that we have arrived at. I express my appreciation to Senator Leahy on the Judiciary Committee, who has been available for us at any given time to help us work through these issues. It was not easy, but their efforts--the Senators I have mentioned-- have been extremely important to fight human trafficking, which is really very, very [[Page S2282]] important for us to do. But we also rejected efforts to further obstruct a woman's access to services they deserve and need and which we believe are within the law. I also want to say something about Senator Cornyn. John Cornyn--I talked to him Thursday. We thought we had something worked out. He has been very reasonable in helping us arrive at a conclusion to this. I express my appreciation to him publicly for that. This compromise is evidence that when Democrats and Republicans sit down together and work toward a solution, good things can happen. The Senate needs more of this. But let's hope that post-agreement amendments do not ruin the agreement that we have reached.

Mr. President, on another subject, it is extremely difficult to compare one Congress to another. Each Congress is unique-- changing times, shifting issues, and new administrations with which to work. But one manner of gauging the success of a Congress is simply to tally the number of Presidential nominees who have been confirmed. After all, offering its advice and consent on nominees is the Senate's constitutional duty. If we were to use confirmations as a measuring stick, by all accounts the majority leader and Senate Republicans are failing in a spectacular fashion. So far this year, the Senate has confirmed 21 nominees--4 months, 21 nominees. It is unheard of to have such a small, small number. If that trend continues, the Republican-led Congress will confirm 63 nominees this year, 2015. By contrast, in 2007, my first year as majority leader under the Bush administration, the Senate confirmed 276 executive and judicial nominees. It did not matter that Democrats were working with a Republican administration. My disagreements with President George W. Bush have been well documented. That is an understatement. But I worked with him on nominations because Democrats knew--and I knew--that it was only fair to give the President the team he needed to lead the country. Doesn't President Obama deserve the same? Of course he does. In 2007, each Democratic committee chair worked to move President Bush's nominees through committees and the Senate floor in a reasonable amount of time. Yet we are seeing the opposite from Republican chairmen this year. They are refusing even to do hearings. Of course, if there are no hearings, there will be no nominations. In fact, Republicans have committed to holding up as many of the President's nominees as possible. Here is what one senior Republican Senator said in the last few days: ``I told them: You jam [nominees] through, it's going to be a long time before I approve of them.'' What I say to that is that if this is a tantrum that the Republicans are having for changing the Senate rules, as we were forced to do, then revenge is not an effective way to govern. If it really is the case that Republicans loathe the changes to the Senate rules, why do they not do something about it? We are 4 months into this Congress, and the majority leader had ample opportunity--which he has had--to undo the changes we made. So change them if you do not like them. It is clear the Republican plan for payback centers on allowing consideration of Presidential nominations to a trickle. Throwing a tantrum is not what the American people expect from their leaders. It is not fair to the President or the American people who elected him or the dedicated public servants who want to serve our country. Ten years ago a young Senator from Texas said: ``I would hope no one in this body would feel it necessary to bring all the leftover angst of the campaign season to bear against a bright and honorable nominee.'' Yet this is what the senior Senator from Texas and his party are doing today--doing exactly what he said should not be done. America continues to look on in disbelief as Republicans delay Loretta Lynch's confirmation because they can. This is outrageous. One only needs to look at the CNN poll today to find out that the work done by the Republican Senate has been an absolute flop. So I certainly hope this is not what we are to expect during the duration of President Obama's term. I hope my Republican colleagues will demonstrate leadership and move the President's nominees. Again, look at the CNN poll, I say to my Republican colleagues. It is a disaster for you. It is not only fair to move forward on President Obama's nominations, but it is a sworn duty Republicans have as Members of the Senate. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 58 (Tuesday, April 21, 2015)] [Senate] [Page S2282] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] EXECUTIVE NOMINATIONS Mr. REID.

Mr. President, from the very beginning of this discussion on the trafficking bill and the underlying issue, Members on both sides of the aisle agreed that we need to get this bill back on track as the bipartisan effort it should be, because, without question, survivors of trafficking deserve our support. Senator Klobuchar has done an amazing job in getting us to this point to get this bill done. I am pleased that we were able to reach a deal that now gets this done in a way that does not expand restrictions on women's health to nontaxpayer dollars or to new programs and provides survivors with real, dedicated funds for the support and services they need. No compromise is perfect. I am sure that Senator Cornyn would say the same thing. I believe there is more we can and must do when it comes to strengthening women's access to quality health care. But I am very pleased that Senator Cornyn and I, along with a number of other Senators on our side, including Senator Klobuchar, were able to work together in a bipartisan way to get this done. I want to thank him and all his colleagues for their work to get us to this point. I hope we can now get this legislation passed very quickly for survivors and move on to continue working together on the many challenges our country faces. I yield the floor. The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Minnesota. Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, I am very happy today that we have reached an agreement. I want to thank [[Page S2283]] Senator Murray for her leadership, and Senator Reid, Senator McConnell, and Senator Cornyn. The two of us have worked on this issue for years. Finally, we are going to be able to move these really important bills forward. What this compromise does is really set up two funds. The first uses Senator Cornyn's fund, which is fees on perpetrators, and it uses that for things such as shelters and law enforcement, things that we had envisioned would be used for people to combat sex trafficking. The second fund is a medical fund. It is really based on the same principle that we used with the SGR fund that we just voted on. That bill passed 92 to 8. The fund will receive a minimum of $5 million and would be matched up to $30 million, as funding in the Cornyn fund goes up. It really is a parallel fund but serving the exact same purpose. This is the way we were able to eliminate extraneous provisions but still keep the spirit of this really important bill and allow us to move on to my bill, the Stop Exploitation Through Trafficking Act, which really is about not prosecuting kids under 18. There was huge bipartisan support over in the House. It passed unanimously through the Judiciary Committee and will be one of the amendments to this bill. Again, I want to thank Senator Murray for her leadership. We have been a team on this. We have been able to work with Senator Cornyn and our friends across the aisle to get this done. It is also time--I will end by saying--to confirm the next Attorney General of the United States, Loretta Lynch. I yield the floor. The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from South Dakota.

CREC-2015-04-21-pt1-PgS2284,CREC-2015-04-21,114,STEVE GLEASON ACT,"[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 58 (Tuesday, April 21, 2015)] [Senate] [Pages S2284-S2285] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] STEVE GLEASON ACT Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of S. 984, the Steve Gleason Act, to help thousands of victims of ALS and other related diseases all across the United States. This bipartisan, straightforward bill would give immediate relief to those folks with ALS, or Lou Gehrig's disease, who are facing significant problems accessing necessary medical equipment as a result of three recent changes in Medicare that prohibit access on every level. It is important to note that this wasn't a problem until the administration governing Medicare made it a problem a few months ago. They affirmatively changed policy, changed rules, and created these significant access problems. We are talking about devices that are critical for patients who have lost their ability to speak, to communicate directly with friends, families, doctors, to call 911 in case of emergency, to write letters to loved ones. These devices allow these patients to speak and communicate in light of their loss of voice and other functions. This issue was first brought before Congress last year when thousands of patients, patient advocates, and device manufacturers brought to our attention the devastating consequences of this new Medicare policy. Patients were actually having their devices taken away. Many were not allowed to own their devices or were not permitted to unlock their devices in order to use all of the technological functions, all of which continue to be problems and to prevent patients from leading much more independent lives. As a result, Members on both sides of the aisle wrote a letter with more than 220 Members advocating on behalf of this patient population to reverse the Medicare administration decision. The Senate has that same opportunity for bipartisanship today, to support this legislation on a strong bipartisan basis. In that spirit, I thank Senator Klobuchar of Minnesota and Senator King of Maine, who have been completely supportive and aggressive in getting this bill to the finish line. They understand the importance of putting patients first and fixing this extremely misguided and harmful Medicare regulation that has had a truly devastating impact on the lives of ALS patients, as well as stroke victims and other folks facing significant paralysis. On Tuesday evening, before the Senate overwhelmingly passed a permanent doc fix, the Senator from Oregon and I reached an agreement that he would run the hotline on this legislation, the Steve Gleason Act, and pass this bill for our constituents. That is what we are working on today, and that is what I absolutely hope to complete today to get this necessary, important, bipartisan language across the finish line. Of course, the ALS Association, a national network group, is completely supportive. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a letter dated January 27, 2015, on this topic from the ALS Association. There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows: January 27, 2015. Hon. Cathy McMorris Rodgers, House of Representatives, Washington, DC. Hon. David Vitter, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC. Dear Representative McMorris Rodgers and Senator Vitter: I am writing on behalf of The ALS Association to express our strong support for your legislation that would help preserve access to speech generating devices (SGDs) and accessories such as eye tracking technology that are needed to access SGDs by people with ALS who have lost mobility. The Association applauds your leadership on these critically important issues and is committed to continuing to work with you to enact this legislation as soon as possible. As you know, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) has taken a number of different actions that limit the ability of people with ALS to access SGDs and eye tracking technology. This includes: issuing a ``coverage reminder'' that would have prohibited coverage for SGDs that include non-speech technology such as email, internet access and environmental controls; routine denials of coverage for eye tracking; and implementing a ``capped rental'' payment system that requires people with ALS to first rent SGDs for a period of 13 months before owning the device. These policies have created significant problems for people with ALS who rely on SGDs for all of their communications needs. For example, under capped rental if a person is admitted to hospice, a hospital or a nursing facility during the rental period, Medicare payment for the SGD will cease. Moreover, capped rental also prohibits a person with ALS from upgrading their SGD during the rental period, which means they are not able to access email, the internet and environmental controls that are so critical to the day-to-day lives of people with ALS. The Association strongly supported your efforts and those of nearly 200 of your colleagues who wrote to CMS expressing concern about these issues last year and we have worked with CMS and other stakeholders on these issues as well. We are grateful that CMS did take action to rescind the coverage reminder and initiate the process of revising the National Coverage Determination for SGDs. However, we do not anticipate that process to be completed until late July 2015 and it may not address the problems created by capped rental or denials of coverage for eye tracking. In short, these policies are having a significant negative impact on the lives of people living with ALS today and there is an urgent need to take action now. People with ALS, who have been robbed of the ability to speak and who will lose their life to ALS in an average of just two to five years, simply do not have time to wait. Your legislation is a responsible approach to address an immediate problem and would help ensure the Medicare program meets the needs of the people it was created to serve. By restoring a person's ability to purchase an SGD and ensuring coverage for eye tracking technologies, your legislation will enable people with ALS to access the SGDs they need when and where they need them and ensure they also have access to the technologies that are so vital to living with this disease. We look forward to continuing to work with you in support of people with ALS. Thank you again for your efforts to champion these critical issues and help ensure Medicare policies do not take away the voice of people with ALS. Sincerely, Steve Gibson, Chief Mission Strategy and Public Policy Officer, The ALS Association. Mr. VITTER. The association has reached out to members all across the country and put in very concrete terms what this means to their members. I wish to give one brief but very moving and significant example. It happens to be a woman from Oregon, the State of the ranking member of the committee. She was diagnosed with ALS in [[Page S2285]] January 2014. Her disease, unfortunately, has progressed rapidly. She is now close to fully paralyzed and has very limited use of her arms and hands, requiring loved ones to be with her at all times. Her respiratory system is also affected. She is struggling with the life- or-death decision of whether to have a tracheotomy procedure and go to mechanical ventilation or to enroll in hospice and essentially prepare to die. Her preference is to continue living, as she still enjoys life. One important factor in the decision for her is that being able to communicate is a tremendous concern. While she still has some vocal ability to speak and to be understood currently, she knows that going on the vent will be the end of her spoken voice and her ability to vocalize, and she is very worried that if she decides to go on a vent and prolong her life, she may lose the ability to communicate with the outside world because of the changes in Medicare policy that prevent her from accessing email and Internet via this technology we are talking about. She is also very concerned that Medicare will deny coverage for the eye-tracking technology she will need in order to use the SGD--this significant technology we are talking about. So, bottom line, she is worried that if she decides to continue living using mechanical ventilation, she will face the prospect of being locked up and having no means to communicate to help direct her care. Because of the limitations of SGD coverage, she may actually choose dying over living, because of that factor. It doesn't get more direct than that. It doesn't get more stark than that as to why we need to give these patients access to important communication technology through the Steve Gleason Act and why we need to act today, why we cannot delay this any longer. Of course, Steve Gleason, for whom this act is named, is a superb advocate for the ALS community. He is the former New Orleans Saints player who famously blocked a punt in the Saints' first game back in the Superdome after Hurricane Katrina. After that tremendous feat and his NFL career, Steve was diagnosed with ALS. Just as he gave the city of New Orleans hope to rebuild after the devastating storm, through his organization Team Gleason, he gives the ALS community and their families hope with his ``No White Flags'' message. Steve was my guest at the State of the Union speech this past January, and during his visit to Washington, we met with the Secretary of Health and Human Services, Sylvia Burwell, and started to gain huge momentum for the Steve Gleason Act. This bill again reinstates long-standing Medicare policy--Medicare policy that was solid and true to these patients until recently--to offer immediate relief for patients experiencing incredible difficulty accessing this important technology and equipment. The act expands access to advancements in technology in a fiscally responsible way. Michelle Gleason, Steve's wife, summed up the story of ALS patients and their loved ones this way: What causes me the most pain is the loss of his voice. I love hearing his voice. I want him to talk to me, and to our son Rivers. This disease takes his body; to take his voice just seems unfair. We can offer a voice. It may not be the same voice but a voice for these struggling patients. This was their lifeline. This was due them until recently, and now it is not because of this Medicare change. I urge all of my colleagues to come together around this piece of bipartisan legislation. Let's pass this today and give a voice--a real voice, a meaningful voice--to these struggling victims. Mr. President, this will become law because we have assurances from House leadership that they are eager to bring the bill to the House floor. They are eager to finish this important work to change the lives of patients across the country by giving them back their voice.

Mr. President, I rise in strong support of S. 984, the Steve Gleason Act, to help thousands of victims of ALS and other related diseases all across the United States. This bipartisan, straightforward bill would give immediate relief to those folks with ALS, or Lou Gehrig's disease, who are facing significant problems accessing necessary medical equipment as a result of three recent changes in Medicare that prohibit access on every level. It is important to note that this wasn't a problem until the administration governing Medicare made it a problem a few months ago. They affirmatively changed policy, changed rules, and created these significant access problems. We are talking about devices that are critical for patients who have lost their ability to speak, to communicate directly with friends, families, doctors, to call 911 in case of emergency, to write letters to loved ones. These devices allow these patients to speak and communicate in light of their loss of voice and other functions. This issue was first brought before Congress last year when thousands of patients, patient advocates, and device manufacturers brought to our attention the devastating consequences of this new Medicare policy. Patients were actually having their devices taken away. Many were not allowed to own their devices or were not permitted to unlock their devices in order to use all of the technological functions, all of which continue to be problems and to prevent patients from leading much more independent lives. As a result, Members on both sides of the aisle wrote a letter with more than 220 Members advocating on behalf of this patient population to reverse the Medicare administration decision. The Senate has that same opportunity for bipartisanship today, to support this legislation on a strong bipartisan basis. In that spirit, I thank Senator Klobuchar of Minnesota and Senator King of Maine, who have been completely supportive and aggressive in getting this bill to the finish line. They understand the importance of putting patients first and fixing this extremely misguided and harmful Medicare regulation that has had a truly devastating impact on the lives of ALS patients, as well as stroke victims and other folks facing significant paralysis. On Tuesday evening, before the Senate overwhelmingly passed a permanent doc fix, the Senator from Oregon and I reached an agreement that he would run the hotline on this legislation, the Steve Gleason Act, and pass this bill for our constituents. That is what we are working on today, and that is what I absolutely hope to complete today to get this necessary, important, bipartisan language across the finish line. Of course, the ALS Association, a national network group, is completely supportive. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a letter dated January 27, 2015, on this topic from the ALS Association. There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows: January 27, 2015. Hon. Cathy McMorris Rodgers, House of Representatives, Washington, DC. Hon. David Vitter, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC. Dear Representative McMorris Rodgers and Senator Vitter: I am writing on behalf of The ALS Association to express our strong support for your legislation that would help preserve access to speech generating devices (SGDs) and accessories such as eye tracking technology that are needed to access SGDs by people with ALS who have lost mobility. The Association applauds your leadership on these critically important issues and is committed to continuing to work with you to enact this legislation as soon as possible. As you know, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) has taken a number of different actions that limit the ability of people with ALS to access SGDs and eye tracking technology. This includes: issuing a ``coverage reminder'' that would have prohibited coverage for SGDs that include non-speech technology such as email, internet access and environmental controls; routine denials of coverage for eye tracking; and implementing a ``capped rental'' payment system that requires people with ALS to first rent SGDs for a period of 13 months before owning the device. These policies have created significant problems for people with ALS who rely on SGDs for all of their communications needs. For example, under capped rental if a person is admitted to hospice, a hospital or a nursing facility during the rental period, Medicare payment for the SGD will cease. Moreover, capped rental also prohibits a person with ALS from upgrading their SGD during the rental period, which means they are not able to access email, the internet and environmental controls that are so critical to the day-to-day lives of people with ALS. The Association strongly supported your efforts and those of nearly 200 of your colleagues who wrote to CMS expressing concern about these issues last year and we have worked with CMS and other stakeholders on these issues as well. We are grateful that CMS did take action to rescind the coverage reminder and initiate the process of revising the National Coverage Determination for SGDs. However, we do not anticipate that process to be completed until late July 2015 and it may not address the problems created by capped rental or denials of coverage for eye tracking. In short, these policies are having a significant negative impact on the lives of people living with ALS today and there is an urgent need to take action now. People with ALS, who have been robbed of the ability to speak and who will lose their life to ALS in an average of just two to five years, simply do not have time to wait. Your legislation is a responsible approach to address an immediate problem and would help ensure the Medicare program meets the needs of the people it was created to serve. By restoring a person's ability to purchase an SGD and ensuring coverage for eye tracking technologies, your legislation will enable people with ALS to access the SGDs they need when and where they need them and ensure they also have access to the technologies that are so vital to living with this disease. We look forward to continuing to work with you in support of people with ALS. Thank you again for your efforts to champion these critical issues and help ensure Medicare policies do not take away the voice of people with ALS. Sincerely, Steve Gibson, Chief Mission Strategy and Public Policy Officer, The ALS Association. Mr. VITTER. The association has reached out to members all across the country and put in very concrete terms what this means to their members. I wish to give one brief but very moving and significant example. It happens to be a woman from Oregon, the State of the ranking member of the committee. She was diagnosed with ALS in [[Page S2285]] January 2014. Her disease, unfortunately, has progressed rapidly. She is now close to fully paralyzed and has very limited use of her arms and hands, requiring loved ones to be with her at all times. Her respiratory system is also affected. She is struggling with the life- or-death decision of whether to have a tracheotomy procedure and go to mechanical ventilation or to enroll in hospice and essentially prepare to die. Her preference is to continue living, as she still enjoys life. One important factor in the decision for her is that being able to communicate is a tremendous concern. While she still has some vocal ability to speak and to be understood currently, she knows that going on the vent will be the end of her spoken voice and her ability to vocalize, and she is very worried that if she decides to go on a vent and prolong her life, she may lose the ability to communicate with the outside world because of the changes in Medicare policy that prevent her from accessing email and Internet via this technology we are talking about. She is also very concerned that Medicare will deny coverage for the eye-tracking technology she will need in order to use the SGD--this significant technology we are talking about. So, bottom line, she is worried that if she decides to continue living using mechanical ventilation, she will face the prospect of being locked up and having no means to communicate to help direct her care. Because of the limitations of SGD coverage, she may actually choose dying over living, because of that factor. It doesn't get more direct than that. It doesn't get more stark than that as to why we need to give these patients access to important communication technology through the Steve Gleason Act and why we need to act today, why we cannot delay this any longer. Of course, Steve Gleason, for whom this act is named, is a superb advocate for the ALS community. He is the former New Orleans Saints player who famously blocked a punt in the Saints' first game back in the Superdome after Hurricane Katrina. After that tremendous feat and his NFL career, Steve was diagnosed with ALS. Just as he gave the city of New Orleans hope to rebuild after the devastating storm, through his organization Team Gleason, he gives the ALS community and their families hope with his ``No White Flags'' message. Steve was my guest at the State of the Union speech this past January, and during his visit to Washington, we met with the Secretary of Health and Human Services, Sylvia Burwell, and started to gain huge momentum for the Steve Gleason Act. This bill again reinstates long-standing Medicare policy--Medicare policy that was solid and true to these patients until recently--to offer immediate relief for patients experiencing incredible difficulty accessing this important technology and equipment. The act expands access to advancements in technology in a fiscally responsible way. Michelle Gleason, Steve's wife, summed up the story of ALS patients and their loved ones this way: What causes me the most pain is the loss of his voice. I love hearing his voice. I want him to talk to me, and to our son Rivers. This disease takes his body; to take his voice just seems unfair. We can offer a voice. It may not be the same voice but a voice for these struggling patients. This was their lifeline. This was due them until recently, and now it is not because of this Medicare change. I urge all of my colleagues to come together around this piece of bipartisan legislation. Let's pass this today and give a voice--a real voice, a meaningful voice--to these struggling victims. Mr. President, this will become law because we have assurances from House leadership that they are eager to bring the bill to the House floor.

CREC-2015-04-21-pt1-PgS2283,CREC-2015-04-21,114,THE FIRST 100 DAYS OF THE REPUBLICAN-LED SENATE,"[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 58 (Tuesday, April 21, 2015)] [Senate] [Pages S2283-S2284] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] THE FIRST 100 DAYS OF THE REPUBLICAN-LED SENATE Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I am pleased to hear of yet another accomplishment that has happened in the Senate since we have gotten things opened up and functioning again. I wish to say that last year when Republicans were running for office, we promised that if we were reelected, we would get Washington working again for American families. That wasn't a campaign slogan; that was a commitment. I am proud to report that after 100 days in office, Republicans are making significant progress. To start, Republicans have the Senate functioning again on a basic level. From an operations standpoint day to day, over the past few years when the Democrats controlled the lawmaking process in the Senate, it largely ground to a halt. Instead of bills being drafted in committee and then brought to the floor for open debate and amendment, bills were crafted behind closed doors. Members in the minority party were shut out of the process, and so were many rank-and-file Democrats. Last year, Democratic leadership allowed a total of 15 amendment votes-- slightly over 1 amendment vote per month in the world's greatest deliberative body, known for unlimited amendment and unlimited debate. Contrast that with the first 100 days under Republican control. In the first 3\1/2\ months of the 114th Congress, the Republican-led Senate has held more than 100 amendment rollcall votes. More than half of those votes have been on Democratic amendments. When you shut one party out of the legislative process in the Senate, you shut out the voices of millions of Americans. Republicans experienced that under Democratic control, and we were determined to make sure things were different this year. Since Republicans took control of the Senate, Members of both parties have had the opportunity to make their voices heard, and we are seeing a lot more bipartisan legislation as a result. In the past 3\1/2\ months, the Republican-led Senate has approved 12 bipartisan bills. We have passed bipartisan legislation to approve the Keystone Pipeline. We have passed a bipartisan bill to prevent suicides among veterans. We have passed a bipartisan reauthorization of the Terrorism Risk Insurance Program and a bipartisan bill to provide restitution for victims of child pornography. Last week, we passed the first significant bipartisan reform of Medicare in years. Mr. President, last week also brought the announcement of a new bipartisan agreement, a bill to reauthorize trade promotion authority. With 96 percent of the world's population and consumers outside the borders of the United States, trade is essential to economic growth. Since 2009, increasing exports have accounted for more than 1.6 million new jobs in the United States. Manufacturing jobs that depend on exports pay on average 13 percent to 18 percent more. U.S. farmers, ranchers, and manufacturers rely on access to foreign markets. In my home State of South Dakota alone, exports support more than 15,000 jobs in industries ranging from farming and ranching to machinery and electronics. Farmers and ranchers in South Dakota, where agriculture is the No. 1 industry, depend on exports for a substantial part of their income. Exports of major South Dakota crops, such as soybeans and corn, have soared over the past few years. In fact, in 2013, total agricultural exports from South Dakota totaled $3.8 billion. Previous free- and fair-trade agreements have been a boon to America's farmers, ranchers, and workers. In 2013, countries with which our Nation has free-trade agreements purchased 12 times more goods per capita from the United States than non-free-trade agreement countries. Since 1934, almost all of the U.S free-trade agreements have been negotiated using trade promotion authority or a similar streamlined process. Trade promotion authority is designed to put the United States in the strongest possible position when negotiating trade agreements. Under TPA, Congress sets guidelines for trade negotiations and outlines the priorities the administration must follow. In return, Congress promises a simple up-or-down vote on the resulting trade agreement instead of a long amendment process that could leave the final deal looking nothing like the original one. That simple up-or- down vote is the key: It lets our negotiating partners know that Congress and trade negotiators are on the same page when it comes to the content of trade agreements, which gives other countries the confidence they need to put their best offers on the table. That, in turn, allows for a successful and timely conclusion of negotiations. Currently, the administration is negotiating two major trade agreements that have the potential to vastly expand the market for American goods and services in the EU and in the Pacific. The Trans-Pacific Partnership is being negotiated with a number of Asia-Pacific nations, including Australia, Japan, New Zealand, Singapore, and currently Vietnam. Currently, American goods face heavy tariffs in many of these countries. Tariffs on consumer goods in Trans- Pacific Partnership countries reach as high as 85 percent, while tariffs on agricultural products range even higher. Poultry tariffs in Trans-Pacific Partnership countries, for example, go up to 240 percent. That is a tremendous burden on American producers. American farmers, ranchers, manufacturers, and consumers would all benefit from the conclusion of the Trans-Pacific Partnership agreement and the United States-European Union trade agreement. These trade deals remove many of the barriers currently facing U.S. products in these regions, which would allow American goods to compete on a level playing field with their foreign counterparts. Reauthorizing trade promotion authority is essential to bringing these two agreements to a successful and timely conclusion. The bipartisan trade promotion authority bill that was introduced last week by the senior Senators from Utah and Oregon reauthorizes this key tool and includes a number of important updates, such as provisions to strengthen [[Page S2284]] transparency of the negotiating process and ensure that the American people stay informed. It also contains provisions I pushed for to require negotiators to ensure that trade agreements protect digital trade as well as trade in physical goods and services. With the importance of digital trade in the 21st-century economy, it is essential that any new trade promotion reauthorization include new guidelines specifically targeted at digital trade. I previously introduced legislation to help ensure that the free flow of digital goods and services is protected, and I am pleased that the bipartisan deal that was reached includes many of the measures I have advocated. The best way to solve the challenges facing our Nation is for Democrats and Republicans to come together to develop solutions. We have done a lot of that so far in the Republican-led Senate, and I look forward to doing a lot more of it. I hope those Democrats who have opposed trade promotion authority in the past will join the White House and Senate Republicans to pass this important bill for American workers and businesses and make the TPA reauthorization our next bipartisan achievement. Mr. President, I wish to add that we also have a bill that would require Congress to approve any nuclear arms agreement with Iran--also a very big bipartisan bill, as it was reported out of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. These are things which can be accomplishments for the American people. It starts with getting the Senate functioning and operating again, where people have the opportunity to come to the floor and debate these issues, to offer amendments, and to get those amendments voted on. That is what our commitment has been in the Senate. I argue-- and I think the record bears this out--that it is making a very consequential difference in terms of the things we are able to get done for the American people. I certainly hope we can continue that pattern. I yield the floor. The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Louisiana. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 58 (Tuesday, April 21, 2015)] [Senate] [Pages S2283-S2284] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] THE FIRST 100 DAYS OF THE REPUBLICAN-LED SENATE Mr. THUNE.

CREC-2015-04-21-pt1-PgS2285,CREC-2015-04-21,114,LYNCH NOMINATION,"[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 58 (Tuesday, April 21, 2015)] [Senate] [Pages S2285-S2286] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] LYNCH NOMINATION Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, it has been 165 days--5\1/2\ months--since the nomination of Loretta Lynch to be Attorney General was announced. Ms. Lynch has been pending on the Senate Executive Calendar for nearly 2 months. She was reported out of the Senate Judiciary Committee in a bipartisan vote--nine Democrats and three Republicans--on February 26. This is a new record, sadly, in terms of delay in appointing an Attorney General. The last seven nominees to be Attorney General of the United States combined--combined--waited on the Senate floor 24 days-- seven nominees, 24 days. Sadly, Ms. Lynch has now been waiting over 50 days. Why? What is it about this nominee that causes so much of a problem? Nothing came up at the Judiciary Committee hearing to suggest a problem. Yes, she was appointed by Barack Obama. Yes, she has said she will serve this President. But when it came to her personally, there was nothing. In fact, we have this tradition that after the nominee has testified under oath, then experts are brought in. Each party can bring an expert in to testify for or against the Attorney General nominee. Senator Patrick Leahy, the ranking Democrat on Judiciary, said to the assembled group-- I think there may have been 10 or 12 of these outside witnesses: Which of you, by show of hands, objects to the nomination of Loretta Lynch for Attorney General? Not a single one raised his hand--none. So even the witnesses that were brought to speak in negative terms all conceded that she should be Attorney General. That is rare. It is rare to have a nominee with that kind of affirmation come out of the Senate Judiciary Committee--and for good reason. When you look at her record, you can understand why. This young woman has an extraordinary record of service. She grew up in North Carolina as the daughter of a minister and a school librarian. Her dad was there at her hearing. Her father was smiling as she recalled those instances when she was a very young girl, and he would sit her on his shoulders and take her to see the civil rights events that occurred when she was so young. She received her undergraduate and law degrees from Harvard University. She has private sector experience at prestigious law firms. She has twice been confirmed unanimously by the Senate to serve as U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of New York. She served in that position with distinction. Her nomination has been endorsed by a wide range of groups, representing law enforcement, prosecutors, bar associations, business leaders, civil rights organizations, and former Justice Department officials from both Democratic and Republican administrations. In what may be one of the most amazing ironies of this whole situation, Loretta Lynch has been recognized as a leader when it comes to prosecuting human traffickers. Why is that significant? Because the Republican leader announced that he was holding up her nomination until we passed a bill on human trafficking. Here is a woman who, as a prosecutor and professional, has prosecuted the [[Page S2286]] people guilty of that crime, and she is being delayed in her appointment as Attorney General of the United States of America because of a political debate on the floor of the Senate for almost 4 weeks over this bill. Under Ms. Lynch's leadership, the U.S. Attorney's office in the Eastern District of New York has brought many important prosecutions in human trafficking. In United States v. Lopez, three brothers were convicted in 2014 for running a human trafficking ring involving 14- and 15-year-old girls. Ms. Lynch was also involved in the successful prosecution of the Granados-Hernandez sex trafficking ring, in which numerous child trafficking victims were reunited with their mothers. In United States v. Johnson, Ms. Loretta Lynch was involved in a prosecution where a Queens man was convicted for trafficking and prostituting a 15-year-old girl out of his home. Make no mistake, when it comes to the issue of human trafficking, this nominee for Attorney General knows more about the subject than most, and she has a record to prove it. Malika Saada Saar, the executive director of Rights4Girls, is one of the Nation's leading antitrafficking advocates. She said: ``It is clear that as the top prosecutor in Brooklyn, New York, Lynch has a strong record of being tough on crime and human trafficking.'' She has been held up on the floor because of our failure to pass a bill on that same subject. Here is what the President of the National District Attorneys Association, Michael Moore, said about Ms. Loretta Lynch when he wrote to express his organization's strong support for her: ``As prosecutors facing challenges in the field from violent crime, to human trafficking, to gangs and drug traffickers, our membership feels that Ms. Lynch understands the operational nature of these challenges and will be a strong independent voice at the helm of the Department.'' Calling a vote on Ms. Lynch and confirming her would be a big step forward in the fight against trafficking. It is time to end this delay and obstruction. This extraordinary woman nominated by the President of the United States to be the first African-American woman to serve as Attorney General should have been approved by the Senate long ago. While she has been waiting patiently for a long, long time, we have interrupted the business of the Senate to approve the President's appointments for Assistant Secretary of Transportation, Assistant Secretary of Commerce, Federal Mine Safety and Health Review Commissioners, Federal Retirement Thrift Investment Board Members, Undersecretary for Management at the Department of Homeland Security, Chairman of the National Indian Gaming Commission, and several Federal judges. We have had more than adequate opportunity to call Ms. Lynch for approval. Let us not leave Washington this week without voting on Loretta Lynch to be our next Attorney General. I voted for her in committee and will proudly support her nomination in the hopes that it will come to the floor this week. I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. LEAHY.

Mr. President, it has been 165 days--5\1/2\ months--since the nomination of Loretta Lynch to be Attorney General was announced. Ms. Lynch has been pending on the Senate Executive Calendar for nearly 2 months. She was reported out of the Senate Judiciary Committee in a bipartisan vote--nine Democrats and three Republicans--on February 26. This is a new record, sadly, in terms of delay in appointing an Attorney General. The last seven nominees to be Attorney General of the United States combined--combined--waited on the Senate floor 24 days-- seven nominees, 24 days. Sadly, Ms. Lynch has now been waiting over 50 days. Why? What is it about this nominee that causes so much of a problem? Nothing came up at the Judiciary Committee hearing to suggest a problem. Yes, she was appointed by Barack Obama. Yes, she has said she will serve this President. But when it came to her personally, there was nothing. In fact, we have this tradition that after the nominee has testified under oath, then experts are brought in. Each party can bring an expert in to testify for or against the Attorney General nominee. Senator Patrick Leahy, the ranking Democrat on Judiciary, said to the assembled group-- I think there may have been 10 or 12 of these outside witnesses: Which of you, by show of hands, objects to the nomination of Loretta Lynch for Attorney General? Not a single one raised his hand--none. So even the witnesses that were brought to speak in negative terms all conceded that she should be Attorney General. That is rare. It is rare to have a nominee with that kind of affirmation come out of the Senate Judiciary Committee--and for good reason. When you look at her record, you can understand why. This young woman has an extraordinary record of service. She grew up in North Carolina as the daughter of a minister and a school librarian. Her dad was there at her hearing. Her father was smiling as she recalled those instances when she was a very young girl, and he would sit her on his shoulders and take her to see the civil rights events that occurred when she was so young. She received her undergraduate and law degrees from Harvard University. She has private sector experience at prestigious law firms. She has twice been confirmed unanimously by the Senate to serve as U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of New York. She served in that position with distinction. Her nomination has been endorsed by a wide range of groups, representing law enforcement, prosecutors, bar associations, business leaders, civil rights organizations, and former Justice Department officials from both Democratic and Republican administrations.

Under the previous order, the Senate will resume consideration of S. 178, which the clerk will report. The legislative clerk read as follows: A bill (S. 178) to provide justice for the victims of trafficking. Pending: McConnell (for Cornyn) amendment No. 1120, to strengthen the Justice for Victims of Trafficking Act by incorporating additional bipartisan amendments. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont. Lynch Nomination Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I realize the devil is always in the details. I see the distinguished senior Senator from Texas on the floor and I hope we are getting somewhere on trafficking. I appreciate the fact that this body, when we were doing the Violence Against Women Act, voted for the anti-sex trafficking amendment I proposed. And the majority of the Senators at the time voted for the final version of the Violence Against Women Act, which included anti- sex trafficking language, and that bill has been signed into law. We should continue on with this bill, which adds to what we did a couple of years ago. But I am concerned, as I have said many times, that we have held up Loretta Lynch because of this. I cannot see what the corollary is. My friends on the other side of the aisle told me, when they had to wait for 3 or 4 days for a Republican nominee on the floor to get confirmed, that it was too long. They would warn us of national security concerns. Well, Loretta Lynch has waited on the floor for a vote for 54 days. I want to put this in some context. Attorney General Holder waited 5 days. Attorney General Mukasey waited 2 days. Attorney General Gonzales waited 8 days. Attorney General Ashcroft waited 2 days. Attorney General Reno waited 1 day. Attorney General Barr waited 5 days. Attorney General Thornburgh waited 1 day. If we take those seven most recent Attorneys General and take all the time that they waited on the floor and add it all together, it comes to 24 days. Loretta Lynch has waited 54 days on the floor--more than twice as long as the seven most recent Attorneys General combined. Then we still have the Deputy Attorney General nominee, whose background is virtually the same as Loretta Lynch's. Both are highly respected prosecutors. Both have prosecuted matters involving the issues we are trying to stop here on the floor--terrorists, traffickers, and white-collar criminals. Once we are done with Loretta Lynch, we have to get her deputy confirmed. I hope both of these highly qualified women are confirmed soon. It has already taken too long. These delays create a morale problem in the Department of Justice-- one of our first lines against terrorists and organized crime. We have some superb men and women who work at the Department of Justice. Some came during Republican administrations, and some came during Democratic administrations. I have met many of these men and women, from both Republican and Democratic administrations, and I am so impressed by them and their dedication. Most of them could leave, go to a law firm, and make a lot more money, but they are dedicated to this country. It is demoralizing to them when we hold the position of Attorney General in limbo. We should stop. The Department of Justice is something we should, whenever possible, keep politics out of. Remember, too, it is not the ``Secretary of Justice,'' like we have the Secretary of Commerce and the Secretary of Agriculture and so on--a member, as some might suggest, of the President's staff. This is the Attorney General of the United States. They represent you. They represent me. They represent everybody. I have often told a story about when I was a young law student at Georgetown. The then-Attorney General invited four or five students from different law schools to meet. He reviewed our grades, invited us in to actually spend an hour with him and encouraged us to come work with the Department of Justice. I remember one of the questions I asked that Attorney General. I said: If you are Attorney General of the United States and you are asked to prosecute somebody who is close to the President, what do you do? He said: Well, if they should be prosecuted, they would be treated the same as anybody else, and we would prosecute them as such. I declined the offer to go work at the Department of Justice. I was homesick and wanted to get back to Vermont. Both my wife and I wanted to get back. I wanted to practice law there, which I did, and I actually became a prosecutor. But I often thought of what the Attorney General said to me about his role. Subsequently a man in Illinois who was critical to the election of the next President ran afoul of the law and the same Attorney General signed off [[Page S2287]] on his prosecution. When asked by some of his staff, ``Well, are you sure you are OK with this?'' he said, ``He committed a crime. He should be prosecuted. Even though I probably won't go to many family reunions for some time after doing this.'' This was, of course, Attorney General Robert Kennedy, and the man he prosecuted was critical to the election of his brother John Kennedy as President. I always admired that he was willing to do that--that he put his duties as a prosecutor first ahead of any political duties. I believe Loretta Lynch will do the same. Sometimes young law students can be very impressionable, but I have never forgotten that time sitting there with Attorney General Kennedy. I have never forgotten how I had to wrestle with the decision to turn down his offer, but it was a family decision and one I have never regretted. I went back to Vermont, and things turned out all right. I have had the privilege of representing Vermont for over 40 years in this body. But that conversation is something I will always remember. It is one of the reasons I went on to the Judiciary Committee. It is one of the reasons I took, when it was offered to me, the chairmanship of the Committee and it is one of the reasons why I am now ranking member. Incidentally, the men and women who work there, on both sides of the aisle, are brilliant lawyers, hard-working people. Kristine Lucius is my chief counsel, and I don't know a better lawyer anywhere than she is or anybody who works harder than she does. We have a lot of issues before the Judiciary Committee. Senator Grassley is my friend. We have been friends for over 30 years. I won't speak for him, but I suspect he would say we have things to get going to. So I hope we are able to get this trafficking matter taken care of and get the Attorney General and Deputy Attorney General confirmed. In the last 2 years of President Bush's second term, Democrats had come back into the majority. I wanted to show that we would try to keep partisanship out, and as chairman, I had moved 15 of President Bush's judges through to confirmation by this time in his second term. We moved them far more rapidly than Republicans had toward the end of President Clinton's term. I am glad we have been able to confirm two judges this Congress. They were both judges from Texas whom I supported. I complimented the two Senators from Texas because of their work in picking candidates who would be judges first and foremost without reference to whatever political background they may have. I hope we can now start doing what we did with President Bush and confirm more. Let's stop making judges political. I am afraid that there could be good men and women who will decline the cut in pay and everything else to become a Federal judge if they think they are going to have to put their life on hold for 6 months or a year to get there--even more so for key positions such as Attorney General, Deputy Attorney General, and others in the Department of Justice. We can fight over political issues but this should be outside of that. The distinguished senior Senator from Texas was a judge and has a prosecutorial background. He and I have worked closely together on a number of issues--the Freedom of Information Act being one of them. And I suspect we will work together on a number of issues to come. Let's get past this roadblock and onto other things. I see him on the floor. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority whip. Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I came to the floor to talk about the work in the Senate and particularly the Justice for Victims of Trafficking Act. But I would say to my colleague and friend, with whom I have worked on so many important issues, that I also look forward--once we get past today's business--to working together with him on patent reform, criminal justice reform, and also to continue our very productive partnership on open government and transparency, particularly the Freedom of Information Act legislation. San Jacinto Day Mr. President, before I talk about the Justice for Victims of Trafficking Act, I have to note this: It is my responsibility, my duty, my honor to note that today is a very important day in Texas. This is San Jacinto Day. For those who do not know what that is, this is the official State holiday that honors Texas independence, where 910 soldiers, led by General Sam Houston, won the decisive battle of the Texas Revolution. So it is not the Battle of the Alamo that gave Texas its independence. That is the one that people perhaps remember the most. Maybe it is because of the movies and books that have been written about that. Actually, the Battle of the Alamo did not turn out too well. Virtually, everybody was killed. But it gave rise to the opportunity for these 910 men, led by General Sam Houston, on San Jacinto Day, to win the decisive battle of the Texas Revolution. Now, almost 180 years later, I think it is only appropriate and fitting that we recognize their bravery and their sacrifices in pursuit of our dream of freedom. Mr. President, on the subject of the Justice for Victims of Trafficking Act, this has been a strange experience, starting as we did on something that passed unanimously in the Judiciary Committee, with 30 cosponsors on a bipartisan basis, and all of a sudden to have this legislation stuck here in the Senate. I will not relitigate the reasons for that because, frankly, I think we have now found a way forward for this legislation, as the majority leader, Senator McConnell, and the Democratic leader, Senator Reid, announced this morning. It is going to take a little bit more work by the Senate. There are perhaps a handful of amendments that we will have an opportunity to vote on. I know there is a desire by everyone for us to finish this trafficking bill as soon as we can, and then we can address the concerns that the ranking member from Vermont, Senator Leahy, has about the Attorney General nomination. Senator McConnell has made very clear that once we get trafficking resolved, which it appears we are on a path to doing, then we can turn to the Lynch nomination. I have actually been somewhat surprised and more optimistic than I have been in a long time about how the Senate is beginning to work again, from passing a budget to dealing with the broken doc fix that had been the law of the land since 1997, which had required us to come back and patch--every 6 months to a year--and the reforms that actually were negotiated by Speaker Boehner and Leader Pelosi in the House, which we passed by an overwhelming margin here in the Senate. Then, consider what happened in the Foreign Relations Committee on the Iran sanctions issue with a unanimous vote and the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee, with Senator Alexander and Senator Murray announcing an agreement to move forward on the reauthorization of early childhood education. We have some very good progress that is being made on trade, for example. I just came from the Senate Finance Committee. I think there is a path forward on trade promotion authority and consideration of the Trans-Pacific Partnership. The truth is that the United States has roughly 20 percent of the world's purchasing power, which means 80 percent of the purchasing power in the world lies beyond our borders. We have 5 percent of the world's population, meaning 95 percent of the world's population lies beyond our borders. The opportunities we have to grow our economy and to help small and medium-sized businesses and the people--the middle-class families who work at those businesses--are very exciting. So the point is that after a long period of dysfunction in the Senate, we are starting to see the Senate work again the way it should work, the way it has historically worked--through the committees, to build consensus on legislation that can then come to the floor, and then to have Senators, whether they be in the majority or minority, to offer constructive suggestions about how to solve our Nation's biggest challenges, and then to work together to send these to the President and get his signature. So there are a lot of positive things happening in the Senate. I hope for even more positive things to occur in the near future. [[Page S2288]] I have been focused like a laser for some time now on justice for the victims of human trafficking. When I think for a minute about the fact that the typical victim of human trafficking is a 12- to 13-year-old girl, who has been sold essentially into sex slavery and who has lost control over her life and perhaps, to her mind, to her future. I cannot think of a more compelling need for the Senate than to try to offer a lifeline to these victims of human trafficking. That is what this legislation that hopefully we will act on today--perhaps no later than tomorrow--is designed to do. It creates a fund that could be as high as $30 million--not from taxes but from fines and penalties paid by people who commit sexual offenses and basically represents the demand side of the human trafficking equation. We have found a way now, on a bipartisan basis, to move this legislation forward so we can offer a hand to rescue these victims of human trafficking, so we can give them an opportunity to heal and we can provide them some hope for a better future. I know all of us, by virtue of the privilege of the office that we serve in, have had stories from constituents about human trafficking. I remember quite clearly Brooke Axtell of Austin, TX, who now works with a number of nonprofits, and has basically turned her tragic story into serving others who have likewise become victims of human trafficking. Brooke's story is really almost beyond belief. She says that at age 7 she was sexually abused. She was literally held captive in a basement and sold to men who would pay money to have sex with her, a 7-year old child. Brooke has brought to light her pain and has begun to heal as a result of having been rescued and been given a helping hand. But she has now turned her tragic story into hope by honorably helping others find a way out of a life that she herself experienced. She founded a group called Survivor Healing and Empowerment, which is a healing community of survivors of rape, abuse, and sex trafficking. There is another horrific story that I have heard--I am sure just as all the Members of the Senate have heard coming from their States, because this is not something isolated in one State. This is a national--indeed, it is an international--phenomenon. Another woman I have had the privilege of meeting with and who has shared her story with me is Melissa Woodward from the Dallas-Fort Worth area. Melissa was 12 years old when she was sold into the sex trade by a family member--unbelievable. Eventually, she was pulled out of school to be trafficked full time when she was in the sixth grade. Her life, as she describes it, became a prison. She was literally chained to a bed in a warehouse, she says, and endured regular beatings and obviously, sexual assaults. There was even once an attempt to set her on fire by one of her abusers. All the while, she says, she was forced to serve between 5 and 30 men every day. She said she wished she was dead. As heartbreaking as Melissa's story is, just as sad is the way she was treated after she escaped her captors. In one of the big changes in the way we have approached victims of human trafficking--at one point we claimed they were the criminal because they had engaged in prostitution. But the idea of a child prostitute is an oxymoron. A child cannot consent to a life of prostitution. What we find, in looking at the victims of human trafficking, is that many of them are manipulated, coerced, and forced to engage in this sex activity for the economic benefit of their johns or their pimps or their traffickers. This is all about money. This is about the face of evil that treats human beings as objects or as things, without the basic dignity and respect which all human beings are entitled to. But as I said, one of the problems with the way we used to treat victims of human trafficking is that we treated them like criminals. That was all too common an outcome for trafficking victims who were labeled as prostitutes and left with very few options but to ultimately return to a nightmare that, sadly, exists in our country. That is beginning to change. It needs to change even more, which is another reason why we need to pass this bill. This is the kind of legislation that I think in many ways is unique, because it is a nonpartisan piece of legislation. All this legislation is designed to do is to help the victims of human trafficking get rescued and then begin to heal and to get on with their lives. It is designed to provide much-needed resources for victims of human trafficking--plain and simple. It may be nothing more than a safe place to sleep, protected from the people who would continue to abuse them. It is designed to help people such as Brooke, Melissa, and so many others--the tens of thousands of victims of human trafficking. This legislation would not only provide help for those victims, but it would ensure that children such as Melissa are treated as victims and not criminals. It would also add law enforcement tools to help authorities rescue victims and to take down human traffickers and the organized criminal networks who support them. That is an important point because human trafficking is not a mom-and-pop business. This is run by organized crime and criminal networks, some of them international or transnational. I want to thank my colleagues for caring--for caring about people such as Melissa and Brooke and the many examples of human trafficking that we have all been introduced to. I want to particularly express my gratitude for all of our colleagues for working on this and not giving up until we found a pathway toward success. This body's consideration of this bill has proven that compromise and bipartisanship need not be relics of the past in today's Washington. They are very much alive and well, particularly when the need is so very great, as it is in this area. So now for the sake of these victims, let's get this important legislation passed and provide crucial help for the children trapped in modern day slavery. I want to just conclude by saying a few thank-you's. I know it is a little premature. But we would not have gotten this far if it were not for the help of organizations such as Rights4Girls, Shared Hope International, Coalition Against Trafficking in Women, the End Child Prostitution and Trafficking organization, the National Association to Protect Children, and members of our staff in the Senate who have worked so hard to get us where we are today. I want to express my gratitude to Senator Klobuchar, Senator Murray, and Senator Reid, on the other side of the aisle, who have worked so closely with us, and of course to the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, Senator Grassley, and particularly I want to single out the majority leader, Senator McConnell. He said we would not move to the nomination for Attorney General of the United States until we get this done. And, indeed, today, I hope and believe that we will get this done, and then we can turn to that nomination. But there are others, perhaps too many to name: Senator Warner, Senator Heitkamp, and others on the Democratic side. There are those on the Republican side. Senator Collins comes to mind, and there are others who have worked so hard and so relentlessly and with such determination to get us where we are today. We need to get this over the finish line so we can move on to other business. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Flake). The clerk will call the roll. The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 58 (Tuesday, April 21, 2015)] [Senate] [Pages S2286-S2288] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] JUSTICE FOR VICTIMS OF TRAFFICKING ACT OF 2015 The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senate will resume consideration of S. 178, which the clerk will report. The legislative clerk read as follows: A bill (S. 178) to provide justice for the victims of trafficking. Pending: McConnell (for Cornyn) amendment No. 1120, to strengthen the Justice for Victims of Trafficking Act by incorporating additional bipartisan amendments. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont. Lynch Nomination Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I realize the devil is always in the details. I see the distinguished senior Senator from Texas on the floor and I hope we are getting somewhere on trafficking. I appreciate the fact that this body, when we were doing the Violence Against Women Act, voted for the anti-sex trafficking amendment I proposed. And the majority of the Senators at the time voted for the final version of the Violence Against Women Act, which included anti- sex trafficking language, and that bill has been signed into law. We should continue on with this bill, which adds to what we did a couple of years ago. But I am concerned, as I have said many times, that we have held up Loretta Lynch because of this. I cannot see what the corollary is. My friends on the other side of the aisle told me, when they had to wait for 3 or 4 days for a Republican nominee on the floor to get confirmed, that it was too long. They would warn us of national security concerns. Well, Loretta Lynch has waited on the floor for a vote for 54 days. I want to put this in some context. Attorney General Holder waited 5 days. Attorney General Mukasey waited 2 days. Attorney General Gonzales waited 8 days. Attorney General Ashcroft waited 2 days. Attorney General Reno waited 1 day. Attorney General Barr waited 5 days. Attorney General Thornburgh waited 1 day. If we take those seven most recent Attorneys General and take all the time that they waited on the floor and add it all together, it comes to 24 days. Loretta Lynch has waited 54 days on the floor--more than twice as long as the seven most recent Attorneys General combined. Then we still have the Deputy Attorney General nominee, whose background is virtually the same as Loretta Lynch's. Both are highly respected prosecutors. Both have prosecuted matters involving the issues we are trying to stop here on the floor--terrorists, traffickers, and white-collar criminals. Once we are done with Loretta Lynch, we have to get her deputy confirmed. I hope both of these highly qualified women are confirmed soon. It has already taken too long. These delays create a morale problem in the Department of Justice-- one of our first lines against terrorists and organized crime. We have some superb men and women who work at the Department of Justice. Some came during Republican administrations, and some came during Democratic administrations. I have met many of these men and women, from both Republican and Democratic administrations, and I am so impressed by them and their dedication. Most of them could leave, go to a law firm, and make a lot more money, but they are dedicated to this country. It is demoralizing to them when we hold the position of Attorney General in limbo. We should stop. The Department of Justice is something we should, whenever possible, keep politics out of. Remember, too, it is not the ``Secretary of Justice,'' like we have the Secretary of Commerce and the Secretary of Agriculture and so on--a member, as some might suggest, of the President's staff. This is the Attorney General of the United States. They represent you. They represent me. They represent everybody. I have often told a story about when I was a young law student at Georgetown. The then-Attorney General invited four or five students from different law schools to meet. He reviewed our grades, invited us in to actually spend an hour with him and encouraged us to come work with the Department of Justice. I remember one of the questions I asked that Attorney General. I said: If you are Attorney General of the United States and you are asked to prosecute somebody who is close to the President, what do you do? He said: Well, if they should be prosecuted, they would be treated the same as anybody else, and we would prosecute them as such. I declined the offer to go work at the Department of Justice. I was homesick and wanted to get back to Vermont. Both my wife and I wanted to get back. I wanted to practice law there, which I did, and I actually became a prosecutor. But I often thought of what the Attorney General said to me about his role. Subsequently a man in Illinois who was critical to the election of the next President ran afoul of the law and the same Attorney General signed off [[Page S2287]] on his prosecution. When asked by some of his staff, ``Well, are you sure you are OK with this?'' he said, ``He committed a crime. He should be prosecuted. Even though I probably won't go to many family reunions for some time after doing this.'' This was, of course, Attorney General Robert Kennedy, and the man he prosecuted was critical to the election of his brother John Kennedy as President. I always admired that he was willing to do that--that he put his duties as a prosecutor first ahead of any political duties. I believe Loretta Lynch will do the same. Sometimes young law students can be very impressionable, but I have never forgotten that time sitting there with Attorney General Kennedy. I have never forgotten how I had to wrestle with the decision to turn down his offer, but it was a family decision and one I have never regretted. I went back to Vermont, and things turned out all right. I have had the privilege of representing Vermont for over 40 years in this body. But that conversation is something I will always remember. It is one of the reasons I went on to the Judiciary Committee. It is one of the reasons I took, when it was offered to me, the chairmanship of the Committee and it is one of the reasons why I am now ranking member. Incidentally, the men and women who work there, on both sides of the aisle, are brilliant lawyers, hard-working people. Kristine Lucius is my chief counsel, and I don't know a better lawyer anywhere than she is or anybody who works harder than she does. We have a lot of issues before the Judiciary Committee. Senator Grassley is my friend. We have been friends for over 30 years. I won't speak for him, but I suspect he would say we have things to get going to. So I hope we are able to get this trafficking matter taken care of and get the Attorney General and Deputy Attorney General confirmed. In the last 2 years of President Bush's second term, Democrats had come back into the majority. I wanted to show that we would try to keep partisanship out, and as chairman, I had moved 15 of President Bush's judges through to confirmation by this time in his second term. We moved them far more rapidly than Republicans had toward the end of President Clinton's term. I am glad we have been able to confirm two judges this Congress. They were both judges from Texas whom I supported. I complimented the two Senators from Texas because of their work in picking candidates who would be judges first and foremost without reference to whatever political background they may have. I hope we can now start doing what we did with President Bush and confirm more. Let's stop making judges political. I am afraid that there could be good men and women who will decline the cut in pay and everything else to become a Federal judge if they think they are going to have to put their life on hold for 6 months or a year to get there--even more so for key positions such as Attorney General, Deputy Attorney General, and others in the Department of Justice. We can fight over political issues but this should be outside of that. The distinguished senior Senator from Texas was a judge and has a prosecutorial background. He and I have worked closely together on a number of issues--the Freedom of Information Act being one of them. And I suspect we will work together on a number of issues to come. Let's get past this roadblock and onto other things. I see him on the floor. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority whip. Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I came to the floor to talk about the work in the Senate and particularly the Justice for Victims of Trafficking Act. But I would say to my colleague and friend, with whom I have worked on so many important issues, that I also look forward--once we get past today's business--to working together with him on patent reform, criminal justice reform, and also to continue our very productive partnership on open government and transparency, particularly the Freedom of Information Act legislation. San Jacinto Day Mr. President, before I talk about the Justice for Victims of Trafficking Act, I have to note this: It is my responsibility, my duty, my honor to note that today is a very important day in Texas. This is San Jacinto Day. For those who do not know what that is, this is the official State holiday that honors Texas independence, where 910 soldiers, led by General Sam Houston, won the decisive battle of the Texas Revolution. So it is not the Battle of the Alamo that gave Texas its independence. That is the one that people perhaps remember the most. Maybe it is because of the movies and books that have been written about that. Actually, the Battle of the Alamo did not turn out too well. Virtually, everybody was killed. But it gave rise to the opportunity for these 910 men, led by General Sam Houston, on San Jacinto Day, to win the decisive battle of the Texas Revolution. Now, almost 180 years later, I think it is only appropriate and fitting that we recognize their bravery and their sacrifices in pursuit of our dream of freedom. Mr. President, on the subject of the Justice for Victims of Trafficking Act, this has been a strange experience, starting as we did on something that passed unanimously in the Judiciary Committee, with 30 cosponsors on a bipartisan basis, and all of a sudden to have this legislation stuck here in the Senate.

Subsequently a man in Illinois who was critical to the election of the next President ran afoul of the law and the same Attorney General signed off [[Page S2287]] on his prosecution. When asked by some of his staff, ``Well, are you sure you are OK with this?'' he said, ``He committed a crime. He should be prosecuted. Even though I probably won't go to many family reunions for some time after doing this.'' This was, of course, Attorney General Robert Kennedy, and the man he prosecuted was critical to the election of his brother John Kennedy as President. I always admired that he was willing to do that--that he put his duties as a prosecutor first ahead of any political duties. I believe Loretta Lynch will do the same. Sometimes young law students can be very impressionable, but I have never forgotten that time sitting there with Attorney General Kennedy. I have never forgotten how I had to wrestle with the decision to turn down his offer, but it was a family decision and one I have never regretted. I went back to Vermont, and things turned out all right. I have had the privilege of representing Vermont for over 40 years in this body. But that conversation is something I will always remember. It is one of the reasons I went on to the Judiciary Committee. It is one of the reasons I took, when it was offered to me, the chairmanship of the Committee and it is one of the reasons why I am now ranking member. Incidentally, the men and women who work there, on both sides of the aisle, are brilliant lawyers, hard-working people. Kristine Lucius is my chief counsel, and I don't know a better lawyer anywhere than she is or anybody who works harder than she does. We have a lot of issues before the Judiciary Committee. Senator Grassley is my friend. We have been friends for over 30 years. I won't speak for him, but I suspect he would say we have things to get going to. So I hope we are able to get this trafficking matter taken care of and get the Attorney General and Deputy Attorney General confirmed. In the last 2 years of President Bush's second term, Democrats had come back into the majority. I wanted to show that we would try to keep partisanship out, and as chairman, I had moved 15 of President Bush's judges through to confirmation by this time in his second term. We moved them far more rapidly than Republicans had toward the end of President Clinton's term. I am glad we have been able to confirm two judges this Congress. They were both judges from Texas whom I supported. I complimented the two Senators from Texas because of their work in picking candidates who would be judges first and foremost without reference to whatever political background they may have. I hope we can now start doing what we did with President Bush and confirm more. Let's stop making judges political. I am afraid that there could be good men and women who will decline the cut in pay and everything else to become a Federal judge if they think they are going to have to put their life on hold for 6 months or a year to get there--even more so for key positions such as Attorney General, Deputy Attorney General, and others in the Department of Justice. We can fight over political issues but this should be outside of that. The distinguished senior Senator from Texas was a judge and has a prosecutorial background. He and I have worked closely together on a number of issues--the Freedom of Information Act being one of them. And I suspect we will work together on a number of issues to come. Let's get past this roadblock and onto other things. I see him on the floor. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority whip. Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I came to the floor to talk about the work in the Senate and particularly the Justice for Victims of Trafficking Act. But I would say to my colleague and friend, with whom I have worked on so many important issues, that I also look forward--once we get past today's business--to working together with him on patent reform, criminal justice reform, and also to continue our very productive partnership on open government and transparency, particularly the Freedom of Information Act legislation. San Jacinto Day Mr. President, before I talk about the Justice for Victims of Trafficking Act, I have to note this: It is my responsibility, my duty, my honor to note that today is a very important day in Texas. This is San Jacinto Day. For those who do not know what that is, this is the official State holiday that honors Texas independence, where 910 soldiers, led by General Sam Houston, won the decisive battle of the Texas Revolution. So it is not the Battle of the Alamo that gave Texas its independence. That is the one that people perhaps remember the most. Maybe it is because of the movies and books that have been written about that. Actually, the Battle of the Alamo did not turn out too well. Virtually, everybody was killed. But it gave rise to the opportunity for these 910 men, led by General Sam Houston, on San Jacinto Day, to win the decisive battle of the Texas Revolution. Now, almost 180 years later, I think it is only appropriate and fitting that we recognize their bravery and their sacrifices in pursuit of our dream of freedom. Mr. President, on the subject of the Justice for Victims of Trafficking Act, this has been a strange experience, starting as we did on something that passed unanimously in the Judiciary Committee, with 30 cosponsors on a bipartisan basis, and all of a sudden to have this legislation stuck here in the Senate. I will not relitigate the reasons for that because, frankly, I think we have now found a way forward for this legislation, as the majority leader, Senator McConnell, and the Democratic leader, Senator Reid, announced this morning. It is going to take a little bit more work by the Senate. There are perhaps a handful of amendments that we will have an opportunity to vote on. I know there is a desire by everyone for us to finish this trafficking bill as soon as we can, and then we can address the concerns that the ranking member from Vermont, Senator Leahy, has about the Attorney General nomination. Senator McConnell has made very clear that once we get trafficking resolved, which it appears we are on a path to doing, then we can turn to the Lynch nomination. I have actually been somewhat surprised and more optimistic than I have been in a long time about how the Senate is beginning to work again, from passing a budget to dealing with the broken doc fix that had been the law of the land since 1997, which had required us to come back and patch--every 6 months to a year--and the reforms that actually were negotiated by Speaker Boehner and Leader Pelosi in the House, which we passed by an overwhelming margin here in the Senate. Then, consider what happened in the Foreign Relations Committee on the Iran sanctions issue with a unanimous vote and the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee, with Senator Alexander and Senator Murray announcing an agreement to move forward on the reauthorization of early childhood education. We have some very good progress that is being made on trade, for example. I just came from the Senate Finance Committee. I think there is a path forward on trade promotion authority and consideration of the Trans-Pacific Partnership. The truth is that the United States has roughly 20 percent of the world's purchasing power, which means 80 percent of the purchasing power in the world lies beyond our borders. We have 5 percent of the world's population, meaning 95 percent of the world's population lies beyond our borders. The opportunities we have to grow our economy and to help small and medium-sized businesses and the people--the middle-class families who work at those businesses--are very exciting. So the point is that after a long period of dysfunction in the Senate, we are starting to see the Senate work again the way it should work, the way it has historically worked--through the committees, to build consensus on legislation that can then come to the floor, and then to have Senators, whether they be in the majority or minority, to offer constructive suggestions about how to solve our Nation's biggest challenges, and then to work together to send these to the President and get his signature. So there are a lot of positive things happening in the Senate. I hope for even more positive things to occur in the near future. [[Page S2288]] I have been focused like a laser for some time now on justice for the victims of human trafficking. When I think for a minute about the fact that the typical victim of human trafficking is a 12- to 13-year-old girl, who has been sold essentially into sex slavery and who has lost control over her life and perhaps, to her mind, to her future. I cannot think of a more compelling need for the Senate than to try to offer a lifeline to these victims of human trafficking. That is what this legislation that hopefully we will act on today--perhaps no later than tomorrow--is designed to do. It creates a fund that could be as high as $30 million--not from taxes but from fines and penalties paid by people who commit sexual offenses and basically represents the demand side of the human trafficking equation. We have found a way now, on a bipartisan basis, to move this legislation forward so we can offer a hand to rescue these victims of human trafficking, so we can give them an opportunity to heal and we can provide them some hope for a better future. I know all of us, by virtue of the privilege of the office that we serve in, have had stories from constituents about human trafficking. I remember quite clearly Brooke Axtell of Austin, TX, who now works with a number of nonprofits, and has basically turned her tragic story into serving others who have likewise become victims of human trafficking. Brooke's story is really almost beyond belief. She says that at age 7 she was sexually abused. She was literally held captive in a basement and sold to men who would pay money to have sex with her, a 7-year old child. Brooke has brought to light her pain and has begun to heal as a result of having been rescued and been given a helping hand. But she has now turned her tragic story into hope by honorably helping others find a way out of a life that she herself experienced. She founded a group called Survivor Healing and Empowerment, which is a healing community of survivors of rape, abuse, and sex trafficking. There is another horrific story that I have heard--I am sure just as all the Members of the Senate have heard coming from their States, because this is not something isolated in one State. This is a national--indeed, it is an international--phenomenon. Another woman I have had the privilege of meeting with and who has shared her story with me is Melissa Woodward from the Dallas-Fort Worth area. Melissa was 12 years old when she was sold into the sex trade by a family member--unbelievable. Eventually, she was pulled out of school to be trafficked full time when she was in the sixth grade. Her life, as she describes it, became a prison. She was literally chained to a bed in a warehouse, she says, and endured regular beatings and obviously, sexual assaults. There was even once an attempt to set her on fire by one of her abusers. All the while, she says, she was forced to serve between 5 and 30 men every day. She said she wished she was dead. As heartbreaking as Melissa's story is, just as sad is the way she was treated after she escaped her captors. In one of the big changes in the way we have approached victims of human trafficking--at one point we claimed they were the criminal because they had engaged in prostitution. But the idea of a child prostitute is an oxymoron. A child cannot consent to a life of prostitution. What we find, in looking at the victims of human trafficking, is that many of them are manipulated, coerced, and forced to engage in this sex activity for the economic benefit of their johns or their pimps or their traffickers. This is all about money. This is about the face of evil that treats human beings as objects or as things, without the basic dignity and respect which all human beings are entitled to. But as I said, one of the problems with the way we used to treat victims of human trafficking is that we treated them like criminals. That was all too common an outcome for trafficking victims who were labeled as prostitutes and left with very few options but to ultimately return to a nightmare that, sadly, exists in our country. That is beginning to change. It needs to change even more, which is another reason why we need to pass this bill. This is the kind of legislation that I think in many ways is unique, because it is a nonpartisan piece of legislation. All this legislation is designed to do is to help the victims of human trafficking get rescued and then begin to heal and to get on with their lives. It is designed to provide much-needed resources for victims of human trafficking--plain and simple. It may be nothing more than a safe place to sleep, protected from the people who would continue to abuse them. It is designed to help people such as Brooke, Melissa, and so many others--the tens of thousands of victims of human trafficking. This legislation would not only provide help for those victims, but it would ensure that children such as Melissa are treated as victims and not criminals. It would also add law enforcement tools to help authorities rescue victims and to take down human traffickers and the organized criminal networks who support them. That is an important point because human trafficking is not a mom-and-pop business. This is run by organized crime and criminal networks, some of them international or transnational. I want to thank my colleagues for caring--for caring about people such as Melissa and Brooke and the many examples of human trafficking that we have all been introduced to. I want to particularly express my gratitude for all of our colleagues for working on this and not giving up until we found a pathway toward success. This body's consideration of this bill has proven that compromise and bipartisanship need not be relics of the past in today's Washington. They are very much alive and well, particularly when the need is so very great, as it is in this area. So now for the sake of these victims, let's get this important legislation passed and provide crucial help for the children trapped in modern day slavery. I want to just conclude by saying a few thank-you's. I know it is a little premature. But we would not have gotten this far if it were not for the help of organizations such as Rights4Girls, Shared Hope International, Coalition Against Trafficking in Women, the End Child Prostitution and Trafficking organization, the National Association to Protect Children, and members of our staff in the Senate who have worked so hard to get us where we are today. I want to express my gratitude to Senator Klobuchar, Senator Murray, and Senator Reid, on the other side of the aisle, who have worked so closely with us, and of course to the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, Senator Grassley, and particularly I want to single out the majority leader, Senator McConnell. He said we would not move to the nomination for Attorney General of the United States until we get this done. And, indeed, today, I hope and believe that we will get this done, and then we can turn to that nomination. But there are others, perhaps too many to name: Senator Warner, Senator Heitkamp, and others on the Democratic side. There are those on the Republican side. Senator Collins comes to mind, and there are others who have worked so hard and so relentlessly and with such determination to get us where we are today. We need to get this over the finish line so we can move on to other business. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Flake). The clerk will call the roll. The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. ____________________",package_114_99.csv,20980,20980,21048,"[congressional record volume 161, number 58 (tuesday, april 21, 2015)] [senate] [pages s2286-s2288] from the congressional record online through the government publishing office [ www.gpo.gov ] justice for victims of trafficking act of 2015 the presiding officer. under the previous order, the senate will resume consideration of s. 178, which the clerk will report. the legislative clerk read as follows: a bill (s. 178) to provide justice for the victims of trafficking. pending: mcconnell (for cornyn) amendment no. 1120, to strengthen the justice for victims of trafficking act by incorporating additional bipartisan amendments. the presiding officer. the senator from vermont. lynch nomination mr. leahy. mr. president, i realize the devil is always in the details. i see the distinguished senior senator from texas on the floor and i hope we are getting somewhere on trafficking. i appreciate the fact that this body, when we were doing the violence against women act, voted for the anti-sex trafficking amendment i proposed. and the majority of the senators at the time voted for the final version of the violence against women act, which included anti- sex trafficking language, and that bill has been signed into law. we should continue on with this bill, which adds to what we did a couple of years ago. but i am concerned, as i have said many times, that we have held up loretta lynch because of this. i cannot see what the corollary is. my friends on the other side of the aisle told me, when they had to wait for 3 or 4 days for a republican nominee on the floor to get confirmed, that it was too long. they would warn us of national security concerns. well, loretta lynch has waited on the floor for a vote for 54 days. i want to put this in some context. attorney general holder waited 5 days. attorney general mukasey waited 2 days. attorney general gonzales waited 8 days. attorney general ashcroft waited 2 days. attorney general reno waited 1 day. attorney general barr waited 5 days. attorney general thornburgh waited 1 day. if we take those seven most recent attorneys general and take all the time that they waited on the floor and add it all together, it comes to 24 days. loretta lynch has waited 54 days on the floor--more than twice as long as the seven most recent attorneys general combined. then we still have the deputy attorney general nominee, whose background is virtually the same as loretta lynch's. both are highly respected prosecutors. both have prosecuted matters involving the issues we are trying to stop here on the floor--terrorists, traffickers, and white-collar criminals. once we are done with loretta lynch, we have to get her deputy confirmed. i hope both of these highly qualified women are confirmed soon. it has already taken too long. these delays create a morale problem in the department of justice-- one of our first lines against terrorists and organized crime. we have some superb men and women who work at the department of justice. some came during republican administrations, and some came during democratic administrations. i have met many of these men and women, from both republican and democratic administrations, and i am so impressed by them and their dedication. most of them could leave, go to a law firm, and make a lot more money, but they are dedicated to this country. it is demoralizing to them when we hold the position of attorney general in limbo. we should stop. the department of justice is something we should, whenever possible, keep politics out of. remember, too, it is not the ``secretary of justice,'' like we have the secretary of commerce and the secretary of agriculture and so on--a member, as some might suggest, of the president's staff. this is the attorney general of the united states. they represent you. they represent me. they represent everybody. i have often told a story about when i was a young law student at georgetown. the then-attorney general invited four or five students from different law schools to meet. he reviewed our grades, invited us in to actually spend an hour with him and encouraged us to come work with the department of justice. i remember one of the questions i asked that attorney general. i said: if you are attorney general of the united states and you are asked to prosecute somebody who is close to the president, what do you do? he said: well, if they should be prosecuted, they would be treated the same as anybody else, and we would prosecute them as such. i declined the offer to go work at the department of justice. i was homesick and wanted to get back to vermont. both my wife and i wanted to get back. i wanted to practice law there, which i did, and i actually became a prosecutor. but i often thought of what the attorney general said to me about his role. subsequently a man in illinois who was critical to the election of the next president ran afoul of the law and the same attorney general signed off [[page s2287]] on his prosecution. when asked by some of his staff, ``well, are you sure you are ok with this?'' he said, ``he committed a crime. he should be prosecuted. even though i probably won't go to many family reunions for some time after doing this.'' this was, of course, attorney general robert kennedy, and the man he prosecuted was critical to the election of his brother john kennedy as president. i always admired that he was willing to do that--that he put his duties as a prosecutor first ahead of any political duties. i believe loretta lynch will do the same. sometimes young law students can be very impressionable, but i have never forgotten that time sitting there with attorney general kennedy. i have never forgotten how i had to wrestle with the decision to turn down his offer, but it was a family decision and one i have never regretted. i went back to vermont, and things turned out all right. i have had the privilege of representing vermont for over 40 years in this body. but that conversation is something i will always remember. it is one of the reasons i went on to the

works harder than she does. we have a lot of issues before the judiciary committee. senator grassley is my friend. we have been friends for over 30 years. i won't speak for him, but i suspect he would say we have things to get going to. so i hope we are able to get this trafficking matter taken care of and get the attorney general and deputy attorney general confirmed. in the last 2 years of

others on the democratic side. there are those on the republican side. senator collins comes to mind, and there are others who have worked so hard and so relentlessly and with such determination to get us where we are today. we need to get this over the finish line so we can move on to other business. i suggest the absence of a quorum. the presiding officer (mr. flake). the clerk will call the roll. the bill clerk proceeded to call the roll. mr. coats. mr. president, i ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. the presiding officer. without objection, it is so ordered. ____________________",20980
CREC-2015-04-21-pt1-PgS2288-2,CREC-2015-04-21,114,JUSTICE FOR VICTIMS OF TRAFFICKING ACT OF 2015--Continued,"[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 58 (Tuesday, April 21, 2015)] [Senate] [Pages S2288-S2295] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] JUSTICE FOR VICTIMS OF TRAFFICKING ACT OF 2015--Continued The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma is recognized. Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I was not going to be talking right now, but I understand some of the people who are going to be reserving time are not yet here. [[Page S2289]] Pilot's Bill of Rights 2 Mr. President, I want to remind my colleagues on the floor that we have a piece of legislation that is coming up that no one is really plugged into right now, but it is going to be coming before us in a very short period of time. Back in 2011, I introduced a bill and passed a bill called the Pilot's Bill of Rights. It was something that was very meaningful to a relatively small number of people, but these are single-issue people, and it strove to correct a problem in our justice system that existed for as long as I could remember. Having been an active commercial pilot for the last over 50 years-- and there are not too many in the Senate; and in our delegation in Oklahoma, I was the only one until a couple years ago--it is only natural that I receive comments from a lot of people concerning problems they have with the FAA. There are a lot of great people in the FAA, and a lot of them I have worked with for many, many years. But there are also some--and this is true with any regulatory body, anyone who has authority over individuals. I remember back many years ago when I was the mayor of Tulsa. We had a great police force. But all it takes is two or three of them who are the bad guys. We are seeing some of that around today, and that gives a bad reputation to a lot of people. The same thing is true with some of the people who are working with the FAA. I can remember helping others, and I always did come to their aid when they felt they were not getting proper justice. But it really did not register with me until it actually happened to me. Back about 3 years ago, flying an airplane into a Texas airfield that is not a controlled airfield, there was an activity going on on the runway without any NOTAMs that had been advised--and nobody actually had any way of knowing this--and with permission I landed on that runway. This is a runway in far South Texas called the Cameron County Airport. It has a 9,000-foot runway. They were working on just a couple thousand feet of it, so it was very easy to come in. Now, because of certain individuals who had some other reasons to be critical of me, all kinds of things happened as a result of that. In fact, just recently they have even had some cartoons talking about how I landed on a runway and was chasing people off the runway. None of that was true. But this is what happened. They proposed to have a violation against me, and I was totally helpless, knowing--and many hundreds of others have had this experience; I never had--that I could lose my license on the whims of one individual in the field. Now, it would not have been as critical for me. That is not how I make my living. But look at some people who do make their living that way. They could lose their license just because of one individual who did not like them. Bob Hoover is a good example. Bob Hoover, who I guess is in his nineties now, arguably was the most gifted pilot I can ever remember. He was the one, I say to the Presiding Officer, who would put a glass of water up on his dash and do a barrel roll and not spill the water. I have been with him when that happened. Well, one guy in the field did not like him for some reason, and they staged a violation. He could have and did lose his license. Now, I had to come to this body--and it took a year and a half--to pass a bill to allow Bob Hoover to get back in. That is an extreme example, but nonetheless, that happened. And that is what was happening to me. So anyway, we passed the Pilot's Bill of Rights. The main thing there and what we are trying to do is to extend to pilots the same protections under the law that other people have. We have heard the phrase many times: You are guilty until proven innocent. Well, in one area in our society that is true--it has historically been true--and that is for violations or alleged violations against pilots. So anyway, we passed this. We corrected some things that have not really come to fruition. For example, what is called a NOTAM is short for a notice to airmen. A NOTAM is something that has to be published. It is supposed to be published by the FAA if there is anything going on at an airport such as construction on a runway that would create a hazard. So the pilots have to look up the NOTAMs. The problem with this is, there are no guidelines as to where they can find a notice to airmen. So we corrected this, we thought, in the Pilot's Bill of Rights. However, it was not as good of a correction as we thought it would be. So now we are coming back with a Pilot's Bill of Rights 2. By the way, I have to tell you, Mr. President, I had 67 cosponsors out of 100 Senators. So this is something that was very popular and passed with overwhelming majorities. So what we are doing now with the Pilot's Bill of Rights 2 is about four things. First, the medical certification process is one that is kind of interesting because there is no uniformity. Someone can have a physical problem, a medical problem, and he might be in Chicago, IL, or he might be in Tampa, FL, and they will have a completely different interpretation by the medical examiner as to what should be the remedy of that person's problem. So this puts uniformity back in there. Then it does something--and this is going to be something that people who do not understand and are not listening to me right now might state that this would be something that could be a hazard or might be some kind of a danger--and that is, we passed in 2004, a rule creating a medical exemption for pilots of light ``sport pilot eligible'' aircraft. That is for airplanes that weigh under 1,230 pounds and only have 2 seats. There are about 34,000 of them around. It has been over 10 years since FAA issued this exemption, and since then the medical safety experience of these pilots has been identical to those with medical certificates, which begs the question of the value of this expensive and burdensome requirement for pilots who fly for recreation. A joint study was done by the Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association, the AOPA, and the Experimental Aircraft Association, the EAA, on the 46,976 aviation accidents that occurred from 2008 and 2012. Of those 46,976, only 99 had a medical cause as a factor. That is less than one- quarter of 1 percent of all accidents. And of those 99, none would have been prevented by the current third-class medical screening standards and the medical certification process. So it does not offer any protection. It does not serve any useful purpose. Now, we are proposing in the Pilot's Bill of Rights 2 to extend that medical exemption that is currently in place for light sport aircraft to include planes weighing up to 6,000 pounds with up to 6 total passengers, including the pilot. That would add airmen and aircraft to an existing FAA-approved medical standard without degrading or creating substandard safety. What I am saying here is that of all these almost 47,000 aviation accidents, only 99 had a medical cause, and of those 99, not one would have been prevented by the current third-class medical screening standards and the medical certification process. So this is just another burden on the public--not individuals, but specifically on pilots, and it does not accomplish anything. What we will do now is have consistency in the application of the medical certification process, and it is something that is overdue. It should not be a problem getting that bill passed, and yet it does need explanation. The second thing it does is extend the due process rights preserved in the original Pilot's Bill of Rights bill to all FAA certificate holders--not just those who are certificate holders who fly airplanes. There are others who are examiners and work in other fields. They should have the same benefits. What it does is--and this is kind of hard to explain--but if someone is accused of a violation, that individual has a process that has been in law prior to the Pilot's Bill of Rights; and that is, you go through and the FAA makes a judgment. Then you can appeal it to the NTSB. The NTSB historically has been a rubber stamp for the FAA. So it does not really qualify anything. What we did in the Pilot's Bill of Rights 1 is allow an individual then to go into the court system and get what they call a de novo. A de novo means they have a whole process that starts from scratch. They do not just take what the FAA says, the NTSB says, but the courts treat it as a new case and look at it. This has not been happening. So we put some teeth in that so [[Page S2290]] that will be something that will be workable. So I really feel we are going to be able to do this, and it is really getting the things done that we tried to do in the Pilot's Bill of Rights, but there have been some problems getting the courts to understand it. In fact, in two separate cases, the Federal district courts ruled that my original bill did not require a full rehearing of the facts. This legislation explicitly spells out the option to appeal an FAA enforcement action to the Federal district courts for a guaranteed de novo trial. But they have not been doing it. So this puts teeth in it so they are going to actually have to do it. By the way, there are things that are in there that people are not aware of. For example, in my case, I allegedly did something that was not in compliance with FAA rules and regulations, but they did not say what it was. They did not give the evidence. So you did not have access to your evidence. The new bill ensures that is going to happen. The third thing is on NOTAMs. A NOTAM is a notice to airmen. It is a pilot's responsibility--this has been true for decades--to know if a NOTAM has been filed by the FAA. That is a notice to airmen. But there is not any way of knowing where to find that. In my case, they claimed there was a NOTAM saying that the runway at Cameron County Airport was closed. That was a lie. There wasn't. There was no NOTAM out there. Finally, we proved that was the case. So now we are going to have it enforced so we know where these notices to airmen are filed, and it is going to be the responsibility of the FAA to put them in a central location where they would have access to them. This is something that was addressed in the Pilot's Bill of Rights, but somehow it was not specific enough. The teeth we put in this bill is that in the event they do not have it, the NOTAM is published where it can be found in a central location. Then the FAA cannot use that as an enforcement action. That will get the job done. The fourth thing it does is to extend the liability protection to individuals designated by the FAA as aviation medical examiners, pilot examiners, and this type of thing. What this does also is address what we call and most people would refer to as the Good Samaritan law. I have a lot of pilots--and I have been in the same situation--who want to help. They want to get a patient to a doctor in an emergency situation. I can remember one time many years ago when a tornado went through and destroyed the island of Dominica, north of Caracas, Venezuela. I got 12 pilots together with 12 of their airplanes, and they volunteered to take all the medical supplies down there. Now, if something had happened in the meantime, they would have had no protection. Yet out of the goodness of their hearts, at their own expense, they were out there trying to save lives. I was there. I know. So this actually is one that is going to give liability protection to individuals other than just the pilots--other people who own FAA certificates--and at the same time give protection to those people who are trying to help other people. So I believe this bill should be coming up in the next couple of weeks. It will be going to the commerce committee. I would encourage Members to--and particularly those 67 Members who were the cosponsors of the original Pilot's Bill of Rights should be on this one too. In fact, most of them are right now. I know Senators Manchin and Boozman were the first two to get on. They happen to be the chairmen of the General Aviation Caucus in the Senate. By the way, we have equal support over in the other body, in the House of Representatives. Last summer, at the EAA AirVenture Oshkosh fly-in convention--that is the largest fly-in convention anywhere in the world--I hosted a public forum to solicit input for the legislation we are having, the Pilot's Bill of Rights 2, and I received over 400 comments from individuals. These are people who were present at the Oshkosh event. So we have solicited their input, and we have all the organizations behind it. I would say, insofar as the one that might become controversial; that is, the exemption on a third-class medical--doctors have unanimously voted in favor of it--they are called the doctors in aviation--and others. This is one of these rare opportunities we have on a bipartisan basis to pass something that is going to offer legal protections to one class of people who currently don't have it and have not had it in the past. I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. HOEVEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. HOEVEN. Mr. President, I rise again to speak in support of the Justice for Victims of Trafficking Act. It is good legislation, drafted and introduced by the Senator from Texas, Mr. Cornyn, and also the Senator from Minnesota, Ms. Klobuchar. They originally put this bill together in the last Congress, and I was pleased to be a cosponsor of that bill. I am also very pleased to be an original cosponsor of the legislation they introduced earlier this year, the legislation we have on the floor now. This bill has many important, strong points. I am going to go through some--not all but a number of them. For example, it makes sure victims get restitution and witnesses get rewards for cooperating with law enforcement before others and encourages prosecutors to get training on restitution in human trafficking cases. It also gives law enforcement greater authority to seize the assets of convicted human traffickers, and it protects victims and witnesses by requiring human traffickers to be treated as violent criminals for purposes of pretrial release and detention pending judicial proceedings. It also ensures that Federal crime victims are informed of any plea bargain or deferred prosecution agreement in their case and clarifies that the ordinary standard of appellate review applies in cases concerning Federal crime victims' rights petitions. It recognizes that child pornography production is a form of human trafficking and ensures that victims have access to direct services at child advocacy centers to help them heal. It allows State and local human trafficking task forces to get wiretap warrants within their own State courts without Federal approval. That will help them to more effectively investigate crimes of child pornography, child sexual exploitation, and human trafficking. The bill also improves nationwide communications so law enforcement can better track and capture traffickers and child pornographers. It ensures regular reporting on the number of human trafficking crimes for purposes of the FBI Uniform Crime Reporting Program. It also requires law enforcement to upload photos of missing individuals into the National Criminal Information Center database and notify the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children of any child reported missing from foster care, and it strengthens current law to reduce demand for human trafficking by encouraging police, prosecutors, judges, and juries to target all persons involved in the buying and selling of human trafficking victims. It is just wrong to prosecute victims and fail to prosecute those who prey on them. This legislation will help for all of those reasons, but this legislation is also very important because it creates a fund from fines and penalties imposed on those who would engage in human trafficking. The fund is important because it not only compensates victims of human trafficking and other crimes of exploitation for their injuries, but it also provides resources to help law enforcement prevent such crimes in the future. As we work on this important issue, it is also very important that we understand that human trafficking is not just a big-State, big-city problem. Every State in the country is facing this issue, including my home State of North Dakota, but we currently have a challenge addressing this problem. After consulting with the North Dakota attorney general's office, we learned that North Dakota has been [[Page S2291]] discouraged from applying for antihuman trafficking grants, because in its application, the Department of Justice asks for at least 2 years of local data on human trafficking victims. North Dakota, in recent years, has been the fastest growing State in the country. So here we are, the fastest growing State both in terms of population and in terms of income growth. Consequently, more so than many States, only recently we have seen significant increases in human trafficking issues. So we don't have that 2 years' worth of data that DOJ requires, but we very much need assistance with addressing the problem of human trafficking. It is not unique to North Dakota. There are other States--typically fast-growing States, States that may have the same kind of energy development or other areas where they have seen a significant influx of people and are continuing to see a significant influx of people. This is a national issue. It is not specific just to my State but to any State where we have seen rapid growth, influx of money, influx of people from outside the State and where human trafficking is an issue. To remedy that, I have offered an amendment to the current legislation we have on the floor now, the Cornyn-Klobuchar bill, that clarifies that an eligibility entity with a worthy trafficking initiative, in an effort to combat trafficking in its jurisdiction, will not be disadvantaged in receiving funds under the Cornyn-Klobuchar bill because they, like North Dakota--be it a State or whatever--have only recently begun collecting data on human trafficking. So in cases where they don't have 2 years of data, as long as they can demonstrate a valid need and a valid solution to try to address this important issue and to reduce human trafficking, that is what will be required for the application, and not having 2 years of data will not be an issue in terms of scoring or an issue that DOJ would hold against that application for receipt of the funds for a worthy project. This is important to make sure that all across the country, in every State, we are addressing human trafficking. We all need to be united, in every State across this great country, working to combat human trafficking. That is why this amendment is very important. There are few issues that as a governing body we can be more united on than making sure we protect our children, that we prevent human trafficking in any form, and that we do it on a national basis in every State. That is what my amendment is all about. For this reason, I offer this amendment. I hope it will be included as part of the Cornyn-Klobuchar legislation, which, as I said earlier, I am only too pleased to cosponsor. The value and importance of this legislation is reflected in the broad coalition of victims' rights and law enforcement organizations that support it. It has been endorsed by nearly 200 groups, from the Fraternal Order of Police to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children. We need to pass this legislation. Crimes such as human trafficking and child pornography target the most vulnerable among us in a most despicable way. I urge all of my colleagues to pass this bill, to put an end to modern-day slavery, and to help victims get the support they need. Mr. President, I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. PORTMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Lankford). Without objection, it is so ordered. The Senator from Ohio. Mr. PORTMAN. Mr. President, I rise to express my appreciation that this afternoon the Senate is finally getting back to legislating on the important issue of human trafficking. It is critical we pass this legislation to combat one of the world's most heinous crimes and one that threatens thousands of innocent people every year. I am the cochair and cofounder of the human trafficking caucus. Our opportunity is not only to raise awareness of this issue but also to pass important legislation to address the problem. We learned that human trafficking is now a $32 billion worldwide industry, leaving it only second in size to the drug trade for criminal activity. Many view this as an international problem. They think, well, this happens somewhere else or on another continent, such as Africa or Asia. The fact is it happens right here. Of course, every country around the world has a responsibility to fight back against traffickers and stop their acts of violence. But while this industry has a global reach, the reality is that human trafficking is a major problem not only in my home State of Ohio, it is a problem in every State represented in the Senate. The Justice Department has told us that the average age of victims getting involved in trafficking is 12 to 14 years old. Think about that. These are children. These are kids. The number of American children at risk of sexual exploitation and human trafficking is estimated to be about 300,000. These children represent the most vulnerable among us, and we should make sure we are doing everything we possibly can to protect them. Every American life has value and every child deserves a chance to live a bright future. Today, however, we can take comfort in knowing we are fighting back against human traffickers and making it harder for their criminal activity to continue in a couple of different ways, both of which are very important. First, our legislation makes it easier to find some of these vulnerable children. Missing children are particularly vulnerable, and the legislation I am about to talk about enables us to find those children more quickly and helps to get them into a nurturing environment. Second, it will strengthen law enforcement's ability to find and punish those who are committing these crimes. We accomplished the first goal with the Bringing Missing Children Home Act. It is a bill that I authored with Senator Chuck Schumer of New York. We know there is a strong connection, unfortunately, between sex trafficking victims and children who have been in and out of the child welfare system. We also understand that kids who are missing or who have run away from home are the most vulnerable to trafficking, exploitation, and abuse. The FBI sting in 2014 recovered 168 sex trafficking victims, and nearly all of them had spent time in the child welfare or foster care system. While many of these children had been reported missing, the information obtained by authorities was not sufficient enough to be able to find them, and that is what this legislation gets at. The Bringing Missing Children Home Act will make it easier to find these children in two different ways. First, it amends the Missing Children's Assistance Act by replacing the term ``child prostitution'' with ``child sex trafficking.'' This reinforces the fact that children who are exploited are victims, not criminals. Secondly, the bill requires law enforcement agencies to update their records of missing children within 30 days of an initial report with additional information that could include medical or dental records or even a photograph. Having this new information, particularly a photograph, is incredibly important when searching for a missing child. I know this because this has been a big problem in my home State of Ohio. We started looking at this legislation and considering this bill on the floor on March 6. Since March 6, 60 children have been reported missing in my home State of Ohio. Yet we only have photographs for 14 of them. It is hard to find these children, and not having that information makes it even more difficult. Our legislation will help to get those photographs and will help ensure that all of us can play a role in helping to find these missing children. The bill also makes it easier for law enforcement officials on the State and local level to coordinate with child welfare services, and it allows missing persons units and State law enforcement agencies to modify and improve missing children's entries to include important information that was uncovered during an investigation. That is not currently the case. It just makes sense to be able to have better records. While we are making it easier to find trafficking victims, we will also make it easier to find and punish perpetrators of these crimes with legislation I have authored with Senator Dianne [[Page S2292]] Feinstein. It is called the Combat Human Trafficking Act and is part of this underlying bill we will also be considering here on the floor. This act focuses on those who commit these crimes. It increases the penalties for those who buy acts from sex trafficking victims. It requires new training by the Justice Department on targeting. It expands reporting on trafficking prosecutions and strengthens victims' rights. A lot of this comes out of what we have learned over the past decade since we have really taken up this issue at the Federal level. It improves Federal law to take into account the information we now know. Through better enforcement of laws against buyers, we will be able to reduce the demand for sexual exploitation and ensure that criminals are prosecuted to the full extent, preventing further trafficking crimes from ever happening. As the cochair of the Senate Caucus to End Human Trafficking, it has been a priority of mine to get this legislation passed in an effort to help victims of trafficking and to prevent the number of victims from increasing. I also hope we can add an amendment I authored entitled ``Ensuring a Better Response for Victims of Child Sex Trafficking.'' This amendment contains a piece of legislation I authored last year with Senator Wyden of Oregon called the Sex Trafficking Data and Response Act. It will help improve the information law enforcement officials have about the scope of the trafficking problem. This was signed into law last year, but there is additional information we would like to provide in terms of getting the response part of that bill passed. The bills I have spoken about are important steps to one day ending human trafficking and putting this horrible industry out of business altogether. Trafficking deserves no place in America. I thank Senator Chuck Schumer, Senator Dianne Feinstein, and others for their hard work on this legislation I have talked about. I would also like to express how grateful I am that Members of this Chamber were able to put partisanship behind us, politics aside, and reach common ground to move forward on this important issue. Ending human trafficking is clearly a bipartisan goal. It is a nonpartisan goal. It is something on which we should come together. The legislation we have before us today will make a profound impact on so many Americans, including some of the most vulnerable. I am happy to see we are a little closer to having these bills become law. I think they will become law once they pass this Chamber, go through the House, and are signed by the President. We still have a lot of work to do. This is just a start. After today, the fight to combat human trafficking will be far from over. Somewhere in America, there will still be children looking to be found, wondering if anybody cares, despite our legislation. Today's legislation will make it easier to find them, but it is still up to all of us. All of us have a role in helping to keep these children from going missing in the first place and then finding and providing them with a nurturing setting and a home where they are embraced and where they can be taken away from the stress of human trafficking and sex trafficking. There will always be traffickers looking to exploit the vulnerable. We know that. But today, if we pass this legislation, we will be sending a warning to those who commit these heinous crimes. As long as you are a perpetrator or an accomplice to human trafficking--folks will know that law enforcement is going to do what it takes to track them down and to punish them. I am glad we have been able to find common ground again and move a little closer to making these positive changes a reality. I am hopeful that we will be able to vote on this today and tomorrow, move this to the House, get it through to the President, and indeed begin to make a difference to my constituents in Ohio and around the country. With that, I yield back. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. COATS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Ayotte). Without objection, it is so ordered. Wasteful Spending Mr. COATS. Madam President, I am here today to identify yet another installment of the ``Waste of the Week.'' We have been doing this now for several weeks, trying to save taxpayers' dollars out of documented waste of their dollars when they send them to Washington. In recent weeks, I have highlighted examples of waste, some big some small. To date, we have documented over $47 billion of taxpayer funds that have gone to duplication of effort, simply gone to things the Federal Government never should have been involved in in the first place, examples of fraud, abuse--$47 billion and climbing on our tax savings gauge here which is approaching now $50 billion. Our goal is $100 billion. We are going to keep going as we discover each week yet another waste of taxpayer dollars. This week's ``Waste of the Week'' involves the Federal Employees' Compensation Act, also known as FECA. This law was enacted in 1916-- well intended, I think, to provide workers' compensation benefits to civilian Federal employees who sustained injuries while employed by the Federal Government and includes funds for vocational rehabilitation and medical benefits. As I said, it was well intended at the time, providing a lifeline for people injured on the job to keep these people afloat financially until they are ready to go back to work. ``Ready to go back to work'' has become somewhat of a major question in terms of how this 1916 law is applied, because you have to wonder, is someone 99 years old looking to go back to work. Well, in 1916, when this act was enacted, it treated them as if they were and are able to go back to work. Let me explain. Both the FECA compensation and medical benefits are payable for the duration of a person's inability to work, which can extend well into their individual golden years. You say: How does that all happen? But under current law, there is no maximum duration of benefits and no maximum age at which benefits must be terminated. Thus, when beneficiaries become eligible for Federal retirement or disability annuities, they are given the choice as to whether they want to remain in the FECA program or choose the Federal retirement program. Well, it is not much of a choice. The choice is obvious because given the level of benefits monthly, FECA benefits can be a much better deal than what they would be paid under retirement benefit plans. The FECA benefits are as high as 75 percent of the worker's predisability wage. The annual cost-of-living-adjustment is applied each year, the COLA, to the benefits. Someone came up with a pretty interesting idea here. FECA benefits are not taxed. So, clearly, this ends up being a much better deal for beneficiaries. But is it a better deal for taxpayers? That is the question. Let's take a closer look. This applies to all Federal agencies, but let's take one agency. The Department of Labor reports that approximately 45,000 cases currently receive long-term disability benefits under FECA, and 15,000 or one-third of these cases involve beneficiaries aged 66 or older. Clearly, it is time--actually it is past time--to reconsider and make reforms to the FECA. At a minimum, we should require workers, when they reach retirement age, to transition into the retirement plan as all their peers have had to do and not continue, throughout their lifetime, the much more generous benefits of FECA. As I said, the agency with the most FECA claims is the U.S. Postal Service. I want to use this as an example of how this is applied. The Postal Service Office of Inspector General told us that FECA rolls include 9,554 postal workers aged 55 or older eligible for retirement; 3,389 aged 65 and over; 928 aged 80 or older; and, yes, one postal worker at the age of 99. So in 2013 the U.S. Postal Service paid about $1.3 billion in workers' compensation claims and $67 million in administrative fees. In addition, as of June 30, 2014, the estimated workers' compensation liability totaled $17.8 billion. Now, while many of these benefits go to workers of a traditional working [[Page S2293]] age, the U.S. Postal Service estimates that these higher than retirement benefits are resulting in an extra $37.8 million being paid out annually. That comes to nearly $400 million over the next 10 years, and that is just from one agency, the U.S. Postal Service. Estimates as to the cost to the taxpayer when all of the Federal agencies are included show that more than $1 billion will be spent over the next 10 years in extra workers' compensation payments for those who would unlikely be working throughout the Federal workforce. As my colleague, Senator Susan Collins from Maine, has been highlighting for years, FECA has become a gold-plated retirement system tainted by unfairness, perverse incentives, and the potential for abuse and fraud. This program has become increasingly expensive and requires some commonsense reforms--reforms that many States have already implemented in their own workers' compensation programs. Remember, these payments are designed as a bridge to help injured workers until they are able to return to work. That is the most important phrase here--``return to work.'' This program was never intended to serve as a higher paying alternative to the Federal retirement system. Yet, under the law, it is used for that, and it has cost the taxpayers a significant amount of their tax dollars for unnecessary payments. Let's not ignore ways we can improve our fiscal health and return our Federal programs, at a minimum, to their original intent. It is time we look at this policy and restore integrity to the FECA, the Federal Employees' Compensation Act. Today, I am adding another $1 billion to the taxpayer savings gauge for this week's waste of the week, and I look forward to discussing ways we can eradicate this waste from our Federal budget so that we can give hard-earned dollars back to the taxpayers--money that simply is not used properly and is labeled, of course, a waste of their money. So we have increased--we are approaching $50 billion, and we are shooting up to $100 billion by the end of this year. I am hoping we can go significantly past that. The next step, of course, is to take what we have identified and make sure that the law is changed, that it is reformed, and that we can proudly say to the taxpayer that we are doing our part in Washington. While the larger issues of debt and deficit need to be addressed and must be addressed, if we cannot come to consensus on that, at least we can come to consensus on eliminating these egregious abuses of taxpayer dollars. I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Gardner). The clerk will call the roll. The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for up to 15 minutes as in morning business. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. CLIMATE CHANGE Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, as Americans celebrate the 35th Earth Day this week, I rise for the 96th time--I seem to be coinciding with the Presiding Officer's schedule so he has been treated to his share of these speeches--to urge this body to wake up to the threat of climate change. It is real, not a hoax. It is caused by carbon pollution, and it is already making changes that we are already seeing in the world around us. We must cut our carbon pollution to prevent even bigger climate changes--changes in our atmosphere, oceans, and human habitat-- potentially unprecedented in the history of our human habitation of this planet. Yet the polluters who are producing this problem would have us do nothing. They make money when we do nothing. So we do nothing. The polluters run a racket. They all float onto us the costs and damage from their fossil fuel product--the costs of heat waves, of sea level rise, of ocean acidification, of dying forests, and more. The polluters happily dump those costs onto everybody else. And to keep this profitable racket running, the polluters spend huge sums on lobbying and politics, particularly right here in the Congress. As one author has written, ``rivers of money flowing from secret sources have turned our elections into silent auctions.'' And the polluters get what they pay for. The Republican Party in Congress has become the political arm of the fossil fuel industry. The polluters also spend huge amounts on a big, complex PR machine to churn out doubt about the real science and cook up some paid-for science. Documents recently discovered by Greenpeace show that one scientist, whose work consistently downplayed the role of carbon pollution and climate change, received--get this--more than $1.2 million from oil and coal interests over the last decade. Those nice people at the Charles G. Koch Charitable Foundation gave him at least $230,000. In recent years, his grants came through Donors Trust, the front group that funnels money from oil, coal, and other special interests. Well, what do we know? We know that financial incentives affect people's behavior. Does anyone doubt that? That is life. That is why politicians have to disclose their political contributors, the gifts and benefits they receive, and even personal financial information. That is why regulatory agencies and scientific journals require scientific submissions to make plain who funded the work. That is why expert witnesses' funding sources are relevant in court proceedings. And that is why Upton Sinclair once said: ``It's difficult to get a man to understand something when his salary depends on his not understanding it.'' So we know that money talks. That is not news. What else do we know? Well, we also know about that industry playbook to keep safety regulation at bay by funding phony science and manufacturing doubt about legitimate science. That is not news, either. That has been around for years. The tobacco industry campaign to mislead the public about the health effects of cigarettes was so fraudulent it was determined in Federal court to be a racketeering enterprise. Think about that--an industry campaign of deception about the risks of their product that persisted for years and was ultimately determined in Federal court to have constituted a racketeering enterprise. Does it sound familiar? And tobacco is not alone. The lead paint industry shut down its trade association, the Lead Industry Association, rather than answer questions under oath in a court proceeding. Entire books have been written documenting this industry's strategy, for example, ``Merchants of Doubt,'' which has recently been made into a documentary, or ``Doubt is Their Product,'' or ``Lead Wars,'' or ``Deceit and Denial.'' So we know the strategy. Finally, we know something else. We know that a network of front organizations with innocent-sounding names has emerged to propagate the baloney science. This phenomenon has been well documented by Dr. Robert Brulle at Drexell University, among others. His follow-the-money analysis diagrams the complex flow of cash to these front groups that industry persistently tries to obscure. Well, here is what makes sense to me: If it is important enough for them to want to hide it, it is important enough for us to want to know about it. So Senators Boxer, Markey, and I sent a letter to about 100 companies, trade groups, and other organizations affiliated with the fossil fuel industry. We asked whether they spent money to support climate research. It sounds reasonable, based on those three things that we know. Well, oh, my, what a fit of caterwauling that drew from the rightwing PR machine. Today, I will give a recap of the outrage highlights. It is a ``witch hunt,'' said the far-right Heartland Institute, ``what fascists do.'' We are ``ethically challenged . . . mental midgets,'' said Heartland's president. He later called this little letter ``harassment . . . abuse of authority and misrepresentation of the facts.'' Heartland, by the way, is that classy group that put up a billboard comparing climate scientists to the Unabomber, just to give an idea of their credibility. Finally, ``[S]hame on you,'' read Heartland's response to our letter, which Heartland called a ``campaign to stigmatize and demonize.'' [[Page S2294]] The rightwing John Locke Foundation said our letter was ``trying to McCarthyite'' them. Rightwinger Hans von Spakovsky of the Heritage Foundation said it was ``an abuse of power.'' Investor's Business Daily got so excited they mixed up their metaphors to say we were both ``inquisitors'' and ``stalk[ers],'' out to ``intimidate'' and ``threatening peaceful citizens.'' They scoffed, ``as if it were any of [our] business'' to know if polluters are funding the science. Keeping that Spanish Inquisition theme going, the Washington Times called us ``climate change Torquemadas.'' So it looks as if we hit the full faux-outrage quadrifecta--witch hunts, fascism, McCarthyism, and even the Spanish Inquisition. But then they got really serious, and they unlimbered the ultimate rightwing malediction. We were accused by the Cato Institute of--cover your ears, young pages--having ``a widespread faith . . . in government's ability to solve problems.'' Well, Cato made its position on climate change clear, saying that for us ``to believe that man's emissions of carbon dioxide are warming the planet'' was a ``bias'' and that the legitimate science endorsed by everyone from NASA to the Department of Defense to every legitimate scientific society--every major legitimate scientific society in the country--all of that was ``propaganda,'' and that we, of course, were climate alarmists. Cato also sent us a letter in response to our inquiry, telling us we cannot ``use the awesome power of the federal government to cow'' Cato and others. Cow? According to the Wall Street Journal editorial page, which sadly has become a front for the fossil fuel industry, we were ``trying to silence'' the other side. Although, I have to confess, it is not clear how the other side would be silenced by simply having to reveal whose payroll they are on, which is all we asked. Let's be clear, our letter didn't suggest that industry scientists should be silenced--just that the public should know if those scientists are being paid by the very industries with a big economic stake in the issue. Let's test how much the rightwing front groups care about the suppression of scientific information. Let's look at their outrage over the reports of public employees in Florida being told--by the government no less--not to talk about climate change. Interviews by the Florida Center for Investigative Reporting with current and former employees, contractors, and volunteers at the Florida Department of Environmental Protection revealed that the administration of Republican Gov. Rick Scott issued an unwritten rule banning official use of the phrases ``climate change'' or ``global warming.'' Those reports have been corroborated by employees of other State agencies. We have heard stories of retribution against State employees who dare discuss climate change, of climate change-related projects being put on the back burner, and even of the term itself being edited out of official documents, including those produced by a university scientist. It sounds like suppression of science. Where was the outrage from the right? Where were the comparisons to fascism and McCarthyism and the Spanish Inquisition for this actual government- sponsored suppression of scientific information? Guess what. There was none. It is not just Florida. Recently, the Republican members of Wisconsin's Board of Commissioners of Public Lands voted to prohibit the professional staff ``from engaging in global warming or climate change work.'' The Wisconsin timber industry, as Senator Baldwin and I have both pointed out, sees the threat climate change poses to Wisconsin forests, including, among other things, the frozen winter roads that loggers use to move their equipment around that warmer weather melts and turns to impassable muck. But the Republicans in charge of those lands have simply ordered State officials to ignore climate change, suppressing the science--plain and simple. Where was the outrage from the rightwing groups that had fits about our little request for some transparency about what scientist is on whose payroll? Where was the outrage? There was none, which shows that the real issue has nothing to do with scientific freedom. The real issue here of freedom is the freedom of big, dishonest special interests to hide whose hand is in the puppet. Here is where it really gets ironic. The enormous multibillion dollar polluting industries whose front groups accuse us of bullying--of being fascists and intimidators and Torquemadas--over our little letter are the very ones pouring hundreds of millions of dollars into elections, much of it secretly, for the plainly avowed purpose of threatening and punishing elected officials who might dare to cross them and acknowledge the dangers of carbon-driven climate change--of all people to be complaining. Americans for Prosperity, to give one example, a Koch brothers venture, has said that Republicans who support any action on climate change will be put at a ``severe disadvantage'' in the 2016 elections. That is a serious threat, given the Koch brothers' pledge to spend $900 million in this election cycle. Yet that same Americans for Prosperity Foundation blasted our little letter as ``an attempt to silence those whose views do not meet with your approval.'' Please. Really? Against a $900 million campaign threat and a stable of paid-for scientists, against that massive screen of fossil fuel front organizations spouting industry propaganda, our little effort at getting a little transparency about who is funding the phony-baloney climate denial science--that is a raindrop against a torrent. We do indeed need to wake up. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan. Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, before my prepared comments, I do want to thank the Senator from Rhode Island for his passion and his leadership in coming to the floor over and over again, ringing the alarm bells about what is happening not only to our country but our world. We are paying the price in lives and in dollars. We are seeing our farmers pay the price because we have not effectively addressed what is happening to our world in terms of climate change. I want to thank the Senator for his continued passion in reminding us over and over again why we need to act right now. Selfridge Air National Guard Deployment Mr. President, today 350 airmen from Michigan, along with 12 A-10 Warthog aircraft, are deploying to the Middle East to take part in Operation Inherent Resolve, our Nation's mission to eliminate the terrorist group known as ISIL. This deployment has special significance for Michigan. Michigan is home to thousands of families and community leaders with loved ones living in the Middle East who have seen firsthand the devastating effect of ISIL as it brutally murders innocent people, drives them from their homes, and destabilizes the region. For so many families in Michigan, the fight against ISIL is deeply personal. Today, that fight is personal to many more families as these airmen from Selfridge Air National Guard Base deploy to the region. The A-10 Warthogs are the very best close air support aircraft in the U.S. military. Known as a tankbuster, the A-10 is ideal against ISIL, which uses tanks stolen from the Iraqi Army. We in Michigan are proud of our fleet. We are proud of our people, their courage, their passion, and their hard work. We are proud for all they have done to protect our Nation. In 2011, the 127th Wing at Selfridge deployed 300 airmen and one dozen A-10s to Kandahar Airfield, a NATO base in southern Afghanistan. Over 120 days, the unit logged over 8,000 flight hours in 2,000 flight missions in an extremely hostile environment. Today, I ask my colleagues in the Senate to keep these 350 airmen in your thoughts and prayers. We wish them Godspeed as they embark on this very important mission, and we remember especially their families and friends who will stay behind and support them with their prayers as well. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. (Mr. DAINES assumed the Chair.) Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Rounds). Without objection, it is so ordered. [[Page S2295]] Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that when the Senate resumes consideration of S. 178 on Wednesday, April 22, Senator Cornyn or his designee be recognized to withdraw the pending Cornyn amendment and offer amendments Nos. 1124 and 301. I further ask that there then be 1 hour of debate, equally divided in the usual form, and that following the use or yielding back of time, the Senate vote on the Leahy amendment No. 301, followed by a vote on amendment No. 1124, both with a 60-vote affirmative threshold for adoption. I further ask that if the Cornyn-Murray-Klobuchar amendment is agreed to, the time until 2 p.m. be equally divided in the usual form, and the Senate then vote on the following amendments in the order listed, with 2 minutes of debate equally divided before each vote: Cornyn No. 1127; Leahy No. 290; Brown No. 311; Burr No. 1121; and Kirk No. 273, as modified. I further ask that amendments in the preceding list each be subject to a 60-vote affirmative threshold for adoption, and that following disposition of these amendments, there then be 5 minutes equally divided in the usual form, followed by votes on the following amendments, which have been cleared by the managers and should be adopted by voice vote: Klobuchar No. 296; Hoeven No. 299, as modified; Sullivan No. 279; Wicker No. 1126; Flake No. 294; Cassidy No. 308; Portman No. 1128; Brown No. 310; Brown No. 312; Heller No. 1122; and Shaheen No. 303. I further ask that there be no second-degrees in order to any of the amendments listed and that following disposition of the Shaheen amendment, the committee-reported substitute, as amended, be agreed to, the bill, as amended, be read a third time, and the Senate proceed to a vote on passage. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? The Senator from Oregon. Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, would the majority leader consider at this time modifying his request to drop the Kirk amendment No. 273? The PRESIDING OFFICER. Will the majority leader so modify his request? The Senator from Texas. Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, as I understand, the distinguished Senator from Oregon is asking to amend the consent request. I would reserve the right to object to that request and make the simple point that the Kirk amendment targets online child exploitation and sex trafficking, which is rampant. Given the fact that the Internet is now one of the principal tools used, on Web sites such as backpage.com, thousands of American children and human trafficking victims are sold into slavery. It is simply unconscionable for us to stand by and allow this to continue. What Senator Kirk is asking for, which I support and believe we should do, is a simple up-or-down vote on the Kirk amendment. So I reserve the right to object and ask our colleague to allow this up-or- down vote on the Kirk amendment. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Will the majority leader so modify his request? Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, the answer is no, but I think the Senator from Oregon wishes to respond. Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, continuing my reservation, I don't take a backseat to anyone when it comes to fighting for the victims of sex trafficking. As the distinguished Senator from Texas knows, I was an original cosponsor of this legislation, and much of it is based on bills I have written and advocated on behalf of for years, including with the distinguished Senator from Texas. Much of this sex trafficking legislation, colleagues, is based on meetings and discussions I have had for years with young women who have been trafficked, law enforcement officials, and community leaders. I remember like it was yesterday how I was with the Portland police on 82nd Avenue in East Portland, and we encountered young women in their early teens who walked around with knives in their purses just hoping to survive the evening. The underlying legislation before us, in my view, is going to be a very valuable tool in helping women like those whom I saw in Southeast Portland. Unfortunately, an amendment that Senator Kirk seeks to offer has been attached to this request that undermines the legal foundation of every social media platform and attacks a basic cornerstone of Internet law. The Kirk amendment will undermine the fight to help victims by distracting the focus of prosecutors from the pimps and the Johns who prey on these young women. The vague language in the Kirk amendment would mean any Web site that hosts user-generated contact--that means any social media platform, any news sites with comments and classified sections and any e-commerce sites--could face felony charges based on a vague concept of knowing and a vague concept of advertising. Instead of focusing resources on going after pimps and traffickers, the Kirk amendment would enable prosecutors to go after Web sites millions of Americans use for nonnefarious purposes, chilling innovation. Under current law, prosecutors already have the ability to go after any entity that knowingly profits from sex trafficking. Every minute our prosecutors are occupied going after legitimate businesses, in my view, is time not spent locking up the real criminals. This amendment hurts America's innovative businesses and entrepreneurs and stifles free speech instead of getting tough on the sex traffickers whom Senator Cornyn and I have sought to target all these years. So I will close by simply saying I am for throwing the book at every sex trafficker and those who enable them. Our country absolutely must do everything we can to prevent the next child from falling victim to these predators. In my view, the Kirk amendment distracts from that goal. I hope it will not ultimately be added to this important piece of legislation. I hope Senators will vote no on the Kirk amendment. With that, Mr. President, I withdraw my reservation to the request. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there any objection to the request of the majority leader? Without objection, it is so ordered. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 58 (Tuesday, April 21, 2015)] [Senate] [Pages S2288-S2295] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] JUSTICE FOR VICTIMS OF TRAFFICKING ACT OF 2015--Continued The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma is recognized. Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I was not going to be talking right now, but I understand some of the people who are going to be reserving time are not yet here. [[Page S2289]] Pilot's Bill of Rights 2 Mr. President, I want to remind my colleagues on the floor that we have a piece of legislation that is coming up that no one is really plugged into right now, but it is going to be coming before us in a very short period of time. Back in 2011, I introduced a bill and passed a bill called the Pilot's Bill of Rights. It was something that was very meaningful to a relatively small number of people, but these are single-issue people, and it strove to correct a problem in our justice system that existed for as long as I could remember. Having been an active commercial pilot for the last over 50 years-- and there are not too many in the Senate; and in our delegation in Oklahoma, I was the only one until a couple years ago--it is only natural that I receive comments from a lot of people concerning problems they have with the FAA. There are a lot of great people in the FAA, and a lot of them I have worked with for many, many years. But there are also some--and this is true with any regulatory body, anyone who has authority over individuals. I remember back many years ago when I was the mayor of Tulsa. We had a great police force. But all it takes is two or three of them who are the bad guys. We are seeing some of that around today, and that gives a bad reputation to a lot of people. The same thing is true with some of the people who are working with the FAA. I can remember helping others, and I always did come to their aid when they felt they were not getting proper justice. But it really did not register with me until it actually happened to me. Back about 3 years ago, flying an airplane into a Texas airfield that is not a controlled airfield, there was an activity going on on the runway without any NOTAMs that had been advised--and nobody actually had any way of knowing this--and with permission I landed on that runway. This is a runway in far South Texas called the Cameron County Airport. It has a 9,000-foot runway. They were working on just a couple thousand feet of it, so it was very easy to come in. Now, because of certain individuals who had some other reasons to be critical of me, all kinds of things happened as a result of that. In fact, just recently they have even had some cartoons talking about how I landed on a runway and was chasing people off the runway. None of that was true. But this is what happened. They proposed to have a violation against me, and I was totally helpless, knowing--and many hundreds of others have had this experience; I never had--that I could lose my license on the whims of one individual in the field. Now, it would not have been as critical for me. That is not how I make my living. But look at some people who do make their living that way. They could lose their license just because of one individual who did not like them. Bob Hoover is a good example. Bob Hoover, who I guess is in his nineties now, arguably was the most gifted pilot I can ever remember. He was the one, I say to the Presiding Officer, who would put a glass of water up on his dash and do a barrel roll and not spill the water. I have been with him when that happened. Well, one guy in the field did not like him for some reason, and they staged a violation. He could have and did lose his license. Now, I had to come to this body--and it took a year and a half--to pass a bill to allow Bob Hoover to get back in. That is an extreme example, but nonetheless, that happened. And that is what was happening to me. So anyway, we passed the Pilot's Bill of Rights. The main thing there and what we are trying to do is to extend to pilots the same protections under the law that other people have. We have heard the phrase many times: You are guilty until proven innocent. Well, in one area in our society that is true--it has historically been true--and that is for violations or alleged violations against pilots. So anyway, we passed this. We corrected some things that have not really come to fruition. For example, what is called a NOTAM is short for a notice to airmen. A NOTAM is something that has to be published. It is supposed to be published by the FAA if there is anything going on at an airport such as construction on a runway that would create a hazard. So the pilots have to look up the NOTAMs. The problem with this is, there are no guidelines as to where they can find a notice to airmen. So we corrected this, we thought, in the Pilot's Bill of Rights. However, it was not as good of a correction as we thought it would be. So now we are coming back with a Pilot's Bill of Rights 2. By the way, I have to tell you, Mr. President, I had 67 cosponsors out of 100 Senators. So this is something that was very popular and passed with overwhelming majorities. So what we are doing now with the Pilot's Bill of Rights 2 is about four things. First, the medical certification process is one that is kind of interesting because there is no uniformity. Someone can have a physical problem, a medical problem, and he might be in Chicago, IL, or he might be in Tampa, FL, and they will have a completely different interpretation by the medical examiner as to what should be the remedy of that person's problem. So this puts uniformity back in there. Then it does something--and this is going to be something that people who do not understand and are not listening to me right now might state that this would be something that could be a hazard or might be some kind of a danger--and that is, we passed in 2004, a rule creating a medical exemption for pilots of light ``sport pilot eligible'' aircraft. That is for airplanes that weigh under 1,230 pounds and only have 2 seats. There are about 34,000 of them around. It has been over 10 years since FAA issued this exemption, and since then the medical safety experience of these pilots has been identical to those with medical certificates, which begs the question of the value of this expensive and burdensome requirement for pilots who fly for recreation. A joint study was done by the Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association, the AOPA, and the Experimental Aircraft Association, the EAA, on the 46,976 aviation accidents that occurred from 2008 and 2012. Of those 46,976, only 99 had a medical cause as a factor. That is less than one- quarter of 1 percent of all accidents. And of those 99, none would have been prevented by the current third-class medical screening standards and the medical certification process. So it does not offer any protection. It does not serve any useful purpose. Now, we are proposing in the Pilot's Bill of Rights 2 to extend that medical exemption that is currently in place for light sport aircraft to include planes weighing up to 6,000 pounds with up to 6 total passengers, including the pilot. That would add airmen and aircraft to an existing FAA-approved medical standard without degrading or creating substandard safety. What I am saying here is that of all these almost 47,000 aviation accidents, only 99 had a medical cause, and of those 99, not one would have been prevented by the current third-class medical screening standards and the medical certification process. So this is just another burden on the public--not individuals, but specifically on pilots, and it does not accomplish anything. What we will do now is have consistency in the application of the medical certification process, and it is something that is overdue. It should not be a problem getting that bill passed, and yet it does need explanation. The second thing it does is extend the due process rights preserved in the original Pilot's Bill of Rights bill to all FAA certificate holders--not just those who are certificate holders who fly airplanes. There are others who are examiners and work in other fields. They should have the same benefits. What it does is--and this is kind of hard to explain--but if someone is accused of a violation, that individual has a process that has been in law prior to the Pilot's Bill of Rights; and that is, you go through and the FAA makes a judgment. Then you can appeal it to the NTSB. The NTSB historically has been a rubber stamp for the FAA. So it does not really qualify anything. What we did in the Pilot's Bill of Rights 1 is allow an individual then to go into the court system and get what they call a de novo. A de novo means they have a whole process that starts from scratch. They do not just take what the FAA says, the NTSB says, but the courts treat it as a new case and look at it. This has not been happening. So we put some teeth in that so [[Page S2290]] that will be something that will be workable. So I really feel we are going to be able to do this, and it is really getting the things done that we tried to do in the Pilot's Bill of Rights, but there have been some problems getting the courts to understand it. In fact, in two separate cases, the Federal district courts ruled that my original bill did not require a full rehearing of the facts. This legislation explicitly spells out the option to appeal an FAA enforcement action to the Federal district courts for a guaranteed de novo trial. But they have not been doing it. So this puts teeth in it so they are going to actually have to do it. By the way, there are things that are in there that people are not aware of. For example, in my case, I allegedly did something that was not in compliance with FAA rules and regulations, but they did not say what it was. They did not give the evidence. So you did not have access to your evidence. The new bill ensures that is going to happen. The third thing is on NOTAMs. A NOTAM is a notice to airmen. It is a pilot's responsibility--this has been true for decades--to know if a NOTAM has been filed by the FAA. That is a notice to airmen. But there is not any way of knowing where to find that. In my case, they claimed there was a NOTAM saying that the runway at Cameron County Airport was closed. That was a lie. There wasn't. There was no NOTAM out there. Finally, we proved that was the case. So now we are going to have it enforced so we know where these notices to airmen are filed, and it is going to be the responsibility of the FAA to put them in a central location where they would have access to them. This is something that was addressed in the Pilot's Bill of Rights, but somehow it was not specific enough. The teeth we put in this bill is that in the event they do not have it, the NOTAM is published where it can be found in a central location. Then the FAA cannot use that as an enforcement action. That will get the job done. The fourth thing it does is to extend the liability protection to individuals designated by the FAA as aviation medical examiners, pilot examiners, and this type of thing. What this does also is address what we call and most people would refer to as the Good Samaritan law. I have a lot of pilots--and I have been in the same situation--who want to help. They want to get a patient to a doctor in an emergency situation. I can remember one time many years ago when a tornado went through and destroyed the island of Dominica, north of Caracas, Venezuela. I got 12 pilots together with 12 of their airplanes, and they volunteered to take all the medical supplies down there. Now, if something had happened in the meantime, they would have had no protection. Yet out of the goodness of their hearts, at their own expense, they were out there trying to save lives. I was there. I know. So this actually is one that is going to give liability protection to individuals other than just the pilots--other people who own FAA certificates--and at the same time give protection to those people who are trying to help other people. So I believe this bill should be coming up in the next couple of weeks. It will be going to the commerce committee. I would encourage Members to--and particularly those 67 Members who were the cosponsors of the original Pilot's Bill of Rights should be on this one too. In fact, most of them are right now. I know Senators Manchin and Boozman were the first two to get on. They happen to be the chairmen of the General Aviation Caucus in the Senate. By the way, we have equal support over in the other body, in the House of Representatives. Last summer, at the EAA AirVenture Oshkosh fly-in convention--that is the largest fly-in convention anywhere in the world--I hosted a public forum to solicit input for the legislation we are having, the Pilot's Bill of Rights 2, and I received over 400 comments from individuals. These are people who were present at the Oshkosh event. So we have solicited their input, and we have all the organizations behind it. I would say, insofar as the one that might become controversial; that is, the exemption on a third-class medical--doctors have unanimously voted in favor of it--they are called the doctors in aviation--and others. This is one of these rare opportunities we have on a bipartisan basis to pass something that is going to offer legal protections to one class of people who currently don't have it and have not had it in the past. I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. HOEVEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. HOEVEN. Mr. President, I rise again to speak in support of the Justice for Victims of Trafficking Act. It is good legislation, drafted and introduced by the Senator from Texas, Mr. Cornyn, and also the Senator from Minnesota, Ms. Klobuchar. They originally put this bill together in the last Congress, and I was pleased to be a cosponsor of that bill. I am also very pleased to be an original cosponsor of the legislation they introduced earlier this year, the legislation we have on the floor now. This bill has many important, strong points. I am going to go through some--not all but a number of them. For example, it makes sure victims get restitution and witnesses get rewards for cooperating with law enforcement before others and encourages prosecutors to get training on restitution in human trafficking cases. It also gives law enforcement greater authority to seize the assets of convicted human traffickers, and it protects victims and witnesses by requiring human traffickers to be treated as violent criminals for purposes of pretrial release and detention pending judicial proceedings. It also ensures that Federal crime victims are informed of any plea bargain or deferred prosecution agreement in their case and clarifies that the ordinary standard of appellate review applies in cases concerning Federal crime victims' rights petitions. It recognizes that child pornography production is a form of human trafficking and ensures that victims have access to direct services at child advocacy centers to help them heal. It allows State and local human trafficking task forces to get wiretap warrants within their own State courts without Federal approval. That will help them to more effectively investigate crimes of child pornography, child sexual exploitation, and human trafficking. The bill also improves nationwide communications so law enforcement can better track and capture traffickers and child pornographers. It ensures regular reporting on the number of human trafficking crimes for purposes of the FBI Uniform Crime Reporting Program. It also requires law enforcement to upload photos of missing individuals into the National Criminal Information Center database and notify the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children of any child reported missing from foster care, and it strengthens current law to reduce demand for human trafficking by encouraging police, prosecutors, judges, and juries to target all persons involved in the buying and selling of human trafficking victims. It is just wrong to prosecute victims and fail to prosecute those who prey on them. This legislation will help for all of those reasons, but this legislation is also very important because it creates a fund from fines and penalties imposed on those who would engage in human trafficking. The fund is important because it not only compensates victims of human trafficking and other crimes of exploitation for their injuries, but it also provides resources to help law enforcement prevent such crimes in the future. As we work on this important issue, it is also very important that we understand that human trafficking is not just a big-State, big-city problem. Every State in the country is facing this issue, including my home State of North Dakota, but we currently have a challenge addressing this problem. After consulting with the North Dakota attorney general's office, we learned that North Dakota has been [[Page S2291]] discouraged from applying for antihuman trafficking grants, because in its application, the Department of Justice asks for at least 2 years of local data on human trafficking victims. North Dakota, in recent years, has been the fastest growing State in the country. So here we are, the fastest growing State both in terms of population and in terms of income growth. Consequently, more so than many States, only recently we have seen significant increases in human trafficking issues. So we don't have that 2 years' worth of data that DOJ requires, but we very much need assistance with addressing the problem of human trafficking. It is not unique to North Dakota. There are other States--typically fast-growing States, States that may have the same kind of energy development or other areas where they have seen a significant influx of people and are continuing to see a significant influx of people. This is a national issue. It is not specific just to my State but to any State where we have seen rapid growth, influx of money, influx of people from outside the State and where human trafficking is an issue. To remedy that, I have offered an amendment to the current legislation we have on the floor now, the Cornyn-Klobuchar bill, that clarifies that an eligibility entity with a worthy trafficking initiative, in an effort to combat trafficking in its jurisdiction, will not be disadvantaged in receiving funds under the Cornyn-Klobuchar bill because they, like North Dakota--be it a State or whatever--have only recently begun collecting data on human trafficking. So in cases where they don't have 2 years of data, as long as they can demonstrate a valid need and a valid solution to try to address this important issue and to reduce human trafficking, that is what will be required for the application, and not having 2 years of data will not be an issue in terms of scoring or an issue that DOJ would hold against that application for receipt of the funds for a worthy project. This is important to make sure that all across the country, in every State, we are addressing human trafficking. We all need to be united, in every State across this great country, working to combat human trafficking. That is why this amendment is very important. There are few issues that as a governing body we can be more united on than making sure we protect our children, that we prevent human trafficking in any form, and that we do it on a national basis in every State. That is what my amendment is all about. For this reason, I offer this amendment. I hope it will be included as part of the Cornyn-Klobuchar legislation, which, as I said earlier, I am only too pleased to cosponsor. The value and importance of this legislation is reflected in the broad coalition of victims' rights and law enforcement organizations that support it. It has been endorsed by nearly 200 groups, from the Fraternal Order of Police to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children. We need to pass this legislation. Crimes such as human trafficking and child pornography target the most vulnerable among us in a most despicable way. I urge all of my colleagues to pass this bill, to put an end to modern-day slavery, and to help victims get the support they need. Mr. President, I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. PORTMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Lankford). Without objection, it is so ordered. The Senator from Ohio. Mr. PORTMAN. Mr. President, I rise to express my appreciation that this afternoon the Senate is finally getting back to legislating on the important issue of human trafficking. It is critical we pass this legislation to combat one of the world's most heinous crimes and one that threatens thousands of innocent people every year. I am the cochair and cofounder of the human trafficking caucus. Our opportunity is not only to raise awareness of this issue but also to pass important legislation to address the problem. We learned that human trafficking is now a $32 billion worldwide industry, leaving it only second in size to the drug trade for criminal activity. Many view this as an international problem. They think, well, this happens somewhere else or on another continent, such as Africa or Asia. The fact is it happens right here. Of course, every country around the world has a responsibility to fight back against traffickers and stop their acts of violence. But while this industry has a global reach, the reality is that human trafficking is a major problem not only in my home State of Ohio, it is a problem in every State represented in the Senate. The Justice Department has told us that the average age of victims getting involved in trafficking is 12 to 14 years old. Think about that. These are children. These are kids. The number of American children at risk of sexual exploitation and human trafficking is estimated to be about 300,000. These children represent the most vulnerable among us, and we should make sure we are doing everything we possibly can to protect them. Every American life has value and every child deserves a chance to live a bright future. Today, however, we can take comfort in knowing we are fighting back against human traffickers and making it harder for their criminal activity to continue in a couple of different ways, both of which are very important. First, our legislation makes it easier to find some of these vulnerable children. Missing children are particularly vulnerable, and the legislation I am about to talk about enables us to find those children more quickly and helps to get them into a nurturing environment. Second, it will strengthen law enforcement's ability to find and punish those who are committing these crimes. We accomplished the first goal with the Bringing Missing Children Home Act. It is a bill that I authored with Senator Chuck Schumer of New York. We know there is a strong connection, unfortunately, between sex trafficking victims and children who have been in and out of the child welfare system. We also understand that kids who are missing or who have run away from home are the most vulnerable to trafficking, exploitation, and abuse. The FBI sting in 2014 recovered 168 sex trafficking victims, and nearly all of them had spent time in the child welfare or foster care system. While many of these children had been reported missing, the information obtained by authorities was not sufficient enough to be able to find them, and that is what this legislation gets at. The Bringing Missing Children Home Act will make it easier to find these children in two different ways. First, it amends the Missing Children's Assistance Act by replacing the term ``child prostitution'' with ``child sex trafficking.'' This reinforces the fact that children who are exploited are victims, not criminals. Secondly, the bill requires law enforcement agencies to update their records of missing children within 30 days of an initial report with additional information that could include medical or dental records or even a photograph. Having this new information, particularly a photograph, is incredibly important when searching for a missing child. I know this because this has been a big problem in my home State of Ohio. We started looking at this legislation and considering this bill on the floor on March 6. Since March 6, 60 children have been reported missing in my home State of Ohio. Yet we only have photographs for 14 of them. It is hard to find these children, and not having that information makes it even more difficult. Our legislation will help to get those photographs and will help ensure that all of us can play a role in helping to find these missing children. The bill also makes it easier for law enforcement officials on the State and local level to coordinate with child welfare services, and it allows missing persons units and State law enforcement agencies to modify and improve missing children's entries to include important information that was uncovered during an investigation. That is not currently the case. It just makes sense to be able to have better records. While we are making it easier to find trafficking victims, we will also make it easier to find and punish perpetrators of these crimes with legislation I have authored with Senator Dianne [[Page S2292]] Feinstein. It is called the Combat Human Trafficking Act and is part of this underlying bill we will also be considering here on the floor. This act focuses on those who commit these crimes. It increases the penalties for those who buy acts from sex trafficking victims. It requires new training by the Justice Department on targeting. It expands reporting on trafficking prosecutions and strengthens victims' rights. A lot of this comes out of what we have learned over the past decade since we have really taken up this issue at the Federal level. It improves Federal law to take into account the information we now know. Through better enforcement of laws against buyers, we will be able to reduce the demand for sexual exploitation and ensure that criminals are prosecuted to the full extent, preventing further trafficking crimes from ever happening. As the cochair of the Senate Caucus to End Human Trafficking, it has been a priority of mine to get this legislation passed in an effort to help victims of trafficking and to prevent the number of victims from increasing. I also hope we can add an amendment I authored entitled ``Ensuring a Better Response for Victims of Child Sex Trafficking.'' This amendment contains a piece of legislation I authored last year with Senator Wyden of Oregon called the Sex Trafficking Data and Response Act. It will help improve the information law enforcement officials have about the scope of the trafficking problem. This was signed into law last year, but there is additional information we would like to provide in terms of getting the response part of that bill passed. The bills I have spoken about are important steps to one day ending human trafficking and putting this horrible industry out of business altogether. Trafficking deserves no place in America. I thank Senator Chuck Schumer, Senator Dianne Feinstein, and others for their hard work on this legislation I have talked about. I would also like to express how grateful I am that Members of this Chamber were able to put partisanship behind us, politics aside, and reach common ground to move forward on this important issue. Ending human trafficking is clearly a bipartisan goal. It is a nonpartisan goal. It is something on which we should come together. The legislation we have before us today will make a profound impact on so many Americans, including some of the most vulnerable. I am happy to see we are a little closer to having these bills become law. I think they will become law once they pass this Chamber, go through the House, and are signed by the President. We still have a lot of work to do. This is just a start. After today, the fight to combat human trafficking will be far from over. Somewhere in America, there will still be children looking to be found, wondering if anybody cares, despite our legislation. Today's legislation will make it easier to find them, but it is still up to all of us. All of us have a role in helping to keep these children from going missing in the first place and then finding and providing them with a nurturing setting and a home where they are embraced and where they can be taken away from the stress of human trafficking and sex trafficking. There will always be traffickers looking to exploit the vulnerable. We know that. But today, if we pass this legislation, we will be sending a warning to those who commit these heinous crimes. As long as you are a perpetrator or an accomplice to human trafficking--folks will know that law enforcement is going to do what it takes to track them down and to punish them. I am glad we have been able to find common ground again and move a little closer to making these positive changes a reality. I am hopeful that we will be able to vote on this today and tomorrow, move this to the House, get it through to the President, and indeed begin to make a difference to my constituents in Ohio and around the country. With that, I yield back. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. COATS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Ayotte). Without objection, it is so ordered. Wasteful Spending Mr. COATS. Madam President, I am here today to identify yet another installment of the ``Waste of the Week.'' We have been doing this now for several weeks, trying to save taxpayers' dollars out of documented waste of their dollars when they send them to Washington. In recent weeks, I have highlighted examples of waste, some big some small. To date, we have documented over $47 billion of taxpayer funds that have gone to duplication of effort, simply gone to things the Federal Government never should have been involved in in the first place, examples of fraud, abuse--$47 billion and climbing on our tax savings gauge here which is approaching now $50 billion. Our goal is $100 billion. We are going to keep going as we discover each week yet another waste of taxpayer dollars. This week's ``Waste of the Week'' involves the Federal Employees' Compensation Act, also known as FECA. This law was enacted in 1916-- well intended, I think, to provide workers' compensation benefits to civilian Federal employees who sustained injuries while employed by the Federal Government and includes funds for vocational rehabilitation and medical benefits. As I said, it was well intended at the time, providing a lifeline for people injured on the job to keep these people afloat financially until they are ready to go back to work. ``Ready to go back to work'' has become somewhat of a major question in terms of how this 1916 law is applied, because you have to wonder, is someone 99 years old looking to go back to work. Well, in 1916, when this act was enacted, it treated them as if they were and are able to go back to work. Let me explain. Both the FECA compensation and medical benefits are payable for the duration of a person's inability to work, which can extend well into their individual golden years. You say: How does that all happen? But under current law, there is no maximum duration of benefits and no maximum age at which benefits must be terminated. Thus, when beneficiaries become eligible for Federal retirement or disability annuities, they are given the choice as to whether they want to remain in the FECA program or choose the Federal retirement program. Well, it is not much of a choice. The choice is obvious because given the level of benefits monthly, FECA benefits can be a much better deal than what they would be paid under retirement benefit plans. The FECA benefits are as high as 75 percent of the worker's predisability wage. The annual cost-of-living-adjustment is applied each year, the COLA, to the benefits. Someone came up with a pretty interesting idea here. FECA benefits are not taxed. So, clearly, this ends up being a much better deal for beneficiaries. But is it a better deal for taxpayers? That is the question. Let's take a closer look. This applies to all Federal agencies, but let's take one agency. The Department of Labor reports that approximately 45,000 cases currently receive long-term disability benefits under FECA, and 15,000 or one-third of these cases involve beneficiaries aged 66 or older. Clearly, it is time--actually it is past time--to reconsider and make reforms to the FECA. At a minimum, we should require workers, when they reach retirement age, to transition into the retirement plan as all their peers have had to do and not continue, throughout their lifetime, the much more generous benefits of FECA. As I said, the agency with the most FECA claims is the U.S. Postal Service. I want to use this as an example of how this is applied. The Postal Service Office of Inspector General told us that FECA rolls include 9,554 postal workers aged 55 or older eligible for retirement; 3,389 aged 65 and over; 928 aged 80 or older; and, yes, one postal worker at the age of 99. So in 2013 the U.S. Postal Service paid about $1.3 billion in workers' compensation claims and $67 million in administrative fees. In addition, as of June 30, 2014, the estimated workers' compensation liability totaled $17.8 billion. Now, while many of these benefits go to workers of a traditional working [[Page S2293]] age, the U.S. Postal Service estimates that these higher than retirement benefits are resulting in an extra $37.8 million being paid out annually. That comes to nearly $400 million over the next 10 years, and that is just from one agency, the U.S. Postal Service. Estimates as to the cost to the taxpayer when all of the Federal agencies are included show that more than $1 billion will be spent over the next 10 years in extra workers' compensation payments for those who would unlikely be working throughout the Federal workforce. As my colleague, Senator Susan Collins from Maine, has been highlighting for years, FECA has become a gold-plated retirement system tainted by unfairness, perverse incentives, and the potential for abuse and fraud. This program has become increasingly expensive and requires some commonsense reforms--reforms that many States have already implemented in their own workers' compensation programs. Remember, these payments are designed as a bridge to help injured workers until they are able to return to work. That is the most important phrase here--``return to work.'' This program was never intended to serve as a higher paying alternative to the Federal retirement system. Yet, under the law, it is used for that, and it has cost the taxpayers a significant amount of their tax dollars for unnecessary payments. Let's not ignore ways we can improve our fiscal health and return our Federal programs, at a minimum, to their original intent. It is time we look at this policy and restore integrity to the FECA, the Federal Employees' Compensation Act. Today, I am adding another $1 billion to the taxpayer savings gauge for this week's waste of the week, and I look forward to discussing ways we can eradicate this waste from our Federal budget so that we can give hard-earned dollars back to the taxpayers--money that simply is not used properly and is labeled, of course, a waste of their money. So we have increased--we are approaching $50 billion, and we are shooting up to $100 billion by the end of this year. I am hoping we can go significantly past that. The next step, of course, is to take what we have identified and make sure that the law is changed, that it is reformed, and that we can proudly say to the taxpayer that we are doing our part in Washington. While the larger issues of debt and deficit need to be addressed and must be addressed, if we cannot come to consensus on that, at least we can come to consensus on eliminating these egregious abuses of taxpayer dollars. I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Gardner). The clerk will call the roll. The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for up to 15 minutes as in morning business. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. CLIMATE CHANGE Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, as Americans celebrate the 35th Earth Day this week, I rise for the 96th time--I seem to be coinciding with the Presiding Officer's schedule so he has been treated to his share of these speeches--to urge this body to wake up to the threat of climate change. It is real, not a hoax. It is caused by carbon pollution, and it is already making changes that we are already seeing in the world around us. We must cut our carbon pollution to prevent even bigger climate changes--changes in our atmosphere, oceans, and human habitat-- potentially unprecedented in the history of our human habitation of this planet. Yet the polluters who are producing this problem would have us do nothing. They make money when we do nothing. So we do nothing. The polluters run a racket. They all float onto us the costs and damage from their fossil fuel product--the costs of heat waves, of sea level rise, of ocean acidification, of dying forests, and more. The polluters happily dump those costs onto everybody else. And to keep this profitable racket running, the polluters spend huge sums on lobbying and politics, particularly right here in the Congress. As one author has written, ``rivers of money flowing from secret sources have turned our elections into silent auctions.'' And the polluters get what they pay for. The Republican Party in Congress has become the political arm of the fossil fuel industry. The polluters also spend huge amounts on a big, complex PR machine to churn out doubt about the real science and cook up some paid-for science. Documents recently discovered by Greenpeace show that one scientist, whose work consistently downplayed the role of carbon pollution and climate change, received--get this--more than $1.2 million from oil and coal interests over the last decade. Those nice people at the Charles G. Koch Charitable Foundation gave him at least $230,000. In recent years, his grants came through Donors Trust, the front group that funnels money from oil, coal, and other special interests. Well, what do we know? We know that financial incentives affect people's behavior. Does anyone doubt that? That is life. That is why politicians have to disclose their political contributors, the gifts and benefits they receive, and even personal financial information. That is why regulatory agencies and scientific journals require scientific submissions to make plain who funded the work. That is why expert witnesses' funding sources are relevant in court proceedings. And that is why Upton Sinclair once said: ``It's difficult to get a man to understand something when his salary depends on his not understanding it.'' So we know that money talks. That is not news. What else do we know? Well, we also know about that industry playbook to keep safety regulation at bay by funding phony science and manufacturing doubt about legitimate science. That is not news, either. That has been around for years. The tobacco industry campaign to mislead the public about the health effects of cigarettes was so fraudulent it was determined in Federal court to be a racketeering enterprise. Think about that--an industry campaign of deception about the risks of their product that persisted for years and was ultimately determined in Federal court to have constituted a racketeering enterprise. Does it sound familiar? And tobacco is not alone. The lead paint industry shut down its trade association, the Lead Industry Association, rather than answer questions under oath in a court proceeding. Entire books have been written documenting this industry's strategy, for example, ``Merchants of Doubt,'' which has recently been made into a documentary, or ``Doubt is Their Product,'' or ``Lead Wars,'' or ``Deceit and Denial.'' So we know the strategy. Finally, we know something else. We know that a network of front organizations with innocent-sounding names has emerged to propagate the baloney science. This phenomenon has been well documented by Dr. Robert Brulle at Drexell University, among others. His follow-the-money analysis diagrams the complex flow of cash to these front groups that industry persistently tries to obscure. Well, here is what makes sense to me: If it is important enough for them to want to hide it, it is important enough for us to want to know about it. So Senators Boxer, Markey, and I sent a letter to about 100 companies, trade groups, and other organizations affiliated with the fossil fuel industry. We asked whether they spent money to support climate research. It sounds reasonable, based on those three things that we know. Well, oh, my, what a fit of caterwauling that drew from the rightwing PR machine. Today, I will give a recap of the outrage highlights. It is a ``witch hunt,'' said the far-right Heartland Institute, ``what fascists do.'' We are ``ethically challenged . . . mental midgets,'' said Heartland's president. He later called this little letter ``harassment . . . abuse of authority and misrepresentation of the facts.'' Heartland, by the way, is that classy group that put up a billboard comparing climate scientists to the Unabomber, just to give an idea of their credibility. Finally, ``[S]hame on you,'' read Heartland's response to our letter, which Heartland called a ``campaign to stigmatize and demonize.'' [[Page S2294]] The rightwing John Locke Foundation said our letter was ``trying to McCarthyite'' them. Rightwinger Hans von Spakovsky of the Heritage Foundation said it was ``an abuse of power.'' Investor's Business Daily got so excited they mixed up their metaphors to say we were both ``inquisitors'' and ``stalk[ers],'' out to ``intimidate'' and ``threatening peaceful citizens.'' They scoffed, ``as if it were any of [our] business'' to know if polluters are funding the science. Keeping that Spanish Inquisition theme going, the Washington Times called us ``climate change Torquemadas.'' So it looks as if we hit the full faux-outrage quadrifecta--witch hunts, fascism, McCarthyism, and even the Spanish Inquisition. But then they got really serious, and they unlimbered the ultimate rightwing malediction. We were accused by the Cato Institute of--cover your ears, young pages--having ``a widespread faith . . . in government's ability to solve problems.'' Well, Cato made its position on climate change clear, saying that for us ``to believe that man's emissions of carbon dioxide are warming the planet'' was a ``bias'' and that the legitimate science endorsed by everyone from NASA to the Department of Defense to every legitimate scientific society--every major legitimate scientific society in the country--all of that was ``propaganda,'' and that we, of course, were climate alarmists. Cato also sent us a letter in response to our inquiry, telling us we cannot ``use the awesome power of the federal government to cow'' Cato and others. Cow? According to the Wall Street Journal editorial page, which sadly has become a front for the fossil fuel industry, we were ``trying to silence'' the other side. Although, I have to confess, it is not clear how the other side would be silenced by simply having to reveal whose payroll they are on, which is all we asked. Let's be clear, our letter didn't suggest that industry scientists should be silenced--just that the public should know if those scientists are being paid by the very industries with a big economic stake in the issue. Let's test how much the rightwing front groups care about the suppression of scientific information. Let's look at their outrage over the reports of public employees in Florida being told--by the government no less--not to talk about climate change. Interviews by the Florida Center for Investigative Reporting with current and former employees, contractors, and volunteers at the Florida Department of Environmental Protection revealed that the administration of Republican Gov. Rick Scott issued an unwritten rule banning official use of the phrases ``climate change'' or ``global warming.'' Those reports have been corroborated by employees of other State agencies. We have heard stories of retribution against State employees who dare discuss climate change, of climate change-related projects being put on the back burner, and even of the term itself being edited out of official documents, including those produced by a university scientist. It sounds like suppression of science. Where was the outrage from the right? Where were the comparisons to fascism and McCarthyism and the Spanish Inquisition for this actual government- sponsored suppression of scientific information? Guess what. There was none. It is not just Florida. Recently, the Republican members of Wisconsin's Board of Commissioners of Public Lands voted to prohibit the professional staff ``from engaging in global warming or climate change work.'' The Wisconsin timber industry, as Senator Baldwin and I have both pointed out, sees the threat climate change poses to Wisconsin forests, including, among other things, the frozen winter roads that loggers use to move their equipment around that warmer weather melts and turns to impassable muck. But the Republicans in charge of those lands have simply ordered State officials to ignore climate change, suppressing the science--plain and simple. Where was the outrage from the rightwing groups that had fits about our little request for some transparency about what scientist is on whose payroll? Where was the outrage? There was none, which shows that the real issue has nothing to do with scientific freedom. The real issue here of freedom is the freedom of big, dishonest special interests to hide whose hand is in the puppet. Here is where it really gets ironic. The enormous multibillion dollar polluting industries whose front groups accuse us of bullying--of being fascists and intimidators and Torquemadas--over our little letter are the very ones pouring hundreds of millions of dollars into elections, much of it secretly, for the plainly avowed purpose of threatening and punishing elected officials who might dare to cross them and acknowledge the dangers of carbon-driven climate change--of all people to be complaining. Americans for Prosperity, to give one example, a Koch brothers venture, has said that Republicans who support any action on climate change will be put at a ``severe disadvantage'' in the 2016 elections. That is a serious threat, given the Koch brothers' pledge to spend $900 million in this election cycle. Yet that same Americans for Prosperity Foundation blasted our little letter as ``an attempt to silence those whose views do not meet with your approval.'' Please. Really? Against a $900 million campaign threat and a stable of paid-for scientists, against that massive screen of fossil fuel front organizations spouting industry propaganda, our little effort at getting a little transparency about who is funding the phony-baloney climate denial science--that is a raindrop against a torrent. We do indeed need to wake up. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan. Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, before my prepared comments, I do want to thank the Senator from Rhode Island for his passion and his leadership in coming to the floor over and over again, ringing the alarm bells about what is happening not only to our country but our world. We are paying the price in lives and in dollars. We are seeing our farmers pay the price because we have not effectively addressed what is happening to our world in terms of climate change. I want to thank the Senator for his continued passion in reminding us over and over again why we need to act right now. Selfridge Air National Guard Deployment Mr. President, today 350 airmen from Michigan, along with 12 A-10 Warthog aircraft, are deploying to the Middle East to take part in Operation Inherent Resolve, our Nation's mission to eliminate the terrorist group known as ISIL. This deployment has special significance for Michigan. Michigan is home to thousands of families and community leaders with loved ones living in the Middle East who have seen firsthand the devastating effect of ISIL as it brutally murders innocent people, drives them from their homes, and destabilizes the region. For so many families in Michigan, the fight against ISIL is deeply personal. Today, that fight is personal to many more families as these airmen from Selfridge Air National Guard Base deploy to the region. The A-10 Warthogs are the very best close air support aircraft in the U.S. military. Known as a tankbuster, the A-10 is ideal against ISIL, which uses tanks stolen from the Iraqi Army. We in Michigan are proud of our fleet. We are proud of our people, their courage, their passion, and their hard work. We are proud for all they have done to protect our Nation. In 2011, the 127th Wing at Selfridge deployed 300 airmen and one dozen A-10s to Kandahar Airfield, a NATO base in southern Afghanistan. Over 120 days, the unit logged over 8,000 flight hours in 2,000 flight missions in an extremely hostile environment. Today, I ask my colleagues in the Senate to keep these 350 airmen in your thoughts and prayers. We wish them Godspeed as they embark on this very important mission, and we remember especially their families and friends who will stay behind and support them with their prayers as well. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. (Mr. DAINES assumed the Chair.) Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Rounds). Without objection, it is so ordered. [[Page S2295]] Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that when the Senate resumes consideration of S. 178 on Wednesday, April 22, Senator Cornyn or his designee be recognized to withdraw the pending Cornyn amendment and offer amendments Nos. 1124 and 301. I further ask that there then be 1 hour of debate, equally divided in the usual form, and that following the use or yielding back of time, the Senate vote on the Leahy amendment No. 301, followed by a vote on amendment No. 1124, both with a 60-vote affirmative threshold for adoption. I further ask that if the Cornyn-Murray-Klobuchar amendment is agreed to, the time until 2 p.m. be equally divided in the usual form, and the Senate then vote on the following amendments in the order listed, with 2 minutes of debate equally divided before each vote: Cornyn No. 1127; Leahy No. 290; Brown No. 311; Burr No. 1121; and Kirk No. 273, as modified. I further ask that amendments in the preceding list each be subject to a 60-vote affirmative threshold for adoption, and that following disposition of these amendments, there then be 5 minutes equally divided in the usual form, followed by votes on the following amendments, which have been cleared by the managers and should be adopted by voice vote: Klobuchar No. 296; Hoeven No. 299, as modified; Sullivan No. 279; Wicker No. 1126; Flake No. 294; Cassidy No. 308; Portman No. 1128; Brown No. 310; Brown No. 312; Heller No. 1122; and Shaheen No. 303. I further ask that there be no second-degrees in order to any of the amendments listed and that following disposition of the Shaheen amendment, the committee-reported substitute, as amended, be agreed to, the bill, as amended, be read a third time, and the Senate proceed to a vote on passage. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? The Senator from Oregon. Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, would the majority leader consider at this time modifying his request to drop the Kirk amendment No. 273? The PRESIDING OFFICER. Will the majority leader so modify his request? The Senator from Texas. Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, as I understand, the distinguished Senator from Oregon is asking to amend the consent request. I would reserve the right to object to that request and make the simple point that the Kirk amendment targets online child exploitation and sex trafficking, which is rampant. Given the fact that the Internet is now one of the principal tools used, on Web sites such as backpage.com, thousands of American children and human trafficking victims are sold into slavery. It is simply unconscionable for us to stand by and allow this to continue. What Senator Kirk is asking for, which I support and believe we should do, is a simple up-or-down vote on the Kirk amendment. So I reserve the right to object and ask our colleague to allow this up-or- down vote on the Kirk amendment. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Will the majority leader so modify his request? Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, the answer is no, but I think the Senator from Oregon wishes to respond. Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, continuing my reservation, I don't take a backseat to anyone when it comes to fighting for the victims of sex trafficking. As the distinguished Senator from Texas knows, I was an original cosponsor of this legislation, and much of it is based on bills I have written and advocated on behalf of for years, including with the distinguished Senator from Texas. Much of this sex trafficking legislation, colleagues, is based on meetings and discussions I have had for years with young women who have been trafficked, law enforcement officials, and community leaders. I remember like it was yesterday how I was with the Portland police on 82nd Avenue in East Portland, and we encountered young women in their early teens who walked around with knives in their purses just hoping to survive the evening. The underlying legislation before us, in my view, is going to be a very valuable tool in helping women like those whom I saw in Southeast Portland. Unfortunately, an amendment that Senator Kirk seeks to offer has been attached to this request that undermines the legal foundation of every social media platform and attacks a basic cornerstone of Internet law. The Kirk amendment will undermine the fight to help victims by distracting the focus of prosecutors from the pimps and the Johns who prey on these young women. The vague language in the Kirk amendment would mean any Web site that hosts user-generated contact--that means any social media platform, any news sites with comments and classified sections and any e-commerce sites--could face felony charges based on a vague concept of knowing and a vague concept of advertising. Instead of focusing resources on going after pimps and traffickers, the Kirk amendment would enable prosecutors to go after Web sites millions of Americans use for nonnefarious purposes, chilling innovation. Under current law, prosecutors already have the ability to go after any entity that knowingly profits from sex trafficking. Every minute our prosecutors are occupied going after legitimate businesses, in my view, is time not spent locking up the real criminals. This amendment hurts America's innovative businesses and entrepreneurs and stifles free speech instead of getting tough on the sex traffickers whom Senator Cornyn and I have sought to target all these years. So I will close by simply saying I am for throwing the book at every sex trafficker and those who enable them. Our country absolutely must do everything we can to prevent the next child from falling victim to these predators. In my view, the Kirk amendment distracts from that goal. I hope it will not ultimately be added to this important piece of legislation. I hope Senators will vote no on the Kirk amendment. With that, Mr. President, I withdraw my reservation to the request. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there any objection to the request of the majority leader? Without objection, it is so ordered. ____________________","Congressional Record, Volume 161 Issue 58 (Tuesday, April 21, 2015) [Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 58 (Tuesday, April 21, 2015)] [Senate] [Pages S2288-S2295] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] JUSTICE FOR VICTIMS OF TRAFFICKING ACT OF 2015--Continued The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma is recognized. Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I was not going to be talking right now, but I understand some of the people who are going to be reserving time are not yet here. [[Page S2289]] Pilot's Bill of Rights 2 Mr. President, I want to remind my colleagues on the floor that we have a piece of legislation that is coming up that no one is really plugged into right now, but it is going to be coming before us in a very short period of time. Back in 2011, I introduced a bill and passed a bill called the Pilot's Bill of Rights. It was something that was very meaningful to a relatively small number of people, but these are single-issue people, and it strove to correct a problem in our justice system that existed for as long as I could remember. Having been an active commercial pilot for the last over 50 years-- and there are not too many in the Senate; and in our delegation in Oklahoma, I was the only one until a couple years ago--it is only natural that I receive comments from a lot of people concerning problems they have with the FAA. There are a lot of great people in the FAA, and a lot of them I have worked with for many, many years. But there are also some--and this is true with any regulatory body, anyone who has authority over individuals. I remember back many years ago when I was the mayor of Tulsa. We had a great police force. But all it takes is two or three of them who are the bad guys. We are seeing some of that around today, and that gives a bad reputation to a lot of people. The same thing is true with some of the people who are working with the FAA. I can remember helping others, and I always did come to their aid when they felt they were not getting proper justice. But it really did not register with me until it actually happened to me. Back about 3 years ago, flying an airplane into a Texas airfield that is not a controlled airfield, there was an activity going on on the runway without any NOTAMs that had been advised--and nobody actually had any way of knowing this--and with permission I landed on that runway. This is a runway in far South Texas called the Cameron County Airport. It has a 9,000-foot runway. They were working on just a couple thousand feet of it, so it was very easy to come in. Now, because of certain individuals who had some other reasons to be critical of me, all kinds of things happened as a result of that. In fact, just recently they have even had some cartoons talking about how I landed on a runway and was chasing people off the runway. None of that was true. But this is what happened. They proposed to have a violation against me, and I was totally helpless, knowing--and many hundreds of others have had this experience; I never had--that I could lose my license on the whims of one individual in the field. Now, it would not have been as critical for me. That is not how I make my living. But look at some people who do make their living that way. They could lose their license just because of one individual who did not like them. Bob Hoover is a good example. Bob Hoover, who I guess is in his nineties now, arguably was the most gifted pilot I can ever remember. He was the one, I say to the Presiding Officer, who would put a glass of water up on his dash and do a barrel roll and not spill the water. I have been with him when that happened. Well, one guy in the field did not like him for some reason, and they staged a violation. He could have and did lose his license. Now, I had to come to this body--and it took a year and a half--to pass a bill to allow Bob Hoover to get back in. That is an extreme example, but nonetheless, that happened. And that is what was happening to me. So anyway, we passed the Pilot's Bill of Rights. The main thing there and what we are trying to do is to extend to pilots the same protections under the law that other people have. We have heard the phrase many times: You are guilty until proven innocent. Well, in one area in our society that is true--it has historically been true--and that is for violations or alleged violations against pilots. So anyway, we passed this. We corrected some things that have not really come to fruition. For example, what is called a NOTAM is short for a notice to airmen. A NOTAM is something that has to be published. It is supposed to be published by the FAA if there is anything going on at an airport such as construction on a runway that would create a hazard. So the pilots have to look up the NOTAMs. The problem with this is, there are no guidelines as to where they can find a notice to airmen. So we corrected this, we thought, in the Pilot's Bill of Rights. However, it was not as good of a correction as we thought it would be. So now we are coming back with a Pilot's Bill of Rights 2. By the way, I have to tell you, Mr. President, I had 67 cosponsors out of 100 Senators. So this is something that was very popular and passed with overwhelming majorities. So what we are doing now with the Pilot's Bill of Rights 2 is about four things. First, the medical certification process is one that is kind of interesting because there is no uniformity. Someone can have a physical problem, a medical problem, and he might be in Chicago, IL, or he might be in Tampa, FL, and they will have a completely different interpretation by the medical examiner as to what should be the remedy of that person's problem. So this puts uniformity back in there. Then it does something--and this is going to be something that people who do not understand and are not listening to me right now might state that this would be something that could be a hazard or might be some kind of a danger--and that is, we passed in 2004, a rule creating a medical exemption for pilots of light ``sport pilot eligible'' aircraft. That is for airplanes that weigh under 1,230 pounds and only have 2 seats. There are about 34,000 of them around. It has been over 10 years since FAA issued this exemption, and since then the medical safety experience of these pilots has been identical to those with medical certificates, which begs the question of the value of this expensive and burdensome requirement for pilots who fly for recreation. A joint study was done by the Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association, the AOPA, and the Experimental Aircraft Association, the EAA, on the 46,976 aviation accidents that occurred from 2008 and 2012. Of those 46,976, only 99 had a medical cause as a factor. That is less than one- quarter of 1 percent of all accidents. And of those 99, none would have been prevented by the current third-class medical screening standards and the medical certification process. So it does not offer any protection. It does not serve any useful purpose. Now, we are proposing in the Pilot's Bill of Rights 2 to extend that medical exemption that is currently in place for light sport aircraft to include planes weighing up to 6,000 pounds with up to 6 total passengers, including the pilot. That would add airmen and aircraft to an existing FAA-approved medical standard without degrading or creating substandard safety. What I am saying here is that of all these almost 47,000 aviation accidents, only 99 had a medical cause, and of those 99, not one would have been prevented by the current third-class medical screening standards and the medical certification process. So this is just another burden on the public--not individuals, but specifically on pilots, and it does not accomplish anything. What we will do now is have consistency in the application of the medical certification process, and it is something that is overdue. It should not be a problem getting that bill passed, and yet it does need explanation. The second thing it does is extend the due process rights preserved in the original Pilot's Bill of Rights bill to all FAA certificate holders--not just those who are certificate holders who fly airplanes. There are others who are examiners and work in other fields. They should have the same benefits. What it does is--and this is kind of hard to explain--but if someone is accused of a violation, that individual has a process that has been in law prior to the Pilot's Bill of Rights; and that is, you go through and the FAA makes a judgment. Then you can appeal it to the NTSB. The NTSB historically has been a rubber stamp for the FAA. So it does not really qualify anything. What we did in the Pilot's Bill of Rights 1 is allow an individual then to go into the court system and get what they call a de novo. A de novo means they have a whole process that starts from scratch. They do not just take what the FAA says, the NTSB says, but the courts treat it as a new case and look at it. This has not been happening. So we put some teeth in that so [[Page S2290]] that will be something that will be workable. So I really feel we are going to be able to do this, and it is really getting the things done that we tried to do in the Pilot's Bill of Rights, but there have been some problems getting the courts to understand it. In fact, in two separate cases, the Federal district courts ruled that my original bill did not require a full rehearing of the facts. This legislation explicitly spells out the option to appeal an FAA enforcement action to the Federal district courts for a guaranteed de novo trial. But they have not been doing it. So this puts teeth in it so they are going to actually have to do it. By the way, there are things that are in there that people are not aware of. For example, in my case, I allegedly did something that was not in compliance with FAA rules and regulations, but they did not say what it was. They did not give the evidence. So you did not have access to your evidence. The new bill ensures that is going to happen. The third thing is on NOTAMs. A NOTAM is a notice to airmen. It is a pilot's responsibility--this has been true for decades--to know if a NOTAM has been filed by the FAA. That is a notice to airmen. But there is not any way of knowing where to find that. In my case, they claimed there was a NOTAM saying that the runway at Cameron County Airport was closed. That was a lie. There wasn't. There was no NOTAM out there. Finally, we proved that was the case. So now we are going to have it enforced so we know where these notices to airmen are filed, and it is going to be the responsibility of the FAA to put them in a central location where they would have access to them. This is something that was addressed in the Pilot's Bill of Rights, but somehow it was not specific enough. The teeth we put in this bill is that in the event they do not have it, the NOTAM is published where it can be found in a central location. Then the FAA cannot use that as an enforcement action. That will get the job done. The fourth thing it does is to extend the liability protection to individuals designated by the FAA as aviation medical examiners, pilot examiners, and this type of thing. What this does also is address what we call and most people would refer to as the Good Samaritan law. I have a lot of pilots--and I have been in the same situation--who want to help. They want to get a patient to a doctor in an emergency situation. I can remember one time many years ago when a tornado went through and destroyed the island of Dominica, north of Caracas, Venezuela. I got 12 pilots together with 12 of their airplanes, and they volunteered to take all the medical supplies down there. Now, if something had happened in the meantime, they would have had no protection. Yet out of the goodness of their hearts, at their own expense, they were out there trying to save lives. I was there. I know. So this actually is one that is going to give liability protection to individuals other than just the pilots--other people who own FAA certificates--and at the same time give protection to those people who are trying to help other people. So I believe this bill should be coming up in the next couple of weeks. It will be going to the commerce committee. I would encourage Members to--and particularly those 67 Members who were the cosponsors of the original Pilot's Bill of Rights should be on this one too. In fact, most of them are right now. I know Senators Manchin and Boozman were the first two to get on. They happen to be the chairmen of the General Aviation Caucus in the Senate. By the way, we have equal support over in the other body, in the House of Representatives. Last summer, at the EAA AirVenture Oshkosh fly-in convention--that is the largest fly-in convention anywhere in the world--I hosted a public forum to solicit input for the legislation we are having, the Pilot's Bill of Rights 2, and I received over 400 comments from individuals. These are people who were present at the Oshkosh event. So we have solicited their input, and we have all the organizations behind it. I would say, insofar as the one that might become controversial; that is, the exemption on a third-class medical--doctors have unanimously voted in favor of it--they are called the doctors in aviation--and others. This is one of these rare opportunities we have on a bipartisan basis to pass something that is going to offer legal protections to one class of people who currently don't have it and have not had it in the past. I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. HOEVEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. HOEVEN. Mr. President, I rise again to speak in support of the Justice for Victims of Trafficking Act. It is good legislation, drafted and introduced by the Senator from Texas, Mr. Cornyn, and also the Senator from Minnesota, Ms. Klobuchar. They originally put this bill together in the last Congress, and I was pleased to be a cosponsor of that bill. I am also very pleased to be an original cosponsor of the legislation they introduced earlier this year, the legislation we have on the floor now. This bill has many important, strong points. I am going to go through some--not all but a number of them. For example, it makes sure victims get restitution and witnesses get rewards for cooperating with law enforcement before others and encourages prosecutors to get training on restitution in human trafficking cases. It also gives law enforcement greater authority to seize the assets of convicted human traffickers, and it protects victims and witnesses by requiring human traffickers to be treated as violent criminals for purposes of pretrial release and detention pending judicial proceedings. It also ensures that Federal crime victims are informed of any plea bargain or deferred prosecution agreement in their case and clarifies that the ordinary standard of appellate review applies in cases concerning Federal crime victims' rights petitions. It recognizes that child pornography production is a form of human trafficking and ensures that victims have access to direct services at child advocacy centers to help them heal. It allows State and local human trafficking task forces to get wiretap warrants within their own State courts without Federal approval. That will help them to more effectively investigate crimes of child pornography, child sexual exploitation, and human trafficking. The bill also improves nationwide communications so law enforcement can better track and capture traffickers and child pornographers. It ensures regular reporting on the number of human trafficking crimes for purposes of the FBI Uniform Crime Reporting Program. It also requires law enforcement to upload photos of missing individuals into the National Criminal Information Center database and notify the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children of any child reported missing from foster care, and it strengthens current law to reduce demand for human trafficking by encouraging police, prosecutors, judges, and juries to target all persons involved in the buying and selling of human trafficking victims. It is just wrong to prosecute victims and fail to prosecute those who prey on them. This legislation will help for all of those reasons, but this legislation is also very important because it creates a fund from fines and penalties imposed on those who would engage in human trafficking. The fund is important because it not only compensates victims of human trafficking and other crimes of exploitation for their injuries, but it also provides resources to help law enforcement prevent such crimes in the future. As we work on this important issue, it is also very important that we understand that human trafficking is not just a big-State, big-city problem. Every State in the country is facing this issue, including my home State of North Dakota, but we currently have a challenge addressing this problem. After consulting with the North Dakota attorney general's office, we learned that North Dakota has been [[Page S2291]] discouraged from applying for antihuman trafficking grants, because in its application, the Department of Justice asks for at least 2 years of local data on human trafficking victims. North Dakota, in recent years, has been the fastest growing State in the country. So here we are, the fastest growing State both in terms of population and in terms of income growth. Consequently, more so than many States, only recently we have seen significant increases in human trafficking issues. So we don't have that 2 years' worth of data that DOJ requires, but we very much need assistance with addressing the problem of human trafficking. It is not unique to North Dakota. There are other States--typically fast-growing States, States that may have the same kind of energy development or other areas where they have seen a significant influx of people and are continuing to see a significant influx of people. This is a national issue. It is not specific just to my State but to any State where we have seen rapid growth, influx of money, influx of people from outside the State and where human trafficking is an issue. To remedy that, I have offered an amendment to the current legislation we have on the floor now, the Cornyn-Klobuchar bill, that clarifies that an eligibility entity with a worthy trafficking initiative, in an effort to combat trafficking in its jurisdiction, will not be disadvantaged in receiving funds under the Cornyn-Klobuchar bill because they, like North Dakota--be it a State or whatever--have only recently begun collecting data on human trafficking. So in cases where they don't have 2 years of data, as long as they can demonstrate a valid need and a valid solution to try to address this important issue and to reduce human trafficking, that is what will be required for the application, and not having 2 years of data will not be an issue in terms of scoring or an issue that DOJ would hold against that application for receipt of the funds for a worthy project. This is important to make sure that all across the country, in every State, we are addressing human trafficking. We all need to be united, in every State across this great country, working to combat human trafficking. That is why this amendment is very important. There are few issues that as a governing body we can be more united on than making sure we protect our children, that we prevent human trafficking in any form, and that we do it on a national basis in every State. That is what my amendment is all about. For this reason, I offer this amendment. I hope it will be included as part of the Cornyn-Klobuchar legislation, which, as I said earlier, I am only too pleased to cosponsor. The value and importance of this legislation is reflected in the broad coalition of victims' rights and law enforcement organizations that support it. It has been endorsed by nearly 200 groups, from the Fraternal Order of Police to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children. We need to pass this legislation. Crimes such as human trafficking and child pornography target the most vulnerable among us in a most despicable way. I urge all of my colleagues to pass this bill, to put an end to modern-day slavery, and to help victims get the support they need. Mr. President, I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. PORTMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Lankford). Without objection, it is so ordered. The Senator from Ohio. Mr. PORTMAN. Mr. President, I rise to express my appreciation that this afternoon the Senate is finally getting back to legislating on the important issue of human trafficking. It is critical we pass this legislation to combat one of the world's most heinous crimes and one that threatens thousands of innocent people every year. I am the cochair and cofounder of the human trafficking caucus. Our opportunity is not only to raise awareness of this issue but also to pass important legislation to address the problem. We learned that human trafficking is now a $32 billion worldwide industry, leaving it only second in size to the drug trade for criminal activity. Many view this as an international problem. They think, well, this happens somewhere else or on another continent, such as Africa or Asia. The fact is it happens right here. Of course, every country around the world has a responsibility to fight back against traffickers and stop their acts of violence. But while this industry has a global reach, the reality is that human trafficking is a major problem not only in my home State of Ohio, it is a problem in every State represented in the Senate. The Justice Department has told us that the average age of victims getting involved in trafficking is 12 to 14 years old. Think about that. These are children. These are kids. The number of American children at risk of sexual exploitation and human trafficking is estimated to be about 300,000. These children represent the most vulnerable among us, and we should make sure we are doing everything we possibly can to protect them. Every American life has value and every child deserves a chance to live a bright future. Today, however, we can take comfort in knowing we are fighting back against human traffickers and making it harder for their criminal activity to continue in a couple of different ways, both of which are very important. First, our legislation makes it easier to find some of these vulnerable children. Missing children are particularly vulnerable, and the legislation I am about to talk about enables us to find those children more quickly and helps to get them into a nurturing environment. Second, it will strengthen law enforcement's ability to find and punish those who are committing these crimes. We accomplished the first goal with the Bringing Missing Children Home Act. It is a bill that I authored with Senator Chuck Schumer of New York. We know there is a strong connection, unfortunately, between sex trafficking victims and children who have been in and out of the child welfare system. We also understand that kids who are missing or who have run away from home are the most vulnerable to trafficking, exploitation, and abuse. The FBI sting in 2014 recovered 168 sex trafficking victims, and nearly all of them had spent time in the child welfare or foster care system. While many of these children had been reported missing, the information obtained by authorities was not sufficient enough to be able to find them, and that is what this legislation gets at. The Bringing Missing Children Home Act will make it easier to find these children in two different ways. First, it amends the Missing Children's Assistance Act by replacing the term ``child prostitution'' with ``child sex trafficking.'' This reinforces the fact that children who are exploited are victims, not criminals. Secondly, the bill requires law enforcement agencies to update their records of missing children within 30 days of an initial report with additional information that could include medical or dental records or even a photograph. Having this new information, particularly a photograph, is incredibly important when searching for a missing child. I know this because this has been a big problem in my home State of Ohio. We started looking at this legislation and considering this bill on the floor on March 6. Since March 6, 60 children have been reported missing in my home State of Ohio. Yet we only have photographs for 14 of them. It is hard to find these children, and not having that information makes it even more difficult. Our legislation will help to get those photographs and will help ensure that all of us can play a role in helping to find these missing children. The bill also makes it easier for law enforcement officials on the State and local level to coordinate with child welfare services, and it allows missing persons units and State law enforcement agencies to modify and improve missing children's entries to include important information that was uncovered during an investigation. That is not currently the case. It just makes sense to be able to have better records. While we are making it easier to find trafficking victims, we will also make it easier to find and punish perpetrators of these crimes with legislation I have authored with Senator Dianne [[Page S2292]] Feinstein. It is called the Combat Human Trafficking Act and is part of this underlying bill we will also be considering here on the floor. This act focuses on those who commit these crimes. It increases the penalties for those who buy acts from sex trafficking victims. It requires new training by the Justice Department on targeting. It expands reporting on trafficking prosecutions and strengthens victims' rights. A lot of this comes out of what we have learned over the past decade since we have really taken up this issue at the Federal level. It improves Federal law to take into account the information we now know. Through better enforcement of laws against buyers, we will be able to reduce the demand for sexual exploitation and ensure that criminals are prosecuted to the full extent, preventing further trafficking crimes from ever happening. As the cochair of the Senate Caucus to End Human Trafficking, it has been a priority of mine to get this legislation passed in an effort to help victims of trafficking and to prevent the number of victims from increasing. I also hope we can add an amendment I authored entitled ``Ensuring a Better Response for Victims of Child Sex Trafficking.'' This amendment contains a piece of legislation I authored last year with Senator Wyden of Oregon called the Sex Trafficking Data and Response Act. It will help improve the information law enforcement officials have about the scope of the trafficking problem. This was signed into law last year, but there is additional information we would like to provide in terms of getting the response part of that bill passed. The bills I have spoken about are important steps to one day ending human trafficking and putting this horrible industry out of business altogether. Trafficking deserves no place in America. I thank Senator Chuck Schumer, Senator Dianne Feinstein, and others for their hard work on this legislation I have talked about. I would also like to express how grateful I am that Members of this Chamber were able to put partisanship behind us, politics aside, and reach common ground to move forward on this important issue. Ending human trafficking is clearly a bipartisan goal. It is a nonpartisan goal. It is something on which we should come together. The legislation we have before us today will make a profound impact on so many Americans, including some of the most vulnerable. I am happy to see we are a little closer to having these bills become law. I think they will become law once they pass this Chamber, go through the House, and are signed by the President. We still have a lot of work to do. This is just a start. After today, the fight to combat human trafficking will be far from over. Somewhere in America, there will still be children looking to be found, wondering if anybody cares, despite our legislation. Today's legislation will make it easier to find them, but it is still up to all of us. All of us have a role in helping to keep these children from going missing in the first place and then finding and providing them with a nurturing setting and a home where they are embraced and where they can be taken away from the stress of human trafficking and sex trafficking. There will always be traffickers looking to exploit the vulnerable. We know that. But today, if we pass this legislation, we will be sending a warning to those who commit these heinous crimes. As long as you are a perpetrator or an accomplice to human trafficking--folks will know that law enforcement is going to do what it takes to track them down and to punish them. I am glad we have been able to find common ground again and move a little closer to making these positive changes a reality. I am hopeful that we will be able to vote on this today and tomorrow, move this to the House, get it through to the President, and indeed begin to make a difference to my constituents in Ohio and around the country. With that, I yield back. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. COATS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Ayotte). Without objection, it is so ordered. Wasteful Spending Mr. COATS. Madam President, I am here today to identify yet another installment of the ``Waste of the Week.'' We have been doing this now for several weeks, trying to save taxpayers' dollars out of documented waste of their dollars when they send them to Washington. In recent weeks, I have highlighted examples of waste, some big some small. To date, we have documented over $47 billion of taxpayer funds that have gone to duplication of effort, simply gone to things the Federal Government never should have been involved in in the first place, examples of fraud, abuse--$47 billion and climbing on our tax savings gauge here which is approaching now $50 billion. Our goal is $100 billion. We are going to keep going as we discover each week yet another waste of taxpayer dollars. This week's ``Waste of the Week'' involves the Federal Employees' Compensation Act, also known as FECA. This law was enacted in 1916-- well intended, I think, to provide workers' compensation benefits to civilian Federal employees who sustained injuries while employed by the Federal Government and includes funds for vocational rehabilitation and medical benefits. As I said, it was well intended at the time, providing a lifeline for people injured on the job to keep these people afloat financially until they are ready to go back to work. ``Ready to go back to work'' has become somewhat of a major question in terms of how this 1916 law is applied, because you have to wonder, is someone 99 years old looking to go back to work. Well, in 1916, when this act was enacted, it treated them as if they were and are able to go back to work. Let me explain. Both the FECA compensation and medical benefits are payable for the duration of a person's inability to work, which can extend well into their individual golden years. You say: How does that all happen? But under current law, there is no maximum duration of benefits and no maximum age at which benefits must be terminated. Thus, when beneficiaries become eligible for Federal retirement or disability annuities, they are given the choice as to whether they want to remain in the FECA program or choose the Federal retirement program. Well, it is not much of a choice. The choice is obvious because given the level of benefits monthly, FECA benefits can be a much better deal than what they would be paid under retirement benefit plans. The FECA benefits are as high as 75 percent of the worker's predisability wage. The annual cost-of-living-adjustment is applied each year, the COLA, to the benefits. Someone came up with a pretty interesting idea here. FECA benefits are not taxed. So, clearly, this ends up being a much better deal for beneficiaries. But is it a better deal for taxpayers? That is the question. Let's take a closer look. This applies to all Federal agencies, but let's take one agency. The Department of Labor reports that approximately 45,000 cases currently receive long-term disability benefits under FECA, and 15,000 or one-third of these cases involve beneficiaries aged 66 or older. Clearly, it is time--actually it is past time--to reconsider and make reforms to the FECA. At a minimum, we should require workers, when they reach retirement age, to transition into the retirement plan as all their peers have had to do and not continue, throughout their lifetime, the much more generous benefits of FECA. As I said, the agency with the most FECA claims is the U.S. Postal Service. I want to use this as an example of how this is applied. The Postal Service Office of Inspector General told us that FECA rolls include 9,554 postal workers aged 55 or older eligible for retirement; 3,389 aged 65 and over; 928 aged 80 or older; and, yes, one postal worker at the age of 99. So in 2013 the U.S. Postal Service paid about $1.3 billion in workers' compensation claims and $67 million in administrative fees. In addition, as of June 30, 2014, the estimated workers' compensation liability totaled $17.8 billion. Now, while many of these benefits go to workers of a traditional working [[Page S2293]] age, the U.S. Postal Service estimates that these higher than retirement benefits are resulting in an extra $37.8 million being paid out annually. That comes to nearly $400 million over the next 10 years, and that is just from one agency, the U.S. Postal Service. Estimates as to the cost to the taxpayer when all of the Federal agencies are included show that more than $1 billion will be spent over the next 10 years in extra workers' compensation payments for those who would unlikely be working throughout the Federal workforce. As my colleague, Senator Susan Collins from Maine, has been highlighting for years, FECA has become a gold-plated retirement system tainted by unfairness, perverse incentives, and the potential for abuse and fraud. This program has become increasingly expensive and requires some commonsense reforms--reforms that many States have already implemented in their own workers' compensation programs. Remember, these payments are designed as a bridge to help injured workers until they are able to return to work. That is the most important phrase here--``return to work.'' This program was never intended to serve as a higher paying alternative to the Federal retirement system. Yet, under the law, it is used for that, and it has cost the taxpayers a significant amount of their tax dollars for unnecessary payments. Let's not ignore ways we can improve our fiscal health and return our Federal programs, at a minimum, to their original intent. It is time we look at this policy and restore integrity to the FECA, the Federal Employees' Compensation Act. Today, I am adding another $1 billion to the taxpayer savings gauge for this week's waste of the week, and I look forward to discussing ways we can eradicate this waste from our Federal budget so that we can give hard-earned dollars back to the taxpayers--money that simply is not used properly and is labeled, of course, a waste of their money. So we have increased--we are approaching $50 billion, and we are shooting up to $100 billion by the end of this year. I am hoping we can go significantly past that. The next step, of course, is to take what we have identified and make sure that the law is changed, that it is reformed, and that we can proudly say to the taxpayer that we are doing our part in Washington. While the larger issues of debt and deficit need to be addressed and must be addressed, if we cannot come to consensus on that, at least we can come to consensus on eliminating these egregious abuses of taxpayer dollars. I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Gardner). The clerk will call the roll. The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for up to 15 minutes as in morning business. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. CLIMATE CHANGE Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, as Americans celebrate the 35th Earth Day this week, I rise for the 96th time--I seem to be coinciding with the Presiding Officer's schedule so he has been treated to his share of these speeches--to urge this body to wake up to the threat of climate change. It is real, not a hoax. It is caused by carbon pollution, and it is already making changes that we are already seeing in the world around us. We must cut our carbon pollution to prevent even bigger climate changes--changes in our atmosphere, oceans, and human habitat-- potentially unprecedented in the history of our human habitation of this planet. Yet the polluters who are producing this problem would have us do nothing. They make money when we do nothing. So we do nothing. The polluters run a racket. They all float onto us the costs and damage from their fossil fuel product--the costs of heat waves, of sea level rise, of ocean acidification, of dying forests, and more. The polluters happily dump those costs onto everybody else. And to keep this profitable racket running, the polluters spend huge sums on lobbying and politics, particularly right here in the Congress. As one author has written, ``rivers of money flowing from secret sources have turned our elections into silent auctions.'' And the polluters get what they pay for. The Republican Party in Congress has become the political arm of the fossil fuel industry. The polluters also spend huge amounts on a big, complex PR machine to churn out doubt about the real science and cook up some paid-for science. Documents recently discovered by Greenpeace show that one scientist, whose work consistently downplayed the role of carbon pollution and climate change, received--get this--more than $1.2 million from oil and coal interests over the last decade. Those nice people at the Charles G. Koch Charitable Foundation gave him at least $230,000. In recent years, his grants came through Donors Trust, the front group that funnels money from oil, coal, and other special interests. Well, what do we know? We know that financial incentives affect people's behavior. Does anyone doubt that? That is life. That is why politicians have to disclose their political contributors, the gifts and benefits they receive, and even personal financial information. That is why regulatory agencies and scientific journals require scientific submissions to make plain who funded the work. That is why expert witnesses' funding sources are relevant in court proceedings. And that is why Upton Sinclair once said: ``It's difficult to get a man to understand something when his salary depends on his not understanding it.'' So we know that money talks. That is not news. What else do we know? Well, we also know about that industry playbook to keep safety regulation at bay by funding phony science and manufacturing doubt about legitimate science. That is not news, either. That has been around for years. The tobacco industry campaign to mislead the public about the health effects of cigarettes was so fraudulent it was determined in Federal court to be a racketeering enterprise. Think about that--an industry campaign of deception about the risks of their product that persisted for years and was ultimately determined in Federal court to have constituted a racketeering enterprise. Does it sound familiar? And tobacco is not alone. The lead paint industry shut down its trade association, the Lead Industry Association, rather than answer questions under oath in a court proceeding. Entire books have been written documenting this industry's strategy, for example, ``Merchants of Doubt,'' which has recently been made into a documentary, or ``Doubt is Their Product,'' or ``Lead Wars,'' or ``Deceit and Denial.'' So we know the strategy. Finally, we know something else. We know that a network of front organizations with innocent-sounding names has emerged to propagate the baloney science. This phenomenon has been well documented by Dr. Robert Brulle at Drexell University, among others. His follow-the-money analysis diagrams the complex flow of cash to these front groups that industry persistently tries to obscure. Well, here is what makes sense to me: If it is important enough for them to want to hide it, it is important enough for us to want to know about it. So Senators Boxer, Markey, and I sent a letter to about 100 companies, trade groups, and other organizations affiliated with the fossil fuel industry. We asked whether they spent money to support climate research. It sounds reasonable, based on those three things that we know. Well, oh, my, what a fit of caterwauling that drew from the rightwing PR machine. Today, I will give a recap of the outrage highlights. It is a ``witch hunt,'' said the far-right Heartland Institute, ``what fascists do.'' We are ``ethically challenged . . . mental midgets,'' said Heartland's president. He later called this little letter ``harassment . . . abuse of authority and misrepresentation of the facts.'' Heartland, by the way, is that classy group that put up a billboard comparing climate scientists to the Unabomber, just to give an idea of their credibility. Finally, ``[S]hame on you,'' read Heartland's response to our letter, which Heartland called a ``campaign to stigmatize and demonize.'' [[Page S2294]] The rightwing John Locke Foundation said our letter was ``trying to McCarthyite'' them. Rightwinger Hans von Spakovsky of the Heritage Foundation said it was ``an abuse of power.'' Investor's Business Daily got so excited they mixed up their metaphors to say we were both ``inquisitors'' and ``stalk[ers],'' out to ``intimidate'' and ``threatening peaceful citizens.'' They scoffed, ``as if it were any of [our] business'' to know if polluters are funding the science. Keeping that Spanish Inquisition theme going, the Washington Times called us ``climate change Torquemadas.'' So it looks as if we hit the full faux-outrage quadrifecta--witch hunts, fascism, McCarthyism, and even the Spanish Inquisition. But then they got really serious, and they unlimbered the ultimate rightwing malediction. We were accused by the Cato Institute of--cover your ears, young pages--having ``a widespread faith . . . in government's ability to solve problems.'' Well, Cato made its position on climate change clear, saying that for us ``to believe that man's emissions of carbon dioxide are warming the planet'' was a ``bias'' and that the legitimate science endorsed by everyone from NASA to the Department of Defense to every legitimate scientific society--every major legitimate scientific society in the country--all of that was ``propaganda,'' and that we, of course, were climate alarmists. Cato also sent us a letter in response to our inquiry, telling us we cannot ``use the awesome power of the federal government to cow'' Cato and others. Cow? According to the Wall Street Journal editorial page, which sadly has become a front for the fossil fuel industry, we were ``trying to silence'' the other side. Although, I have to confess, it is not clear how the other side would be silenced by simply having to reveal whose payroll they are on, which is all we asked. Let's be clear, our letter didn't suggest that industry scientists should be silenced--just that the public should know if those scientists are being paid by the very industries with a big economic stake in the issue. Let's test how much the rightwing front groups care about the suppression of scientific information. Let's look at their outrage over the reports of public employees in Florida being told--by the government no less--not to talk about climate change. Interviews by the Florida Center for Investigative Reporting with current and former employees, contractors, and volunteers at the Florida Department of Environmental Protection revealed that the administration of Republican Gov. Rick Scott issued an unwritten rule banning official use of the phrases ``climate change'' or ``global warming.'' Those reports have been corroborated by employees of other State agencies. We have heard stories of retribution against State employees who dare discuss climate change, of climate change-related projects being put on the back burner, and even of the term itself being edited out of official documents, including those produced by a university scientist. It sounds like suppression of science. Where was the outrage from the right? Where were the comparisons to fascism and McCarthyism and the Spanish Inquisition for this actual government- sponsored suppression of scientific information? Guess what. There was none. It is not just Florida. Recently, the Republican members of Wisconsin's Board of Commissioners of Public Lands voted to prohibit the professional staff ``from engaging in global warming or climate change work.'' The Wisconsin timber industry, as Senator Baldwin and I have both pointed out, sees the threat climate change poses to Wisconsin forests, including, among other things, the frozen winter roads that loggers use to move their equipment around that warmer weather melts and turns to impassable muck. But the Republicans in charge of those lands have simply ordered State officials to ignore climate change, suppressing the science--plain and simple. Where was the outrage from the rightwing groups that had fits about our little request for some transparency about what scientist is on whose payroll? Where was the outrage? There was none, which shows that the real issue has nothing to do with scientific freedom. The real issue here of freedom is the freedom of big, dishonest special interests to hide whose hand is in the puppet. Here is where it really gets ironic. The enormous multibillion dollar polluting industries whose front groups accuse us of bullying--of being fascists and intimidators and Torquemadas--over our little letter are the very ones pouring hundreds of millions of dollars into elections, much of it secretly, for the plainly avowed purpose of threatening and punishing elected officials who might dare to cross them and acknowledge the dangers of carbon-driven climate change--of all people to be complaining. Americans for Prosperity, to give one example, a Koch brothers venture, has said that Republicans who support any action on climate change will be put at a ``severe disadvantage'' in the 2016 elections. That is a serious threat, given the Koch brothers' pledge to spend $900 million in this election cycle. Yet that same Americans for Prosperity Foundation blasted our little letter as ``an attempt to silence those whose views do not meet with your approval.'' Please. Really? Against a $900 million campaign threat and a stable of paid-for scientists, against that massive screen of fossil fuel front organizations spouting industry propaganda, our little effort at getting a little transparency about who is funding the phony-baloney climate denial science--that is a raindrop against a torrent. We do indeed need to wake up. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan. Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, before my prepared comments, I do want to thank the Senator from Rhode Island for his passion and his leadership in coming to the floor over and over again, ringing the alarm bells about what is happening not only to our country but our world. We are paying the price in lives and in dollars. We are seeing our farmers pay the price because we have not effectively addressed what is happening to our world in terms of climate change. I want to thank the Senator for his continued passion in reminding us over and over again why we need to act right now. Selfridge Air National Guard Deployment Mr. President, today 350 airmen from Michigan, along with 12 A-10 Warthog aircraft, are deploying to the Middle East to take part in Operation Inherent Resolve, our Nation's mission to eliminate the terrorist group known as ISIL. This deployment has special significance for Michigan. Michigan is home to thousands of families and community leaders with loved ones living in the Middle East who have seen firsthand the devastating effect of ISIL as it brutally murders innocent people, drives them from their homes, and destabilizes the region. For so many families in Michigan, the fight against ISIL is deeply personal. Today, that fight is personal to many more families as these airmen from Selfridge Air National Guard Base deploy to the region. The A-10 Warthogs are the very best close air support aircraft in the U.S. military. Known as a tankbuster, the A-10 is ideal against ISIL, which uses tanks stolen from the Iraqi Army. We in Michigan are proud of our fleet. We are proud of our people, their courage, their passion, and their hard work. We are proud for all they have done to protect our Nation. In 2011, the 127th Wing at Selfridge deployed 300 airmen and one dozen A-10s to Kandahar Airfield, a NATO base in southern Afghanistan. Over 120 days, the unit logged over 8,000 flight hours in 2,000 flight missions in an extremely hostile environment. Today, I ask my colleagues in the Senate to keep these 350 airmen in your thoughts and prayers. We wish them Godspeed as they embark on this very important mission, and we remember especially their families and friends who will stay behind and support them with their prayers as well. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. (Mr. DAINES assumed the Chair.) Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Rounds). Without objection, it is so ordered. [[Page S2295]] Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that when the Senate resumes consideration of S. 178 on Wednesday, April 22, Senator Cornyn or his designee be recognized to withdraw the pending Cornyn amendment and offer amendments Nos. 1124 and 301. I further ask that there then be 1 hour of debate, equally divided in the usual form, and that following the use or yielding back of time, the Senate vote on the Leahy amendment No. 301, followed by a vote on amendment No. 1124, both with a 60-vote affirmative threshold for adoption. I further ask that if the Cornyn-Murray-Klobuchar amendment is agreed to, the time until 2 p.m. be equally divided in the usual form, and the Senate then vote on the following amendments in the order listed, with 2 minutes of debate equally divided before each vote: Cornyn No. 1127; Leahy No. 290; Brown No. 311; Burr No. 1121; and Kirk No. 273, as modified. I further ask that amendments in the preceding list each be subject to a 60-vote affirmative threshold for adoption, and that following disposition of these amendments, there then be 5 minutes equally divided in the usual form, followed by votes on the following amendments, which have been cleared by the managers and should be adopted by voice vote: Klobuchar No. 296; Hoeven No. 299, as modified; Sullivan No. 279; Wicker No. 1126; Flake No. 294; Cassidy No. 308; Portman No. 1128; Brown No. 310; Brown No. 312; Heller No. 1122; and Shaheen No. 303. I further ask that there be no second-degrees in order to any of the amendments listed and that following disposition of the Shaheen amendment, the committee-reported substitute, as amended, be agreed to, the bill, as amended, be read a third time, and the Senate proceed to a vote on passage. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? The Senator from Oregon. Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, would the majority leader consider at this time modifying his request to drop the Kirk amendment No. 273? The PRESIDING OFFICER. Will the majority leader so modify his request? The Senator from Texas. Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, as I understand, the distinguished Senator from Oregon is asking to amend the consent request. I would reserve the right to object to that request and make the simple point that the Kirk amendment targets online child exploitation and sex trafficking, which is rampant. Given the fact that the Internet is now one of the principal tools used, on Web sites such as backpage.com, thousands of American children and human trafficking victims are sold into slavery. It is simply unconscionable for us to stand by and allow this to continue. What Senator Kirk is asking for, which I support and believe we should do, is a simple up-or-down vote on the Kirk amendment. So I reserve the right to object and ask our colleague to allow this up-or- down vote on the Kirk amendment. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Will the majority leader so modify his request? Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, the answer is no, but I think the Senator from Oregon wishes to respond. Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, continuing my reservation, I don't take a backseat to anyone when it comes to fighting for the victims of sex trafficking. As the distinguished Senator from Texas knows, I was an original cosponsor of this legislation, and much of it is based on bills I have written and advocated on behalf of for years, including with the distinguished Senator from Texas. Much of this sex trafficking legislation, colleagues, is based on meetings and discussions I have had for years with young women who have been trafficked, law enforcement officials, and community leaders. I remember like it was yesterday how I was with the Portland police on 82nd Avenue in East Portland, and we encountered young women in their early teens who walked around with knives in their purses just hoping to survive the evening. The underlying legislation before us, in my view, is going to be a very valuable tool in helping women like those whom I saw in Southeast Portland. Unfortunately, an amendment that Senator Kirk seeks to offer has been attached to this request that undermines the legal foundation of every social media platform and attacks a basic cornerstone of Internet law. The Kirk amendment will undermine the fight to help victims by distracting the focus of prosecutors from the pimps and the Johns who prey on these young women. The vague language in the Kirk amendment would mean any Web site that hosts user-generated contact--that means any social media platform, any news sites with comments and classified sections and any e-commerce sites--could face felony charges based on a vague concept of knowing and a vague concept of advertising. Instead of focusing resources on going after pimps and traffickers, the Kirk amendment would enable prosecutors to go after Web sites millions of Americans use for nonnefarious purposes, chilling innovation. Under current law, prosecutors already have the ability to go after any entity that knowingly profits from sex trafficking. Every minute our prosecutors are occupied going after legitimate businesses, in my view, is time not spent locking up the real criminals. This amendment hurts America's innovative businesses and entrepreneurs and stifles free speech instead of getting tough on the sex traffickers whom Senator Cornyn and I have sought to target all these years. So I will close by simply saying I am for throwing the book at every sex trafficker and those who enable them. Our country absolutely must do everything we can to prevent the next child from falling victim to these predators. In my view, the Kirk amendment distracts from that goal. I hope it will not ultimately be added to this important piece of legislation. I hope Senators will vote no on the Kirk amendment. With that, Mr. President, I withdraw my reservation to the request. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there any objection to the request of the majority leader? Without objection, it is so ordered. ____________________",package_114_99.csv,56937,56937,57005,"[congressional record volume 161, number 58 (tuesday, april 21, 2015)] [senate] [pages s2288-s2295] from the congressional record online through the government publishing office [ www.gpo.gov ] justice for victims of trafficking act of 2015--continued the presiding officer. the senator from oklahoma is recognized. mr. inhofe. mr. president, i was not going to be talking right now, but i understand some of the people who are going to be reserving time are not yet here. [[page s2289]] pilot's bill of rights 2 mr. president, i want to remind my colleagues on the floor that we have a piece of legislation that is coming up that no one is really plugged into right now, but it is going to be coming before us in a very short period of time. back in 2011, i introduced a bill and passed a bill called the pilot's bill of rights. it was something that was very meaningful to a relatively small number of people, but these are single-issue people, and it strove to correct a problem in our justice system that existed for as long as i could remember. having been an active commercial pilot for the last over 50 years-- and there are not too many in the senate; and in our delegation in oklahoma, i was the only one until a couple years ago--it is only natural that i receive comments from a lot of people concerning problems they have with the faa. there are a lot of great people in the faa, and a lot of them i have worked with for many, many years. but there are also some--and this is true with any regulatory body, anyone who has authority over individuals. i remember back many years ago when i was the mayor of tulsa. we had a great police force. but all it takes is two or three of them who are the bad guys. we are seeing some of that around today, and that gives a bad reputation to a lot of people. the same thing is true with some of the people who are working with the faa. i can remember helping others, and i always did come to their aid when they felt they were not getting proper justice. but it really did not register with me until it actually happened to me. back about 3 years ago, flying an airplane into a texas airfield that is not a controlled airfield, there was an activity going on on the runway without any notams that had been advised--and nobody actually had any way of knowing this--and with permission i landed on that runway. this is a runway in far south texas called the cameron county airport. it has a 9,000-foot runway. they were working on just a couple thousand feet of it, so it was very easy to come in. now, because of certain individuals who had some other reasons to be critical of me, all kinds of things happened as a result of that. in fact, just recently they have even had some cartoons talking about how i landed on a runway and was chasing people off the runway. none of that was true. but this is what happened. they proposed to have a violation against me, and i was totally helpless, knowing--and many hundreds of others have had this experience; i never had--that i could lose my license on the whims of one individual in the field. now, it would not have been as critical for me. that is not how i make my living. but look at some people who do make their living that way. they could lose their license just because of one individual who did not like them. bob hoover is a good example. bob hoover, who i guess is in his nineties now, arguably was the most gifted pilot i can ever remember. he was the one, i say to the presiding officer, who would put a glass of water up on his dash and do a barrel roll and not spill the water. i have been with him when that happened. well, one guy in the field did not like him for some reason, and they staged a violation. he could have and did lose his license. now, i had to come to this body--and it took a year and a half--to pass a bill to allow bob hoover to get back in. that is an extreme example, but nonetheless, that happened. and that is what was happening to me. so anyway, we passed the pilot's bill of rights. the main thing there and what we are trying to do is to extend to pilots the same protections under the law that other people have. we have heard the phrase many times: you are guilty until proven innocent. well, in one area in our society that is true--it has historically been true--and that is for violations or alleged violations against pilots. so anyway, we passed this. we corrected some things that have not really come to fruition. for example, what is called a notam is short for a notice to airmen. a notam is something that has to be published. it is supposed to be published by the faa if there is anything going on at an airport such as construction on a runway that would create a hazard. so the pilots have to look up the notams. the problem with this is, there are no guidelines as to where they can find a notice to airmen. so we corrected this, we thought, in the pilot's bill of rights. however, it was not as good of a correction as we thought it would be. so now we are coming back with a pilot's bill of rights 2. by the way, i have to tell you, mr. president, i had 67 cosponsors out of 100 senators. so this is something that was very popular and passed with overwhelming majorities. so what we are doing now with the pilot's bill of rights 2 is about four things. first, the medical certification process is one that is kind of interesting because there is no uniformity. someone can have a physical problem, a medical problem, and he might be in chicago, il, or he might be in tampa, fl, and they will have a completely different interpretation by the medical examiner as to what should be the remedy of that person's problem. so this puts uniformity back in there. then it does something--and this is going to be something that people who do not understand and are not listening to me right now might state that this would be something that could be a hazard or might be some kind of a danger--and that is, we passed in 2004, a rule creating a medical exemption for pilots of light ``sport pilot eligible'' aircraft. that is for airplanes that weigh under 1,230 pounds and only have 2 seats. there are about 34,000 of them around. it has been over 10 years since faa issued this exemption, and since then the medical safety experience of these pilots has been identical to those with medical certificates, which begs the question of the value of this expensive and burdensome requirement for pilots who fly for recreation. a joint study was done by the aircraft owners and pilots association, the aopa, and the experimental aircraft association, the eaa, on the 46,976 aviation accidents that occurred from 2008 and 2012. of those 46,976, only 99 had a medical cause as a factor. that is less than one- quarter of 1 percent of all accidents. and of those 99, none would have been prevented by the current third-class medical screening standards and the medical certification process. so it does not offer any protection. it does not serve any useful purpose. now, we are proposing in the pilot's bill of rights 2 to extend that medical exemption that is currently in place for light sport aircraft to include planes weighing up to 6,000 pounds with up to 6 total passengers, including the pilot. that would add airmen and aircraft to an existing faa-approved medical standard without degrading or creating substandard safety. what i am saying here is that of all these almost 47,000 aviation accidents, only 99 had a medical cause, and of those 99, not one would have been prevented by the current third-class medical screening standards and the medical certification process. so this is just another burden on the public--not individuals, but specifically on pilots, and it does not accomplish anything. what we will do now is have consistency in the application of the medical certification process, and it is something that is overdue. it should not be a problem getting that bill passed, and yet it does need explanation. the second thing it does is extend the due process rights preserved in the original pilot's bill of rights bill to all faa certificate holders--not just those who are certificate holders who fly airplanes. there are others who are examiners and work in other fields. they should have the same benefits. what it does is--and this is kind of hard to explain--but if someone is accused of a violation, that individual has a process that has been in law prior to the pilot's bill of rights; and that is, you go through and the faa makes a judgment. then you can appeal it to the ntsb. the ntsb historically has been a rubber stamp for the faa. so it does not really qualify anything. what we did in the pilot's bill of rights 1 is allow an individual then to go into the court system and get what they call a de novo. a de novo means they have a whole process that starts from scratch. they do not just take what the faa says, the ntsb says, but the courts treat it as a new case and look at it. this has not been happening. so we put some teeth in that so [[page s2290]] that will be something that will be workable. so i really feel we are going to be able to do this, and it is really getting the things done that we tried to do in the pilot's bill of rights, but there have been some problems getting the courts to understand it. in fact, in two separate cases, the federal district courts ruled that my original bill did not require a full rehearing of the facts. this legislation explicitly spells out the option to appeal an faa enforcement action to the federal district courts for a guaranteed de novo trial. but they have not been doing it. so this puts teeth in it so they are going to actually have to do it. by the way, there are things that are in there that people are not aware of. for example, in my case, i allegedly did something that was not in compliance with faa rules and regulations, but they did not say what it was. they did not give the evidence. so you did not have access to your evidence. the new bill ensures that is going to happen. the third thing is on notams. a notam is a notice to airmen. it is a pilot's responsibility--this has been true for decades--to know if a notam has been filed by the faa. that is a notice to airmen. but there is not any way of knowing where to find that. in my case, they claimed there was a notam saying that the runway at cameron county airport was closed. that was a lie. there wasn't. there was no notam out there. finally, we proved that was the case. so now we are going to have it enforced so we know where these notices to airmen are filed, and it is going to be the responsibility of the faa to put them in a central location where they would have access to them. this is something that was addressed in the pilot's bill of rights, but somehow it was not specific enough. the teeth we put in this bill is that in the event they do not have it, the notam is published where it can be found in a central location. then the faa cannot use that as an enforcement action. that will get the job done. the fourth thing it does is to extend the liability protection to individuals designated by the faa as aviation medical examiners, pilot examiners, and this type of thing. what this does also is address what we call and most people would refer to as the good samaritan law. i have a lot of pilots--and i have been in the same situation--who want to help. they want to get a patient to a doctor in an emergency situation. i can remember one time many years ago when a tornado went through and destroyed the island of dominica, north of caracas, venezuela. i got 12 pilots together with 12 of their airplanes, and they volunteered to take all the medical supplies down there. now, if something had happened in the meantime, they would have had no protection. yet out of the goodness of their hearts, at their own expense, they were out there trying to save lives. i was there. i know. so this actually is one that is going to give liability protection to individuals other than just the pilots--other people who own faa certificates--and at the same time give protection to those people who are trying to help other people. so i believe this bill should be coming up in the next couple of weeks. it will be going to the commerce committee. i would encourage members to--and particularly those 67 members who were the cosponsors of the original pilot's bill of rights should be on this one too. in fact, most of them are right now. i know senators manchin and boozman were the first two to get on. they happen to be the chairmen of the general aviation caucus in the senate. by the way, we have equal support over in the other body, in the house of representatives. last summer, at the eaa airventure oshkosh fly-in convention--that is the largest fly-in convention anywhere in the world--i hosted a public forum to solicit input for the legislation we are having, the pilot's bill of rights 2, and i received over 400 comments from individuals. these are people who were present at the oshkosh event. so we have solicited their input, and we have all the organizations behind it. i would say, insofar as the one that might become controversial; that is, the exemption on a third-class medical--doctors have unanimously voted in favor of it--they are called the doctors in aviation--and others. this is one of these rare opportunities we have on a bipartisan basis to pass something that is going to offer legal protections to one class of people who currently don't have it and have not had it in the past. i yield the floor. i suggest the absence of a quorum. the presiding officer. the clerk will call the roll. the senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. mr. hoeven. mr. president, i ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. the presiding officer. without objection, it is so ordered. mr. hoeven. mr. president, i rise again to speak in support of the justice for victims of trafficking act. it is good legislation, drafted and introduced by the senator from texas, mr. cornyn, and also the senator from minnesota, ms. klobuchar. they originally put this bill together in the last congress, and i was pleased to be a cosponsor of that bill. i am also very pleased to be an original cosponsor of the legislation they introduced earlier this year, the legislation we have on the floor now. this bill has many important, strong points. i am going to go through some--not all but a number of them. for example, it makes sure victims get restitution and witnesses get rewards for cooperating with law enforcement before others and encourages prosecutors to get training on restitution in human trafficking cases. it also gives law enforcement greater authority to seize the assets of convicted human traffickers, and it protects victims and witnesses by requiring human traffickers to be treated as violent criminals for purposes of pretrial release and detention pending judicial proceedings. it also ensures that federal crime victims are informed of any plea bargain or deferred prosecution agreement in their case and clarifies that the ordinary standard of appellate review applies in cases concerning federal crime victims' rights petitions. it recognizes that child pornography production is a form of human trafficking and ensures that victims have access to direct services at child advocacy centers to help them heal. it allows state and local human trafficking task forces to get wiretap warrants within their own state courts without federal approval. that will help them to more effectively investigate crimes of child pornography, child sexual exploitation, and human trafficking. the bill also improves nationwide communications so law enforcement can better track and capture traffickers and child pornographers. it ensures regular reporting on the number of human trafficking crimes for purposes of the fbi uniform crime reporting program. it also requires law enforcement to upload photos of missing individuals into the national criminal information center database and notify the national center for missing and exploited children of any child reported missing from foster care, and it strengthens current law to reduce demand for human trafficking by encouraging police, prosecutors, judges, and juries to target all persons involved in the buying and selling of human trafficking victims. it is just wrong to prosecute victims and fail to prosecute those who prey on them. this legislation will help for all of those reasons, but this legislation is also very important because it creates a fund from fines and penalties imposed on those who would engage in human trafficking. the fund is important because it not only compensates victims of human trafficking and other crimes of exploitation for their injuries, but it also provides resources to help law enforcement prevent such crimes in the future. as we work on this important issue, it is also very important that we understand that human trafficking is not just a big-state, big-city problem. every state in the country is facing this issue, including my home state of north dakota, but we currently have a challenge addressing this problem. after consulting with the north dakota attorney general's office, we learned that north dakota has been [[page s2291]] discouraged from applying for antihuman trafficking grants, because in its application, the department of justice asks for at least 2 years of local data on human trafficking victims. north dakota, in recent years, has been the fastest growing state in the country. so here we are, the fastest growing state both in terms of population and in terms of income growth. consequently, more so than many states, only recently we have seen significant increases in human trafficking issues. so we don't have that 2 years' worth of data that doj requires, but we very much need assistance with addressing the problem of human trafficking. it is not unique to north dakota. there are other states--typically fast-growing states, states that may have the same kind of energy development or other areas where they have seen a significant influx of people and are continuing to see a significant influx of people. this is a national issue. it is not specific just to my state but to any state where we have seen rapid growth, influx of money, influx of people from outside the state and where human trafficking is an issue. to remedy that, i have offered an amendment to the current legislation we have on the floor now, the cornyn-klobuchar bill, that clarifies that an eligibility entity with a worthy trafficking initiative, in an effort to combat trafficking in its jurisdiction, will not be disadvantaged in receiving funds under the cornyn-klobuchar bill because they, like north dakota--be it a state or whatever--have only recently begun collecting data on human trafficking. so in cases where they don't have 2 years of data, as long as they can demonstrate a valid need and a valid solution to try to address this important issue and to reduce human trafficking, that is what will be required for the application, and not having 2 years of data will not be an issue in terms of scoring or an issue that doj would hold against that application for receipt of the funds for a worthy project. this is important to make sure that all across the country, in every state, we are addressing human trafficking. we all need to be united, in every state across this great country, working to combat human trafficking. that is why this amendment is very important. there are few issues that as a governing body we can be more united on than making sure we protect our children, that we prevent human trafficking in any form, and that we do it on a national basis in every state. that is what my amendment is all about. for this reason, i offer this amendment. i hope it will be included as part of the cornyn-klobuchar legislation, which, as i said earlier, i am only too pleased to cosponsor. the value and importance of this legislation is reflected in the broad coalition of victims' rights and law enforcement organizations that support it. it has been endorsed by nearly 200 groups, from the fraternal order of police to the national center for missing and exploited children. we need to pass this legislation. crimes such as human trafficking and child pornography target the most vulnerable among us in a most despicable way. i urge all of my colleagues to pass this bill, to put an end to modern-day slavery, and to help victims get the support they need. mr. president, i yield the floor. i suggest the absence of a quorum. the presiding officer. the clerk will call the roll. the senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. mr. portman. mr. president, i ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. the presiding officer (mr. lankford). without objection, it is so ordered. the senator from ohio. mr. portman. mr. president, i rise to express my appreciation that this afternoon the senate is finally getting back to legislating on the important issue of human trafficking. it is critical we pass this legislation to combat one of the world's most heinous crimes and one that threatens thousands of innocent people every year. i am the cochair and cofounder of the human trafficking caucus. our opportunity is not only to raise awareness of this issue but also to pass important legislation to address the problem. we learned that human trafficking is now a $32 billion worldwide industry, leaving it only second in size to the drug trade for criminal activity. many view this as an international problem. they think, well, this happens somewhere else or on another continent, such as africa or asia. the fact is it happens right here. of course, every country around the world has a responsibility to fight back against traffickers and stop their acts of violence. but while this industry has a global reach, the reality is that human trafficking is a major problem not only in my home state of ohio, it is a problem in every state represented in the senate. the justice department has told us that the average age of victims getting involved in trafficking is 12 to 14 years old. think about that. these are children. these are kids. the number of american children at risk of sexual exploitation and human trafficking is estimated to be about 300,000. these children represent the most vulnerable among us, and we should make sure we are doing everything we possibly can to protect them. every american life has value and every child deserves a chance to live a bright future. today, however, we can take comfort in knowing we are fighting back against human traffickers and making it harder for their criminal activity to continue in a couple of different ways, both of which are very important. first, our legislation makes it easier to find some of these vulnerable children. missing children are particularly vulnerable, and the legislation i am about to talk about enables us to find those children more quickly and helps to get them into a nurturing environment. second, it will strengthen law enforcement's ability to find and punish those who are committing these crimes. we accomplished the first goal with the bringing missing children home act. it is a bill that i authored with senator chuck schumer of new york. we know there is a strong connection, unfortunately, between sex trafficking victims and children who have been in and out of the child welfare system. we also understand that kids who are missing or who have run away from home are the most vulnerable to trafficking, exploitation, and abuse. the fbi sting in 2014 recovered 168 sex trafficking victims, and nearly all of them had spent time in the child welfare or foster care system. while many of these children had been reported missing, the information obtained by authorities was not sufficient enough to be able to find them, and that is what this legislation gets at. the bringing missing children home act will make it easier to find these children in two different ways. first, it amends the missing children's assistance act by replacing the term ``child prostitution'' with ``child sex trafficking.'' this reinforces the fact that children who are exploited are victims, not criminals. secondly, the bill requires law enforcement agencies to update their records of missing children within 30 days of an initial report with additional information that could include medical or dental records or even a photograph. having this new information, particularly a photograph, is incredibly important when searching for a missing child. i know this because this has been a big problem in my home state of ohio. we started looking at this legislation and considering this bill on the floor on march 6. since march 6, 60 children have been reported missing in my home state of ohio. yet we only have photographs for 14 of them. it is hard to find these children, and not having that information makes it even more difficult. our legislation will help to get those photographs and will help ensure that all of us can play a role in helping to find these missing children. the bill also makes it easier for law enforcement officials on the state and local level to coordinate with child welfare services, and it allows missing persons units and state law enforcement agencies to modify and improve missing children's entries to include important information that was uncovered during an investigation. that is not currently the case. it just makes sense to be able to have better records. while we are making it easier to find trafficking victims, we will also make it easier to find and punish perpetrators of these crimes with legislation i have authored with senator dianne [[page s2292]] feinstein. it is called the combat human trafficking act and is part of this underlying bill we will also be considering here on the floor. this act focuses on those who commit these crimes. it increases the penalties for those who buy acts from sex trafficking victims. it requires new training by the justice department on targeting. it expands reporting on trafficking prosecutions and strengthens victims' rights. a lot of this comes out of what we have learned over the past decade since we have really taken up this issue at the federal level. it improves federal law to take into account the information we now know. through better enforcement of laws against buyers, we will be able to reduce the demand for sexual exploitation and ensure that criminals are prosecuted to the full extent, preventing further trafficking crimes from ever happening. as the cochair of the senate caucus to end human trafficking, it has been a priority of mine to get this legislation passed in an effort to help victims of trafficking and to prevent the number of victims from increasing. i also hope we can add an amendment i authored entitled ``ensuring a better response for victims of child sex trafficking.'' this amendment contains a piece of legislation i authored last year with senator wyden of oregon called the sex trafficking data and response act. it will help improve the information law enforcement officials have about the scope of the trafficking problem. this was signed into law last year, but there is additional information we would like to provide in terms of getting the response part of that bill passed. the bills i have spoken about are important steps to one day ending human trafficking and putting this horrible industry out of business altogether. trafficking deserves no place in america. i thank senator chuck schumer, senator dianne feinstein, and others for their hard work on this legislation i have talked about. i would also like to express how grateful i am that members of this chamber were able to put partisanship behind us, politics aside, and reach common ground to move forward on this important issue. ending human trafficking is clearly a bipartisan goal. it is a nonpartisan goal. it is something on which we should come together. the legislation we have before us today will make a profound impact on so many americans, including some of the most vulnerable. i am happy to see we are a little closer to having these bills become law. i think they will become law once they pass this chamber, go through the house, and are signed by the president. we still have a lot of work to do. this is just a start. after today, the fight to combat human trafficking will be far from over. somewhere in america, there will still be children looking to be found, wondering if anybody cares, despite our legislation. today's legislation will make it easier to find them, but it is still up to all of us. all of us have a role in helping to keep these children from going missing in the first place and then finding and providing them with a nurturing setting and a home where they are embraced and where they can be taken away from the stress of human trafficking and sex trafficking. there will always be traffickers looking to exploit the vulnerable. we know that. but today, if we pass this legislation, we will be sending a warning to those who commit these heinous crimes. as long as you are a perpetrator or an accomplice to human trafficking--folks will know that law enforcement is going to do what it takes to track them down and to punish them. i am glad we have been able to find common ground again and move a little closer to making these positive changes a reality. i am hopeful that we will be able to vote on this today and tomorrow, move this to the house, get it through to the president, and indeed begin to make a difference to my constituents in ohio and around the country. with that, i yield back. i suggest the absence of a quorum. the presiding officer. the clerk will call the roll. the legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. mr. coats. madam president, i ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. the presiding officer (ms. ayotte). without objection, it is so ordered. wasteful spending mr. coats. madam president, i am here today to identify yet another installment of the ``waste of the week.'' we have been doing this now for several weeks, trying to save taxpayers' dollars out of documented waste of their dollars when they send them to washington. in recent weeks, i have highlighted examples of waste, some big some small. to date, we have documented over $47 billion of taxpayer funds that have gone to duplication of effort, simply gone to things the federal government never should have been involved in in the first place, examples of fraud, abuse--$47 billion and climbing on our tax savings gauge here which is approaching now $50 billion. our goal is $100 billion. we are going to keep going as we discover each week yet another waste of taxpayer dollars. this week's ``waste of the week'' involves the federal employees' compensation act, also known as feca. this law was enacted in 1916-- well intended, i think, to provide workers' compensation benefits to civilian federal employees who sustained injuries while employed by the federal government and includes funds for vocational rehabilitation and medical benefits. as i said, it was well intended at the time, providing a lifeline for people injured on the job to keep these people afloat financially until they are ready to go back to work. ``ready to go back to work'' has become somewhat of a major question in terms of how this 1916 law is applied, because you have to wonder, is someone 99 years old looking to go back to work. well, in 1916, when this act was enacted, it treated them as if they were and are able to go back to work. let me explain. both the feca compensation and medical benefits are payable for the duration of a person's inability to work, which can extend well into their individual golden years. you say: how does that all happen? but under current law, there is no maximum duration of benefits and no maximum age at which benefits must be terminated. thus, when beneficiaries become eligible for federal retirement or disability annuities, they are given the choice as to whether they want to remain in the feca program or choose the federal retirement program. well, it is not much of a choice. the choice is obvious because given the level of benefits monthly, feca benefits can be a much better deal than what they would be paid under retirement benefit plans. the feca benefits are as high as 75 percent of the worker's predisability wage. the annual cost-of-living-adjustment is applied each year, the cola, to the benefits. someone came up with a pretty interesting idea here. feca benefits are not taxed. so, clearly, this ends up being a much better deal for beneficiaries. but is it a better deal for taxpayers? that is the question. let's take a closer look. this applies to all federal agencies, but let's take one agency. the department of labor reports that approximately 45,000 cases currently receive long-term disability benefits under feca, and 15,000 or one-third of these cases involve beneficiaries aged 66 or older. clearly, it is time--actually it is past time--to reconsider and make reforms to the feca. at a minimum, we should require workers, when they reach retirement age, to transition into the retirement plan as all their peers have had to do and not continue, throughout their lifetime, the much more generous benefits of feca. as i said, the agency with the most feca claims is the u.s. postal service. i want to use this as an example of how this is applied. the postal service office of inspector general told us that feca rolls include 9,554 postal workers aged 55 or older eligible for retirement; 3,389 aged 65 and over; 928 aged 80 or older; and, yes, one postal worker at the age of 99. so in 2013 the u.s. postal service paid about $1.3 billion in workers' compensation claims and $67 million in administrative fees. in addition, as of june 30, 2014, the estimated workers' compensation liability totaled $17.8 billion. now, while many of these benefits go to workers of a traditional working [[page s2293]] age, the u.s. postal service estimates that these higher than retirement benefits are resulting in an extra $37.8 million being paid out annually. that comes to nearly $400 million over the next 10 years, and that is just from one agency, the u.s. postal service. estimates as to the cost to the taxpayer when all of the federal agencies are included show that more than $1 billion will be spent over the next 10 years in extra workers' compensation payments for those who would unlikely be working throughout the federal workforce. as my colleague, senator susan collins from maine, has been highlighting for years, feca has become a gold-plated retirement system tainted by unfairness, perverse incentives, and the potential for abuse and fraud. this program has become increasingly expensive and requires some commonsense reforms--reforms that many states have already implemented in their own workers' compensation programs. remember, these payments are designed as a bridge to help injured workers until they are able to return to work. that is the most important phrase here--``return to work.'' this program was never intended to serve as a higher paying alternative to the federal retirement system. yet, under the law, it is used for that, and it has cost the taxpayers a significant amount of their tax dollars for unnecessary payments. let's not ignore ways we can improve our fiscal health and return our federal programs, at a minimum, to their original intent. it is time we look at this policy and restore integrity to the feca, the federal employees' compensation act. today, i am adding another $1 billion to the taxpayer savings gauge for this week's waste of the week, and i look forward to discussing ways we can eradicate this waste from our federal budget so that we can give hard-earned dollars back to the taxpayers--money that simply is not used properly and is labeled, of course, a waste of their money. so we have increased--we are approaching $50 billion, and we are shooting up to $100 billion by the end of this year. i am hoping we can go significantly past that. the next step, of course, is to take what we have identified and make sure that the law is changed, that it is reformed, and that we can proudly say to the taxpayer that we are doing our part in washington. while the larger issues of debt and deficit need to be addressed and must be addressed, if we cannot come to consensus on that, at least we can come to consensus on eliminating these egregious abuses of taxpayer dollars. i yield the floor. i suggest the absence of a quorum. the presiding officer (mr. gardner). the clerk will call the roll. the legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. mr. whitehouse. mr. president, i ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. the presiding officer. without objection, it is so ordered. mr. whitehouse. mr. president, i ask unanimous consent to speak for up to 15 minutes as in morning business. the presiding officer. without objection, it is so ordered. climate change mr. whitehouse. mr. president, as americans celebrate the 35th earth day this week, i rise for the 96th time--i seem to be coinciding with the presiding officer's schedule so he has been treated to his share of these speeches--to urge this body to wake up to the threat of climate change. it is real, not a hoax. it is caused by carbon pollution, and it is already making changes that we are already seeing in the world around us. we must cut our carbon pollution to prevent even bigger climate changes--changes in our atmosphere, oceans, and human habitat-- potentially unprecedented in the history of our human habitation of this planet. yet the polluters who are producing this problem would have us do nothing. they make money when we do nothing. so we do nothing. the polluters run a racket. they all float onto us the costs and damage from their fossil fuel product--the costs of heat waves, of sea level rise, of ocean acidification, of dying forests, and more. the polluters happily dump those costs onto everybody else. and to keep this profitable racket running, the polluters spend huge sums on lobbying and politics, particularly right here in the congress. as one author has written, ``rivers of money flowing from secret sources have turned our elections into silent auctions.'' and the polluters get what they pay for. the republican party in congress has become the political arm of the fossil fuel industry. the polluters also spend huge amounts on a big, complex pr machine to churn out doubt about the real science and cook up some paid-for science. documents recently discovered by greenpeace show that one scientist, whose work consistently downplayed the role of carbon pollution and climate change, received--get this--more than $1.2 million from oil and coal interests over the last decade. those nice people at the charles g. koch charitable foundation gave him at least $230,000. in recent years, his grants came through donors trust, the front group that funnels money from oil, coal, and other special interests. well, what do we know? we know that financial incentives affect people's behavior. does anyone doubt that? that is life. that is why politicians have to disclose their political contributors, the gifts and benefits they receive, and even personal financial information. that is why regulatory agencies and scientific journals require scientific submissions to make plain who funded the work. that is why expert witnesses' funding sources are relevant in court proceedings. and that is why upton sinclair once said: ``it's difficult to get a man to understand something when his salary depends on his not understanding it.'' so we know that money talks. that is not news. what else do we know? well, we also know about that industry playbook to keep safety regulation at bay by funding phony science and manufacturing doubt about legitimate science. that is not news, either. that has been around for years. the tobacco industry campaign to mislead the public about the health effects of cigarettes was so fraudulent it was determined in federal court to be a racketeering enterprise. think about that--an industry campaign of deception about the risks of their product that persisted for years and was ultimately determined in federal court to have constituted a racketeering enterprise. does it sound familiar? and tobacco is not alone. the lead paint industry shut down its trade association, the lead industry association, rather than answer questions under oath in a court proceeding. entire books have been written documenting this industry's strategy, for example, ``merchants of doubt,'' which has recently been made into a documentary, or ``doubt is their product,'' or ``lead wars,'' or ``deceit and denial.'' so we know the strategy. finally, we know something else. we know that a network of front organizations with innocent-sounding names has emerged to propagate the baloney science. this phenomenon has been well documented by dr. robert brulle at drexell university, among others. his follow-the-money analysis diagrams the complex flow of cash to these front groups that industry persistently tries to obscure. well, here is what makes sense to me: if it is important enough for them to want to hide it, it is important enough for us to want to know about it. so senators boxer, markey, and i sent a letter to about 100 companies, trade groups, and other organizations affiliated with the fossil fuel industry. we asked whether they spent money to support climate research. it sounds reasonable, based on those three things that we know. well, oh, my, what a fit of caterwauling that drew from the rightwing pr machine. today, i will give a recap of the outrage highlights. it is a ``witch hunt,'' said the far-right heartland institute, ``what fascists do.'' we are ``ethically challenged . . . mental midgets,'' said heartland's president. he later called this little letter ``harassment . . . abuse of authority and misrepresentation of the facts.'' heartland, by the way, is that classy group that put up a billboard comparing climate scientists to the unabomber, just to give an idea of their credibility. finally, ``[s]hame on you,'' read heartland's response to our letter, which heartland called a ``campaign to stigmatize and demonize.'' [[page s2294]] the rightwing john locke foundation said our letter was ``trying to mccarthyite'' them. rightwinger hans von spakovsky of the heritage foundation said it was ``an abuse of power.'' investor's business daily got so excited they mixed up their metaphors to say we were both ``inquisitors'' and ``stalk[ers],'' out to ``intimidate'' and ``threatening peaceful citizens.'' they scoffed, ``as if it were any of [our] business'' to know if polluters are funding the science. keeping that spanish inquisition theme going, the washington times called us ``climate change torquemadas.'' so it looks as if we hit the full faux-outrage quadrifecta--witch hunts, fascism, mccarthyism, and even the spanish inquisition. but then they got really serious, and they unlimbered the ultimate rightwing malediction. we were accused by the cato institute of--cover your ears, young pages--having ``a widespread faith . . . in government's ability to solve problems.'' well, cato made its position on climate change clear, saying that for us ``to believe that man's emissions of carbon dioxide are warming the planet'' was a ``bias'' and that the legitimate science endorsed by everyone from nasa to the department of defense to every legitimate scientific society--every major legitimate scientific society in the country--all of that was ``propaganda,'' and that we, of course, were climate alarmists. cato also sent us a letter in response to our inquiry, telling us we cannot ``use the awesome power of the federal government to cow'' cato and others. cow? according to the wall street journal editorial page, which sadly has become a front for the fossil fuel industry, we were ``trying to silence'' the other side. although, i have to confess, it is not clear how the other side would be silenced by simply having to reveal whose payroll they are on, which is all we asked. let's be clear, our letter didn't suggest that industry scientists should be silenced--just that the public should know if those scientists are being paid by the very industries with a big economic stake in the issue. let's test how much the rightwing front groups care about the suppression of scientific information. let's look at their outrage over the reports of public employees in florida being told--by the government no less--not to talk about climate change. interviews by the florida center for investigative reporting with current and former employees, contractors, and volunteers at the florida department of environmental protection revealed that the administration of republican gov. rick scott issued an unwritten rule banning official use of the phrases ``climate change'' or ``global warming.'' those reports have been corroborated by employees of other state agencies. we have heard stories of retribution against state employees who dare discuss climate change, of climate change-related projects being put on the back burner, and even of the term itself being edited out of official documents, including those produced by a university scientist. it sounds like suppression of science. where was the outrage from the right? where were the comparisons to fascism and mccarthyism and the spanish inquisition for this actual government- sponsored suppression of scientific information? guess what. there was none. it is not just florida. recently, the republican members of wisconsin's board of commissioners of public lands voted to prohibit the professional staff ``from engaging in global warming or climate change work.'' the wisconsin timber industry, as senator baldwin and i have both pointed out, sees the threat climate change poses to wisconsin forests, including, among other things, the frozen winter roads that loggers use to move their equipment around that warmer weather melts and turns to impassable muck. but the republicans in charge of those lands have simply ordered state officials to ignore climate change, suppressing the science--plain and simple. where was the outrage from the rightwing groups that had fits about our little request for some transparency about what scientist is on whose payroll? where was the outrage? there was none, which shows that the real issue has nothing to do with scientific freedom. the real issue here of freedom is the freedom of big, dishonest special interests to hide whose hand is in the puppet. here is where it really gets ironic. the enormous multibillion dollar polluting industries whose front groups accuse us of bullying--of being fascists and intimidators and torquemadas--over our little letter are the very ones pouring hundreds of millions of dollars into elections, much of it secretly, for the plainly avowed purpose of threatening and punishing elected officials who might dare to cross them and acknowledge the dangers of carbon-driven climate change--of all people to be complaining. americans for prosperity, to give one example, a koch brothers venture, has said that republicans who support any action on climate change will be put at a ``severe disadvantage'' in the 2016 elections. that is a serious threat, given the koch brothers' pledge to spend $900 million in this election cycle. yet that same americans for prosperity foundation blasted our little letter as ``an attempt to silence those whose views do not meet with your approval.'' please. really? against a $900 million campaign threat and a stable of paid-for scientists, against that massive screen of fossil fuel front organizations spouting industry propaganda, our little effort at getting a little transparency about who is funding the phony-baloney climate denial science--that is a raindrop against a torrent. we do indeed need to wake up. i yield the floor. the presiding officer. the senator from michigan. ms. stabenow. mr. president, before my prepared comments, i do want to thank the senator from rhode island for his passion and his leadership in coming to the floor over and over again, ringing the alarm bells about what is happening not only to our country but our world. we are paying the price in lives and in dollars. we are seeing our farmers pay the price because we have not effectively addressed what is happening to our world in terms of climate change. i want to thank the senator for his continued passion in reminding us over and over again why we need to act right now. selfridge air national guard deployment mr. president, today 350 airmen from michigan, along with 12 a-10 warthog aircraft, are deploying to the middle east to take part in operation inherent resolve, our nation's mission to eliminate the terrorist group known as isil. this deployment has special significance for michigan. michigan is home to thousands of families and community leaders with loved ones living in the middle east who have seen firsthand the devastating effect of isil as it brutally murders innocent people, drives them from their homes, and destabilizes the region. for so many families in michigan, the fight against isil is deeply personal. today, that fight is personal to many more families as these airmen from selfridge air national guard base deploy to the region. the a-10 warthogs are the very best close air support aircraft in the u.s. military. known as a tankbuster, the a-10 is ideal against isil, which uses tanks stolen from the iraqi army. we in michigan are proud of our fleet. we are proud of our people, their courage, their passion, and their hard work. we are proud for all they have done to protect our nation. in 2011, the 127th wing at selfridge deployed 300 airmen and one dozen a-10s to kandahar airfield, a nato base in southern afghanistan. over 120 days, the unit logged over 8,000 flight hours in 2,000 flight missions in an extremely hostile environment. today, i ask my colleagues in the senate to keep these 350 airmen in your thoughts and prayers. we wish them godspeed as they embark on this very important mission, and we remember especially their families and friends who will stay behind and support them with their prayers as well. i suggest the absence of a quorum. the presiding officer. the clerk will call the roll. the senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. (mr. daines assumed the chair.) mr. mcconnell. mr. president, i ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. the presiding officer (mr. rounds). without objection, it is so ordered. [[page s2295]] mr. mcconnell. mr. president, i ask unanimous consent that when the senate resumes consideration of s. 178 on wednesday, april 22, senator cornyn or his designee be recognized to withdraw the pending cornyn amendment and offer amendments nos. 1124 and 301. i further ask that there then be 1 hour of debate, equally divided in the usual form, and that following the use or yielding back of time, the senate vote on the leahy amendment no. 301, followed by a vote on amendment no. 1124, both with a 60-vote affirmative threshold for adoption. i further ask that if the cornyn-murray-klobuchar amendment is agreed to, the time until 2 p.m. be equally divided in the usual form, and the senate then vote on the following amendments in the order listed, with 2 minutes of debate equally divided before each vote: cornyn no. 1127; leahy no. 290; brown no. 311; burr no. 1121; and kirk no. 273, as modified. i further ask that amendments in the preceding list each be subject to a 60-vote affirmative threshold for adoption, and that following disposition of these amendments, there then be 5 minutes equally divided in the usual form, followed by votes on the following amendments, which have been cleared by the managers and should be adopted by voice vote: klobuchar no. 296; hoeven no. 299, as modified; sullivan no. 279; wicker no. 1126; flake no. 294; cassidy no. 308; portman no. 1128; brown no. 310; brown no. 312; heller no. 1122; and shaheen no. 303. i further ask that there be no second-degrees in order to any of the amendments listed and that following disposition of the shaheen amendment, the committee-reported substitute, as amended, be agreed to, the bill, as amended, be read a third time, and the senate proceed to a vote on passage. the presiding officer. is there objection? the senator from oregon. mr. wyden. mr. president, reserving the right to object, would the majority leader consider at this time modifying his request to drop the kirk amendment no. 273? the presiding officer. will the majority leader so modify his request? the senator from texas. mr. cornyn. mr. president, as i understand, the distinguished senator from oregon is asking to amend the consent request. i would reserve the right to object to that request and make the simple point that the kirk amendment targets online child exploitation and sex trafficking, which is rampant. given the fact that the internet is now one of the principal tools used, on web sites such as backpage.com, thousands of american children and human trafficking victims are sold into slavery. it is simply unconscionable for us to stand by and allow this to continue. what senator kirk is asking for, which i support and believe we should do, is a simple up-or-down vote on the kirk amendment. so i reserve the right to object and ask our colleague to allow this up-or- down vote on the kirk amendment. the presiding officer. will the majority leader so modify his request? mr. mcconnell. mr. president, the answer is no, but i think the senator from oregon wishes to respond. mr. wyden. mr. president, continuing my reservation, i don't take a backseat to anyone when it comes to fighting for the victims of sex trafficking. as the distinguished senator from texas knows, i was an original cosponsor of this legislation, and much of it is based on bills i have written and advocated on behalf of for years, including with the distinguished senator from texas. much of this sex trafficking legislation, colleagues, is based on meetings and discussions i have had for years with young women who have been trafficked, law enforcement officials, and community leaders. i remember like it was yesterday how i was with the portland police on 82nd avenue in east portland, and we encountered young women in their early teens who walked around with knives in their purses just hoping to survive the evening. the underlying legislation before us, in my view, is going to be a very valuable tool in helping women like those whom i saw in southeast portland. unfortunately, an amendment that senator kirk seeks to offer has been attached to this request that undermines the legal foundation of every social media platform and attacks a basic cornerstone of internet law. the kirk amendment will undermine the fight to help victims by distracting the focus of prosecutors from the pimps and the johns who prey on these young women. the vague language in the kirk amendment would mean any web site that hosts user-generated contact--that means any social media platform, any news sites with comments and classified sections and any e-commerce sites--could face felony charges based on a vague concept of knowing and a vague concept of advertising. instead of focusing resources on going after pimps and traffickers, the kirk amendment would enable prosecutors to go after web sites millions of americans use for nonnefarious purposes, chilling innovation. under current law, prosecutors already have the ability to go after any entity that knowingly profits from sex trafficking. every minute our prosecutors are occupied going after legitimate businesses, in my view, is time not spent locking up the real criminals. this amendment hurts america's innovative businesses and entrepreneurs and stifles free speech instead of getting tough on the sex traffickers whom senator cornyn and i have sought to target all these years. so i will close by simply saying i am for throwing the book at every sex trafficker and those who enable them. our country absolutely must do everything we can to prevent the next child from falling victim to these predators. in my view, the kirk amendment distracts from that goal. i hope it will not ultimately be added to this important piece of legislation. i hope senators will vote no on the kirk amendment. with that, mr. president, i withdraw my reservation to the request. the presiding officer. is there any objection to the request of the majority leader? without objection, it is so ordered. ____________________",56937

CREC-2015-04-21-pt1-PgS2295-4,CREC-2015-04-21,114,REMEMBERING NORMAN H. BANGERTER,"[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 58 (Tuesday, April 21, 2015)] [Senate] [Pages S2295-S2296] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] REMEMBERING NORMAN H. BANGERTER Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, today I wish to pay tribute to a loving father, [[Page S2296]] a visionary leader, a committed public servant, and a cherished friend--former Utah Governor Norman ``Norm'' Howard Bangerter. As Utah's 13th Governor, Norm established himself as one of the strongest leaders to ever hold public office in our State. Norm's roots were deeply entrenched in the west side of the Salt Lake Valley, and he often referred to himself as a ``humble farmer and carpenter'' who learned the value of hard work from a young age. His parents, William and Isabelle Bangerter, instilled in their 11 children a strong moral compass and a desire to help others--virtues he carried with him throughout his life. Norm first entered politics in 1974 when he ran for the Utah House of Representatives. He gained a surprise victory, which put him on a path of strong representation and leadership for his constituents. Norm served 10 years as a State representative, including 4 years as the speaker of the house. During Norm's first term as Governor, Utah faced formidable challenges. Never one to shrink from duty, Norm confronted these challenges head-on, exhibiting the exceptional judgment and foresight that would distinguish him as our State's chief executive. In making these difficult decisions, Governor Bangerter always sought to do what was right over what was politically expedient. He laid a strong framework for his governance, which included ``the three e's''-- education, economic development, and efficiency in government. Later in his tenure, he added a fourth ``e''--the environment. After Governor Bangerter won reelection in 1988, the difficult decisions of his first term began to bear fruit. Utah had raised its profile as a fiscally well-managed State, and the success of the Governor's economic development projects encouraged several prominent companies to relocate or expand in Utah. The Bangerter administration cut budgets, created jobs, expanded the economy, and provided a foundation for fiscal responsibility that still exists today. Although public service was important to Norm, his family was always paramount. In 1953, he married Colleen Monson, who was his loyal friend and constant companion through nearly 58 years of marriage until she passed away in 2011. Together they raised 7 children and were grandparents to 30 grandchildren and 31 great-grandchildren. In 2012, Norm married Judy Schiffman, who was a dear friend and support to Norm and his family. His daily life was always spent with family by his side. Family time was sacred and essential to Norm, and he firmly believed that family was the most important component of life. Norm not only served willingly in the public arena, he also served diligently in his church, assuming several important leadership positions in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. He served for 18 years as a bishop and as a stake president, and later presided with his wife, Colleen, over the Johannesburg, South Africa Mission from 1996 to 1999. After his missionary service, Norm spent many hours each week volunteering in the LDS Church's Jordan River Temple. His life was an example of compassion and service, modeled after our Savior, Jesus Christ. Throughout my years of public service, I have had the privilege of knowing, working with, and learning from Governor Norm Bangerter. We spoke often, and I could always count on him to share with me his no- nonsense wisdom and his passionate advice. Our conversations were always spirited, and they played an indispensable role in my own public service. He fought for what he believed in with great determination and fervor, and he was never afraid to express his opinions. I appreciated our conversations more than he probably knew, and I will miss his sage advice and loyal friendship. Elaine and I will greatly miss our dear friend, Governor Norm Bangerter. The impact he made on Utah cannot be overstated. He led during difficult times and was a steadfast anchor for our State. He was also a noble servant of our Heavenly Father, and a strong, loving husband, father, and grandfather to his cherished family. He left an indelible impression on me and on all those who had the privilege of knowing him. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 58 (Tuesday, April 21, 2015)] [Senate] [Pages S2295-S2296] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] REMEMBERING NORMAN H.

CREC-2015-04-21-pt1-PgS2296,CREC-2015-04-21,114,TRADE ADJUSTMENT ASSISTANCE ENHANCEMENT ACT,"[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 58 (Tuesday, April 21, 2015)] [Senate] [Pages S2296-S2297] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] TRADE ADJUSTMENT ASSISTANCE ENHANCEMENT ACT Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I am joined by my colleague Senator Ron Wyden in introducing the Trade Adjustment Assistance, TAA, Enhancement Act of 2015. This legislation would reauthorize trade adjustment assistance programs to help American workers who lose their jobs as a result of foreign competition. These programs are an investment in the American worker and are essential to helping those who are negatively affected by international trade to get the skills and training to prepare for jobs in other industries. The Trade Adjustment Assistance Enhancement Act of 2015 would cover affected workers in the manufacturing, service, and agricultural sectors. In addition to covering workers whose jobs shift to countries with which the United States has a Free Trade Agreement, the bill would also extend to job losses from non-FTA countries, such as China or India. It would make eligible for assistance those who have been laid off due to unfair foreign subsidies or dumping practices, as long as the layoff occurs within 1 year of an affirmative injury determination by the International Trade Commission. Our bill would also authorize an investment of up to $575 million per year to train workers in new, in-demand skills, thereby providing them with the opportunity to find lasting employment that will ensure greater economic stability in years to come. It would also provide extended unemployment insurance for those enrolled in an approved training program. For older workers seeking quick reemployment, our bill would provide wage insurance to cover up to 50 percent of the wage differential between the old job and the new job. It would also provide assistance to those who must commute a greater distance or relocate altogether to find new employment. Under our bill, farmers, fishermen, and aquaculture producers would also be eligible for targeted training and assistance programs designed to help increase their competitiveness. The bill would further clarify that fishermen and aquaculture producers may receive TAA benefits whether they are competing against farmed or wild-caught fish or seafood imports. Small, rural communities in my home State of Maine have been hit hard by closures or partial shutdowns of mills, manufacturing plants, or other businesses that, in many cases, represent a large portion of jobs in the surrounding communities. In the past year, the communities of Lincoln, Millinocket, and Bucksport have experienced such devastating job losses. Moreover, the second and third-order economic effects on other businesses is significant. When these jobs are abruptly lost on such a massive scale, entire communities and the surrounding area are devastated. In times of such great upheaval, the laid off employees, who lost their good jobs through no fault of their own, need the time, support, and resources to learn new skills and seek viable employment opportunities. TAA programs have made a tremendous difference in the lives of those working in trade-affected industries in Maine, such as the pulp and paper manufacturing, lobster, and blueberry industries. In fiscal year 2013, more than 700 Mainers benefitted from these programs, which led to an employment retention rate of more than 90 percent. In the last year alone, the Department of Labor approved TAA benefits for the hundreds of workers who lost their jobs with the closures of the Verso Paper mill in Bucksport, the Lincoln Paper and Tissue mill in Lincoln, the Great Northern Paper mill in East Millinocket, and the UTC Fire and Security plant in Pittsfield. Previously, TAA benefited former employees of the Great Northern Paper mill in Millinocket when it closed, in addition to lobstermen and wild blueberry producers who needed help increasing the competitiveness of their unique commodities. Recently, I had the opportunity to visit Eastern Maine Community College and tour its Fine Woodworking and Cabinet Making Shop. I met with a group of students formerly employed at the Bucksport Verso Paper mill, who now have the opportunity to learn a new skill because of the funds available through TAA. [[Page S2297]] TAA has been vitally important in helping Maine workers, and those across the Nation, who have been harmed by trade get the skills and training they need to prepare for jobs in other industries. Reauthorization of trade adjustment assistance programs must be a part of the national trade policy debate, and I am pleased that the Senate recognized the importance of TAA by approving the bipartisan amendment that I authored to the Budget Resolution related to reauthorizing TAA. I urge my colleagues to support the bipartisan Trade Adjustment Assistance Enhancement Act of 2015 to continue crucial investments in the American worker and protect them from unfair trade practices and increased imports. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 58 (Tuesday, April 21, 2015)] [Senate] [Pages S2296-S2297] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] TRADE ADJUSTMENT ASSISTANCE ENHANCEMENT ACT Ms. COLLINS.

Mr. President, I support the Volunteer Income Tax Assistance Act. Each year, tax payers across the country utilize accountants, tax software, and lawyers as they prepare their returns. For millions of low-income families, high-cost, high-tech tax assistance is not an option. As a result, the families most in need of tax preparation assistance--low- and moderate-income families, including elderly and disabled taxpayers--will fail to file their taxes or miss out on valuable tax credits. The IRS created the Volunteer Income Tax Assistance, VITA program in 1969 to assist individuals and families in submitting their Federal tax returns. For decades, this program operated predominantly with the resources and facilities of community partners. In 2007, Congress created a demonstration program awarding matching grants to VITA sites to serve additional low-income individuals and families. Since 2008, the VITA grant program has grown to over 200 grant recipients but is still only able to fund about two-thirds of grant applicants. During the 2014 Federal income tax filing season, VITA programs filed approximately 1.7 million tax returns. Of those 1.7 million returns, more than 551,000 claimed the Earned Income Tax Credit as part of nearly $2.5 billion in tax refunds that went to VITA tax filers. In addition, VITA programs improve accuracy in the return process and reduce IRS costs by e-filing. In 2014, VITA program tax returns were e- filed 96 percent of the time, compared to 86 percent for the rest of the population. Funding for the VITA program remains insufficient to meet demand and has not been made permanent. The Volunteer Income Tax Assistance Act would ensure that volunteers and nonprofits across the country can continue to provide essential tax preparation services each spring by creating a permanent matching grant program for VITA sites. The act would also build on the success of the VITA program by creating a National Center to Promote Quality, Excellence, and Evaluation in Volunteer Income Tax Assistance. Through the center, VITA's many sites would have a mechanism to share best practices and create a more efficient and sustainable program to serve a large number of low- and middle-income families. I ask that my colleagues join me in supporting working families by cosponsoring the Volunteer Income Tax Assistance Act. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 58 (Tuesday, April 21, 2015)] [Senate] [Page S2297] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] VOLUNTEER INCOME TAX ASSISTANCE ACT Mr. BROWN.

CREC-2015-04-21-pt1-PgS2297-2,CREC-2015-04-21,114,RECOGNIZING SANOFI'S PENNSYLVANIA EMPLOYEES,"[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 58 (Tuesday, April 21, 2015)] [Senate] [Page S2297] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] RECOGNIZING SANOFI'S PENNSYLVANIA EMPLOYEES Mr. TOOMEY. Mr. President, I wish to recognize the contributions to global public health by the Pennsylvania employees of Sanofi. Yesterday, at the White House, they were presented with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office's Patent for Humanity award, in recognition of the development of a patented chemical and industrial process for producing semi-synthetic artemisinin, which is used in the creation of combination therapies, ACTs, treating malaria. Malaria is one of the most deadly infectious diseases in the world, with 200 million cases in almost 100 countries. In 2013, an estimated 584,000 people died from malaria. This parasitic infection most significantly burdens countries with the highest rates of poverty. In Africa, where 90 percent of all malaria cases occur, one child dies every minute from the condition. Artemisinin is an important antimalarial drug derived from the sweet wormwood plant in Asia and Africa, but weather and other factors can yield an uncertain supply of natural artemisinin, threatening patients' access. Thus, developing semi-synthetic artemisinin will enable a stable supply of high-quality medication at affordable prices on a no- profit, no-loss model, lead to a stronger supply chain, and place more ACTs in the hands of the most vulnerable patients. Sanofi hopes to produce annually an average of 50 to 60 tons of artemisinin, which will produce 80 to 150 million ACT treatments. This project to produce semi-synthetic artemisinin began in 2007, and involves a partnership with the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, the University of California Berkeley, the global health charity PATH, Sanofi, and Amirys. I would like to commend in particular Alain Werner, Robert Sebbag, and Philippe Charreau of Sanofi who led the organization's work on this important project. Sanofi's achievement is only one example of a rich history of dedicating its resources to combat the world's most deadly diseases. Their work on malaria dates back to the 1930s. More recently, Sanofi, which has 112,000 employees and retains core strengths in human vaccines, animal health, consumer healthcare, diabetes, and rare diseases, created its Access to Medicines program to improve access to healthcare in the poorest countries. As the Senate continues to work on legislation to speed the development of therapies, I ask my colleagues keep in mind the important incentives and intellectual property protections that encourage scientists, such as those responsible for this breakthrough, to create lifesaving medicines for patients worldwide. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 58 (Tuesday, April 21, 2015)] [Senate] [Page S2297] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] RECOGNIZING SANOFI'S PENNSYLVANIA EMPLOYEES Mr. TOOMEY.

I am also pleased to transmit my written approval, authorization, and determination concerning the Agreement, and an unclassified Nuclear Proliferation Assessment Statement (NPAS) concerning the Agreement. (In accordance with section 123 of the Act, as amended by Title XII of the Foreign Affairs Reform and Restructuring Act of 1998 (Public Law 105-277), two classified annexes to the NPAS, prepared by the Secretary of State, in consultation with the Director of National Intelligence, summarizing relevant classified information, will be submitted to the Congress separately.) The joint memorandum submitted to me by the Secretaries of State and Energy and a letter from the Chairman of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission stating the views of the Commission are also enclosed. An addendum to the NPAS containing a comprehensive analysis of China's export control system with respect to nuclear-related matters, including interactions with other countries of proliferation concern and the actual or suspected nuclear, dual-use, or missile- [[Page S2298]] related transfers to such countries, pursuant to section 102A(w) of the National Security Act of 1947 (50 U.S.C. 3024(w)), is being submitted separately by the Director of National Intelligence. The proposed Agreement has been negotiated in accordance with the Act and other applicable law. In my judgment, it meets all applicable statutory requirements and will advance the nonproliferation and other foreign policy interests of the United States. The proposed Agreement provides a comprehensive framework for peaceful nuclear cooperation with China based on a mutual commitment to nuclear nonproliferation. It would permit the transfer of material, equipment (including reactors), components, information, and technology for nuclear research and nuclear power production. It does not permit transfers of any Restricted Data. Transfers of sensitive nuclear technology, sensitive nuclear facilities, and major critical components of such facilities may only occur if the Agreement is amended to cover such transfers. In the event of termination, key nonproliferation conditions and controls continue with respect to material, equipment, and components subject to the Agreement. The proposed Agreement would obligate the United States and China to work together to enhance their efforts to familiarize commercial entities in their respective countries about the requirements of the Agreement as well as national export controls and policies applicable to exports and imports subject to the Agreement. It would have a term of 30 years from the date of its entry into force. Either party may terminate the proposed Agreement on at least 1 year's written notice to the other party. Since the 1980s, China has become a party to several nonproliferation treaties and conventions and worked to bring its domestic export control authorities in line with international standards. China joined the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons in 1992 as a nuclear weapon state, brought into force an Additional Protocol to its International Atomic Energy Agency safeguards agreement in 2002, and joined the Nuclear Suppliers Group in 2004. China is a party to the Convention on the Physical Protection of Nuclear Material, which establishes international standards of physical protection for use, storage, and transport of nuclear material, and has ratified the 2005 Amendment to the Convention. A more detailed discussion of China's civil nuclear program and its nuclear nonproliferation policies and practices, including its nuclear export policies and practices, is provided in the NPAS and in two classified annexes to the NPAS submitted to you separately. As noted above, the Director of National Intelligence will provide an addendum to the NPAS containing a comprehensive analysis of the export control system of China with respect to nuclear-related matters. I have considered the views and recommendations of the interested departments and agencies in reviewing the proposed Agreement and have determined that its performance will promote, and will not constitute an unreasonable risk to, the common defense and security. Accordingly, I have approved the proposed Agreement and authorized its execution and urge that the Congress give it favorable consideration. This transmission shall constitute a submittal for purposes of both sections 123 b. and 123 d. of the Act. My Administration is prepared to begin immediately the consultations with the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and the House Foreign Affairs Committee as provided in section 123 b.

(in accordance with section 123 of the act, as amended by title xii of the foreign affairs reform and restructuring act of 1998 (public law 105-277), two classified annexes to the npas, prepared by the secretary of state, in consultation with the director of national intelligence, summarizing relevant classified information, will be submitted to the congress separately.) the joint memorandum submitted to me by the secretaries of state and energy and a letter from the chairman of the nuclear regulatory commission stating the views of the commission are also enclosed. an addendum to the npas containing a comprehensive analysis of china's export control system with respect to nuclear-related matters, including interactions with other countries of proliferation concern and the actual or suspected nuclear, dual-use, or missile- [[page s2298]] related transfers to such countries, pursuant to section 102a(w) of the national security act of 1947 (50 u.s.c. 3024(w)), is being submitted separately by the director of national intelligence. the proposed agreement has been negotiated in accordance with the act and other applicable law. in my judgment, it meets all applicable statutory requirements and will advance the nonproliferation and other foreign policy interests of the united states. the proposed agreement provides a comprehensive framework for peaceful nuclear cooperation with china based on a mutual commitment to nuclear nonproliferation. it would permit the transfer of material, equipment (including reactors), components, information, and technology for nuclear research and nuclear power production. it does not permit transfers of any restricted data. transfers of sensitive nuclear technology, sensitive nuclear facilities, and major critical components of such facilities may only occur if the agreement is amended to cover such transfers. in the event of termination, key nonproliferation conditions and controls continue with respect to material, equipment, and components subject to the agreement. the proposed agreement would obligate the united states and china to work together to enhance their efforts to familiarize commercial entities in their respective countries about the requirements of the agreement as well as national export controls and policies applicable to exports and imports subject to the agreement. it would have a term of 30 years from the date of its entry into force. either party may terminate the proposed agreement on at least 1 year's written notice to the other party. since the 1980s, china has become a party to several nonproliferation treaties and conventions and worked to bring its domestic export control authorities in line with international standards. china joined the treaty on the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons in 1992 as a nuclear weapon state, brought into force an additional protocol to its international atomic energy agency safeguards agreement in 2002, and joined the nuclear suppliers group in 2004. china is a party to the convention on the physical protection of nuclear material, which establishes international standards of physical protection for use, storage, and transport of nuclear material, and has ratified the 2005 amendment to the convention. a more detailed discussion of china's civil nuclear program and its nuclear nonproliferation policies and practices, including its nuclear export policies and practices, is provided in the npas and in two classified annexes to the npas submitted to you separately. as noted above, the director of national intelligence will provide an addendum to the npas containing a comprehensive analysis of the export control system of china with respect to nuclear-related matters. i have considered the views and recommendations of the interested departments and agencies in reviewing the proposed agreement and have determined that its performance will promote, and will not constitute an unreasonable risk to, the common defense and security. accordingly, i have approved the proposed agreement and authorized its execution and urge that the congress give it favorable consideration. this transmission shall constitute a submittal for purposes of both sections 123 b. and 123 d. of the act. my administration is prepared to begin immediately the consultations with the senate foreign relations committee and the house foreign affairs committee as provided in section 123 b. upon completion of the 30 days of continuous session review provided for in section 123 b., the 60 days of continuous session review provided for in section 123 d. shall commence. barack obama. the white house, april 21, 2015. ____________________",5905

A bill to require notification of information security breaches and to enhance penalties for cyber criminals, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation. Mrs. GILLIBRAND. Mr. President, I rise to speak about two bipartisan bills that would help to modernize the way this country approaches cyber security. Congress needs to get with the times and realize that the Internet is no longer a new concept. Swiping a credit card, conducting online banking, storing prescription records online--these are not new activities. The cloud is no longer new. Hackers are no longer new. So why are we still so taken aback, in shock, every time we suffer another major cyber attack? Why are we still not requiring that consumers be notified when their information has been stolen? Why aren't we unleashing law enforcement to go after cyber criminals? If we want to defend against 21st-century threats, then we have to bring our laws into the 21st century. We have to get out of the mindset that the only way we can be hurt is from an actual physical attack. Hackers don't operate on battlefields; they operate in basements and in cubicles. Our approach to cyber security so far has been certifiably wrong. We have the largest defense budget in the world by far, but that hasn't stopped our hospitals and banks from falling victim to a near constant barrage of attacks. Last year, data breaches in this country hit a record high; they were up more than 27 percent from the year before. In New York State, between 2006 and 2013, we had nearly 5,000 individual data breaches that were reported by businesses, not-for-profits, and government entities. In the same period, 23 million personal records of New Yorkers were exposed to criminals. And that is just my home State. Imagine how big that number actually is nationwide. We are long overdue for a new national approach to cyber security, and I am introducing two bills that would finally make this happen. The first is the Data Breach Notification and Punishing Cyber Criminals Act. It would set, for the first time, a national standard for how and when victims of cyber attacks will be informed. When an attack takes place on a business, for example, one that has your financial data or medical information, this law would require that you be informed quickly, with information about what was targeted, what was taken, and whether you were personally affected. This bill would seriously increase the penalties on people found guilty of hacking and cyber crime. It would raise the allowable fines and imprisonment sentences for many of the most common cyber crimes, including identity theft and theft of personal information. The second bill is the Cybersecurity Information Sharing Credit Act-- a bill that would incentivize America's businesses to share cyber security information critical to preventing attacks, without having to involve their competitors. Instead, businesses would be encouraged, with significant tax credits, to adopt the preferred, most efficient method for information sharing; that is, membership in private, sector- specific cyber security networks designed to protect an industry, such as health care and hospitals, from attack. At the individual level, companies, hospitals, and banks can only do so much to protect us. Any good cyber defense has to involve information sharing so that patterns can be recognized, industries can bolster their defenses, and the same hacks aren't just repeated over and over again. To modernize America's approach to cyber security, we as individuals have to take action, companies have to take action, law enforcement has to take action, and local governments must take action. Most importantly and most urgently, Congress has to take action. We desperately need to modernize our cyber security laws. I urge my colleagues to support these two bills. ______ By Mr. WYDEN (for himself and Mr. Paul): S. 1030. A bill to amend title 18, United States Code, to provide for clarification as to the meaning of access without authorization, and for other purposes; to the Committee on the Judiciary. Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, today I am reintroducing the Aaron's Law Act of 2015 to reform the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, a sweeping anti-hacking law that criminalizes many forms of common Internet and computer use. This overly broad law currently allows breathtaking levels of prosecutorial discretion that invites serious overuse and abuse. Together with Senator Rand Paul, and my colleagues in the House of Representatives, we introduce legislation to fix the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act which is long overdue for reform. Aaron's Law would curb the abuses of this outdated law while still preserving the tools needed to prosecute malicious attacks. Our bill, inspired by the late Internet innovator and activist Aaron Swartz, who faced up to 35 years in prison for an act of civil disobedience, would reform the quarter-century-old law to better reflect computer and Internet activities in the digital age. Numerous and recent instances of heavy-handed prosecutions for non-malicious computer crimes have raised serious questions as to how the law treats violations of terms of service, employer agreement or website notices. Aaron's Law is smart legislation that keeps up with the constant evolution of the Internet, and honors the late Aaron Swartz. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record. There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows: S. 1030 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. This Act may be cited as the ``Aaron's Law Act of 2015''. SEC. 2.

(b) Conforming Amendment.--Section 1030 of title 18, United States Code, is amended-- [[Page S2305]] (1) in subsection (d)(10), by striking ``unauthorized access, or exceeding authorized access, to a'' and inserting ``access without authorization of a protected''; and (2) by striking ``exceeds authorized access'' each place it appears. SEC. 3. ELIMINATING REDUNDANCY. (a) Repeal.--Section 1030(a) of title 18, United States Code, is amended-- (1) by striking paragraph (4); and (2) by redesignating paragraphs (5), (6), and (7) as paragraphs (4), (5), and (6), respectively. (b) Conforming Amendments.--Section 1030 of title 18, United States Code, is amended-- (1) in subsection (c)-- (A) in paragraph (2), by striking ``(a)(6)'' each place it appears and inserting ``(a)(5)''; and (B) in paragraph (3)-- (i) in subparagraph (A), by striking ``subsection (a)(4) or (a)(7)'' and inserting ``subsection (a)(6)''; and (ii) in subparagraph (B), by striking ``subsection (a)(4), or (a)(7)'' and inserting ``subsection (a)(6)''; and (C) in paragraph (4)-- (i) in subparagraph (A)(i), in the matter preceding clause (i), by striking ``subsection (a)(5)(B)'' and inserting ``subsection (a)(4)(B)''; (ii) in subparagraph (B)(i), by striking ``subsection (a)(5)(A)'' and inserting ``subsection (a)(4)(A)''; (iii) in subparagraph (C)(i), by striking ``subsection (a)(5)'' and inserting ``subsection (a)(4)''; (iv) in subparagraph (D)(i), by striking ``subsection (a)(5)(C)'' and inserting ``subsection (a)(4)(C)''; (v) in subparagraph (E), by striking ``subsection (a)(5)(A)'' and inserting ``subsection (a)(4)(A)''; (vi) in subparagraph (F), by striking ``subsection (a)(5)(A)'' and inserting ``subsection (a)(4)(A)''; and (vii) in subparagraph (G)(i), by striking ``subsection (a)(5)'' and inserting ``subsection (a)(4)''; and (2) in subsection (h), by striking ``subsection (a)(5)'' and inserting ``subsection (a)(4)''. SEC. 4. MAKING PENALTIES PROPORTIONAL TO CRIMES. (a) Section 1030(c)(2) of title 18, United States Code, is amended-- (1) in subparagraph (A)-- (A) by striking ``conviction for another'' and inserting ``subsequent''; and (B) by inserting ``such'' after ``attempt to commit''; (2) in subparagraph (B)(i), by inserting after ``financial gain'' the following: ``and the fair market value of the information obtained exceeds $5,000''; (3) in subparagraph (B)(ii), by striking ``the offense was committed'' and all that follows through the semicolon, and inserting the following: ``the offense was committed in furtherance of any criminal act in violation of the Constitution or laws of the United States or of any State punishable by a term of imprisonment greater than one year, unless such criminal acts are prohibited by this section or such State violation would be based solely on accessing information without authorization;''; (4) in subparagraph (B)(iii), by inserting ``fair market'' before ``value''; and (5) in subparagraph (C)-- (A) by striking ``conviction for another'' and inserting ``subsequent''; and (B) by inserting ``such'' after ``attempt to commit''. ______ By Mr. GRASSLEY (for himself, Mr. Lee, Mr. Vitter, Mr. Enzi, Mrs. Fischer, Mr. Corker, Mr. Cotton, Mr. Inhofe, Mr. Wicker, Mrs. Capito, Mr. Boozman, Mr. Sessions, and Mr. Perdue): S. 1032. A bill to expand the use of E-Verify, to hold employers accountable, and for other purposes; to the Committee on the Judiciary. Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, in 1986, Congress made it unlawful for employers to knowingly hire or employ individuals who are not eligible to work in the United States. Identity theft and counterfeit documents have made a mockery of this law. Under current law, if the documents provided by an employee reasonably appear on their face to be genuine, the employer has met its obligation to review the worker's documents. This is why Congress created a pilot program, known as the Basic Pilot program, to help employers verify the work eligibility of its new hires. This program has allowed employers to check records maintained by the Department of Homeland Security and the Social Security Administration. It was successful, and in 2003, Congress made the program available in all 50 States. Now known as E-Verify, this nationwide program is free for employers and accessible via the internet. This program has been a valuable tool for those who want to hire a legal workforce. Employers like it. In fact, according to Westat, a private statistical survey research corporation that conducted a survey last year, 97 percent of employers found E-Verify user-friendly, and 92 percent said the program was effective. Employers also reported that ``E-Verify takes the guess work out of determining the validity of documents, provides immediate results, offers reassurance that the company is not hiring unauthorized workers, and helps them to show a good faith effort to comply with the law.'' So, today, along with several colleagues, I am introducing legislation to permanently authorize and expand the E-Verify program. My bill, the Accountability Through Electronic Verification Act, will ensure that employers can rely on this program while holding them accountable for their hiring practices. My bill would make E-Verify a staple in every workplace. It would pave the way to modify and simplify the I-9 process required today. It would increase penalties on employers who hire people unauthorized to work in the country. Employers would be required to check the status of current employees within three years, and would allow employers to run a check prior to offering a job, saving that employer valuable time and resources. Employers will also be required to re-check those workers whose authorization is about to expire, such as those who come to the United States on temporary visas. As Congress considers the reauthorization of E-Verify this year, I hope my bill will be a starting point for discussion. We need to enhance and expand the program so that our immigration laws are being upheld. I hope my colleagues will consider joining me in making E- Verify a permanent part of our immigration laws. ______ By Mr. McCONNELL (for himself and Mr. Burr): S. 1035.

A bill to require notification of information security breaches and to enhance penalties for cyber criminals, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation. Mrs. GILLIBRAND. Mr. President, I rise to speak about two bipartisan bills that would help to modernize the way this country approaches cyber security. Congress needs to get with the times and realize that the Internet is no longer a new concept. Swiping a credit card, conducting online banking, storing prescription records online--these are not new activities. The cloud is no longer new. Hackers are no longer new. So why are we still so taken aback, in shock, every time we suffer another major cyber attack? Why are we still not requiring that consumers be notified when their information has been stolen? Why aren't we unleashing law enforcement to go after cyber criminals? If we want to defend against 21st-century threats, then we have to bring our laws into the 21st century. We have to get out of the mindset that the only way we can be hurt is from an actual physical attack. Hackers don't operate on battlefields; they operate in basements and in cubicles. Our approach to cyber security so far has been certifiably wrong. We have the largest defense budget in the world by far, but that hasn't stopped our hospitals and banks from falling victim to a near constant barrage of attacks. Last year, data breaches in this country hit a record high; they were up more than 27 percent from the year before. In New York State, between 2006 and 2013, we had nearly 5,000 individual data breaches that were reported by businesses, not-for-profits, and government entities. In the same period, 23 million personal records of New Yorkers were exposed to criminals. And that is just my home State. Imagine how big that number actually is nationwide. We are long overdue for a new national approach to cyber security, and I am introducing two bills that would finally make this happen. The first is the Data Breach Notification and Punishing Cyber Criminals Act. It would set, for the first time, a national standard for how and when victims of cyber attacks will be informed. When an attack takes place on a business, for example, one that has your financial data or medical information, this law would require that you be informed quickly, with information about what was targeted, what was taken, and whether you were personally affected. This bill would seriously increase the penalties on people found guilty of hacking and cyber crime. It would raise the allowable fines and imprisonment sentences for many of the most common cyber crimes, including identity theft and theft of personal information. The second bill is the Cybersecurity Information Sharing Credit Act-- a bill that would incentivize America's businesses to share cyber security information critical to preventing attacks, without having to involve their competitors. Instead, businesses would be encouraged, with significant tax credits, to adopt the preferred, most efficient method for information sharing; that is, membership in private, sector- specific cyber security networks designed to protect an industry, such as health care and hospitals, from attack. At the individual level, companies, hospitals, and banks can only do so much to protect us. Any good cyber defense has to involve information sharing so that patterns can be recognized, industries can bolster their defenses, and the same hacks aren't just repeated over and over again. To modernize America's approach to cyber security, we as individuals have to take action, companies have to take action, law enforcement has to take action, and local governments must take action. Most importantly and most urgently, Congress has to take action. We desperately need to modernize our cyber security laws. I urge my colleagues to support these two bills. ______ By Mr. WYDEN (for himself and Mr. Paul): S. 1030. A bill to amend title 18, United States Code, to provide for clarification as to the meaning of access without authorization, and for other purposes; to the Committee on the Judiciary. Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, today I am reintroducing the Aaron's Law Act of 2015 to reform the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, a sweeping anti-hacking law that criminalizes many forms of common Internet and computer use. This overly broad law currently allows breathtaking levels of prosecutorial discretion that invites serious overuse and abuse. Together with Senator Rand Paul, and my colleagues in the House of Representatives, we introduce legislation to fix the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act which is long overdue for reform. Aaron's Law would curb the abuses of this outdated law while still preserving the tools needed to prosecute malicious attacks. Our bill, inspired by the late Internet innovator and activist Aaron Swartz, who faced up to 35 years in prison for an act of civil disobedience, would reform the quarter-century-old law to better reflect computer and Internet activities in the digital age. Numerous and recent instances of heavy-handed prosecutions for non-malicious computer crimes have raised serious questions as to how the law treats violations of terms of service, employer agreement or website notices. Aaron's Law is smart legislation that keeps up with the constant evolution of the Internet, and honors the late Aaron Swartz. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record. There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows: S. 1030 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. This Act may be cited as the ``Aaron's Law Act of 2015''. SEC. 2.

(b) Conforming Amendment.--Section 1030 of title 18, United States Code, is amended-- [[Page S2305]] (1) in subsection (d)(10), by striking ``unauthorized access, or exceeding authorized access, to a'' and inserting ``access without authorization of a protected''; and (2) by striking ``exceeds authorized access'' each place it appears. SEC. 3. ELIMINATING REDUNDANCY. (a) Repeal.--Section 1030(a) of title 18, United States Code, is amended-- (1) by striking paragraph (4); and (2) by redesignating paragraphs (5), (6), and (7) as paragraphs (4), (5), and (6), respectively. (b) Conforming Amendments.--Section 1030 of title 18, United States Code, is amended-- (1) in subsection (c)-- (A) in paragraph (2), by striking ``(a)(6)'' each place it appears and inserting ``(a)(5)''; and (B) in paragraph (3)-- (i) in subparagraph (A), by striking ``subsection (a)(4) or (a)(7)'' and inserting ``subsection (a)(6)''; and (ii) in subparagraph (B), by striking ``subsection (a)(4), or (a)(7)'' and inserting ``subsection (a)(6)''; and (C) in paragraph (4)-- (i) in subparagraph (A)(i), in the matter preceding clause (i), by striking ``subsection (a)(5)(B)'' and inserting ``subsection (a)(4)(B)''; (ii) in subparagraph (B)(i), by striking ``subsection (a)(5)(A)'' and inserting ``subsection (a)(4)(A)''; (iii) in subparagraph (C)(i), by striking ``subsection (a)(5)'' and inserting ``subsection (a)(4)''; (iv) in subparagraph (D)(i), by striking ``subsection (a)(5)(C)'' and inserting ``subsection (a)(4)(C)''; (v) in subparagraph (E), by striking ``subsection (a)(5)(A)'' and inserting ``subsection (a)(4)(A)''; (vi) in subparagraph (F), by striking ``subsection (a)(5)(A)'' and inserting ``subsection (a)(4)(A)''; and (vii) in subparagraph (G)(i), by striking ``subsection (a)(5)'' and inserting ``subsection (a)(4)''; and (2) in subsection (h), by striking ``subsection (a)(5)'' and inserting ``subsection (a)(4)''. SEC. 4. MAKING PENALTIES PROPORTIONAL TO CRIMES. (a) Section 1030(c)(2) of title 18, United States Code, is amended-- (1) in subparagraph (A)-- (A) by striking ``conviction for another'' and inserting ``subsequent''; and (B) by inserting ``such'' after ``attempt to commit''; (2) in subparagraph (B)(i), by inserting after ``financial gain'' the following: ``and the fair market value of the information obtained exceeds $5,000''; (3) in subparagraph (B)(ii), by striking ``the offense was committed'' and all that follows through the semicolon, and inserting the following: ``the offense was committed in furtherance of any criminal act in violation of the Constitution or laws of the United States or of any State punishable by a term of imprisonment greater than one year, unless such criminal acts are prohibited by this section or such State violation would be based solely on accessing information without authorization;''; (4) in subparagraph (B)(iii), by inserting ``fair market'' before ``value''; and (5) in subparagraph (C)-- (A) by striking ``conviction for another'' and inserting ``subsequent''; and (B) by inserting ``such'' after ``attempt to commit''. ______ By Mr. GRASSLEY (for himself, Mr. Lee, Mr. Vitter, Mr. Enzi, Mrs. Fischer, Mr. Corker, Mr. Cotton, Mr. Inhofe, Mr. Wicker, Mrs. Capito, Mr. Boozman, Mr. Sessions, and Mr. Perdue): S. 1032. A bill to expand the use of E-Verify, to hold employers accountable, and for other purposes; to the Committee on the Judiciary. Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, in 1986, Congress made it unlawful for employers to knowingly hire or employ individuals who are not eligible to work in the United States. Identity theft and counterfeit documents have made a mockery of this law. Under current law, if the documents provided by an employee reasonably appear on their face to be genuine, the employer has met its obligation to review the worker's documents. This is why Congress created a pilot program, known as the Basic Pilot program, to help employers verify the work eligibility of its new hires. This program has allowed employers to check records maintained by the Department of Homeland Security and the Social Security Administration. It was successful, and in 2003, Congress made the program available in all 50 States. Now known as E-Verify, this nationwide program is free for employers and accessible via the internet. This program has been a valuable tool for those who want to hire a legal workforce. Employers like it. In fact, according to Westat, a private statistical survey research corporation that conducted a survey last year, 97 percent of employers found E-Verify user-friendly, and 92 percent said the program was effective. Employers also reported that ``E-Verify takes the guess work out of determining the validity of documents, provides immediate results, offers reassurance that the company is not hiring unauthorized workers, and helps them to show a good faith effort to comply with the law.'' So, today, along with several colleagues, I am introducing legislation to permanently authorize and expand the E-Verify program. My bill, the Accountability Through Electronic Verification Act, will ensure that employers can rely on this program while holding them accountable for their hiring practices. My bill would make E-Verify a staple in every workplace. It would pave the way to modify and simplify the I-9 process required today. It would increase penalties on employers who hire people unauthorized to work in the country. Employers would be required to check the status of current employees within three years, and would allow employers to run a check prior to offering a job, saving that employer valuable time and resources. Employers will also be required to re-check those workers whose authorization is about to expire, such as those who come to the United States on temporary visas. As Congress considers the reauthorization of E-Verify this year, I hope my bill will be a starting point for discussion. We need to enhance and expand the program so that our immigration laws are being upheld. I hope my colleagues will consider joining me in making E- Verify a permanent part of our immigration laws. ______ By Mr. McCONNELL (for himself and Mr. Burr): S. 1035.

A bill to require notification of information security breaches and to enhance penalties for cyber criminals, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation. Mrs. GILLIBRAND. Mr. President, I rise to speak about two bipartisan bills that would help to modernize the way this country approaches cyber security. Congress needs to get with the times and realize that the Internet is no longer a new concept. Swiping a credit card, conducting online banking, storing prescription records online--these are not new activities. The cloud is no longer new. Hackers are no longer new. So why are we still so taken aback, in shock, every time we suffer another major cyber attack? Why are we still not requiring that consumers be notified when their information has been stolen? Why aren't we unleashing law enforcement to go after cyber criminals? If we want to defend against 21st-century threats, then we have to bring our laws into the 21st century. We have to get out of the mindset that the only way we can be hurt is from an actual physical attack. Hackers don't operate on battlefields; they operate in basements and in cubicles. Our approach to cyber security so far has been certifiably wrong. We have the largest defense budget in the world by far, but that hasn't stopped our hospitals and banks from falling victim to a near constant barrage of attacks. Last year, data breaches in this country hit a record high; they were up more than 27 percent from the year before. In New York State, between 2006 and 2013, we had nearly 5,000 individual data breaches that were reported by businesses, not-for-profits, and government entities. In the same period, 23 million personal records of New Yorkers were exposed to criminals. And that is just my home State. Imagine how big that number actually is nationwide. We are long overdue for a new national approach to cyber security, and I am introducing two bills that would finally make this happen. The first is the Data Breach Notification and Punishing Cyber Criminals Act. It would set, for the first time, a national standard for how and when victims of cyber attacks will be informed. When an attack takes place on a business, for example, one that has your financial data or medical information, this law would require that you be informed quickly, with information about what was targeted, what was taken, and whether you were personally affected. This bill would seriously increase the penalties on people found guilty of hacking and cyber crime. It would raise the allowable fines and imprisonment sentences for many of the most common cyber crimes, including identity theft and theft of personal information. The second bill is the Cybersecurity Information Sharing Credit Act-- a bill that would incentivize America's businesses to share cyber security information critical to preventing attacks, without having to involve their competitors. Instead, businesses would be encouraged, with significant tax credits, to adopt the preferred, most efficient method for information sharing; that is, membership in private, sector- specific cyber security networks designed to protect an industry, such as health care and hospitals, from attack. At the individual level, companies, hospitals, and banks can only do so much to protect us. Any good cyber defense has to involve information sharing so that patterns can be recognized, industries can bolster their defenses, and the same hacks aren't just repeated over and over again. To modernize America's approach to cyber security, we as individuals have to take action, companies have to take action, law enforcement has to take action, and local governments must take action. Most importantly and most urgently, Congress has to take action. We desperately need to modernize our cyber security laws. I urge my colleagues to support these two bills. ______ By Mr. WYDEN (for himself and Mr. Paul): S. 1030. A bill to amend title 18, United States Code, to provide for clarification as to the meaning of access without authorization, and for other purposes; to the Committee on the Judiciary. Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, today I am reintroducing the Aaron's Law Act of 2015 to reform the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, a sweeping anti-hacking law that criminalizes many forms of common Internet and computer use. This overly broad law currently allows breathtaking levels of prosecutorial discretion that invites serious overuse and abuse. Together with Senator Rand Paul, and my colleagues in the House of Representatives, we introduce legislation to fix the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act which is long overdue for reform. Aaron's Law would curb the abuses of this outdated law while still preserving the tools needed to prosecute malicious attacks. Our bill, inspired by the late Internet innovator and activist Aaron Swartz, who faced up to 35 years in prison for an act of civil disobedience, would reform the quarter-century-old law to better reflect computer and Internet activities in the digital age. Numerous and recent instances of heavy-handed prosecutions for non-malicious computer crimes have raised serious questions as to how the law treats violations of terms of service, employer agreement or website notices. Aaron's Law is smart legislation that keeps up with the constant evolution of the Internet, and honors the late Aaron Swartz. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record. There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows: S. 1030 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. This Act may be cited as the ``Aaron's Law Act of 2015''. SEC. 2.

(b) Conforming Amendment.--Section 1030 of title 18, United States Code, is amended-- [[Page S2305]] (1) in subsection (d)(10), by striking ``unauthorized access, or exceeding authorized access, to a'' and inserting ``access without authorization of a protected''; and (2) by striking ``exceeds authorized access'' each place it appears.

SEC. 4. MAKING PENALTIES PROPORTIONAL TO CRIMES. (a) Section 1030(c)(2) of title 18, United States Code, is amended-- (1) in subparagraph (A)-- (A) by striking ``conviction for another'' and inserting ``subsequent''; and (B) by inserting ``such'' after ``attempt to commit''; (2) in subparagraph (B)(i), by inserting after ``financial gain'' the following: ``and the fair market value of the information obtained exceeds $5,000''; (3) in subparagraph (B)(ii), by striking ``the offense was committed'' and all that follows through the semicolon, and inserting the following: ``the offense was committed in furtherance of any criminal act in violation of the Constitution or laws of the United States or of any State punishable by a term of imprisonment greater than one year, unless such criminal acts are prohibited by this section or such State violation would be based solely on accessing information without authorization;''; (4) in subparagraph (B)(iii), by inserting ``fair market'' before ``value''; and (5) in subparagraph (C)-- (A) by striking ``conviction for another'' and inserting ``subsequent''; and (B) by inserting ``such'' after ``attempt to commit''. ______ By Mr. GRASSLEY (for himself, Mr. Lee, Mr. Vitter, Mr. Enzi, Mrs. Fischer, Mr. Corker, Mr. Cotton, Mr. Inhofe, Mr. Wicker, Mrs. Capito, Mr. Boozman, Mr. Sessions, and Mr. Perdue): S. 1032. A bill to expand the use of E-Verify, to hold employers accountable, and for other purposes; to the Committee on the Judiciary. Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, in 1986, Congress made it unlawful for employers to knowingly hire or employ individuals who are not eligible to work in the United States. Identity theft and counterfeit documents have made a mockery of this law. Under current law, if the documents provided by an employee reasonably appear on their face to be genuine, the employer has met its obligation to review the worker's documents. This is why Congress created a pilot program, known as the Basic Pilot program, to help employers verify the work eligibility of its new hires. This program has allowed employers to check records maintained by the Department of Homeland Security and the Social Security Administration. It was successful, and in 2003, Congress made the program available in all 50 States. Now known as E-Verify, this nationwide program is free for employers and accessible via the internet. This program has been a valuable tool for those who want to hire a legal workforce. Employers like it. In fact, according to Westat, a private statistical survey research corporation that conducted a survey last year, 97 percent of employers found E-Verify user-friendly, and 92 percent said the program was effective. Employers also reported that ``E-Verify takes the guess work out of determining the validity of documents, provides immediate results, offers reassurance that the company is not hiring unauthorized workers, and helps them to show a good faith effort to comply with the law.'' So, today, along with several colleagues, I am introducing legislation to permanently authorize and expand the E-Verify program. My bill, the Accountability Through Electronic Verification Act, will ensure that employers can rely on this program while holding them accountable for their hiring practices. My bill would make E-Verify a staple in every workplace. It would pave the way to modify and simplify the I-9 process required today. It would increase penalties on employers who hire people unauthorized to work in the country. Employers would be required to check the status of current employees within three years, and would allow employers to run a check prior to offering a job, saving that employer valuable time and resources. Employers will also be required to re-check those workers whose authorization is about to expire, such as those who come to the United States on temporary visas. As Congress considers the reauthorization of E-Verify this year, I hope my bill will be a starting point for discussion. We need to enhance and expand the program so that our immigration laws are being upheld. I hope my colleagues will consider joining me in making E- Verify a permanent part of our immigration laws. ______ By Mr. McCONNELL (for himself and Mr. Burr): S. 1035.

to the committee on commerce, science, and transportation. mrs. gillibrand. mr. president, i rise to speak about two bipartisan bills that would help to modernize the way this country approaches cyber security. congress needs to get with the times and realize that the internet is no longer a new concept. swiping a credit card, conducting online banking, storing prescription records online--these are not new activities. the cloud is no longer new. hackers are no longer new. so why are we still so taken aback, in shock, every time we suffer another major cyber attack? why are we still not requiring that consumers be notified when their information has been stolen? why aren't we unleashing law enforcement to go after cyber criminals? if we want to defend against 21st-century threats, then we have to bring our laws into the 21st century. we have to get out of the mindset that the only way we can be hurt is from an actual physical attack. hackers don't operate on battlefields; they operate in basements and in cubicles. our approach to cyber security so far has been certifiably wrong. we have the largest defense budget in the world by far, but that hasn't stopped our hospitals and banks from falling victim to a near constant barrage of attacks. last year, data breaches in this country hit a record high; they were up more than 27 percent from the year before. in new york state, between 2006 and 2013, we had nearly 5,000 individual data breaches that were reported by businesses, not-for-profits, and government entities. in the same period, 23 million personal records of new yorkers were exposed to criminals. and that is just my home state. imagine how big that number actually is nationwide. we are long overdue for a new national approach to cyber security, and i am introducing two bills that would finally make this happen. the first is the data breach notification and punishing cyber criminals act. it would set, for the first time, a national standard for how and when victims of cyber attacks will be informed. when an attack takes place on a business, for example, one that has your financial data or medical information, this law would require that you be informed quickly, with information about what was targeted, what was taken, and whether you were personally affected. this bill would seriously increase the penalties on people found guilty of hacking and cyber crime. it would raise the allowable fines and imprisonment sentences for many of the most common cyber crimes, including identity theft and theft of personal information. the second bill is the cybersecurity information sharing credit act-- a bill that would incentivize america's businesses to share cyber security information critical to preventing attacks, without having to involve their competitors. instead, businesses would be encouraged, with significant tax credits, to adopt the preferred, most efficient method for information sharing; that is, membership in private, sector- specific cyber security networks designed to protect an industry, such as health care and hospitals, from attack. at the individual level, companies, hospitals, and banks can only do so much to protect us. any good cyber defense has to involve information sharing so that patterns can be recognized, industries can bolster their defenses, and the same hacks aren't just repeated over and over again. to modernize america's approach to cyber security, we as individuals have to take action, companies have to take action, law enforcement has to take action, and local governments must take action. most importantly and most urgently, congress has to take action. we desperately need to modernize our cyber security laws. i urge my colleagues to support these two bills. ______ by mr. wyden (for himself and mr. paul): s. 1030. a bill to amend title 18, united states code, to provide for clarification as to the meaning of access without authorization, and for other purposes; to the committee on the judiciary. mr. wyden. mr. president, today i am reintroducing the aaron's law act of 2015 to reform the computer fraud and abuse act, a sweeping anti-hacking law that criminalizes many forms of common internet and computer use. this overly broad law currently allows breathtaking levels of prosecutorial discretion that invites serious overuse and abuse. together with senator rand paul, and my colleagues in the house of representatives, we introduce legislation to fix the computer fraud and abuse act which is long overdue for reform. aaron's law would curb the abuses of this outdated law while still preserving the tools needed to prosecute malicious attacks. our bill, inspired by the late internet innovator and activist aaron swartz, who faced up to 35 years in prison for an act of civil disobedience, would reform the quarter-century-old law to better reflect computer and internet activities in the digital age. numerous and recent instances of heavy-handed prosecutions for non-malicious computer crimes have raised serious questions as to how the law treats violations of terms of service, employer agreement or website notices. aaron's law is smart legislation that keeps up with the constant evolution of the internet, and honors the late aaron swartz. mr. president, i ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the record. there being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be printed in the record, as follows: s. 1030 be it enacted by the senate and house of representatives of the united states of america in congress assembled, section 1. short title. this act may be cited as the ``aaron's law act of 2015''. sec. 2. clarifying that ``access without authorization'' under section 1030 of title 18, united states code, means circumvention of technological barriers in order to gain unauthorized access. (a) in general.--section 1030(e)(6) of title 18, united states code, is amended by-- (1) striking ``exceeds authorized access'' and all that follows; and (2) inserting the following: `` `access without authorization' means-- ``(a) to obtain information on a protected computer; ``(b) that the accesser lacks authorization to obtain; and ``(c) by knowingly circumventing one or more technological or physical measures that are designed to exclude or prevent unauthorized individuals from obtaining that information;''. (b) conforming amendment.--section 1030 of title 18, united states code, is amended-- [[page s2305]] (1) in subsection (d)(10), by striking ``unauthorized access, or exceeding authorized access, to a'' and inserting ``access without authorization of a protected''; and (2) by striking ``exceeds authorized access'' each place it appears. sec. 3. eliminating redundancy. (a) repeal.--section 1030(a) of title 18, united states code, is amended-- (1) by striking paragraph (4); and (2) by redesignating paragraphs (5), (6), and (7) as paragraphs (4), (5), and (6), respectively. (b) conforming amendments.--section 1030 of title 18, united states code, is amended-- (1) in subsection (c)-- (a) in paragraph (2), by striking ``(a)(6)'' each place it appears and inserting ``(a)(5)''; and (b) in paragraph (3)-- (i) in subparagraph (a), by striking ``subsection (a)(4) or (a)(7)'' and inserting ``subsection (a)(6)''; and (ii) in subparagraph (b), by striking ``subsection (a)(4), or (a)(7)'' and inserting ``subsection (a)(6)''; and (c) in paragraph (4)-- (i) in subparagraph (a)(i), in the matter preceding clause (i), by striking ``subsection (a)(5)(b)'' and inserting ``subsection (a)(4)(b)''; (ii) in subparagraph (b)(i), by striking ``subsection (a)(5)(a)'' and inserting ``subsection (a)(4)(a)''; (iii) in subparagraph (c)(i), by striking ``subsection (a)(5)'' and inserting ``subsection (a)(4)''; (iv) in subparagraph (d)(i), by striking ``subsection (a)(5)(c)'' and inserting ``subsection (a)(4)(c)''; (v) in subparagraph (e), by striking ``subsection (a)(5)(a)'' and inserting ``subsection (a)(4)(a)''; (vi) in subparagraph (f), by striking ``subsection (a)(5)(a)'' and inserting ``subsection (a)(4)(a)''; and (vii) in subparagraph (g)(i), by striking ``subsection (a)(5)'' and inserting ``subsection (a)(4)''; and (2) in subsection (h), by striking ``subsection (a)(5)'' and inserting ``subsection (a)(4)''. sec. 4. making penalties proportional to crimes. (a) section 1030(c)(2) of title 18, united states code, is amended-- (1) in subparagraph (a)-- (a) by striking ``conviction for another'' and inserting ``subsequent''; and (b) by inserting ``such'' after ``attempt to commit''; (2) in subparagraph (b)(i), by inserting after ``financial gain'' the following: ``and the fair market value of the information obtained exceeds $5,000''; (3) in subparagraph (b)(ii), by striking ``the offense was committed'' and all that follows through the semicolon, and inserting the following: ``the offense was committed in furtherance of any criminal act in violation of the constitution or laws of the united states or of any state punishable by a term of imprisonment greater than one year, unless such criminal acts are prohibited by this section or such state violation would be based solely on accessing information without authorization;''; (4) in subparagraph (b)(iii), by inserting ``fair market'' before ``value''; and (5) in subparagraph (c)-- (a) by striking ``conviction for another'' and inserting ``subsequent''; and (b) by inserting ``such'' after ``attempt to commit''. ______ by mr. grassley (for himself, mr. lee, mr. vitter, mr. enzi, mrs. fischer, mr. corker, mr. cotton, mr. inhofe, mr. wicker, mrs. capito, mr. boozman, mr. sessions, and mr. perdue): s. 1032. a bill to expand the use of e-verify, to hold employers accountable, and for other purposes; to the committee on the judiciary. mr. grassley. mr. president, in 1986, congress made it unlawful for employers to knowingly hire or employ individuals who are not eligible to work in the united states. identity theft and counterfeit documents have made a mockery of this law. under current law, if the documents provided by an employee reasonably appear on their face to be genuine, the employer has met its obligation to review the worker's documents. this is why congress created a pilot program, known as the basic pilot program, to help employers verify the work eligibility of its new hires. this program has allowed employers to check records maintained by the department of homeland security and the social security administration. it was successful, and in 2003, congress made the program available in all 50 states. now known as e-verify, this nationwide program is free for employers and accessible via the internet. this program has been a valuable tool for those who want to hire a legal workforce. employers like it. in fact, according to westat, a private statistical survey research corporation that conducted a survey last year, 97 percent of employers found e-verify user-friendly, and 92 percent said the program was effective. employers also reported that ``e-verify takes the guess work out of determining the validity of documents, provides immediate results, offers reassurance that the company is not hiring unauthorized workers, and helps them to show a good faith effort to comply with the law.'' so, today, along with several colleagues, i am introducing legislation to permanently authorize and expand the e-verify program. my bill, the accountability through electronic verification act, will ensure that employers can rely on this program while holding them accountable for their hiring practices. my bill would make e-verify a staple in every workplace. it would pave the way to modify and simplify the i-9 process required today. it would increase penalties on employers who hire people unauthorized to work in the country. employers would be required to check the status of current employees within three years, and would allow employers to run a check prior to offering a job, saving that employer valuable time and resources. employers will also be required to re-check those workers whose authorization is about to expire, such as those who come to the united states on temporary visas. as congress considers the reauthorization of e-verify this year, i hope my bill will be a starting point for discussion. we need to enhance and expand the program so that our immigration laws are being upheld. i hope my colleagues will consider joining me in making e- verify a permanent part of our immigration laws. ______ by mr. mcconnell (for himself and mr. burr): s. 1035. a bill to extend authority relating to roving surveillance, access to business records, and individual terrorists as agents of foreign powers under the foreign intelligence surveillance act of 1978 and for other purposes; read the first time. mr. mcconnell. mr. president, i ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the record. there being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be printed in the record, as follows: s. 1035 be it enacted by the senate and house of representatives of the united states of america in congress assembled, section 1. extensions of authority under the foreign intelligence surveillance act of 1978.

A bill to expand the use of E-Verify, to hold employers accountable, and for other purposes; to the Committee on the Judiciary. Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, in 1986, Congress made it unlawful for employers to knowingly hire or employ individuals who are not eligible to work in the United States. Identity theft and counterfeit documents have made a mockery of this law. Under current law, if the documents provided by an employee reasonably appear on their face to be genuine, the employer has met its obligation to review the worker's documents. This is why Congress created a pilot program, known as the Basic Pilot program, to help employers verify the work eligibility of its new hires. This program has allowed employers to check records maintained by the Department of Homeland Security and the Social Security Administration. It was successful, and in 2003, Congress made the program available in all 50 States. Now known as E-Verify, this nationwide program is free for employers and accessible via the internet. This program has been a valuable tool for those who want to hire a legal workforce. Employers like it. In fact, according to Westat, a private statistical survey research corporation that conducted a survey last year, 97 percent of employers found E-Verify user-friendly, and 92 percent said the program was effective. Employers also reported that ``E-Verify takes the guess work out of determining the validity of documents, provides immediate results, offers reassurance that the company is not hiring unauthorized workers, and helps them to show a good faith effort to comply with the law.'' So, today, along with several colleagues, I am introducing legislation to permanently authorize and expand the E-Verify program. My bill, the Accountability Through Electronic Verification Act, will ensure that employers can rely on this program while holding them accountable for their hiring practices. My bill would make E-Verify a staple in every workplace. It would pave the way to modify and simplify the I-9 process required today. It would increase penalties on employers who hire people unauthorized to work in the country. Employers would be required to check the status of current employees within three years, and would allow employers to run a check prior to offering a job, saving that employer valuable time and resources. Employers will also be required to re-check those workers whose authorization is about to expire, such as those who come to the United States on temporary visas. As Congress considers the reauthorization of E-Verify this year, I hope my bill will be a starting point for discussion. We need to enhance and expand the program so that our immigration laws are being upheld. I hope my colleagues will consider joining me in making E- Verify a permanent part of our immigration laws. ______","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 58 (Tuesday, April 21, 2015)] [Senate] [Page S2305] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] By Mr. GRASSLEY (for himself, Mr. Lee, Mr. Vitter, Mr. Enzi, Mrs. Fischer, Mr. Corker, Mr. Cotton, Mr. Inhofe, Mr. Wicker, Mrs. Capito, Mr. Boozman, Mr. Sessions, and Mr. Perdue): S. 1032.

A bill to require notification of information security breaches and to enhance penalties for cyber criminals, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation. Mrs. GILLIBRAND. Mr. President, I rise to speak about two bipartisan bills that would help to modernize the way this country approaches cyber security. Congress needs to get with the times and realize that the Internet is no longer a new concept. Swiping a credit card, conducting online banking, storing prescription records online--these are not new activities. The cloud is no longer new. Hackers are no longer new. So why are we still so taken aback, in shock, every time we suffer another major cyber attack? Why are we still not requiring that consumers be notified when their information has been stolen? Why aren't we unleashing law enforcement to go after cyber criminals? If we want to defend against 21st-century threats, then we have to bring our laws into the 21st century. We have to get out of the mindset that the only way we can be hurt is from an actual physical attack. Hackers don't operate on battlefields; they operate in basements and in cubicles. Our approach to cyber security so far has been certifiably wrong. We have the largest defense budget in the world by far, but that hasn't stopped our hospitals and banks from falling victim to a near constant barrage of attacks. Last year, data breaches in this country hit a record high; they were up more than 27 percent from the year before. In New York State, between 2006 and 2013, we had nearly 5,000 individual data breaches that were reported by businesses, not-for-profits, and government entities. In the same period, 23 million personal records of New Yorkers were exposed to criminals. And that is just my home State. Imagine how big that number actually is nationwide. We are long overdue for a new national approach to cyber security, and I am introducing two bills that would finally make this happen. The first is the Data Breach Notification and Punishing Cyber Criminals Act. It would set, for the first time, a national standard for how and when victims of cyber attacks will be informed. When an attack takes place on a business, for example, one that has your financial data or medical information, this law would require that you be informed quickly, with information about what was targeted, what was taken, and whether you were personally affected. This bill would seriously increase the penalties on people found guilty of hacking and cyber crime. It would raise the allowable fines and imprisonment sentences for many of the most common cyber crimes, including identity theft and theft of personal information. The second bill is the Cybersecurity Information Sharing Credit Act-- a bill that would incentivize America's businesses to share cyber security information critical to preventing attacks, without having to involve their competitors. Instead, businesses would be encouraged, with significant tax credits, to adopt the preferred, most efficient method for information sharing; that is, membership in private, sector- specific cyber security networks designed to protect an industry, such as health care and hospitals, from attack. At the individual level, companies, hospitals, and banks can only do so much to protect us. Any good cyber defense has to involve information sharing so that patterns can be recognized, industries can bolster their defenses, and the same hacks aren't just repeated over and over again. To modernize America's approach to cyber security, we as individuals have to take action, companies have to take action, law enforcement has to take action, and local governments must take action. Most importantly and most urgently, Congress has to take action. We desperately need to modernize our cyber security laws. I urge my colleagues to support these two bills. ______","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 58 (Tuesday, April 21, 2015)] [Senate] [Page S2304] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] By Mr. KIRK (for himself and Mrs. Gillibrand): S. 1027.

A bill to amend title 18, United States Code, to provide for clarification as to the meaning of access without authorization, and for other purposes; to the Committee on the Judiciary. Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, today I am reintroducing the Aaron's Law Act of 2015 to reform the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, a sweeping anti-hacking law that criminalizes many forms of common Internet and computer use. This overly broad law currently allows breathtaking levels of prosecutorial discretion that invites serious overuse and abuse. Together with Senator Rand Paul, and my colleagues in the House of Representatives, we introduce legislation to fix the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act which is long overdue for reform. Aaron's Law would curb the abuses of this outdated law while still preserving the tools needed to prosecute malicious attacks. Our bill, inspired by the late Internet innovator and activist Aaron Swartz, who faced up to 35 years in prison for an act of civil disobedience, would reform the quarter-century-old law to better reflect computer and Internet activities in the digital age. Numerous and recent instances of heavy-handed prosecutions for non-malicious computer crimes have raised serious questions as to how the law treats violations of terms of service, employer agreement or website notices. Aaron's Law is smart legislation that keeps up with the constant evolution of the Internet, and honors the late Aaron Swartz. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record. There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows: S. 1030 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. This Act may be cited as the ``Aaron's Law Act of 2015''. SEC. 2. CLARIFYING THAT ``ACCESS WITHOUT AUTHORIZATION'' UNDER SECTION 1030 OF TITLE 18, UNITED STATES CODE, MEANS CIRCUMVENTION OF TECHNOLOGICAL BARRIERS IN ORDER TO GAIN UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS.

(b) Conforming Amendment.--Section 1030 of title 18, United States Code, is amended-- [[Page S2305]] (1) in subsection (d)(10), by striking ``unauthorized access, or exceeding authorized access, to a'' and inserting ``access without authorization of a protected''; and (2) by striking ``exceeds authorized access'' each place it appears. SEC. 3. ELIMINATING REDUNDANCY. (a) Repeal.--Section 1030(a) of title 18, United States Code, is amended-- (1) by striking paragraph (4); and (2) by redesignating paragraphs (5), (6), and (7) as paragraphs (4), (5), and (6), respectively.

A bill to amend title 18, United States Code, to provide for clarification as to the meaning of access without authorization, and for other purposes; to the Committee on the Judiciary. Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, today I am reintroducing the Aaron's Law Act of 2015 to reform the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, a sweeping anti-hacking law that criminalizes many forms of common Internet and computer use. This overly broad law currently allows breathtaking levels of prosecutorial discretion that invites serious overuse and abuse. Together with Senator Rand Paul, and my colleagues in the House of Representatives, we introduce legislation to fix the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act which is long overdue for reform. Aaron's Law would curb the abuses of this outdated law while still preserving the tools needed to prosecute malicious attacks. Our bill, inspired by the late Internet innovator and activist Aaron Swartz, who faced up to 35 years in prison for an act of civil disobedience, would reform the quarter-century-old law to better reflect computer and Internet activities in the digital age. Numerous and recent instances of heavy-handed prosecutions for non-malicious computer crimes have raised serious questions as to how the law treats violations of terms of service, employer agreement or website notices. Aaron's Law is smart legislation that keeps up with the constant evolution of the Internet, and honors the late Aaron Swartz. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record. There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows: S. 1030 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, SECTION 1.

Mr. Speaker, it is my honor to help commemorate the 150th Anniversary of the establishment of the First Presbyterian Church in Nicholson, Pennsylvania. The church is a historic landmark within my congressional district, and provides my constituents with a place to come together and worship. Founded in April of 1865 by Reverend Lyman Richardson, the church remains the tallest structure in Nicholson. This house of worship, which rises to a height of 60 feet and is adorned with 10 beautiful stained-glass windows, serves as a magnificent symbol reminding onlookers of the great sense of pride and community the town's residents share. First Presbyterian is comprised of nine board members who oversee a vibrant and active congregation. Thanks to an enthusiastic and committed staff of teachers, the youth of the church are able to enjoy a Sunday school program that runs 12 months of the year. Additionally, in 1879, a women's Missionary Society was organized in order to aid the church in its everyday spiritual and monetary needs. The group survives over 100 years later, and is referred to today as the ``Presbyterian Women.'' Mr. Speaker, it is my pleasure to honor the First Presbyterian Church of Nicholson, Pennsylvania as it celebrates its 150th anniversary, and I commend its congregation, both past and present, for their tireless efforts to preserve its longstanding legacy. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 58 (Tuesday, April 21, 2015)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E533] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] IN COMMEMORATION OF THE 150TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE ESTABLISHMENT OF THE FIRST PRESBYTERIAN CHURCH IN NICHOLSON, PENNSYLVANIA ______ HON.

Job Corps provides career preparatory training to high school dropouts, homeless young adults, and students with learning disabilities, enabling them to become productive and financially independent members of society. Job Corps provides over 50,000 at-risk youth with invaluable job training and life skills each year. The Cassadaga Job Corps Center, located in Chautauqua County, New York, has had an immensely positive impact on lives and families in my congressional district. The Center enrolls over 300 local youths every year, providing them with the resources and opportunities necessary to achieve success, both now and in the future. These programs have enabled thousands of young adults to enter the workforce and begin careers in construction, healthcare, security, and various vocational industries. Our local communities have greatly benefited from the services provided by the hardworking staff of the Cassadaga Job Corps Center. The staff provides a ``hand up'' to young adults in need, by mentoring, encouraging, and supporting the program participants as they work to better themselves. The staff works with the participants as they establish solid foundations upon which to build their careers, which directly benefits the participants and our communities. Mr. Speaker, it is my sincere pleasure to congratulate the National Job Corps on fifty [[Page E534]] years of excellent service to students and young adults across the country. I salute Job Corps on a job well-done, and extend my best wishes for continued success in the future. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 58 (Tuesday, April 21, 2015)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Pages E533-E534] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] RECOGNIZING NATIONAL JOB CORPS' 50TH ANNIVERSARY ______ HON.

Mr. Speaker, I rise today to ask the House of Representatives to join me in celebrating the 44th anniversary of the Gay and Lesbian Activists Alliance of Washington, DC (GLAA), a much- valued human rights organization that has long been a local leader in the struggle for equal rights for the lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) community. Since its founding, in April 1971, GLAA has been a respected and tireless advocate for full and equal rights for the District of Columbia, and has been at the forefront of efforts to strengthen enforcement of the landmark D.C. Human Rights Act of 1977. One of GLAA's most significant achievements, on which it worked with coalition partners, D.C. elected officials, and District residents, was enactment of the District of Columbia Religious Freedom and Civil Marriage Equality Amendment Act, which permits same-sex couples to marry in the District. GLAA has also stoutly defended the District's comprehensive human rights law; has been an outspoken advocate for LGBT youth and seniors; has stood up for the rights of LGBT consumers; has upheld the rights of transgender people, including equal treatment by police and access to culturally competent healthcare; and has built and nurtured coalitions with other constituencies to advance these causes and defend the District's autonomy. At GLAA's 44th anniversary reception on April 23, 2015, the recipients of its 2015 Distinguished Service Awards will be recognized, including: Alexandra Andrea Beninda serves as a member of the D.C. Commission on Human Rights. She is a dedicated transgender advocate and community volunteer. She has also served as a board member for Equality Virginia, Treasurer of the Virginia Partisans Gay and Lesbian Democratic Club, Treasurer of the Gertrude Stein Democratic Club, and a board member for the DC Center for the LGBT Community. She has represented the Stein Club on the D.C. Democratic State Committee. She is an active member and Assistant Treasurer at All Souls Unitarian Church. Chuck Hicks is a longtime specialist in Black history and strong supporter of HIV/AIDS prevention and treatment. He is founder and chair of the DC Black History Celebration Committee, and collaborated with the DC Commission on the Arts and Humanities in last year's multimedia production on Bayard Rustin and James Baldwin, and this year's production on Ruby Dee and Ossie Davis. He is founder and chair of Bread for the Soul. He has also served on the board of the Whitman- Walker Clinic. He led creation of a local host committee for the dedication of the Martin Luther King, Jr. Memorial, and served on the D.C. Mayor's Committee on the 50th Anniversary of the 1963 March on Washington. He currently serves on the Commission on Aging, D.C. Commission on African-American Men and Boys, Commission on African- American Affairs, and the MLK Holiday Commission. Anne Phelps is a former D.C. Council Committee Director for the Committee on the Judiciary and Public Safety, serving under then- chairman Tommy Wells. Before that, she was Committee Director for the Committee on Libraries, Parks, Recreation, and Planning, and General Counsel for the Committee on Transportation and Public Works. During her tenure on the Judiciary and Public Safety Committee, the following bills supported by GLAA were passed: the Marriage Officiant Amendment Act of 2013; JaParker Deoni Jones Birth Certificate Equality Amendment Act of 2013; Marriage License Issuance Amendment Act of 2013; Civil Marriage Dissolution Equality Clarification Amendment Act of 2014; Repeal of Prostitution Free Zones Amendment Act of 2014; and Human Rights Amendment Act of 2014.

CRIMES,"[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 58 (Tuesday, April 21, 2015)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E534] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] IN HONOR OF MRS. MAGGIE L. CRIMES ______ HON. SANFORD D. BISHOP, JR. of georgia in the house of representatives Tuesday, April 21, 2015 Mr. BISHOP of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor a woman of grace, class and dignity, Mrs. Maggie Crimes. Sadly, Mrs. Crimes passed away on April 17, 2015. Her funeral service was held on April 19, 2015, at New Hope Baptist Church in Preston, Georgia. Mrs. Crimes was born in Webster County, Georgia on September 1, 1927, to the union of the late Mr. Willie Muff and the late Mrs. Evelyn Hawkins Muff Colbert Holley. She was educated in the Webster County School System. At an early age, she joined Shiloh Baptist Church in Preston, Georgia. In later years, she was a dedicated member of New Hope Baptist Church, also in Preston. In 1944, she married Mr. Jimmie Lee Crimes, Sr. This union produced ten children. Following in the footsteps of the great African American woman entrepreneur, Madame C.J. Walker, she pursued her entrepreneurial dreams and opened Mom's Kitchen in Preston in 1981. At the request of former President Jimmy Carter, she opened a second Mom's Kitchen location in Plains, Georgia in 2000. She made Mom's Kitchen a family affair, as many of her children and other relatives are employed in the business. Mom's is a place where you can get a good meal, get good customer service, and talk about the burning issues of the day. Mother Crimes made Mom's Kitchen a place that is welcoming to all people from many diverse backgrounds. She was a dear friend to me and my wife, Vivian. She gave me a platform and venue at Mom's Kitchen that I used on many occasions to interact with constituents. Mother Crimes was a great woman who treated all people with respect. She loved her God. She was honest, hardworking, and always told you the truth. She instilled these values in all of her children. Mom truly believed in the words of George Washington Carver, when he said, ``How far you go in life depends on your being tender with the young, compassionate with the aged, sympathetic with the striving and tolerant of the weak and the strong. Because someday in life you will have been all of these.'' Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me today in honoring the life and legacy of Mrs. Maggie Crimes and in extending condolences on behalf of my wife and the more than 730,000 people of the Second Congressional District. I know that her ten children, forty-three grandchildren, sixty-two great grandchildren, and four great great grandchildren will all miss her presence and wise counsel. But, I know that they will be more determined than ever to carry out her legacy. Heaven now has the ``best cook'' around and Mom now serves in the ``greatest kitchen'' of all. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 58 (Tuesday, April 21, 2015)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E534] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] IN HONOR OF MRS.

BARBARA LEE of california in the house of representatives Tuesday, April 21, 2015 Ms. LEE. First, let me thank Congressman Jeffries for his leadership in hosting this important Special Order on a critical issue facing every single member of the House--the senseless murder of our young African American male constituents and the overmilitarization of our police forces. My heart and prayers continue to go out to Walter Scott's family. Losing a loved one is always incredibly hard. But it is unbearable when a life is cut short. The unfortunate truth is the tragic death of Walter Scott is another in a series of tragedies that remind us that, to some, the lives of young black men and women do not matter. [[Page E536]] Tragedies like Michael Brown, Eric Garner, and Oscar Grant--one of my constituents--are far too common in communities across this country. As the mother of two black men and two black grandsons, I have had many uncomfortable but necessary conversations about how to walk, how to talk and how to interact with police. This is not just my reality. It is also the reality of millions of other black mothers and grandmothers. Tonight, we stand here, once again, to discuss the ongoing failures of our criminal justice system and over-use of deadly force by law enforcement across the country. In order to address the problem people need to know the facts. I applaud President Obama's Task Force on 21st Century Policing. The Task Force provided much needed recommendations, such as the creation of a National Crime and Justice Task Force that will review all components of the criminal justice system and provide recommendations on comprehensive criminal justice reform as well as renewed focus on community policing. The unfortunate facts are since President Obama's Task Force on 21st Century Policing released its report; there have been more than 100 fatal police shootings in America. Every 28 hours an African American male is killed by a security officer. 1 in 3 African American men and 1 in 6 Latino men will spend some part of their lives in prison. The truth is that disparity and inequality continue at every level of our society, especially in our criminal justice system. It's past time that Congress start enacting policies to dismantle the bias endemic in our institutions. We must come together like never before to tackle the systemic, structural and rampant racial bias endemic in our institutions and criminal justice system. We need to empower communities and work to build greater trust between law enforcement and the community, especially communities of color. That is why Congress should pass the bipartisan Stop Militarizing Law Enforcement Act (H.R. 1232), which I am a proud cosponsor of, to stop the militarization of our nation's police forces. We need to pass the Police Accountability Act (H.R. 1102) and the Grand Jury Reform Act (H.R. 429) so we can ensure that deadly force cases are heard by a judge and there is more accountability among police officers. Congress should also work to pass the Shield Our Streets Act (H.R. 103) to increase investments in proven, community-orientated policing programs that reduce crime and increase community and law enforcement trust and understanding. Congress must work with the Department of Justice to ensure training programs are available to ALL law enforcement officials to reduce racial bias and profiling and provide law enforcement officers with the resources to address, defuse and manage situations without the unnecessary use of deadly force. We also must support funding programs that focus on increasing police force diversity and retention of qualified officers in communities. This is something that the President's Task Force recommended in its report. It is vital that Congress acts to ensure the tragedies in Ferguson, Staten Island, Oakland--in my district--and now North Charleston are not repeated. So I urge my colleagues to support these efforts that can end the structural injustice that is endemic in our criminal justice system. These events must be our call to action--as Dr. King reminded us in his ``Two Americas'' speech in 1967. He said: `We must come to see that social progress never rolls in on the wheels of inevitability. It comes through the tireless efforts and the persistent work of dedicated individuals.' We must, each of us, be those dedicated individuals working persistently for the social progress that is so greatly needed. Too much is at stake to do nothing--we must act and act now. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 58 (Tuesday, April 21, 2015)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Pages E535-E536] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] WALTER SCOTT AND POLICE VIOLENCE IN AMERICA: WHERE DO WE GO FROM HERE? ______ HON.

ELEANOR HOLMES NORTON of the district of columbia in the house of representatives Tuesday, April 21, 2015 Ms. NORTON. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to ask the House of Representatives to join me in honoring Vicki Saporta for 20 years of outstanding leadership and service as President and CEO of the National Abortion Federation (NAF). As the first woman organizing director for an international union and now as a visionary leader in the reproductive health, rights, and justice movement, Vicki Saporta has spent her career fighting for women's equality and to improve women's lives. Since taking the helm of NAF in 1995, President Saporta has worked tirelessly to ensure women's access to safe, legal abortion care. Recognizing the need to address violence against abortion providers, Saporta successfully advocated for the establishment of the Department of Justice's National Task Force on Violence Against Health Care Providers. She has actively worked with Attorney Generals Janet Reno and Eric Holder; the Department of Justice; Federal Bureau of Investigation, Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, and U.S. Marshals to improve law enforcement response to clinic violence. As a result, major incidences of violence against abortion providers have decreased significantly in recent years. Saporta has brought abortion providers and their patients into the forefront of the public debate about abortion. In 1996, she brought five women and their families to the Oval Office to meet with President Clinton, who publicly announced that he vetoed a federal abortion ban because he was so moved by their stories. More recently, she worked closely with Congress to build support for lifting a decades-long ban on federal funding for abortion care for servicemembers and their dependents in cases of rape and incest--one of the only pro-choice legislative victories in the last 40 years. Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in honoring President and CEO Vicki Saporta for her outstanding service to reproductive health. Her legacy continues to offer a powerful example for serving our communities. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 58 (Tuesday, April 21, 2015)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E536] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] HONORING VICKI SAPORTA ______ HON.

Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize the unveiling of a very special memorial in my congressional district in Durham, North Carolina. On Sunday, April 26, 2015, a memorial forever marking the final resting place of ashes from victims who lost their lives during the Holocaust at the Dachau Concentration Camp in Germany will be unveiled in the Durham Hebrew Cemetery. The amazing and unlikely journey that brought these hallowed ashes to their final resting place in Durham, North Carolina took over seventy years. David Walter Corsbie, Jr. served in the United States Army Air Corps with the 364th Fighter Squadron during World War II. In 1945, shortly after Dachau was liberated by American troops, Mr. Corsbie was sent there on assignment. It was there that a survivor who had been imprisoned at Dachau gave the ashes to Mr. Corsbie telling him to never forget the unspeakable horrors that occurred there. In late 2012, Mr. Corsbie's son Joseph made the existence of these ashes known after they had remained a secret since the end of World War II. Last year, those ashes were finally laid to rest in the Durham Hebrew Cemetery. The victims whose ashes were interred were finally given the honor and respect they were denied so long ago. A memorial to mark their final resting place will be unveiled this Sunday. This memorial will serve as an enduring reminder that will ensure the victims at Dachau and the millions of others that were lost during the Holocaust are never forgotten.

ROSA L. DeLAURO of connecticut in the house of representatives Tuesday, April 21, 2015 Ms. DeLAURO. Mr. Speaker, I rise to congratulate Job Corps on the occasion of its fiftieth anniversary. Five decades ago, President Lyndon Johnson stood before Congress and challenged us to end poverty in the United States. Job Corps is a critical part of the answer to that challenge. Since 1965, the program has helped level the playing field for more than two million disadvantaged young men and women through its 125 centers across 48 states, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico. Young people come to Job Corps unsure about their future and often in need of a second chance. When they graduate, they are ready to take on the challenges and opportunities of the adult world. Put simply, Job Corps changes lives for the better. Job Corps is not like other career preparation programs. It does not just train and educate its participants. It instills in them discipline, structure, and the social skills they need to be successful in their lives. I had the honor of taking part in the opening of Connecticut's very first Job Corps center in New Haven in 1996. A year later, I returned to serve as graduation speaker. I was amazed at how far the students had come. Today, the New Haven Job Corps center is among the best in the nation. Armed with the right skills, its alumni pursue careers everywhere from Yale-New Haven Hospital to the Department of Homeland Security. Job Corps successfully places more than three quarters of its graduates in higher education programs or careers. Thanks to this track record of achievement, our nation now has many more skilled young people ready for careers as emergency medical technicians, chefs, nurses, carpenters, entrepreneurs, and all kinds of other vocations. No investment is more critical than investment in our human capital. If we want to compete in the global economy, we must invest in the workers of tomorrow and give them the skills they need to succeed. For half a century, Job Corps has been doing just that. I could not be more proud of the role I have played, as Chair and Ranking Member of the Appropriations Subcommittee that funds Job Corps, in supporting the program. I congratulate Job Corps, its staff, and its many graduates on fifty years of success. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 58 (Tuesday, April 21, 2015)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E537] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] JOB CORPS 50TH ANNIVERSARY ______ HON.

ROSA L. DeLAURO of connecticut in the house of representatives Tuesday, April 21, 2015 Ms. DeLAURO. Mr. Speaker, I rise to congratulate Job Corps on the occasion of its fiftieth anniversary. Five decades ago, President Lyndon Johnson stood before Congress and challenged us to end poverty in the United States. Job Corps is a critical part of the answer to that challenge. Since 1965, the program has helped level the playing field for more than two million disadvantaged young men and women through its 125 centers across 48 states, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico. Young people come to Job Corps unsure about their future and often in need of a second chance. When they graduate, they are ready to take on the challenges and opportunities of the adult world. Put simply, Job Corps changes lives for the better. Job Corps is not like other career preparation programs. It does not just train and educate its participants. It instills in them discipline, structure, and the social skills they need to be successful in their lives. I had the honor of taking part in the opening of Connecticut's very first Job Corps center in New Haven in 1996. A year later, I returned to serve as graduation speaker. I was amazed at how far the students had come. Today, the New Haven Job Corps center is among the best in the nation. Armed with the right skills, its alumni pursue careers everywhere from Yale-New Haven Hospital to the Department of Homeland Security. Job Corps successfully places more than three quarters of its graduates in higher education programs or careers. Thanks to this track record of achievement, our nation now has many more skilled young people ready for careers as emergency medical technicians, chefs, nurses, carpenters, entrepreneurs, and all kinds of other vocations. No investment is more critical than investment in our human capital. If we want to compete in the global economy, we must invest in the workers of tomorrow and give them the skills they need to succeed. For half a century, Job Corps has been doing just that. I could not be more proud of the role I have played, as Chair and Ranking Member of the Appropriations Subcommittee that funds Job Corps, in supporting the program. I congratulate Job Corps, its staff, and its many graduates on fifty years of success. ____________________",package_114_99.csv,2570,2570,2638,"[congressional record volume 161, number 58 (tuesday, april 21, 2015)] [extensions of remarks] [page e537] from the congressional record online through the government publishing office [ www.gpo.gov ] job corps 50th anniversary ______ hon. rosa l. delauro of connecticut in the house of representatives tuesday, april 21, 2015 ms. delauro. mr. speaker, i rise to congratulate job corps on the occasion of its fiftieth anniversary. five decades ago, president lyndon johnson stood before congress and challenged us to end poverty in the united states. job corps is a critical part of the answer to that challenge. since 1965, the program has helped level the playing field for more than two million disadvantaged young men and women through its 125 centers across 48 states, the district of columbia, and puerto rico. young people come to job corps unsure about their future and often in need of a second chance. when they graduate, they are ready to take on the challenges and opportunities of the adult world. put simply, job corps changes lives for the better. job corps is not like other career preparation programs. it does not just train and educate its participants. it instills in them discipline, structure, and the social skills they need to be successful in their lives. i had the honor of taking part in the opening of connecticut's very first job corps center in new haven in 1996. a year later, i returned to serve as graduation speaker. i was amazed at how far the students had come. today, the new haven job corps center is among the best in the nation. armed with the right skills, its alumni pursue careers everywhere from yale-new haven hospital to the department of homeland security. job corps successfully places more than three quarters of its graduates in higher education programs or careers. thanks to this track record of achievement, our nation now has many more skilled young people ready for careers as emergency medical technicians, chefs, nurses, carpenters, entrepreneurs, and all kinds of other vocations. no investment is more critical than investment in our human capital. if we want to compete in the global economy, we must invest in the workers of tomorrow and give them the skills they need to succeed. for half a century, job corps has been doing just that. i could not be more proud of the role i have played, as chair and ranking member of the appropriations subcommittee that funds job corps, in supporting the program. i congratulate job corps, its staff, and its many graduates on fifty years of success. ____________________",2570

CREC-2015-04-21-pt1-PgE537-4,CREC-2015-04-21,114,HONORING BOB RULEY,"[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 58 (Tuesday, April 21, 2015)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Pages E537-E538] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] HONORING BOB RULEY ______ HON. MICHELLE LUJAN GRISHAM of new mexico in the house of representatives Tuesday, April 21, 2015 Ms. MICHELLE LUJAN GRISHAM of New Mexico. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life of Bob Ruley, a dedicated service member, loving family man, and proud New Mexican. Growing up in Encino, New Mexico, Bob learned the importance of hard work, shared responsibility and a commitment to his family and country. When Bob was 8 years old, his mother passed away and the siblings were expected to step up and support the family. Every morning at 8:00 a.m., Bob and his brother would wake up, strap on their boots, and prep his family's 110 cattle for the all-day excursion across town. As Bob got older, World War II intensified in Europe, and on February 7, 1941 in El Paso, Texas, Bob made a decision that would change his life. At the age of 18, in front of a tiny kiosk amid the bustling Alligator Square crowd, Bob enlisted into the United States Army's Eighth Calvary Regiment, First Calvary Division. In total, Bob spent over 4 years in service to the United States in what was a remarkable career. As a Cavalryman, Bob conducted strategic maneuvers on the Louisiana and Texas borders with his horse Stony (Army Number 5U27) to protect against any German attacks that could originate in Mexico. On December 2, 1942, Bob began training and prepared for deployment to the Philippines. As an Infantryman he completed two beachheads in the Pacific theatre. The first was January, 1944 at Manus Island, Philippines, with instructions to take the Lorengau airstrip. Bob's unit, the Eighth Calvary Regiment, landed at Lugos Mission and led the charge for the U.S. forces. Bob explained, ``Anytime you were a lead guy, you got hit''. That didn't stop Bob or the Eighth Calvary Regiment from pushing forward and repelling the enemy. At the end of the battle, U.S. forces successfully drove the Japanese from the island. Bob later earned a Purple Heart for his injuries sustained during the conflict. The second beachhead was October, 1944 at the Battle of Leyte Gulf, in what became known as one of the most decisive battles of the war. Bob recalled the heroism of the troops, and in particular, two local Filipino men who spent all night paddling 185 men up and down the river. The battle was so influential that President Truman announced a Presidential citation for the skill, bravery, and courage that U.S. forces displayed in the victory. On September 12, 1945, Bob returned home and began looking for work. Employment prospects were slim and, for Bob, that meant taking odd jobs to make a living. Whether he was delivering flowers, passing out court summons, or covering the night shift at a meat factory for an overworked employee, Bob always did what was needed to provide for his family. He eventually landed a full time job at the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway Company in Las Vegas, New Mexico, where he would spend the next 38 years as a Conductor and Brakeman. Bob's story reminds us of a generation of Americans who, with hard work, persistence and determination, resolved to build a better America--a generation that constructed our modem concept of the ``American Dream'' and safeguarded the freedoms that we enjoy today. I have known Bob my whole adult life and am fortunate to have felt his exuberant joy and generous heart over the years. He could always be found at the local Denny's, walking along the perimeter of the University of New Mexico's North golf course, at his favorite restaurant, Hurricane's, in downtown Albuquerque, or spending time with his family that he cherished deeply. From his childhood efforts to support his family, to risking his life overseas to preserve the liberties of millions of Americans, to fighting to create a richer life for his children, Bob represents the very best of our country. Bob's enduring legacy of service, sacrifice and unwavering faith in our community, state, and country will remain a lasting inspiration for future generations.

CHRIS VAN HOLLEN of maryland in the house of representatives Tuesday, April 21, 2015 Mr. VAN HOLLEN. Mr. Speaker, I stand to commend the efforts of President Obama and our P5+1 partners to achieve a strong, verifiable agreement to prevent Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapon. The economic sanctions imposed through joint action from the Congress and the president, combined with the sanctions imposed by our international partners, have succeeded in bringing Iran to the negotiating table. We must maintain the unity that has succeeded in keeping the pressure on Iran. That unity helped produce an interim agreement last November that, among other things, effectively eliminated Iran's stockpile of more highly enriched nuclear material. Even the early critics of the interim agreement have now acknowledged that it was a useful step. We now have The Framework for a Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action on Iran's Nuclear Program that represents another important step toward the goal of preventing Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon. As the Administration has acknowledged, many important details remain to be negotiated in the coming months. I will be carefully monitoring and reviewing the ongoing negotiations to determine whether the final product meets the objectives we have established. As these negotiations proceed, it is important that Congress refrain from taking actions that could weaken our negotiating position and undermine the multi-lateral sanctions that brought Iran to the negotiating table. There is a very important role for Congress in this process. Congress will review this agreement and have the opportunity to act. Moreover, any repeal of the sanctions legislation will require congressional action. As negotiations continue, I look forward to working with the president and my congressional colleagues to prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon. I agree with President Obama that it would be best if we can achieve that objective by negotiating a verifiable agreement. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 58 (Tuesday, April 21, 2015)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E538] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] REGARDING THE ONGOING NEGOTIATIONS TO PREVENT IRAN FROM ACQUIRING A NUCLEAR WEAPON ______ HON.

Mr. Speaker, I rise today to ask my colleagues to join me in recognizing Dave McConnell, who this year is observing his 50th year in the District of Columbia at WTOP Radio, where he has provided outstanding service to radio listeners in Washington, D.C. and the national capital region. For five decades, Dave McConnell has been the deeply crisp golden voice the national capital region has tuned in to for news. Dave has brilliantly made himself the preeminent reporter the region can trust to get the news straight. Dave's grasp of the complicated news of the day is so profound that he can summarize it in a few short edifying sentences. So significant has been Dave's talented voice, his peerless dedication to unbiased reporting, and his vast knowledge of Congress and of Washington that WTOP owes part of its continued success to Dave McConnell. A graduate of the University of Maryland, Dave McConnell was drafted to work for Armed Forces Radio before returning to the Washington area, where he first worked at WTTG Channel Five and WMAL before starting at WTOP in 1965, where he has remained for 50 years. Dave continues to thrive in his career. His popular ``Today on the Hill'' reports are broadcast each weekday, each hour in the morning and afternoon, with the occasional special reports. Dave has provided exemplary coverage of 12 presidential elections, five inaugurations, and countless political changes. He has been the recipient of a host of honors. Among the most notable are his recent Career Achievement of the Radio and Television Correspondents Association award in 2013 along with his 2001 AIR Lifetime Achievement Award and the Society of Professional Journalists Hall of Fame award in 1999. Mr. Speaker, Members of Congress, like residents of the District of Columbia, where WTOP is located, and the entire national capital region, have benefited from Dave's straight forward and always unbiased reporting.

Mr. Speaker, I rise today to commemorate the motion picture, ``Field of Dreams,'' which is set in the First District of Iowa. 26 years ago today, movie-goers were introduced to the wonderful pastoral landscapes that dot my district and first heard ``If you build it, he will come.'' Since then, the movie, adapted from the novel ``Shoeless Joe'' by W.P. Kinsella, has become recognized as a representation of classic American cinema. Directed by Phil Alden Robinson and starring Kevin Costner, Amy Madigan, James Earl Jones, Ray Liotta, and Burt Lancaster, ``Field of Dreams'' uniquely blends the importance of family, dreams deferred, and America's pastime--baseball. Released on April 21, 1989, ``Field of Dreams'' received three Academy Award nominations: Best Original Score, Best Adapted Screenplay, and Best Picture. The original farmhouse and baseball diamond from the movie, in Dyersville, Iowa, is open daily to the public for the 2015 season through October free of charge. On July 5, 2015, the ghost players will return to the field for their first ``Ghost Sunday'' game of the year. Visitors enjoy a ball game played by the baseball legends appearing in the movie. I encourage all fans to visit the Field of Dreams site website at www.fodmoviesite.com for more information.

DUNCAN HUNTER of california in the house of representatives Tuesday, April 21, 2015 Mr. HUNTER. Mr. Speaker, in February, 1942, Howard Payne was a 27- year old employee of the Bank of Benton when he received his induction notice. He reported to the Scott Field, IL, Induction Center and was assigned an Army serial number. Payne completed his basic training at Camp McCoy, WI, the site of the Second Army Maneuvers where 65,000 Soldiers from seven states formed the largest troop concentration in the Midwest. Payne was sent to Fort Sheridan, IL and then to Camp Ellis near Macomb, IL where he was assigned to the 368th Engineer Battalion. In October 1943, Payne's battalion was alerted that it would be shipping out from Camp Shanks, NY. Payne remembers leaving the New York Harbor and viewing the Statue of Liberty. ``Our Captain told us to take a good look at the Statue because some of you will never see her again.'' Payne recounts, ``He was right. I saw an unbelievable loss of life. We did not outgun the German's. We just outnumbered them.'' Payne was with the first military convoy to travel overseas. Passage of the Atlantic Ocean was dangerous because the German's controlled the air and sea with submarines below and with airplanes above. It took his ship 14 days to cross the Atlantic Ocean due to the strength of the enemy. ``Our ship had to zigzag in the ocean to keep out of harm's way.'' Most American troop ships were accompanied by battleships. Payne's ship landed in Bristol, England, amid a furious battle. German airplanes were strafing Bristol's railroad tracks, city streets, and local citizens. To help ward off the low flying airplanes, the residents of Bristol had erected huge balloons to keep the planes from flying at a low altitude. ``We were introduced to war shortly after we landed.'' Members of the 368th were boarded on trains and transported to Liverpool, England. ``We began building airports and housing for the troops,'' noted Payne. While they were constructing airfields and barracks, the United States declared war on Germany. In May, 1944, the 368th were told that they would be a part of an invasion. ``We loaded our ships with equipment and troops and waited. Multiple times we were told to ``ship-out,'' but on two occasions, we were ordered to ``stand-down.'' Weather played a role in the timeline for the invasion. ``Finally, we got orders to ship out'' Payne remembers. On June 6, 1944, U.S. Army Private Payne was in the second wave at Utah Beach in the Normandy Peninsula Invasion. Payne joined thousands of Americans in Operation Overlord. GIs from the 368th were transferred from ships to Landing Ships, Tanks (LST). The LSTs were filled with caterpillars, tractors, and heavy construction equipment. The weight of the equipment caused the LST to sit deep in the water. ``Our LST hit the ocean's floor early and we had to jump out and wade ashore.'' Utah Beach was one of the five sectors of the Allied invasion of German-occupied France in the Normandy landings. The westernmost of the five landing beaches, Utah is on the Cotentin Peninsula. Amphibious landings at Utah were undertaken by U.S. Army troops, with sea transport and naval artillery support provided by the U.S. Navy, with elements from the British Royal Navy. The objective at Utah Beach was to secure a beachhead, the location of important port facilities at Cherbourg. The amphibious assault by the U.S. 4th Infantry Division and 70th Tank Battalion was supported by airborne landings of the 82nd and the 101st. Their mission was to seal off the Cotentin Peninsula to prevent the Germans from reinforcing Cherbourg. The Allies faced two battalions of the 919th Grenadier Regiment, part of the 709th Static Infantry Division. German fortifications were under the leadership of ``The Desert Fox,'' Field Marshal Erwin Rommel. Payne remembers that the beaches were strewed with men who were dead, dying and wounded. The Germans were high over the cliffs. The first goal was to get ashore and scale the cliffs. ``When we got to the top of the cliffs, I thought the rough part was over, but I discovered the bad stuff was just beginning'' Payne recalls. Members of the 386th immediately began clearing the area of obstacles and mines. Additional American reinforcements continued to arrive. At the close of D-Day, Allied forces had captured about half of the planned area. Contingents of German defenders remained, but the beachhead was secure. Payne's unit pushed the Germans back to Le Mans, France. The 368th constructed a pontoon bridge to facilitate the European Theater of Operations and allowed Lieutenant Colonel Christian Clarke, Jr. to move his 358th Infantry, 90th Infantry Division across the river. Clarke proceeded on into Western France. Payne was with the forces that helped liberate Paris, fought the enemy to Luxemburg, and was caught in the Ardennes region of Wallonia in Belgium. It was the winter of 1944 when the Allied Forces had to defend the important harbor of Antwerp from the Germans [[Page E540]] in a 40-day surprise attack that came to be known as the ``Battle of the Bulge.'' Between December 16, 1944, and January 25, 1945, the U.S. forces fought back the German attack, and in doing so, incurred their highest casualties for any operation of the war. America's fighting spirit prevailed and, late in January, the Allied forces scored a decisive victory over Germany. The Allied forces fought the enemy up the Ryan River and forced the German's back to Berlin. Payne's battalion was stopped from attacking Berlin due to terms of the Yalta Agreement. The United States and England capitulated to Russia, and agreed that the only invading forces would be the Red Army. ``We had the fight and we had the spirit to battle the enemy all the way to Berlin, but Russian dictator Joseph Stalin had convinced the Allied forces to stop our progress.'' On May 8, 1945, Payne was near Dusseldorf, Germany when the Allied forces announced Victory in Europe. The six-year-old War had concluded in Europe, but the Japanese were still fighting in the Pacific Theatre. Payne and others were told that GIs involved in the Normandy Invasion were exempt from the war in the Pacific. The Pacific conflict ended only after the August 6, 1945, detonation of the Atomic Bomb. President Harry S. Truman ordered the deployment of the new weapon that caused the Japanese to capitulate to Allied demands. Payne waited from June until November to be shipped back to the states. On Dec. 5, 1945, Payne was discharged from the U.S. Army with the rank of Staff Sergeant. Ten days after his discharge, he married Helene Takie in his hometown of Benton, IL. Their marriage lasted almost 65 years, until her passing in July, 2010. Payne returned to his position at the Bank of Benton and eventually became its president. He remains active as a community leader, a champion of education projects and a philanthropist. Mr. Speaker, today Payne will celebrate his 100th birthday at his rural Benton, Illinois, home. We extend our deepest appreciation to Howard Lee Payne for his service to his country, both in battle during WWII, and for his post-war contributions. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 58 (Tuesday, April 21, 2015)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Pages E539-E540] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] WISHING SSGT HOWARD LEE PAYNE A HAPPY 100TH BIRTHDAY ______ HON.

America's fighting spirit prevailed and, late in January, the Allied forces scored a decisive victory over Germany. The Allied forces fought the enemy up the Ryan River and forced the German's back to Berlin. Payne's battalion was stopped from attacking Berlin due to terms of the Yalta Agreement. The United States and England capitulated to Russia, and agreed that the only invading forces would be the Red Army. ``We had the fight and we had the spirit to battle the enemy all the way to Berlin, but Russian dictator Joseph Stalin had convinced the Allied forces to stop our progress.'' On May 8, 1945, Payne was near Dusseldorf, Germany when the Allied forces announced Victory in Europe. The six-year-old War had concluded in Europe, but the Japanese were still fighting in the Pacific Theatre. Payne and others were told that GIs involved in the Normandy Invasion were exempt from the war in the Pacific. The Pacific conflict ended only after the August 6, 1945, detonation of the Atomic Bomb. President Harry S. Truman ordered the deployment of the new weapon that caused the Japanese to capitulate to Allied demands. Payne waited from June until November to be shipped back to the states. On Dec. 5, 1945, Payne was discharged from the U.S. Army with the rank of Staff Sergeant. Ten days after his discharge, he married Helene Takie in his hometown of Benton, IL. Their marriage lasted almost 65 years, until her passing in July, 2010. Payne returned to his position at the Bank of Benton and eventually became its president. He remains active as a community leader, a champion of education projects and a philanthropist. Mr. Speaker, today Payne will celebrate his 100th birthday at his rural Benton, Illinois, home. We extend our deepest appreciation to Howard Lee Payne for his service to his country, both in battle during WWII, and for his post-war contributions.

online through the government publishing office [ www.gpo.gov ] wishing ssgt howard lee payne a happy 100th birthday ______ hon. duncan hunter of california in the house of representatives tuesday, april 21, 2015 mr. hunter. mr. speaker, in february, 1942, howard payne was a 27- year old employee of the bank of benton when he received his induction notice. he reported to the scott field, il, induction center and was assigned an army serial number. payne completed his basic training at camp mccoy, wi, the site of the second army maneuvers where 65,000 soldiers from seven states formed the largest troop concentration in the midwest. payne was sent to fort sheridan, il and then to camp ellis near macomb, il where he was assigned to the 368th engineer battalion. in october 1943, payne's battalion was alerted that it would be shipping out from camp shanks, ny. payne remembers leaving the new york harbor and viewing the statue of liberty. ``our captain told us to take a good look at the statue because some of you will never see her again.'' payne recounts, ``he was right. i saw an unbelievable loss of life. we did not outgun the german's. we just outnumbered them.'' payne was with the first military convoy to travel overseas. passage of the atlantic ocean was dangerous because the german's controlled the air and sea with submarines below and with airplanes above. it took his ship 14 days to cross the atlantic ocean due to the strength of the enemy. ``our ship had to zigzag in the ocean to keep out of harm's way.'' most american troop ships were accompanied by battleships. payne's ship landed in bristol, england, amid a furious battle. german airplanes were strafing bristol's railroad tracks, city streets, and local citizens. to help ward off the low flying airplanes, the residents of bristol had erected huge balloons to keep the planes from flying at a low altitude. ``we were introduced to war shortly after we landed.'' members of the 368th were boarded on trains and transported to liverpool, england. ``we began building airports and housing for the troops,'' noted payne. while they were constructing airfields and barracks, the united states declared war on germany. in may, 1944, the 368th were told that they would be a part of an invasion. ``we loaded our ships with equipment and troops and waited. multiple times we were told to ``ship-out,'' but on two occasions, we were ordered to ``stand-down.'' weather played a role in the timeline for the invasion. ``finally, we got orders to ship out'' payne remembers. on june 6, 1944, u.s. army private payne was in the second wave at utah beach in the normandy peninsula invasion. payne joined thousands of americans in operation overlord. gis from the 368th were transferred from ships to landing ships, tanks (lst). the lsts were filled with caterpillars, tractors, and heavy construction equipment. the weight of the equipment caused the lst to sit deep in the water. ``our lst hit the ocean's floor early and we had to jump out and wade ashore.'' utah beach was one of the five sectors of the allied invasion of german-occupied france in the normandy landings. the westernmost of the five landing beaches, utah is on the cotentin peninsula. amphibious landings at utah were undertaken by u.s. army troops, with sea transport and naval artillery support provided by the u.s. navy, with elements from the british royal navy. the objective at utah beach was to secure a beachhead, the location of important port facilities at cherbourg. the amphibious assault by the u.s. 4th infantry division and 70th tank battalion was supported by airborne landings of the 82nd and the 101st. their mission was to seal off the cotentin peninsula to prevent the germans from reinforcing cherbourg. the allies faced two battalions of the 919th grenadier regiment, part of the 709th static infantry division. german fortifications were under the leadership of ``the desert fox,'' field marshal erwin rommel. payne remembers that the beaches were strewed with men who were dead, dying and wounded. the germans were high over the cliffs. the first goal was to get ashore and scale the cliffs. ``when we got to the top of the cliffs, i thought the rough part was over, but i discovered the bad stuff was just beginning'' payne recalls. members of the 386th immediately began clearing the area of obstacles and mines. additional american reinforcements continued to arrive. at the close of d-day, allied forces had captured about half of the planned area. contingents of german defenders remained, but the beachhead was secure. payne's unit pushed the germans back to le mans, france. the 368th constructed a pontoon bridge to facilitate the european theater of operations and allowed lieutenant colonel christian clarke, jr. to move his 358th infantry, 90th infantry division across the river. clarke proceeded on into western france. payne was with the forces that helped liberate paris, fought the enemy to luxemburg, and was caught in the ardennes region of wallonia in belgium. it was the winter of 1944 when the allied forces had to defend the important harbor of antwerp from the germans [[page e540]] in a 40-day surprise attack that came to be known as the ``battle of the bulge.'' between december 16, 1944, and january 25, 1945, the u.s. forces fought back the german attack, and in

Born in Burbank, California, on August 25, 1927, to Helen Culbertson and Leonard Orin Hofstetter, Ms. Hofstetter grew up in the towns of Artesia and Whittier. She graduated from Whittier High School in 1943, Monmouth College in 1948, and Boalt Hall Law School at the University of California at Berkeley in 1951. Ms. Hofstetter opened a law office with her sister Marilynn in 1953. She was appointed to judge at Whittier Municipal in 1963, and became the first woman to serve as President of the California Judges Association in 1976. Ms. Hofstetter was a life member of Soroptimist International and the American Association of University Women. She served on the College Board at Monmouth College, where she was later inducted into the Hall of Fame. Ms. Hofstetter was an active member of the Democratic Party and a champion of democratic values on the North Coast. Among her favorite hobbies was fishing the rivers and lakes of California and Oregon with her lifelong friend and partner, former California Assemblywoman Sally Tanner. In 2001 and 2002, Pat and Sally were winners in the California-Oregon Fishing Derby. Ms. Hofstetter was an avid poker and bridge player and had a great appreciation for music and movies. Pat is survived by her companion Sally Tanner; her sister Helen Raphael and niece Rose Anne of New Liberia, Louisiana; her sister Marilynn Hofstetter of Ferndale and nephew John Raphael and wife Christine, along with their children Melanie and Kathleen.

It is a shame and a disgrace that in 2015, after the LGBT community has made such enormous strides towards equal protections under the law, that we continue to see discriminatory legislation advanced in states like Indiana and Arkansas. At a time when what we truly need is comprehensive legislation to ensure that LGBT individuals are treated and protected, intolerance is sadly being codified in law under the false flag of religious liberties. I am glad that the national reaction to discriminatory RFRA laws was swift and disapproving, from businesses and individuals, to governments and communities. I was proud that the City of Oakland located in my district, banned city-funded travel to Indiana in the wake of the state's discriminatory statute. Now, Congress must respond by sending a strong message that we will not stand for prejudice and small-mindedness. This resolution is a step in the right direction. It outlines the need for LGBT people to receive full protections under the law and urges comprehensive legislation to prohibit discrimination in areas where unequal treatment against LGBT people is still the law of the land. I thank the gentleman from Indiana as well as my fellow colleagues in the LGBT Equality Caucus for introducing this important resolution and urge my colleagues to lend it their support. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 58 (Tuesday, April 21, 2015)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E540] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] H.

JIM COOPER of tennessee in the house of representatives Tuesday, April 21, 2015 Mr. COOPER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to Belmont University and its men's basketball program, the Belmont Bruins, led by Coach Rick Byrd. Under Coach Byrd's leadership, Belmont's basketball program has flourished. Belmont is consistently among the top Division I teams and has made it to seven NCAA tournaments. But its most prestigious accomplishments are not on the court. The USA Today said it best: ``Belmont wins where it counts: In the classroom.'' Thanks to its perfect score from Inside Higher Ed's rankings, Belmont won the national championship for academics for the second time in three years. Every single player graduates. The team's cumulative grade point average has been above 3.0 for fourteen consecutive seasons, and no Belmont player since 2003 has left the basketball team for any reason other than graduation. Belmont's successes both on and off the court have separated the Bruins from the rest of the pack. Today, I join my fellow Tennesseans in honoring Coach Rick Byrd and the Belmont Bruins for their vigorous commitment to the highest standards in academics and athletics. They make our district and the state of Tennessee proud.

LUKE MESSER of indiana in the house of representatives Tuesday, April 21, 2015 Mr. MESSER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to the life of Tom Ray Raper, an innovative entrepreneur, generous philanthropist and devoted family man from the Sixth District of Indiana. Tom embodied what it meant to live the American Dream. He took a $2,000 investment in 1964 to open a small used car dealership and eventually turned it into one of the largest RV dealerships in America. He owned and operated Tom Raper RVs for 38 more years before selling his dealership empire to David Bane's Camping World Company in 2002. Not only was Tom a monumental success in the RV business, but he was also known for his huge heart and charitable spirit. After selling his company, Mr. Raper used his time and money to give back to the Richmond community. In 2009, Indiana University East renamed Middlefork Hall to Tom Raper Hall after he bequeathed $2.17 million to the university. Tom donated more than $1 million to Wayne County to build a 5,000-seat exhibition building and to make other improvements to the Wayne County Fairgrounds. He also gave $250,000 to the city to transform the gymnasium at the Civil Hall into a modern performing arts center. Most recently, Tom, established a $50,000 endowed scholarship fund at Ivy Tech Community College in Richmond as a means to provide more students with the opportunity to get a college education. It is for selfless contributions like these that the city of Richmond renamed Williamsburg Pike to Williamsburg Pike/Tom Raper Way. I have had the pleasure to meet with Tom several times throughout my life. He was an icon in Richmond and a philanthropic inspiration for any man or woman looking to give back to their community. I will always be grateful for the contributions he has made to improve the great city of Richmond, Indiana. Today, it is my privilege to honor the life of Tom Raper. My thoughts and prayers go out to Tom's family and his wife of 46 years, Suzanne. May God comfort those he left behind with His peace and strength. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 58 (Tuesday, April 21, 2015)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E541] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] TRIBUTE TO THE LIFE OF TOM RAY RAPER ______ HON.

It is Job Corps' unique model, partnering the federal government with private industry that has made the program so successful for so many years. Each year Job Corps serves over 50,000 at-risk youth at 125 residential campuses located across the country, and over eighty percent of Job Corps graduates find employment, enlist in the military, or enroll in higher education classes. I am honored to represent two of these outstanding centers: the Earle C. Clements Job Corps Center in Morganfield and the Muhlenberg Job Corps Center in Greenville. These centers are true assets to their communities. I have visited these centers in person, and I have met with educators, staff, and students. It is the students who are the true testament to the success of this program, and I am moved each time I visit with them and hear just how much Job Corps has changed their lives. I cofounded the Friends of Job Corps Congressional Caucus in 2006 because I believe in this program. I congratulate Job Corps on its fifty years of success, and I hope it will continue to enrich the lives of many more young people in the years to come. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 58 (Tuesday, April 21, 2015)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E541] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] RECOGNIZING THE 50TH ANNIVERSARY OF JOB CORPS ______ HON.

ED WHITFIELD of kentucky in the house of representatives Tuesday, April 21, 2015 Mr. WHITFIELD. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the Job Corps program as it celebrates its 50th anniversary. For fifty years, Job Corps has served America's most at-risk and vulnerable youths by providing an opportunity to finish their education while obtaining career training and the skills necessary to become productive members of society. It is Job Corps' unique model, partnering the federal government with private industry that has made the program so successful for so many years. Each year Job Corps serves over 50,000 at-risk youth at 125 residential campuses located across the country, and over eighty percent of Job Corps graduates find employment, enlist in the military, or enroll in higher education classes.

ANN KIRKPATRICK of arizona in the house of representatives Tuesday, April 21, 2015 Mrs. KIRKPATRICK. Mr. Speaker, according to the Arizona Department of Public Safety, there were 1,725 reports of rape or attempted rape in 2012, which is five sexual assaults per day. And in 2014, the U.S. Department of Justice gave an alarming estimate that as many as 1 in 3 Native American women would be sexually assaulted in their lifetime, a rate 2.5 times higher than for any other group. Unfortunately, only 40 percent of sexual assaults are reported, and if the victim is in college that number is cut in half, according to the Justice Department. Research and information from Pennsylvania State University and a 2010 U.S. Senate subcommittee hearing found that the top reason sexual assault victims do not report the crime is their fear of not being believed and being blamed for the attack. To address this issue, End Violence Against Women International has developed a program titled ``Start By Believing,'' a message that confronts the reality that many victims do not get the support they need when they report the crime. Local governments, private businesses, universities and colleges across the country are participating in the Start By Believing campaign. April is Sexual Assault Awareness Month, and I encourage people everywhere to share this simple message of support for survivors of sexual assault.

MARC A. VEASEY of texas in the house of representatives Tuesday, April 21, 2015 Mr. VEASEY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in order to commend The New Rising Star Missionary Baptist Church led by Pastor Isadore Edwards, Jr. for establishing the Raymond B. Spencer Scholarship Fund that strives to not only assist young students in their pursuit of higher education but to embody the generous and selfless spirit of Dr. Raymond Bernard Spencer. Dr. Raymond Bernard Spencer was born in Houston, Texas on September 21, 1964, as the youngest child to Manfred and Helen Spencer. After attending public schools in Houston, he went on to obtain his Bachelor of Science Degree from Oklahoma Christian College in 1989. He then completed the Master of Divinity Program at Southwestern Baptist Theological Seminary in Fort Worth, Texas, which I am proud to represent in Congress. Dr. Raymond Bernard Spencer continued in his education at Southwestern and obtained his doctoral degree in Theology in 2001. As a further distinction and honor, he served as the first full time African American pastor at Southwestern where he taught preaching in the School of Theology while also serving as adjunct professor of the Old and New Testament at Dallas Baptist University. Finally, his service to faith included Superintendent of Church School and Assistant to Pastor Isadore Davis, Jr. at The New Rising Star Missionary Baptist Church in Fort Worth, Texas. There can be no doubt that Dr. Spencer was an exceptional student, respected seeker of knowledge, and follower in the path of God, but he was also a caring professor, a trusted friend, gifted vocalist, and a generous advocate of academic excellence for students and young people. He pursued all of these passions in life, faith, and academics with such staunch persistence and zeal until he was laid to rest on January 10, 2013. I can think of no better way to honor his lifelong devotion to improving the lives of those around him than continuing his advocacy for higher education with the Raymond B. Spencer Scholarship Fund and I congratulate The New Rising Star Missionary Baptist Church on their tenth anniversary of this wonderful endeavor. I am so proud to represent The New Rising Star Missionary Baptist Church and many members of their congregation who devote their lives to improving the lives of their young students and opening up opportunities for them to preserve Dr. Spencer's legacy of excellence. Let their efforts serve as a testament to the lives of others for what can be achieved through dedication and devotion to the greater good of humanity.

ROD BLUM of iowa in the house of representatives Tuesday, April 21, 2015 Mr. BLUM. Mr. Speaker, Governor Terry E. Branstad and Lt. Governor Kim Reynolds inducted three individuals and one organization into the Iowa Volunteer Hall of Fame on April 14th, 2015 in Des Moines, Iowa. The 2015 inductees include H.D. ``Ike'' Leighty from Waterloo and the Sisters of Mercy from Cedar Rapids. Both reside in my district and I rise today to honor their hard work and acknowledge their accomplishments. H.D. ``Ike'' Leighty co-founded Engineered Products Company in Waterloo, Iowa in 1977. After selling the business, he established The Leighty Foundation and the Mother Moon Service Scholarship program. Every year, this program awards a college scholarship to one Black Hawk county high school junior who completes over 100 hours of community service. To date, 179 Iowans have received assistance towards a college education from the Mother Moon Service Scholarship. In 1989, the Sisters of Mercy founded the Catherine McAuley Center to develop long term solutions to poverty in the Cedar Rapids area. Guided by the five core values of empowerment, learning, mercy, community, and commitment, the Sisters provide one-on-one tutoring for adults, as well as transitional housing for victims of domestic violence, and those who suffer from mental illness and substance abuse. H.D. ``Ike'' Leighty and the Sisters of Mercy are model citizens and assets to their communities. I encourage all Iowans to visit the State of Iowa Historical Museum in Des Moines and view the Iowa Volunteer Hall of Fame plaques where their names now join 155 other inductees. On behalf of the people of Iowa's first district, I commend Mr. Leighty and the Sisters of Mercy for their selflessness and sacrifice in service to our communities. I congratulate them on their 2015 induction into the Iowa Volunteer Hall of Fame. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 58 (Tuesday, April 21, 2015)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E542] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] CONGRATULATING 2015 INDUCTEES INTO THE IOWA VOLUNTEER HALL OF FAME ______ HON.

RAUL RUIZ of california in the house of representatives Tuesday, April 21, 2015 Mr. RUIZ. Mr. Speaker, due to the recent birth of my twin daughters, I was unable to be present for votes on the House floor the week of April 13, 2015. Below is an explanation of how I would have voted and why. I would have voted for H.R. 1259, the Helping Expand Lending Practices in Rural Communities Act, which creates a process for areas to be considered rural to allow otherwise prohibited balloon payments in qualified mortgages. This bill aims to improve access to financing for borrowers in rural, underserved areas, which will help families nationwide achieve the dream of home ownership. I would have voted for H.R. 1265, the Bureau Advisory Commission Transparency Act, which requires advisory committees established by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau to adhere to federal ethics and conflict-of-interest laws. Government transparency is essential to holding administration officials accountable, and this bill will help ensure that the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau conducts their crucial work out in the open. I would have voted for H.R. 1480, the SAFE Act Confidentiality and Privilege Enhancement Act, which would provide confidentiality protections to financial services regulators when they access information in the national mortgage licensing and registry system. This bill will provide financial regulators the confidentiality protections they need to protect consumers and eliminate fraud in the mortgage industry. I would have voted against H.R. 650, the Preserving Access to Manufactured Housing Act, which reduces regulatory restrictions on high-cost mortgages in the manufactured housing industry to increase the maximum interest rates manufactured housing vendors can charge. This bill would hamstring Dodd-Frank regulations designed to protect consumers from predatory lending practices in the manufactured housing industry. The bill seeks to reduce the regulatory restrictions on high- cost mortgages in the manufactured housing industry by increasing the maximum interest rates manufactured housing vendors can charge. I would have voted for H.R. 685, the Mortgage Choice Act of 2015, which seeks to clarify conflicting definitions under current law concerning affiliated and unaffiliated title companies, and could help keep interest rates on mortgage loans affordable. I would have voted for Rep. Van Hollen's Motion to Instruct Conferees on S. Con. Res. 11, which would instruct conferees to recede to the Senate budget resolution accommodation for legislation to improve workplace benefits, including paid sick leave. The motion would also instruct budget conferees to reject the House-passed budget's provision to turn Medicare into a voucher program. Our seniors depend on Medicare, and I will reject any attempt to end the Medicare guarantee and increase out-of-pocket health costs for seniors. I would have voted for H.R. 1562, the Contracting and Tax Accountability Act of 2015, and H.R. 1563, the Federal Employee Tax Accountability Act of 2015. H.R. 1562 would generally prohibit individuals and companies with seriously delinquent tax debts from receiving federal contracts and grants, and H.R. 1563 would make individuals with seriously delinquent tax debt ineligible for federal employment if they fail to accept a payment plan within nine months of enactment. Corporations and individuals with serious tax delinquencies should not receive taxpayer-subsidized benefits over those who fulfill their tax obligations. I would have voted against H.R. 622, the State and Local Sales Tax Deduction Fairness Act, which would permanently allow taxpayers to deduct state and local sales taxes in lieu of state and local income taxes, without offsetting the cost. This bill would increase the deficit by $42 billion and encourages states to raise taxes, pressuring the federal government to increase taxes to account for the difference. California does not benefit from the state and local sales tax deduction, so this bill would push more of the nation's tax burden onto hardworking taxpayers in my district. Finally, I would have voted against H.R. 1105, the Death Tax Repeal Act. This bill repeals the federal estate tax, which currently affects only estates valued at $5.4 million or above ($10.8 million for couples). This bill would add $269 billion to the federal deficit, and the entirety of those benefits would go to the wealthiest 0.2 percent of estates. The federal tax code should expand opportunity for everyone, rather than stacking the deck against middle-class families. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 58 (Tuesday, April 21, 2015)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E543] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] PERSONAL EXPLANATION ______ HON.

volume 161, number 58 (tuesday, april 21, 2015)] [extensions of remarks] [page e543] from the congressional record online through the government publishing office [ www.gpo.gov ] personal explanation ______ hon. raul ruiz of california in the house of representatives tuesday, april 21, 2015 mr. ruiz. mr. speaker, due to the recent birth of my twin daughters, i was unable to be present for votes on the house floor the week of april 13, 2015. below is an explanation of how i would have voted and why. i would have voted for h.r. 1259, the helping expand lending practices in rural communities act, which creates a process for areas to be considered rural to allow otherwise prohibited balloon payments in qualified mortgages. this bill aims to improve access to financing for borrowers in rural, underserved areas, which will help families nationwide achieve the dream of home ownership. i would have voted for h.r. 1265, the bureau advisory commission transparency act, which requires advisory committees established by the consumer financial protection bureau to adhere to federal ethics and conflict-of-interest laws. government transparency is essential to holding administration officials accountable, and this bill will help ensure that the consumer financial protection bureau conducts their crucial work out in the open. i would have voted for h.r. 1480, the safe act confidentiality and privilege enhancement act, which would provide confidentiality protections to financial services regulators when they access information in the national mortgage licensing and registry system. this bill will provide financial regulators the confidentiality protections they need to protect consumers and eliminate fraud in the mortgage industry. i would have voted against h.r. 650, the preserving access to manufactured housing act, which reduces regulatory restrictions on high-cost mortgages in the manufactured housing industry to increase the maximum interest rates manufactured housing vendors can charge. this bill would hamstring dodd-frank regulations designed to protect consumers from predatory lending practices in the manufactured housing industry. the bill seeks to reduce the regulatory restrictions on high- cost mortgages in the manufactured housing industry by increasing the maximum interest rates manufactured housing vendors can charge. i would have voted for h.r. 685, the mortgage choice act of 2015, which seeks to clarify conflicting definitions under current law concerning affiliated and unaffiliated title companies, and could help keep interest rates on mortgage loans affordable. i would have voted for rep. van hollen's motion to instruct conferees on s. con. res. 11, which would instruct conferees to recede to the senate budget resolution accommodation for legislation to improve workplace benefits, including paid sick leave. the motion would also instruct budget conferees to reject the house-passed budget's provision to turn medicare into a voucher program. our seniors depend on medicare, and i will reject any attempt to end the medicare guarantee and increase out-of-pocket health costs for seniors. i would have voted for h.r. 1562, the contracting and tax accountability act of 2015, and h.r. 1563, the federal employee tax accountability act of 2015. h.r. 1562 would generally prohibit individuals and companies with seriously delinquent tax debts from receiving federal contracts and grants, and h.r. 1563 would make individuals with seriously delinquent tax debt ineligible for federal employment if they fail to accept a payment plan within nine months of enactment. corporations and individuals with serious tax delinquencies should not receive taxpayer-subsidized benefits over those who fulfill their tax obligations. i would have voted against h.r. 622, the state and local sales tax deduction fairness act, which would permanently allow taxpayers to deduct state and local sales taxes in lieu of state and local income taxes, without offsetting the cost. this bill would increase the deficit by $42 billion and encourages states to raise taxes, pressuring the federal government to increase taxes to account for the difference. california does not benefit from the state and local sales tax deduction, so this bill would push more of the nation's tax burden onto hardworking taxpayers in my district. finally, i would have voted against h.r. 1105, the death tax repeal act. this bill repeals the federal estate tax, which currently affects only estates valued at $5.4 million or above ($10.8 million for couples). this bill would add $269 billion to the federal deficit, and the entirety of those benefits would go to the wealthiest 0.2 percent of estates. the federal tax code should expand opportunity for everyone, rather than stacking the deck against middle-class families. ____________________",4872

SANFORD D. BISHOP, JR. of georgia in the house of representatives Tuesday, April 21, 2015 Mr. BISHOP of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, this evening, hundreds of individuals from across the United States will be gathering at the Mellon Auditorium in Washington, D.C. to celebrate the fiftieth anniversary of Job Corps. Originally created by President Lyndon B. Johnson to wage the War on Poverty, the Job Corps program is one of the nation's most successful anti-poverty programs today. Job Corps empowers its participants to become productive members of society by helping them reach their goals, achieve educational aspirations, and learn a trade. I have seen first-hand the positive impact Job Corps has had on the graduates of Turner Job Corps in my hometown of Albany, Georgia. There is Marc Scotton of Atlanta, Georgia, who arrived at Turner Job Corps Center not believing in himself and not focused on his schoolwork. After successfully completing the program, he will begin an internship at an Atlanta radio station and plans to study Mass Communications at college. There is Anna Washington, who first heard of Turner Job Corps through her church. She chose to pursue a certification as a Medical Administrative Assistant. Staying focused, Anna completed her career pathway in six months. A year and a half ago, she became a certified Clinical Medical Administrative Assistant and attended advanced training at the Atlanta Job Corps. These two stories are but a few of the successes of the Turner Job Corps Center and the Job Corps program in general. Their achievements also are the result of the outstanding staff at these Job Corps Centers. The young men and women who successfully complete their training at Job Corps Centers across the country receive much more [[Page E544]] than a certificate of completion. They gain valuable career and social skills that will serve them well throughout their lives--all in a supportive environment that encourages growth and success. President Lyndon Johnson once said when describing his War on Poverty--``What we're trying to do--instead of people getting something for nothing, we're going to try to fit them where they can take care of themselves . . . That's our program. We don't want them to get something for nothing. We want to get them where they can carry their own weight.'' As the Co-Chairs of the Friends of the Job Corps Congressional Caucus, Congressman Christopher Gibson and I will work with the 79 other members of the Caucus to ensure that it continues to fulfill President Lyndon B. Johnson's goal now and into the future. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 58 (Tuesday, April 21, 2015)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Pages E543-E544] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] FIFTIETH ANNIVERSARY OF JOB CORPS ______ HON.

CREC-2015-04-21-pt1-PgE545-2,CREC-2015-04-21,114,LIFT THE CRUDE OIL BAN,"[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 58 (Tuesday, April 21, 2015)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E545] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] LIFT THE CRUDE OIL BAN ______ HON. TED POE of texas in the house of representatives Tuesday, April 21, 2015 Mr. POE of Texas. Mr. Speaker, new technologies have ushered in an American energy revolution. Last year, the U.S. overtook Russia and Saudi Arabia to become the largest crude oil producer in the world. We now have more oil than we can refine or store. A majority of U.S. refineries are built to handle heavy, sour crude but new oil production is light, sweet crude. U.S. refiners simply can't keep up with the new production. Normally producers could simply pump oil into storage containers. But experts say those storage tanks could fill up before the end of this month. Instead of exporting excess oil like producers get to do in other countries, the ban is already forcing U.S. oil producers to leave oil in the ground and lay off workers. About 50% of the working rigs in my home state of Texas have had to shut down in the last 6 months. Over 70,000 people have been laid off since Thanksgiving. The solution to this problem is clear: it is time for the crude oil ban to be lifted. Critics of lifting the ban are afraid that U.S. oil exports will lead to higher domestic gas prices. Fortunately, many studies have debunked this myth. Gas prices are more closely linked to the international market--or Brent price--than the domestic price of crude because refined products like gasoline are traded freely on the international market. So the more crude oil we can put on the international market, the lower the international price of crude oil. The lower the international price of crude oil, the lower the price of gas for Americans. A Rice University study released in March 2015 reviewed previous studies that examined the impact of removing the ban on gas prices. They found that ``all studies underscore that lifting the export ban will not translate into higher gasoline prices. In fact, studies generally project gasoline prices in the U.S. will fall once the ban is lifted.'' U.S. crude entering the global market will increase the international oil supply and decrease the price of gas. The only thing the studies do not agree on is just how much gas prices will drop. Savings could range from 1.8 to 12 cents per gallon at the pump. Lifting the ban will also lead to more jobs and a higher GDP. An IHS study predicts crude oil exports would support nearly 300,000 jobs by 2018. Removing the export ban would add $26 billion to GDP per year and improve labor income by about $158 per year, on average. As it improves the U.S. economy, removing the ban will also improve our national security. The original purpose of the ban put in place back in 1973 was to insulate the United States from the volatility of the international oil market. Ironically, today the ban exposes the U.S. market to volatility. Because our gas prices are tied to the international price of crude, if there is a disruption in the international supply, that directly affects our gas prices. The more crude oil we can put on the market, the more we can minimize those disruptions. Even 1 million barrels of swing capacity matters a lot in the world. So if ISIS continues to wreak havoc and disrupts oil supply in places like Libya and Iraq, having more U.S. crude oil on the market would help prevent a spike in the price of crude oil and gas prices. Lifting the ban would also free us up to help our allies more. Europe gets 40% of its oil from Russia. Exporting crude oil would give the Europeans an alternative to having to depend on Russia. It would also increase our influence in Asia. Japan and South Korea partly rely on crude oil from Iran to satisfy their growing energy consumption. U.S. exports can help diminish that reliance. Ironically, with the so-called deal with Iran it is now U.S. government policy to allow Iran to export crude oil and inject billions of dollars into their own economy. At the same time it is still U.S. government policy to prohibit U.S. producers from doing the same. U.S. exports offer a stable source of energy to our allies and decrease their reliance on dictators and state sponsors of terror. Lifting the ban shows that the U.S. is serious about supporting free market rules around the world. We criticize China for not exporting rare earth minerals and yet here we are not exporting crude oil. Removing the ban will give us more credibility when we criticize other nations' export bans. All in all, it is high time we remove the crude oil export ban. Exporting U.S. crude will lower gas prices, increase American jobs, and strengthen our national security. And that's just the way it is. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 58 (Tuesday, April 21, 2015)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E545] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] LIFT THE CRUDE OIL BAN ______ HON.

And that's just the way it is. ____________________",package_114_99.csv,4847,4847,4915,"[congressional record volume 161, number 58 (tuesday, april 21, 2015)] [extensions of remarks] [page e545] from the congressional record online through the government publishing office [ www.gpo.gov ] lift the crude oil ban ______ hon. ted poe of texas in the house of representatives tuesday, april 21, 2015 mr. poe of texas. mr. speaker, new technologies have ushered in an american energy revolution. last year, the u.s. overtook russia and saudi arabia to become the largest crude oil producer in the world. we now have more oil than we can refine or store. a majority of u.s. refineries are built to handle heavy, sour crude but new oil production is light, sweet crude. u.s. refiners simply can't keep up with the new production. normally producers could simply pump oil into storage containers. but experts say those storage tanks could fill up before the end of this month. instead of exporting excess oil like producers get to do in other countries, the ban is already forcing u.s. oil producers to leave oil in the ground and lay off workers. about 50% of the working rigs in my home state of texas have had to shut down in the last 6 months. over 70,000 people have been laid off since thanksgiving. the solution to this problem is clear: it is time for the crude oil ban to be lifted. critics of lifting the ban are afraid that u.s. oil exports will lead to higher domestic gas prices. fortunately, many studies have debunked this myth. gas prices are more closely linked to the international market--or brent price--than the domestic price of crude because refined products like gasoline are traded freely on the international market. so the more crude oil we can put on the international market, the lower the international price of crude oil. the lower the international price of crude oil, the lower the price of gas for americans. a rice university study released in march 2015 reviewed previous studies that examined the impact of removing the ban on gas prices. they found that ``all studies underscore that lifting the export ban will not translate into higher gasoline prices. in fact, studies generally project gasoline prices in the u.s. will fall once the ban is lifted.'' u.s. crude entering the global market will increase the international oil supply and decrease the price of gas. the only thing the studies do not agree on is just how much gas prices will drop. savings could range from 1.8 to 12 cents per gallon at the pump. lifting the ban will also lead to more jobs and a higher gdp. an ihs study predicts crude oil exports would support nearly 300,000 jobs by 2018. removing the export ban would add $26 billion to gdp per year and improve labor income by about $158 per year, on average. as it improves the u.s. economy, removing the ban will also improve our national security. the original purpose of the ban put in place back in 1973 was to insulate the united states from the volatility of the international oil market. ironically, today the ban exposes the u.s. market to volatility. because our gas prices are tied to the international price of crude, if there is a disruption in the international supply, that directly affects our gas prices. the more crude oil we can put on the market, the more we can minimize those disruptions. even 1 million barrels of swing capacity matters a lot in the world. so if isis continues to wreak havoc and disrupts oil supply in places like libya and iraq, having more u.s. crude oil on the market would help prevent a spike in the price of crude oil and gas prices. lifting the ban would also free us up to help our allies more. europe gets 40% of its oil from russia. exporting crude oil would give the europeans an alternative to having to depend on russia. it would also increase our influence in asia. japan and south korea partly rely on crude oil from iran to satisfy their growing energy consumption. u.s. exports can help diminish that reliance. ironically, with the so-called deal with iran it is now u.s. government policy to allow iran to export crude oil and inject billions of dollars into their own economy. at the same time it is still u.s. government policy to prohibit u.s. producers from doing the same. u.s. exports offer a stable source of energy to our allies and decrease their reliance on dictators and state sponsors of terror. lifting the ban shows that the u.s. is serious about supporting free market rules around the world. we criticize china for not exporting rare earth minerals and yet here we are not exporting crude oil. removing the ban will give us more credibility when we criticize other nations' export bans. all in all, it is high time we remove the crude oil export ban. exporting u.s. crude will lower gas prices, increase american jobs, and strengthen our national security. and that's just the way it is. ____________________",4847

RAUL RUIZ of california in the house of representatives Tuesday, April 21, 2015 Mr. RUIZ. Mr. Speaker, due to the birth of my first children--twin baby girls named Sky and Sage--I was unable to be present for votes on the House floor the week of March 23, 2015. Below is an explanation of how I would have voted and why. I would have voted for H.R. 360, to re-authorize the Native American Housing Assistance and Self-Determination Act of 1996 and for other purposes, because it provides housing assistance to Native Americans by allowing tribes to determine their own low-income housing needs, including housing for Native American veterans who are homeless or in danger of becoming homeless. I would have voted for H. Res. 162, which calls on the President to provide Ukraine with military assistance to defend its sovereignty and territorial integrity, because an independent, democratic and prosperous Ukraine is in the national interest of the United States, and that Russia has engaged in political, economic and military aggression that violates the territorial integrity of Ukraine. I would have voted for H.R. 216, the Department of Veterans Affairs Budget Planning Reform Act of 2015, which I also supported in the Veterans Affairs Committee. This bill requires the VA to plan ahead, annually submit a five-year budget plan for the agency to meet its commitment to veterans, including the resources necessary to meet those needs, and will assist Congress in holding the VA accountable for its obligation to our veterans. I would have voted against the Ellison Amendment to H. Con. Res. 27, the Congressional Progressive Caucus substitute budget. While I support some of the provisions of this alternative budget, I oppose raising America's tax burden by $6.9 trillion over the next decade. This budget would not do enough to reduce the deficit and trim wasteful government spending, and does not reflect the best course for the nation at this time. I would have also voted against the Butterfield Amendment to H. Con. Res. 27, the Congressional Black Caucus substitute budget. While this alternative also contains many worthwhile measures, I cannot support a budget that adds $2.7 trillion in new taxes over the next 10 years. My district's priorities dictate a more fiscally responsible approach. I would have also voted against the Van Hollen Amendment to H. Con. Res. 27, the Democratic Caucus substitute budget. While I support many of the priorities in this budget, it also increases the deficit and burdens American families with more $1.8 trillion in additional taxes. This budget does not do enough to trim unnecessary government spending, and is not right for the 36th District at this juncture. I would have voted against the Stutzman Amendment to H. Con. Res. 27, the Republican Study Committee substitute budget. This extremist, destructive plan would render Medicare unrecognizable from the current, successful program. It would keep seniors from enrolling in Medicare until age 67, and then give them a voucher that would raise their out- of-pocket costs substantially. It would keep seniors from receiving Social Security until age 70, and result in millions of individuals, families, and children losing Health coverage. There is no place in Congress for radical, extremist agendas that distract us from genuine solutions for hardworking Americans, and I would have vehemently rejected this alternative budget. I would have strongly opposed, spoken on the floor against, and voted against the Price Amendments to H. Con. Res. 27, the House Republican budget resolution. Once again, House Republican Leadership seeks to balance the budget on the backs of middle-class families and seniors, undermine our economic recovery, and end the Medicare guarantee. This disastrous Republican budget puts an end to Medicare as we know it, turning it into a voucher program that makes health care more expensive and less accessible for seniors. Thousands of seniors in my district rely on Medicare, and this backwards budget proposal threatens the retirement security of seniors living in our desert and across the nation. Our priority should be to strengthen Medicare by reducing health care costs and improving patient outcomes. Instead, House Republican Leadership has shifted the cost of Medicare to seniors, prioritizing more tax cuts for billionaires and big business. We must work together to protect and preserve Medicare, reduce our deficit, and decrease health care costs. This budget would do the opposite--jeopardizing Medicare and threatening the well-being of our seniors. In addition, this budget would remove more than 16 million Americans from their health plan, swelling the ranks of the uninsured while callously removing consumer protections for women, young adults, and those with pre-existing conditions. Worse yet, this budget would not even offer economic benefit in return for eviscerating the health care system. In fact, independent studies estimate the Republican budget would grind economic growth to a halt, costing Americans almost 3 million jobs by 2017. The House Republican budget would end Medicare as we know it, ask seniors and families to pay more for less health coverage, and decimate economic growth for the middle class, all to give huge tax breaks to wealthy corporations. This is not a serious effort to work across party lines for the good of the country, but a reflection of the extreme, upside-down priorities of the House Republican caucus. Finally, I would have voted for H.R. 2, the Medicare Access and CHIP Reauthorization Act of 2015. This long-overdue legislation abolishes the flawed SGR formula and replaces it with HR a bipartisan agreement to provide stability for Medicare beneficiaries and providers alike. By providing a reliable, value-based payment system, this bill will protect seniors' access to Medicare and preserve their established relationships with their doctors. Additionally, this bipartisan bill will extend the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP), which provides crucial health coverage for low-income children, extend vital funding for Community Health Centers and other safety net providers, and avoid premium spikes or doctors dropping Medicare patients. As long as I have been in Congress, I have advocated for a long-term SGR fix for our seniors and physicians. I co-sponsored the bipartisan framework that forms the foundation of this bill, and I have written to House leadership multiple times asking for this solution to be brought to the floor. This bill is a practical solution that will protect and preserve Medicare for our seniors and provide stability and relief for our nation's health care providers, and I am proud to support it. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 58 (Tuesday, April 21, 2015)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E546] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] PERSONAL EXPLANATION ______ HON.
