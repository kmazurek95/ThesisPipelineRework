ADAM KINZINGER of illinois in the house of representatives Friday, May 8, 2015 Mr. KINZINGER of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life of a great American: Anthony ``Tony'' Rossi. Tony was born in Italy and his family immigrated to the United States when he was young. He grew up in Hoboken, New Jersey and graduated from Demarest High School. Throughout his life he answered the call to serve; beginning in World War II, he joined the Army Air Corps and served as a bombardier. During the war, he was captured and held as a Prisoner of War in Germany for 18 months. His family says those experiences were transformational. When Tony returned home to Hoboken, his approach was: Keep your problems in perspective; accept each day as a blessing; and treasure your family and friends. During the Korean War, Tony again answered the call to serve and, following the conflict, continued a career in the Air Force in Japan, England, and throughout the United States. After retirement from the Air Force, Tony worked for General Electric for 16 years and later retired to Florida in 1987. He is survived by his wife of 42 years, Eileen Rossi; son, Michael (Marsha) Rossi; daughter Renee (Robert) Faiks; and son, Charles Rossi; 6 grandchildren: Chris (Laura) Rossi, Karen (Rich) Rossi Pickup, Preston (Kristi) Faiks, Grant (Kim) Faiks, Gillian and William Rossi; and 6 great grandchildren: Audrey and Lillian Faiks, Jason and Sarah Faiks, Daniela Rossi, Jack Pickup. Mr. Speaker, today marks the 70th Anniversary of Victory in Europe Day and it is a great honor to recognize and celebrate Tony's honorable service to our country and reflect on his life. In June, our country will honor his service with a funeral at Arlington National Cemetery.

PETER J. ROSKAM of illinois in the house of representatives Friday, May 8, 2015 Mr. ROSKAM. Mr. Speaker, I am honored to rise today to recognize Chase Ewoldt, a brave, strong, and exceptional young man from the Sixth District of Illinois. Chase was recently named one of the five ambassadors nationwide for the St. Baldrick's foundation. In July 2012, at the age of two, Chase was diagnosed with a rare, aggressive brain and spinal cancer. Experts believe this specific type of cancer is found in just 100 to 200 new patients every year in the United States and Chase was only given a 20% chance of survival. Over the next 14 months, his family and friends watched him undergo punishing cancer therapy every two to three weeks. Most of his time was spent in and out of hospitals. Nevertheless, Chase beat the odds and survived. In August of 2013 there was no longer any sign of the disease in his body. Chase is not completely out of the woods, and will most likely struggle with aspects of the disease for the rest of his life, but for now the family is celebrating his health and trying to raise awareness about pediatric cancer, a testament not only to Chase's strength and resilience, but also the entire family's compassion and determination to help others. Chase is an inspiration to all with cancer and I am sure he will continue to be a light for those in darkness. As Chase told his mother, ``I am a survivor''. Let us celebrate the life of this survivor.

CREC-2015-05-08-pt1-PgE663-6,CREC-2015-05-08,114,RECOGNITION OF CONSTANTINE (GUS) SARKOS,"[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 70 (Friday, May 8, 2015)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Pages E663-E664] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] RECOGNITION OF CONSTANTINE (GUS) SARKOS ______ HON. FRANK A. LoBIONDO of new jersey in the house of representatives Friday, May 8, 2015 Mr. LoBIONDO. Mr. Speaker, I come to the floor today to honor Mr. Constantine (Gus) Sarkos. When it comes to fire safety aboard commercial aircraft, Gus Sarkos is the primary expert and a national treasure. As head of the Federal Aviation Administration's (FAA) Fire Safety Branch, Sarkos and his team have played an essential and critical [[Page E664]] role improving cabin and cargo safety in ways that have decreased the risk of injuries to airline passengers and saved lives. According to Dennis Filler, Director of the FAA's William J. Hughes Technical Center, ``Gus Sarkos does the science that becomes the fire safety standards adopted by the whole world.'' His work testing materials and measuring the effectiveness of fire detection and suppression systems has led to more than a dozen significant changes to U.S. and foreign aircraft during the past three decades to stop fires and curtail the spread of blazes occurring in- flight or during crash landings, increasing the chances of passenger survival. Most recently, Mr. Sarkos and his team have been examining and reporting on fire threats posed by lighter and potentially flammable materials now being used in airplanes, and by the combustibility of large quantities of lithium batteries that have been carried in cargo holds. As a result of his team's work, the Department of Transportation (DOT) no longer allows non-rechargeable metal lithium batteries to be shipped in the cargo holds of passenger jets. In addition, a number of U.S. airlines this year unilaterally announced they will no longer accept rechargeable ion lithium batteries because of tests done by Mr. Sarkos and his team showing that a buildup of gases inside bulk containers can lead to explosions and violent fires. The International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) and the U.S. DOT currently are considering proposals to ban bulk shipments of these rechargeable batteries or to require safer packaging rules for air transport. Katherine Rooney, chief of ICAO's cargo safety section, said the work by Mr. Sarkos' group on the batteries and many other issues has been ``absolutely invaluable.'' She added that passengers are ``in a safer situation thanks to the research they have provided.'' During his long tenure, Mr. Sarkos has participated in and overseen the development of such post-crash aircraft fire safety improvements as new fire blocking seat cushions, heat resistant evacuation slides, burn-through resistant fuselage insulation, and interior panels that release less heat and smoke. ``The FAA's goal'', Mr. Sarkos said, ``is to minimize the likelihood of an aircraft fire in-flight or improve survivability during a post- crash fire. If a fire occurs in-flight, the objective is to reliably detect, extinguish or suppress it until the aircraft can be safely landed. In the case of a post-crash fire,'' Sarkos said, ``the goal is to have materials that burn and spread fire more slowly, and releases less heat, so passengers have more time to escape.'' Director Filler noted how the work of Mr. Sarkos and his team came into play in 2013 when Asiana Airlines Flight 214 crashed and caught fire while landing in San Francisco. Three people died of injuries unrelated to the fire, while 304 survived the crash. He said the fire was slow in developing in large part because of the fire resistant material in the aircraft, and as a result, people had the time to evacuate. Director Filler also cited a 2008 accident when a Continental 737 veered off the runway in Denver, skidded into a ravine, lost its landing gear and left engine, and caught fire. All 110 passengers and five crew members had time to evacuate. In 2005, an Air France A340 landed in Toronto during a severe thunderstorm, skidded off the runway and erupted into flames. While the fire eventually gutted the aircraft, all 297 passengers and 12 crew members survived. ``These are examples of three aircraft that caught fire and 728 people survived largely because of the work that Gus and his team have been able to promote throughout the industry,'' said Filler. ``His efforts have provided added time for passengers to evacuate. In the old days, materials would have burned faster or caused passengers to inhale toxic fumes, and they would have died in the aircraft.'' Mr. Sarkos said his work is challenging, but a source of pride because it has resulted in increased safety. ``The worst thing I ever had to do was meet with relatives of accident victims,'' said Mr. Sarkos. ``I am glad that in recent years that conditions have improved because of the work we have done and continue to do.'' I want to publicly commend Gus for being named a finalist to receive the Service to America Medal a.k.a. ``Sammies''. Gus' vision, leadership, and dedication to saving lives is a testament to his invaluable public service. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 70 (Friday, May 8, 2015)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Pages E663-E664] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] RECOGNITION OF CONSTANTINE (GUS) SARKOS ______ HON. FRANK A. LoBIONDO of new jersey in the house of representatives Friday, May 8, 2015 Mr. LoBIONDO. Mr. Speaker, I come to the floor today to honor Mr. Constantine (Gus) Sarkos. When it comes to fire safety aboard commercial aircraft, Gus Sarkos is the primary expert and a national treasure. As head of the Federal Aviation Administration's (FAA) Fire Safety Branch, Sarkos and his team have played an essential and critical [[Page E664]] role improving cabin and cargo safety in ways that have decreased the risk of injuries to airline passengers and saved lives. According to Dennis Filler, Director of the FAA's William J. Hughes Technical Center, ``Gus Sarkos does the science that becomes the fire safety standards adopted by the whole world.'' His work testing materials and measuring the effectiveness of fire detection and suppression systems has led to more than a dozen significant changes to U.S. and foreign aircraft during the past three decades to stop fires and curtail the spread of blazes occurring in- flight or during crash landings, increasing the chances of passenger survival. Most recently, Mr. Sarkos and his team have been examining and reporting on fire threats posed by lighter and potentially flammable materials now being used in airplanes, and by the combustibility of large quantities of lithium batteries that have been carried in cargo holds. As a result of his team's work, the Department of Transportation (DOT) no longer allows non-rechargeable metal lithium batteries to be shipped in the cargo holds of passenger jets.

CREC-2015-05-08-pt1-PgE664-3,CREC-2015-05-08,114,JEWISH AMERICAN HERITAGE MONTH,"[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 70 (Friday, May 8, 2015)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Pages E664-E665] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] JEWISH AMERICAN HERITAGE MONTH ______ HON. SHEILA JACKSON LEE of texas in the house of representatives Friday, May 8, 2015 Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in recognition of Jewish American Heritage Month. Nearly 360 years have passed since the establishment of the first Jewish community in North America. Since that time, Jewish Americans have contributed to the cultural richness and diversity of our nation in every field of community life, including business, government, medicine, law, the natural and social sciences, the arts and humanities, academia, religion, and the military. There are approximately 5 million Jewish Americans and more than 100,000 of them live in Texas, nearly half of those, about 45,000, live in the Houston metropolitan area. Although their numbers may be small in a state with a general population over 20 million, the impact of Jewish Americans in Texas and in Houston has been great indeed. Jewish Americans were there during the fight for Texas' independence from Spain and Mexico. Adolphus Sterne, an East Texas merchant, became a principal source of financial backing for the Texas Revolution and a close friend of Sam Houston. Albert Moses Levy was surgeon-in-chief in the revolutionary army. The De Cordova family helped develop the city of Waco and Henri Castro settled immigrants in several Texas towns. In 1859 the first synagogue in Texas was established in Houston.

SHEILA JACKSON LEE of texas in the house of representatives Friday, May 8, 2015 Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in recognition of Jewish American Heritage Month. Nearly 360 years have passed since the establishment of the first Jewish community in North America. Since that time, Jewish Americans have contributed to the cultural richness and diversity of our nation in every field of community life, including business, government, medicine, law, the natural and social sciences, the arts and humanities, academia, religion, and the military. There are approximately 5 million Jewish Americans and more than 100,000 of them live in Texas, nearly half of those, about 45,000, live in the Houston metropolitan area. Although their numbers may be small in a state with a general population over 20 million, the impact of Jewish Americans in Texas and in Houston has been great indeed. Jewish Americans were there during the fight for Texas' independence from Spain and Mexico. Adolphus Sterne, an East Texas merchant, became a principal source of financial backing for the Texas Revolution and a close friend of Sam Houston. Albert Moses Levy was surgeon-in-chief in the revolutionary army. The De Cordova family helped develop the city of Waco and Henri Castro settled immigrants in several Texas towns. In 1859 the first synagogue in Texas was established in Houston. Business and trade, especially the merchandising of food, clothing, jewelry with style, elegance, and distinction are the arenas in which many Jewish-Texan families made their most visual marks on the state of Texas.

DONNA SHALALA ______ HON. CARLOS CURBELO of florida in the house of representatives Friday, May 8, 2015 Mr. CURBELO of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in recognition of University of Miami President Dr. Donna Shalala, a woman who has made such mark on our community since her first day on June 1, 2001. As a two-time University of Miami graduate, I have witnessed my alma mater's immense development during President Shalala's tenure; a reflection of her tremendous dedication to our community. During her tenure, UM has solidified its position among top research universities in the country. The University's two successful Momentum campaigns have raised $3 billion dollars in private support towards its endowment, academic research programs, and world-class facilities. Born in Cleveland, Ohio, President Shalala received her A.B. degree in history from Western College for Women. One of the country's first Peace Corps Volunteers, she served in Iran from 1962 to 1964. She earned her Ph.D. degree from The Maxwell School of Citizenship and Public Affairs at Syracuse University.

SHEILA JACKSON LEE of texas in the house of representatives Friday, May 8, 2015 Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in recognition of Asian Pacific American Heritage Month. Throughout the history of the United States, Asian American and Pacific Islanders have contributed to our greatest undertakings and our vibrant cultural diversity. They have become leaders in business, in the community, and in politics, overcoming adversity and prejudice in pursuit of the American Dream. Today, there are more than 20 million Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders and more than 1 million of them live in Texas. A majority of them are concentrated in the cities, particularly Houston. At 80,049, the Vietnamese American community in the City of Houston has the third largest in the country. Houston is also home to sizable populations of Chinese Americans, Indian Americans, and Filipino Americans These communities have transformed the city, bringing their cultures, religions, and businesses and creating a new home. The first recorded Asian Americans in Texas were 250 Chinese laborers, who came to Houston to work on the railroad in 1870. It was thankless, dangerous work, but they helped to build the backbone of our state's economy. Although many of them would leave soon after the work was done, several stayed behind in Houston, and in the early 1900s the first Chinese business districts were opened. The Asian American population in Houston remained quite low until the 1970s, when a new wave of immigration brought tens of thousands of Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders to the city. Many of these early immigrants were Vietnamese refugees fleeing the country with the aid of the Indochinese Assistance and Refugee Assistance Act of 1975. Others were Chinese, drawn by the growth of the Chinese Merchants' Association throughout the decade. Today, there are more than 100,000 Asian American and Pacific Islanders living in Houston. As of 2007, they operate 16,000 businesses, and there are multiple temples dedicated to Buddhism, Hinduism, and Sikhism. The city offers official documents in Vietnamese, Chinese, and Urdu. Neighborhoods from Little Saigon to Chinatown to the Mahatma Gandhi District are vibrant community centers for Asian Americans and other residents alike. But for all their contributions to our state and our country, there are still unacceptable challenges facing Asian American Pacific Islander communities. There is an urgent need to fix our broken immigration system by passing legislation that will support families, strengthen small businesses, protect workers [[Page E666]] and grow our nation's economy. These communities have also had historically low enrollment in the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program, which would otherwise help them to achieve stability and security. Mr. Speaker, as a representative for tens of thousands of Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders, I join with my colleagues in recognizing the contributions of Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders to not just our history, but our economy and our future. I call on all Americans to celebrate Asian Pacific American Heritage month by deepening their understanding about these contributions, and pledge to support and serve Asian American and Pacific Islander families. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 70 (Friday, May 8, 2015)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Pages E665-E666] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] ASIAN PACIFIC AMERICAN HERITAGE MONTH ______ HON.

SHEILA JACKSON LEE of texas in the house of representatives Friday, May 8, 2015 Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, as Members of Congress we know well, perhaps better than most, how blessed our nation is to have in reserve such exceptional young men and women who will go on to become leaders in their local communities, states, and the nation in the areas of business, education, government, philanthropy, the arts and culture, and the military. We know this because we see them and benefit from their contributions every day. Many of them work for us in our offices as junior staff members, congressional fellows, or interns and they do amazing work for and on behalf of the constituents we are privileged to represent. Mr. Speaker, I believe there is no higher calling than the call to serve a cause larger than ourselves. That is why I ran for public office. I was inspired to serve by President Kennedy who said, ``Ask not what your country can do for you, ask what you can do for your country,'' and by the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. who said: ``Everybody can be great because anybody can serve. . . . You only need a heart full of grace. A soul generated by love.'' By this measure, there are several other great young men and women who served as volunteers this year in my offices. They may toil in obscurity but their contributions to the constituents we serve are deeply appreciated and that is why today I rise to pay tribute to six extraordinary young persons for their service to my constituents in the 18th Congressional District of Texas and to the American people. They are: Kenya Metters, Chelsea Ukoha, Ryan Wallace, Gregory Butchello, Fabian Rubio, and Danielle Konerth. Mr. Speaker, the energy, intelligence, and idealism these wonderful young people [[Page E667]] brought to my office and those interning in the offices of my colleagues help keep our democracy vibrant. The insights, skills, and knowledge of the governmental process they gain from their experiences will last a lifetime and prove invaluable to them as they go about making their mark in this world. Because of persons like them the future of our country is bright and its best days lie ahead. I wish them all well. Mr. Speaker, I am grateful that such thoughtful committed young men and women can be found working in my office, those of my colleagues, and in every community in America. Their good works will keep America great, good, and forever young.","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 70 (Friday, May 8, 2015)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Pages E666-E667] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] TRIBUTE TO YOUNG STAFF MEMBERS FOR THEIR CONTRIBUTIONS ON BEHALF OF THE PEOPLE OF THE 18TH CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICT OF TEXAS AND THE UNITED STATES ______ HON.
