Mr. DOLD. Mr. Speaker, Chip Anderson has been an integral part of Kenilworth Scouting--more specifically, Troop 13--for the last 8 years. He has provided outstanding leadership and support to the young men of Kenilworth, Illinois, as first the troop quartermaster, and then as the troop Scoutmaster. He is moving to Atlanta with his family for career reasons and resigning his active leadership position with Troop 13, but will always remain a vital part of Troop 13 and its legacy. During his tenure, the troop has been very active with weekly meetings, community service projects, and monthly camping and overnight trips, including the annual Boundary Waters High Adventure for the rising seventh-grade boys. Advancement is one, but not the only, measure of success, and during his tenure Troop 13 has had 45 young men attain the rank of Eagle, Scouting's highest rank. Chip has directly supported each of these young men, as well as all the young men in the troop. Most have called him a mentor and friend in the notes they have written to express their thanks. We are thankful for his outstanding contribution, and as a community we feel very fortunate to have had his leadership and dedication to the Scouting program and to the development of young men in the village. It is an honor to recognize Chip today. It as an honor to call him my friend.

Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of a long-term reauthorization of the highway trust fund. Just this week, Mayor Dumas from Attleboro, Massachusetts, came to Washington to tell me how another stopgap bill would negatively impact projects in his city. The bridges in my home State are some of the oldest in our country. Of the over 5,000 bridges in our Commonwealth, more than half are considered deficient. Every single day, cars, trucks, and schoolbuses cross our structurally compromised bridges nearly 10 million times. Those numbers underscore the urgency for our government to provide the critical, long-term investments in infrastructure that our constituents demand and deserve. Each time we approve a short-term patch of the highway trust fund, we are continuing the uncertainty and doubt that prevents States and municipalities from moving forward on projects that not only create jobs but keep all of us safe. Our refusal to even consider a lasting transportation plan is hindering our ability to maintain the infrastructure we already have, when we should be instead focused on new projects that increase our modern economy in communities across our country. It is time to fix this problem. It is time to invest in our country. It is time to pass this bill. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 75 (Friday, May 15, 2015)] [House] [Page H3218] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] LONG-TERM HIGHWAY TRUST FUND REAUTHORIZATION (Mr. KENNEDY asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)

The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 260, the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Thornberry) and the gentleman from Washington (Mr. Larsen) each will control 10 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Texas. Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself 30 seconds. Mr. Chairman, this en bloc package consists of 17 total amendments. Nine of them have been offered by Republicans, eight of them have been offered by Democrats. They cover a variety of very important topics for our national security, including cooperation with India, evacuation of U.S. persons from Yemen, the impact of U.S. troop levels on NATO, and violence in Mexico. I believe these are important subjects and important additions to our bill. I hope Members will support this en bloc package. And I hope that all Members who make these contributions will support the final version so that their contribution has a chance to become law. With that, Mr. Chairman, I am pleased to yield 1 minute to the distinguished gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Walberg). {time} 0915 Mr. WALBERG. I thank the chairman for the efforts put forth by himself and the committee on necessary legislation that, indeed, should pass. Mr. Chairman, America has given 14 years, nearly $1 trillion, and thousands of lives to help build a stable Afghanistan. While most of our troops have come home, Congress has still obligated billions of dollars to be spent on reconstruction efforts. As we transfer oversight authority to Afghan officials, the Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction has identified serious deficiencies in our ability to ensure the proper use of these American taxpayer dollars, as the Afghan Ministries currently lack the capacity to effectively manage and account for U.S.-funded assistance. My amendment would require SIGAR to certify it has sufficient access to Afghan accounts to guarantee effective audits. We must ensure that every dollar is spent effectively. I appreciate that this amendment has been added en bloc, and I ask my colleagues to support this legislation and this amendment. Mr. LARSEN of Washington. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Chairman, I would ask Members to support this en bloc package, and I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. Nolan) for comments on en bloc No. 6. Mr. NOLAN. Mr. Chairman and Members of the House, as Mr. Walberg just pointed out, we have spent literally trillions of dollars in the Middle East in what many would describe as wars of choice and nation building. I want to applaud the committee for this underlying legislation to ensure some accountability of how that money goes. All too often, the moneys have made a mockery of our good intentions and ended up in the wrong hands and, in many cases, used against us. The underlying legislation requires the Defense Department now to require them to give us a list of who money has been given to in Syria and Iraq to fight ISIL, and my legislation says that, when they find evidence that those funds have been misused by any one of those parties, they can no longer be recipients of our funding and our intentions in this regard. Mr. Chairman, I urge the adoption of my amendment and the bloc as well. Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Chairman, I am pleased to yield 1 minute to my colleague from Texas (Mr. Poe). Mr. POE of Texas. I thank the chairman for yielding, and I want the chairman to know that I support the amendment en bloc, and I support the bill as well. Mr. Chair, the number of foreign fighters traveling to Syria and Iraq to join ISIS is increasing at an alarming, dramatic rate. The Director of the National Counterterrorism Center said that more foreign fighters have joined ISIS in the last 2 years than those who went to Afghanistan or Iraq in the last 20 years. More than 180 of these fighters are from the United States. These killers are not just going to fight and die on the battlefields of Iraq and Syria. Many return home to their home countries as trained, battle-hardened Islamic radicals. Before Moner Mohammad Abusalha became the first American to carry out a suicide bomb in Syria, he had already been to Syria and back to the United States as a trained suicide killer. The United States Government didn't even know this. We need a comprehensive strategy to reduce the flow of foreign fighters from ISIS to the United States and foreign fighters going to train with ISIS. This amendment requires such a strategy. And that is just the way it is. Mr. LARSEN of Washington. Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from Michigan (Mrs. Dingell). Mrs. DINGELL. I thank the gentleman from Washington (Mr. Larsen). Mr. Chairman, Members of the House, I rise in support of my amendment, No. 103, contained in this bloc, which expresses the sense of Congress that the President should exercise all available authority to evacuate U.S. citizens from Yemen as soon as possible. My district is home to the highest concentration of Yemeni Americans in the United States. Since hostilities began in Yemen, my office hears daily from Yemeni Americans who are terrified, frustrated, desperate, and have no idea how to exit the country. These are United States citizens in Yemen, with nowhere to turn. This week, NPR told the story of Rhonia Aladashi, a 16-year-old girl from my hometown of Dearborn, Michigan. She had traveled to Yemen to visit her father when the hostilities began, and she tried multiple options to escape. She tried to cross the border at Saudi Arabia and got turned back into hostile areas because she did not have a man traveling with her. Ultimately, she ended up on a private fishing boat, going with no food or water on board. My constituents and their families stuck in Yemen need hope, and they need to know that American citizens are not being forgotten. We do not in any way want to put American military in danger, but we need to tell Americans there is hope. [[Page H3222]] I thank Mr. Larsen and Chairman Thornberry. Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Chairman, I am pleased to yield 1 minute to the distinguished gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. Walker). Mr. WALKER. I thank the gentleman from Texas for yielding. Mr. Chairman, I rise today to express my gratitude for the hard work and dedication put forth by Chairman Thornberry, Ranking Member Smith, and their colleagues on the Armed Services Committee in drafting the National Defense Authorization Act of 2016. I would like to thank the Rules Committee, Chairman Sessions, and Ranking Member Slaughter for their efforts in ensuring Members on both sides of the aisle had an avenue to voice their opinion. We recently finished 10 townhalls in 10 counties, and the number one thing from our constituents is making sure that Washington is held accountable. These efforts help restore our constituents' faith in this body and the process of lawmaking. Mr. LARSEN of Washington. Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from New York (Mr. Crowley). Mr. CROWLEY. I thank the gentleman from Washington, my good friend Mr. Larsen, for yielding me this time. Mr. Chairman, the effort to expand U.S.-India relations has always been and continues to be a bipartisan effort, and I want to thank both sides of the aisle in acceptance of the amendment that I put forward. Over the past two decades, we have seen the relationship between the United States and India flourish and blossom under both--I should say starting with President Clinton's Presidency, followed by President George Bush's Presidency, and we have seen how advanced it has become under the Presidency of Barack Obama. I had the opportunity to travel with the President earlier this year to India, and the incredible reception that the President and the delegation received was like no other experience I have ever had in India, and this relationship continues to grow. This is the first time we have had an opportunity to express the support of the House and of the Congress of this burgeoning relationship, especially as it pertains to mil-to-mil cooperation, and I believe that this is the most critical relationship that we will have this decade in the world. India and the United States, we have shared values of civilian control of the military. It is a very important aspect when you consider the part of the world we are talking about. We share that same value with India. India's quest for securing peace not only within her region, but around the world as well, is something that we share with her. India's commitment to democracy and rule of law is something we also share with India and, overall, using democracy and the quest for peace, trying to bring stability throughout the world. I also want to thank the Indian diaspora in helping with this effort. This is truly, as I said earlier, I believe, the most important alliance the United States will have this century. Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Chairman, I am pleased to yield 1 minute to the distinguished gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Kelly). Mr. KELLY of Pennsylvania. I thank the chairman. I rise in strong support of my amendment to renew a 1-year ban on the Obama administration from using any Department of Defense funds to implement the United Nations Arms Trade Treaty. This amendment updates and strengthens the language of my amendments that were entered into law in previous NDAAs. Why? Because this amendment--we must always uphold our fundamental individual right to keep and to bear arms, which is enshrined in our Constitution. We also must uphold the sovereignty of the United States over our arms export control system, which is the gold standard of the world. Now, how do we do this? First, the amendment explicitly forbids the use of DOD funds to facilitate domestic prosecutions of individual Americans. This is a real danger because the Obama administration has already engaged in domestic prosecutions of individuals using treaties. This is totally unacceptable. Second, my amendment specifically bans the use of DOD funds for an ATT secretariat, created for ``effectively implementing'' the ATT, according to the treaty's supporters. Appallingly and equally unacceptable, ATT backers seek to put the U.S. on the hook to fund the activities of a treaty to which it is not a party. I thank the chairman and the ranking member for including this amendment in the en bloc amendments. I urge my colleagues to stand with me in support of the Second Amendment, our Nation's sovereignty, and vote in support of this amendment to renew the annual ban on the funding of the United Nations Arms Trade Treaty. Mr. LARSEN of Washington. Mr. Chairman, may I inquire how much time I have left? The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman has 5 minutes remaining. Mr. LARSEN of Washington. Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. Castor). Ms. CASTOR of Florida. I thank my colleague. Mr. Chair, I rise today in support of the Castor amendment, which is an amendment in support of military families across the country. It expresses the sense of Congress that, when it comes to housing military members, the Pentagon should factor in the commuting times for base personnel and the land available for on-base housing. On-base housing is a critical readiness issue. Having our servicemembers as close to their assignments as possible is vital. DOD must ensure that the decisions relating to base housing take into account relevant factors, and each base is different. For example, at MacDill Air Force Base in my hometown in Tampa, Florida, it is home to the 6th Air Mobility Wing, United States Special Operations Command, and United States Central Command. The recent expansion of on-base housing for military families has been a great success. Pursuant to a public-private partnership that was authorized in 2007, 572 homes have been constructed on the base. This has been a godsend for the families at MacDill, and here is why: the neighborhoods closest to the base are expensive and out of reach for many military families, so servicemembers oftentimes buy homes about 30 miles away and then commute to the base. This recent public-private partnership at MacDill has been a win-win for the military and the families who serve. In fact, one top Pentagon official who oversees installations noted that the MacDill Air Force Base housing initiative was one of her favorites, forcewide, and was exceptional. Think about the difference it makes to that military family when they can live close to where they work and where their children attend school. Now, until recently, the Air Force and the housing contractor were discussing the next phase of on-base housing. MacDill has over 330 families on a waiting list. Unfortunately, despite the long waiting list, the obvious demand, the Air Force has inexplicably terminated discussions. If this is happening in my community, it could be happening in yours, and with scarce Federal dollars, we must continue to encourage fruitful public-private partnerships and the best interests of our brave men and women in the service. I thank Chairman Thornberry, Ranking Member Smith, and Mr. Larsen for their support of the amendment, and I urge adoption. Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. LARSEN of Washington. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Chairman, I support the en bloc. I hope all Members will, and I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. HOLDING. Mr. Chair, I rise today to support the Crowley-Engel- Holding-Bera-Royce amendment to the 2016 NDAA. As Co-Chair of the House India Caucus, I am privileged to spend time highlighting the robust and growing relationship between the United States and India to my colleagues and to my constituents. With the emerging challenges our two nations face in the Indo-Pacific region, we must place an emphasis on increasing the collaboration between our two defense departments and defense industries. In January to move this collaboration forward, the United States and India signed the [[Page H3223]] ``Joint Strategic Vision for the Asia Pacific and Indian Ocean Region'' laying out our shared principles and views for security in the region. Our two nations also agreed to renew--and upgrade--our ten year defense framework well before its expiration date which truly shows our commitment to working together. The United States and India are on the same page and through the diligent work of the Defense Technology and Trade Initiative along with the Department of Defense's India Rapid Reaction Cell, defense cooperation between our two nations is on the right trajectory. But more can, should, and will be done to bring us closer together on defense. Mr. Chair, India has a vital role to play in the Indo-Pacific by becoming a regional security provider and the United States should continue to work lockstep with our counterparts in New Delhi to achieve this. And Mr. Chair, that is precisely what our amendment supports. The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendments en bloc offered by the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Thornberry). The en bloc amendments were agreed to. Amendments En Bloc No. 7 Offered by Mr. Thornberry of Texas Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Chairman, pursuant to House Resolution 260, I offer amendments en bloc.

The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 260, the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Thornberry) and the gentleman from Washington (Mr. Larsen) each will control 10 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Texas. Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself 30 seconds. Mr. Chairman this en bloc package consists of 11 amendments. They touch such important subjects as the nuclear enterprise review, the long-range standoff weapon, military manufacturing arsenals, and a variety of other very important topics. They are sponsored by both Republicans and Democrats. Four of these amendments are sponsored by Democrats. I believe they deserve the support of the whole House, but I also believe the full bill deserves the support of the whole House so that these important amendments have a chance to become law. I hope all Members will support not only the package, but final passage. Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Colorado (Mr. Lamborn), the distinguished vice chair of the Subcommittee on Strategic Forces. {time} 0930 Mr. LAMBORN. Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of my amendment, No. 108, which is included in this en bloc package. My amendment adds a sense of Congress provision regarding our support for the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan. Jordan is one of our most important allies in the region, and I believe that the United States should support Jordan's military efforts to the greatest extent possible. The Jordanians are on the front lines in the fight against ISIS and have suffered the consequences of the President's policy failures regarding Syria. Jordan is under fire from those who wish to do it harm, and we must stand by a country that has been a force for good in the region. In Colorado, we have a unique interest in this relationship, as the Colorado National Guard is partnered with the Jordanian military through the State Partnership Program. Colorado guardsmen are helping train Jordanian servicemembers. This is just one of the ways that we can help stand with our friends in Jordan. I thank the chairman for including this amendment in the en bloc package, and I urge its adoption. Mr. LARSEN of Washington. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Chairman, I want to echo the comments of the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Thornberry) about en bloc No. 7 and its bipartisan nature. I would encourage Members to support it. With that, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Foster). Mr. FOSTER. I would like to thank the ranking member for yielding and the chairman and his staff for working with me on this amendment. Mr. Chairman, the National Defense Authorization Act tasks the Missile Defense Agency with developing a concept for a space-based missile defense system. There is no doubt that missile defense--if technologically feasible, militarily robust, and economically justifiable--would be an important priority for our national security. But as a scientist, I think that we need to do our homework before we begin investing hundreds of billions of dollars into developing this system, and that is why I am introducing this amendment to require a preliminary cost estimate for this project. A 2012 report by the National Academy of Sciences estimated that even to provide limited coverage, hundreds of interceptors would be required to stop an incoming ballistic missile. Because of the cost to launch, maintain, operate, and replenish the interceptors, even a limited system would cost a minimum of $200 billion. We must do our due diligence before investing billions of taxpayer dollars into any project. So I urge my colleagues to join me and vote ``yes'' on this amendment. Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Chairman, at this point, I am pleased to yield 1 minute to the gentleman from California (Mr. Royce), the distinguished chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee. Mr. ROYCE. Mr. Chairman, I very much appreciate Chairman Thornberry and the Armed Services Committee for working collaboratively on this important amendment. In speaking on behalf of this Royce-Maloney amendment, I want to recognize the leadership of Representative Carolyn B. Maloney of New York, who has been dedicated in the fight against Boko Haram and dedicated in terms of trying to raise awareness on this. Many have seen on television the continued kidnappings of Boko Haram, the pillaging of villages, the taking of women and children as captives. I just want to tell you the story that we heard last year in our committee from one young girl, a survivor from Chibok, that touched the hearts of, I think, many people there that day. She gave this brave narration of what happened when Boko Haram broke in and, before her very eyes, killed her father and killed her 14-year- old brother. She is one of the few from her village who survived. The Acting CHAIR. The time of the gentleman has expired. Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Chairman, I yield the gentleman an additional 1 minute. Mr. ROYCE. I thank the chairman for yielding. So I just want to say this: Nigeria and its neighbors--Chad, Niger, Cameroon--have been making headway in the fight against Boko Haram. They have cleared a number of northern Nigerian towns. Now we have an opportunity with the African Union force--but it lacks equipment; it lacks capacity--for a protracted fight there. This amendment expresses support for robust security assistance, training, equipment, the capacity building they need so that the African troops that are fighting against Boko Haram can continue to advance on the field. The amendment also requires the Department of Defense and the State Department to produce a report to make sure the Congress is fully aware of the nature of the assistance being provided. We need to support Nigeria and the African Union authorized force with all appropriate means. It is the best chance we have to eliminate Boko Haram, to eliminate this terror so that other young girls are not snatched and their lives destroyed. The region's stability, by the way, depends upon it. Mr. LARSEN of Washington. Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from New York (Mrs. Carolyn B. Maloney). Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New York. I thank the ranking member for yielding and for his strong leadership. Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong support of the amendment I have cosponsored with the gentleman from California, Representative Royce, and I thank him for his outstanding leadership not only on this issue, but on so many of them. This particular amendment expresses U.S. support for the defeat of the terrorist organization Boko Haram. Combating Boko Haram is in our national interest and is certainly in the interest of security in the region, and the United States should support the regional allies in their operations against Boko Haram, which are making significant progress in combating them. We just marked the 1-year anniversary of the kidnapping of 270 young schoolgirls from Nigeria. This horror raised the awareness of the world to the terror of Boko Haram and what it has unleashed on Nigerians for years. The amendment clearly affirms that Boko Haram represents a threat not just to our Nation, but to the world, and certainly to stability in the region. [[Page H3226]] The amendment calls for United States support--which may be in the form of equipment, training, technical support--for a coordinated military response in Africa to combat Boko Haram. Since its formation, the coalition has made significant gains against this terrorist threat and has started to improve stability in the region. Many of the young girls have escaped and have come here to speak to us in Congress. The amendment also calls for reports to Congress on the progress of the mission and an accounting of U.S. support. Combating Boko Haram is and should remain a national security interest, and we must remain vigilant in fighting this enemy. I urge my colleagues to support this important amendment. Again, I thank Chairman Royce for his attention, strong leadership, and for really saving lives in this region. He is securing stability in the region and for America, too. Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself 30 seconds. Mr. Chairman, I just want to show my appreciation for the work of Chairman Royce and Mrs. Carolyn B. Maloney of New York on this issue with Boko Haram. I noticed in the headlines of this morning's paper, Boko Haram has a new offensive against a military base in Nigeria. The contribution they have made with this amendment to the bill is very important so that the Nigerians and others in the region are better able to fight these terrorists. And there is no other word for them. There are also provisions in this bill to help the Ukrainians fight the aggression that they are undergoing, there are provisions in this bill to help fight ISIS, which is all part of the reason I believe this bill deserves the support of all Members. I appreciate the contributions of both Members on this amendment. I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. LARSEN of Washington. Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from California (Mr. Garamendi). Mr. GARAMENDI. I thank the chairman for yielding. Mr. Chairman, in the legislation today, there is a clause that would cause us to think about what to do in the High Arctic. The Arctic Ocean is melting. There will be a Northwest Passage. We are going to need a new heavy icebreaker to provide the support for the Navy as well as for commercial. Yesterday during a hearing, we hit upon the notion of creating a special fund similar to what exists for the strategic missile submarines. We would like, therefore, to begin the discussion of a national strategic high-latitude icebreaking fund. That discussion could then merge into a way of funding about $1 billion for a new icebreaker, absolutely essential for the U.S. Navy, absolutely essential for the commerce in the Arctic Ocean as well as for providing us with the ability to compete with Russia. I would like to propose that that be discussed and part of the process as we move the NDAA through the committees and the two Houses. Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. LARSEN of Washington. Mr. Chairman, I would encourage folks to vote for en bloc 7, and I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Chairman, I encourage Members to do the same thing, as well as on final passage. I yield back the balance of my time. The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendments en bloc offered by the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Thornberry). The en bloc amendments were agreed to.

Page 754, line 10, after ``operational requirements,'' insert the following: ``not including the requirements of any other organization or country,''. The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 260, the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Thornberry) and the gentleman from Washington (Mr. Smith) each will control 10 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Texas. Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself 30 seconds. Mr. Chairman, this en bloc package consists of 11 amendments. Generally, they are on the issues related to our strategic deterrence: our nuclear weapons, our ICBMs, missile defense against those sorts of weapons from other countries; in other words, they touch on very important issues that are central to our country's security. They have been sponsored by both Republicans and Democrats, and I hope Members of this House will support this en bloc package. I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. SMITH of Washington. Mr. Chairman, I, too, support this en bloc package. I hope that the Members will vote for it. With that, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Chairman, I have no further speakers at this point, so I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. SMITH of Washington. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself the balance of my time to once again say that I want to, first of all, thank the chairman. I want to thank all of the members of the committee and the staff for the hard work that they do and have done on this bill. Every year, this is a very, very difficult process, starting with the committee markup, which, this year, I think--we probably didn't set a record. We set a record for my time in terms of one day going until 4:45 in the morning. But I just want to take one brief moment to recognize the staff that does just an unbelievable amount of work throughout this process. We see the amendments both in committee and on the floor that survive that process. The staff has to sift through literally hundreds more to try to boil them down, to try to find compromises, to basically try to work out whatever they can work out. I don't think there are too many members of the staff on either side that have slept more than 2 or 3 hours a night here for the last few weeks. So I thank them for their hard work, and I thank the committee members for their hard work as well. It is the largest committee in Congress. We have excellent members on it. During the course of the debate and during the course of putting together this bill, every one of those members contributed greatly to the product. As I have said before, there are a lot of good things in this bill. The reform package that the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Thornberry) has made of particular priority I think is a very good first step towards trying to get more efficiency out of the military in a variety in different places. And of course we fund a lot of very necessary programs. But we have one overarching problem that we have had since 2011, starting with the fact that we couldn't pass the appropriations bills for 2011. And most have forgotten this, but at the end of March of 2011, we were looking at a government shutdown. We had a marathon 4- day, every amendment you can imagine on the appropriations bill, and, actually, I think it did go past the moment when the government was supposed to shut down before passing a CR, which pushed us then up against the debt ceiling in 2011, which wasn't going to be raised. We were facing a situation where chunks of the government would shut downs in ways we couldn't even predict, and I want everyone to understand the impact that this has on the Department of Defense. {time} 0945 I vividly remember a dinner that I had in March of 2011 with then- Vice Chief of Staff of the Army, Pete Chiarelli, and I was asking him about how all of this budget uncertainty impacts the Department of Defense. He said: Well, we have got several hundred programs, and every day we try to figure out which ones we are allowed to fund, which ones we are not allowed to fund, where we can get the money, what we can do, and how we can move it around. They didn't know. For the last 4 years plus, that is what the Department of Defense has had to do. We have gone from CR to government shutdown to occasionally getting a spending bill to living with sequestration and the budget caps. The one thing that this bill doesn't do is it doesn't resolve that issue. It goes to the overseas contingency operation fund while leaving the budget caps in place. As Secretary Carter has said, the overseas contingency operations fund is no way to fund the military and does very, very little to remove that uncertainty that I just described. So I want everyone to understand when I talk about the fact that I am opposing this bill because of its impact on the overall budget, that is also very much about the Department of Defense. The Department of Defense is left in that uncertainty and also stuck with OCO funding, which is unpredictable, 1-year money that makes it very difficult for them to plan. So this bill's reliance on the OCO funding is a problem for the Department of Defense. Leaving those budget caps in place is something that I am opposed to. So it is an issue directly related to the Department of Defense. Now, it is also related to the rest of the budget. We have caps that impact the Department of Homeland Security, that impact the Department of Justice, that impact those other areas that, by the way, are very important. I have had some folks mention ISIL and our fight against them. Those departments are incredibly important to that fight. They are still under the budget caps, which are, I believe, jeopardizing our national security. And then there are other issues, infrastructure being the biggest one that those budget caps continue to hamper and continue, I believe, to make our country less safe. So the fact that this bill locks in place and keeps the budget caps, relies on the overseas contingency operations fund, and, most importantly, does not lift the budget cap for defense is the reason I am opposing it and urging other Democrats and Republicans as well to oppose it. It doesn't lift the budget caps. I believe that is harmful to the Department of Defense. So this is a defense issue. Mr. Chairman, I also point out for my conservative colleagues who are so [[Page H3229]] concerned about keeping those budget caps that the OCO goes right around them. I wouldn't think that a conservative who wants to keep government spending under control would encourage the government deciding that they can create free money. The OCO doesn't count against the budget caps. So it is like the money isn't really being spent, only, of course, the money is being spent. It is $38 billion that we are just choosing not to count. It doesn't fix the problem. Lastly, the President has promised to veto all of the appropriations bills and the defense bill that are based on this flawed approach to the budget. So what we are doing here is ultimately not going to be successful until we come up with a better long-term solution to dealing with the budget caps, and I will simply emphasize one more time that has a profoundly negative effect on the Department of Defense, on our obligation to, I believe, properly fund and properly support the men and women who serve in our military. So, Mr. Chairman, while there is a lot of good in this bill, the ongoing budget uncertainty that it continues, I believe, is the fatal flaw in this bill. So I urge people to vote ``no.'' I do appreciate all the work and the effort that went into it. I also emphasize that this is but one step in the process. We have got a long way to go, and I am completely confident by the time we get to the end of it, we will have a National Defense Authorization Act. It will be difficult. We have to work with the President, we have to work with the Senate, and people have a lot of different opinions, but this is but the first step in the process. So, Mr. Chairman, I urge us to continue working to hopefully get a better product that can get the support of the House, the Senate, and the President and fulfill our duty to pass this bill and support our troops. With that, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself the balance of my time. Mr. Chairman, let me start with where the gentleman from Washington left off, that this is one step in the process. That is kind of what I have been saying all along. Earlier the gentleman said he is opposed to this bill because it locks in this OCO approach. No, it doesn't lock anything in. If there is a better way to deal with our budget issues in the appropriation bills, then there is lots of time this year to do that. But the question here for the House is: Will we vote against a defense authorization bill--not an appropriation bill--but a defense authorization bill and prevent it from moving a step ahead? As a matter of fact, Mr. Chairman, I hope all Members had a chance to read the editorial in this morning's Washington Post. Let me just read the last sentence of it: ``Far better for him''--by which it means the President--``and his party's leadership in Congress to help an adequate defense budget keep moving through Congress rather than perpetuate a fight all Americans, whether Republican or Democrat, may later regret.'' That is what we are asking here today: keep this adequate defense budget moving by voting for it. Now, Mr. Chairman, that doesn't solve all the problems. The gentleman is exactly right. There are all sorts of appropriation bills and other things to come in this process. But to try to use this important bill and the authorities it gives as political leverage to somehow make that happen, I think, is not fair to the men and women who serve or to our country's security. Mr. Chairman, there are lots of things that affect the military that this bill does not solve. I admit it. I don't try to solve all of them. When you try to solve all the problems, you usually end up making a mess. But that should not take away from the good that is in this bill. So I want to just emphasize the good that is in this bill has come from both sides of the aisle, and I am incredibly grateful for the contributions the Democratic members of the committee made. Something like 110 provisions in the underlying mark were requested by Democrats. In the committee 96 amendments offered by Democrats were adopted into the mark. We have had 57 amendments offered by Democrats made in order under the rule. We don't know how they are all going to come out yet, but the point is, a substantial part of this measure has been written and contributed to by Members on the Democratic side of the aisle, as well as Members on the Republican side of the aisle. The truth is it is a better product as a result, and the truth is that it is consistent with the bipartisan tradition of this committee. So, Mr. Chairman, I want to end, actually, where Mr. Smith started, and that is to express appreciation to him for being a terrific partner to work with in formulating this bill and dealing with very complex, rapidly changing subjects as the world is swirling around us. As he pointed out, we are the largest committee in Congress--63 members. But each of those members on both sides of the aisle have made important contributions to this bill. I would, like him, also want to appreciate the staff. I think we are unique in the Congress. We have an integrated staff where I can grab someone on the Democratic side or a Democratic member can grab someone who works on the Republican side. They are all integrated, working on the same issues. I think that makes us stronger as a committee. So there is an important bipartisan tradition of this committee, and it is because national security is so important. Let me go back to The Washington Post editorial and read the first sentence: ``There isn't much bipartisan governance left in Washington, but if anything still fits that description, it is probably the annual defense authorization act.'' I am pleased about that. I think that is what the American people want to hear because national security is so important. So for the suggestion to come that we are going to put national security on the back burner while we try to solve all the budget problems of all the agencies and all the government, that is discouraging. Mr. Chairman, I hope that Members will not agree with that tactic, that they will listen to the better angels of their nature as far as supporting this bill because it is a bipartisan bill that is so important for our troops and national security. I hope they will support this en bloc amendment. I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. McCAUL. Mr. Chair, I rise in strong support of the Carter-Rigell- McCaul-Gohmert Amendment to the National Defense Authorization Act of Fiscal Year 2016 and in defense of our servicemembers' Second Amendment rights. Twice my home State of Texas has mourned the loss of our soldiers and civilians after shootings at Fort Hood just north of my district. In 2009, Nidal Hassan walked into Fort Hood's Soldier Readiness Center, shouted ``Allahu Akbar'', and opened fire, killing 13 and wounding 42 others in the most horrific terrorist attack on U.S. soil since 9/11. Five years later, another shooter opened fire on the base, killing four and wounding sixteen others. This is on top of other deadly attacks on military installations, such as the Navy Yard shooting in 2013, and the 2009 shooting at a recruiting center in Little Rock, Arkansas, where another Islamist radical killed one and wounded another. In each case, one has to wonder if something could have been done to stop the shooting sooner and to prevent more lives from being lost. For years, DOD has had a stringent policy which prevents well-trained soldiers from carrying personal firearms on base in compliance with state and local laws. The Carter-Rigell-McCaul-Gohmert Amendment will responsibly adjust this policy and allow members of the Armed Forces to carry a concealed personal firearm if their commander determines it to be necessary as a personal or force protection measure. This is especially important at a time when threats to our soldiers and military bases is growing. In March, ISIS published a ``kill list'' of the names, photos and addresses of American soldiers. Since then, the threat level at U.S. military bases increased to ``Force Protection Bravo,'' in response to the increased threat of terrorism. Mr. Chair, we must give our base commanders more discretion and our soldiers more protection. Thousands of my constituents in Texas already exercise this right responsibly. It is time for our servicemembers to be allowed to do the same. The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendments en bloc offered by the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Thornberry).

The result of the vote was announced as above recorded. The Acting CHAIR (Mr. Collins of Georgia). The question is on the amendment in the nature of a substitute, as amended. The amendment was agreed to. The Acting CHAIR. Under the rule, the Committee rises. Accordingly, the Committee rose; and the Speaker pro tempore (Mr. Womack) having assumed the chair, Mr. Collins of Georgia, Acting Chair of the Committee of the Whole House on the state of the Union, reported that that Committee, having had under consideration the bill (H.R. 1735) to authorize appropriations for fiscal year 2016 for military activities of the Department of Defense and for military construction, to prescribe military personnel strengths for such fiscal year, and for other purposes, and, pursuant to House Resolution 260, he reported the bill back to the House with an amendment adopted in the Committee of the Whole. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under the rule, the previous question is ordered. Is a separate vote demanded on any amendment to the amendment reported from the Committee of the Whole? If not, the question is on the amendment in the nature of a substitute, as amended. The amendment was agreed to. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the engrossment and third reading of the bill. The bill was ordered to be engrossed and read a third time, and was read the third time. Motion to Recommit Mr. GALLEGO. Mr. Speaker, I have a motion to recommit at the desk. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is the gentleman opposed to the bill? Mr. GALLEGO. Yes, I am opposed. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Clerk will report the motion to recommit. The Clerk read as follows: Mr. Gallego moves to recommit the bill H.R. 1735 to the Committee on Armed Services with instructions to report the same back to the House forthwith, with the following amendment: At the end of subtitle A of title VI, add the following new section: SEC. 6__. GUARANTEEING A PAY INCREASE FOR MEMBERS OF THE UNIFORMED SERVICES AND NO LAPSE IN PAY CAUSED BY A GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWN. (a) Increase in Basic Pay.--As provided in section 1009 of title 37, United States Code, and effective on January 1, 2016, the increase for fiscal year 2016 in the rates of monthly basic pay authorized for members of the uniformed services shall be 2.3 percent. (b) Response to Lapse in Appropriations.--The Secretary of Defense shall take all steps necessary to ensure that members of the Army, Navy, Air Force, and Marine Corps continue to receive compensation for their service in defense of the United States despite any lapse in appropriations after September 30, 2015. Mr. GALLEGO. Mr. Speaker, this is the final amendment to the bill. It will not delay the bill, kill the bill, or send it back to committee. If adopted, the bill will proceed immediately to final passage, as amended. As Members of Congress, we must always honor our promises to the men and women who serve in our military. Unfortunately, I know firsthand what happens when Washington fails our troops on the battlefield and when we come home. I fought the Iraq war on the ground. I was shot at and experienced IED attacks, but because Congress didn't follow through on its promises, our vehicles didn't have the proper armor they needed. This failure cost my friends their lives. Later, when I got home, my friends and I suffered needlessly. When my friends and I got home, we suffered needlessly because of a veterans healthcare system that was shortchanged and mismanaged. These failures of leadership are what encouraged me to run for office, to ensure that my generation of leaders takes better care of our troops than we were taken care of. That is why I am offering this amendment. It is to make good on Congress' promise to give our military men and women a raise. The amendment will lock in a 2.3 percent increase for all of our soldiers, sailors, airmen, and marines. Last year, one in four members of our military had to rely on food pantries and other charities just to make ends meet. That is a disgrace. Mr. Speaker, our troops deserve a raise. My amendment does something else that is just as important. It ensures that even if Congress shuts down the Federal Government, all of our brave men and women in uniform will still get paid. Why should our servicemen and -women miss their paychecks just because we can't do our jobs? [[Page H3234]] Why am I offering this amendment now? Because Republicans don't appear to have learned the lessons of the chaos and confusion they caused by shutting down the government in 2013. Today, my Republican friends are risking another government shutdown by resorting to budget gimmicks, relying on war funding to pay for more routine operations and maintenance. That is completely irresponsible. My Republican friends are fond of comparing the Federal budget to a family budget. Mr. Speaker, working families, military families can't rely on a special slush fund to pay for their daily expenses, and Congress should not either. We must protect our troops from the consequences of this Republican leadership's refusal to confront the realities of sequestration. That is why this amendment is so critical. Yesterday, Speaker Boehner said voting against this bill would be shameful and that we would be turning our back on our troops. As a marine and a combat veteran, I can tell you that the Speaker is wrong. There is no shame in voting against a bill that creates uncertainty for our military and risks another dangerous government shutdown. Mr. Speaker, the real shame would be to vote against the amendment that gives our men and women the raise and certainty they deserve. I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the motion. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Texas is recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Speaker, let me start by saying I very much appreciate the service of Mr. Gallego and all the veterans on both sides of the aisle who have served our Nation. I appreciate all of the contributions Mr. Gallego and all the other 62 members of the committee have made into producing this National Defense Authorization Act. It has been a bipartisan product in the tradition of this committee. You know, if you think about it, for 53 straight years Congresses of both parties have passed and Presidents of both parties have signed into law a Defense Authorization Act, and that has been true through Vietnam and the cold war and 9/11. It has been true through Watergate and race riots, and economic recessions and bitter political feuds. {time} 1045 And yet, through all those things, somehow the parties could come together to do what was needed for our troops and for our country's security. I think that that strong tradition of bipartisanship is something that we should not walk away from lightly. We have heard some discussion--complaints, really--on both sides of the aisle about using OCO to get up to the President's level. If you look at this chart, this is the President's budget, and this is the congressional budget, which this bill is compliant with. There is a little difference in where the light blue and the dark blue start and stop. But the net effect, when you add it all together, is exactly the same: $612 billion. That is what the President asked for. That is what this bill provides. There is no difference between the two. I agree that we ought to find a better way to have fiscal discipline without the arbitrary caps and sequestration that are in the Budget Control Act, but this bill can't do that. This bill is a defense authorization bill. It is not a budget bill. It is not an immigration bill. It is not even a defense appropriation bill. So if this bill fails, how does that get us closer to fixing our budget problems? The truth is we could all find an excuse to vote against every bill, every day, for what is not in it, but that doesn't make a lot of sense. What is important is what is in it. And what is in it is really important for our troops and for our national security. As much as I appreciate Congressman Gallego's service, I find it ironic that he would offer an amendment that tries to make sure our troops get paid, even in the event of a government shutdown; and yet, by voting against this bill, the troops don't get paid. How does that fit together? Let me just mention two of the things that are in this bill for our troops. One is a new retirement system for people who sign up for the military. Right now, 83 percent of the people who serve come away with no retirement. Under this bill, they can put some money aside, the government will match it, and they can have a nest egg. If you vote against that bill, that doesn't happen. One of the complaints we have all heard so many times is that the transition from Active Duty to the VA is problematic because you can't stay on the same drugs. One of the things this bill does is say that they have got to have a joint formulary so you stay on the same drugs and you can take better care of the people as they transition. Doesn't that make sense? I hope all Members had a chance to read The Washington Post editorial today. Let me just read the last sentence: Far better for the President and his party's leadership in Congress to help an adequate defense budget keep moving through Congress rather than perpetuate a fight all Americans, whether Republican or Democrat, may later regret. I think that is the bottom line. This doesn't solve all the problems. It doesn't try to solve all the problems. I know we have got more debate, more discussion to come, but this is a step on what has been a very bipartisan bill. Mr. Speaker, here is the bottom line. We are incredibly privileged to have these jobs, to live in this country, but those privileges only come because brave men and women are willing to volunteer to serve and sacrifice for our country. Now, we can never match their courage and dedication and sacrifice, but surely to goodness we can do better than use them as pawns for some sort of attempt to apply political pressure on issues that have nothing to do with this bill. Surely we can do better than that. And the way to do better than that is to vote against this motion and for final passage. I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Without objection, the previous question is ordered on the motion to recommit. There was no objection. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion to recommit.

The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 260, the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Thornberry) and the gentleman from Washington (Mr. Larsen) each will control 10 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Texas. Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself 30 seconds. Mr. Chairman, this en bloc package consists of 17 total amendments. Nine of them have been offered by Republicans, eight of them have been offered by Democrats. They cover a variety of very important topics for our national security, including cooperation with India, evacuation of U.S. persons from Yemen, the impact of U.S. troop levels on NATO, and violence in Mexico. I believe these are important subjects and important additions to our bill. I hope Members will support this en bloc package. And I hope that all Members who make these contributions will support the final version so that their contribution has a chance to become law. With that, Mr. Chairman, I am pleased to yield 1 minute to the distinguished gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Walberg). {time} 0915 Mr. WALBERG. I thank the chairman for the efforts put forth by himself and the committee on necessary legislation that, indeed, should pass. Mr. Chairman, America has given 14 years, nearly $1 trillion, and thousands of lives to help build a stable Afghanistan. While most of our troops have come home, Congress has still obligated billions of dollars to be spent on reconstruction efforts. As we transfer oversight authority to Afghan officials, the Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction has identified serious deficiencies in our ability to ensure the proper use of these American taxpayer dollars, as the Afghan Ministries currently lack the capacity to effectively manage and account for U.S.-funded assistance. My amendment would require SIGAR to certify it has sufficient access to Afghan accounts to guarantee effective audits. We must ensure that every dollar is spent effectively. I appreciate that this amendment has been added en bloc, and I ask my colleagues to support this legislation and this amendment. Mr. LARSEN of Washington. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Chairman, I would ask Members to support this en bloc package, and I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. Nolan) for comments on en bloc No. 6. Mr. NOLAN. Mr. Chairman and Members of the House, as Mr. Walberg just pointed out, we have spent literally trillions of dollars in the Middle East in what many would describe as wars of choice and nation building. I want to applaud the committee for this underlying legislation to ensure some accountability of how that money goes. All too often, the moneys have made a mockery of our good intentions and ended up in the wrong hands and, in many cases, used against us. The underlying legislation requires the Defense Department now to require them to give us a list of who money has been given to in Syria and Iraq to fight ISIL, and my legislation says that, when they find evidence that those funds have been misused by any one of those parties, they can no longer be recipients of our funding and our intentions in this regard. Mr. Chairman, I urge the adoption of my amendment and the bloc as well. Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Chairman, I am pleased to yield 1 minute to my colleague from Texas (Mr. Poe). Mr. POE of Texas. I thank the chairman for yielding, and I want the chairman to know that I support the amendment en bloc, and I support the bill as well. Mr. Chair, the number of foreign fighters traveling to Syria and Iraq to join ISIS is increasing at an alarming, dramatic rate. The Director of the National Counterterrorism Center said that more foreign fighters have joined ISIS in the last 2 years than those who went to Afghanistan or Iraq in the last 20 years. More than 180 of these fighters are from the United States. These killers are not just going to fight and die on the battlefields of Iraq and Syria. Many return home to their home countries as trained, battle-hardened Islamic radicals. Before Moner Mohammad Abusalha became the first American to carry out a suicide bomb in Syria, he had already been to Syria and back to the United States as a trained suicide killer. The United States Government didn't even know this. We need a comprehensive strategy to reduce the flow of foreign fighters from ISIS to the United States and foreign fighters going to train with ISIS. This amendment requires such a strategy. And that is just the way it is. Mr. LARSEN of Washington. Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from Michigan (Mrs. Dingell). Mrs. DINGELL. I thank the gentleman from Washington (Mr. Larsen). Mr. Chairman, Members of the House, I rise in support of my amendment, No. 103, contained in this bloc, which expresses the sense of Congress that the President should exercise all available authority to evacuate U.S. citizens from Yemen as soon as possible. My district is home to the highest concentration of Yemeni Americans in the United States. Since hostilities began in Yemen, my office hears daily from Yemeni Americans who are terrified, frustrated, desperate, and have no idea how to exit the country. These are United States citizens in Yemen, with nowhere to turn. This week, NPR told the story of Rhonia Aladashi, a 16-year-old girl from my hometown of Dearborn, Michigan. She had traveled to Yemen to visit her father when the hostilities began, and she tried multiple options to escape. She tried to cross the border at Saudi Arabia and got turned back into hostile areas because she did not have a man traveling with her. Ultimately, she ended up on a private fishing boat, going with no food or water on board. My constituents and their families stuck in Yemen need hope, and they need to know that American citizens are not being forgotten. We do not in any way want to put American military in danger, but we need to tell Americans there is hope. [[Page H3222]] I thank Mr. Larsen and Chairman Thornberry. Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Chairman, I am pleased to yield 1 minute to the distinguished gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. Walker). Mr. WALKER. I thank the gentleman from Texas for yielding. Mr. Chairman, I rise today to express my gratitude for the hard work and dedication put forth by Chairman Thornberry, Ranking Member Smith, and their colleagues on the Armed Services Committee in drafting the National Defense Authorization Act of 2016. I would like to thank the Rules Committee, Chairman Sessions, and Ranking Member Slaughter for their efforts in ensuring Members on both sides of the aisle had an avenue to voice their opinion. We recently finished 10 townhalls in 10 counties, and the number one thing from our constituents is making sure that Washington is held accountable. These efforts help restore our constituents' faith in this body and the process of lawmaking. Mr. LARSEN of Washington. Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from New York (Mr. Crowley). Mr. CROWLEY. I thank the gentleman from Washington, my good friend Mr. Larsen, for yielding me this time. Mr. Chairman, the effort to expand U.S.-India relations has always been and continues to be a bipartisan effort, and I want to thank both sides of the aisle in acceptance of the amendment that I put forward. Over the past two decades, we have seen the relationship between the United States and India flourish and blossom under both--I should say starting with President Clinton's Presidency, followed by President George Bush's Presidency, and we have seen how advanced it has become under the Presidency of Barack Obama. I had the opportunity to travel with the President earlier this year to India, and the incredible reception that the President and the delegation received was like no other experience I have ever had in India, and this relationship continues to grow. This is the first time we have had an opportunity to express the support of the House and of the Congress of this burgeoning relationship, especially as it pertains to mil-to-mil cooperation, and I believe that this is the most critical relationship that we will have this decade in the world. India and the United States, we have shared values of civilian control of the military. It is a very important aspect when you consider the part of the world we are talking about. We share that same value with India. India's quest for securing peace not only within her region, but around the world as well, is something that we share with her. India's commitment to democracy and rule of law is something we also share with India and, overall, using democracy and the quest for peace, trying to bring stability throughout the world. I also want to thank the Indian diaspora in helping with this effort. This is truly, as I said earlier, I believe, the most important alliance the United States will have this century. Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Chairman, I am pleased to yield 1 minute to the distinguished gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Kelly). Mr. KELLY of Pennsylvania. I thank the chairman. I rise in strong support of my amendment to renew a 1-year ban on the Obama administration from using any Department of Defense funds to implement the United Nations Arms Trade Treaty. This amendment updates and strengthens the language of my amendments that were entered into law in previous NDAAs. Why? Because this amendment--we must always uphold our fundamental individual right to keep and to bear arms, which is enshrined in our Constitution. We also must uphold the sovereignty of the United States over our arms export control system, which is the gold standard of the world. Now, how do we do this? First, the amendment explicitly forbids the use of DOD funds to facilitate domestic prosecutions of individual Americans. This is a real danger because the Obama administration has already engaged in domestic prosecutions of individuals using treaties. This is totally unacceptable. Second, my amendment specifically bans the use of DOD funds for an ATT secretariat, created for ``effectively implementing'' the ATT, according to the treaty's supporters. Appallingly and equally unacceptable, ATT backers seek to put the U.S. on the hook to fund the activities of a treaty to which it is not a party. I thank the chairman and the ranking member for including this amendment in the en bloc amendments. I urge my colleagues to stand with me in support of the Second Amendment, our Nation's sovereignty, and vote in support of this amendment to renew the annual ban on the funding of the United Nations Arms Trade Treaty. Mr. LARSEN of Washington. Mr. Chairman, may I inquire how much time I have left? The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman has 5 minutes remaining. Mr. LARSEN of Washington. Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. Castor). Ms. CASTOR of Florida. I thank my colleague. Mr. Chair, I rise today in support of the Castor amendment, which is an amendment in support of military families across the country. It expresses the sense of Congress that, when it comes to housing military members, the Pentagon should factor in the commuting times for base personnel and the land available for on-base housing. On-base housing is a critical readiness issue. Having our servicemembers as close to their assignments as possible is vital. DOD must ensure that the decisions relating to base housing take into account relevant factors, and each base is different. For example, at MacDill Air Force Base in my hometown in Tampa, Florida, it is home to the 6th Air Mobility Wing, United States Special Operations Command, and United States Central Command. The recent expansion of on-base housing for military families has been a great success. Pursuant to a public-private partnership that was authorized in 2007, 572 homes have been constructed on the base. This has been a godsend for the families at MacDill, and here is why: the neighborhoods closest to the base are expensive and out of reach for many military families, so servicemembers oftentimes buy homes about 30 miles away and then commute to the base. This recent public-private partnership at MacDill has been a win-win for the military and the families who serve. In fact, one top Pentagon official who oversees installations noted that the MacDill Air Force Base housing initiative was one of her favorites, forcewide, and was exceptional. Think about the difference it makes to that military family when they can live close to where they work and where their children attend school. Now, until recently, the Air Force and the housing contractor were discussing the next phase of on-base housing. MacDill has over 330 families on a waiting list. Unfortunately, despite the long waiting list, the obvious demand, the Air Force has inexplicably terminated discussions. If this is happening in my community, it could be happening in yours, and with scarce Federal dollars, we must continue to encourage fruitful public-private partnerships and the best interests of our brave men and women in the service. I thank Chairman Thornberry, Ranking Member Smith, and Mr. Larsen for their support of the amendment, and I urge adoption. Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. LARSEN of Washington. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Chairman, I support the en bloc. I hope all Members will, and I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. HOLDING. Mr. Chair, I rise today to support the Crowley-Engel- Holding-Bera-Royce amendment to the 2016 NDAA. As Co-Chair of the House India Caucus, I am privileged to spend time highlighting the robust and growing relationship between the United States and India to my colleagues and to my constituents. With the emerging challenges our two nations face in the Indo-Pacific region, we must place an emphasis on increasing the collaboration between our two defense departments and defense industries. In January to move this collaboration forward, the United States and India signed the [[Page H3223]] ``Joint Strategic Vision for the Asia Pacific and Indian Ocean Region'' laying out our shared principles and views for security in the region. Our two nations also agreed to renew--and upgrade--our ten year defense framework well before its expiration date which truly shows our commitment to working together. The United States and India are on the same page and through the diligent work of the Defense Technology and Trade Initiative along with the Department of Defense's India Rapid Reaction Cell, defense cooperation between our two nations is on the right trajectory. But more can, should, and will be done to bring us closer together on defense. Mr. Chair, India has a vital role to play in the Indo-Pacific by becoming a regional security provider and the United States should continue to work lockstep with our counterparts in New Delhi to achieve this. And Mr. Chair, that is precisely what our amendment supports. The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendments en bloc offered by the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Thornberry). The en bloc amendments were agreed to. Amendments En Bloc No. 7 Offered by Mr. Thornberry of Texas Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Chairman, pursuant to House Resolution 260, I offer amendments en bloc.

The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 260, the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Thornberry) and the gentleman from Washington (Mr. Larsen) each will control 10 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Texas. Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself 30 seconds. Mr. Chairman this en bloc package consists of 11 amendments. They touch such important subjects as the nuclear enterprise review, the long-range standoff weapon, military manufacturing arsenals, and a variety of other very important topics. They are sponsored by both Republicans and Democrats. Four of these amendments are sponsored by Democrats. I believe they deserve the support of the whole House, but I also believe the full bill deserves the support of the whole House so that these important amendments have a chance to become law. I hope all Members will support not only the package, but final passage. Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Colorado (Mr. Lamborn), the distinguished vice chair of the Subcommittee on Strategic Forces. {time} 0930 Mr. LAMBORN. Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of my amendment, No. 108, which is included in this en bloc package. My amendment adds a sense of Congress provision regarding our support for the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan. Jordan is one of our most important allies in the region, and I believe that the United States should support Jordan's military efforts to the greatest extent possible. The Jordanians are on the front lines in the fight against ISIS and have suffered the consequences of the President's policy failures regarding Syria. Jordan is under fire from those who wish to do it harm, and we must stand by a country that has been a force for good in the region. In Colorado, we have a unique interest in this relationship, as the Colorado National Guard is partnered with the Jordanian military through the State Partnership Program. Colorado guardsmen are helping train Jordanian servicemembers. This is just one of the ways that we can help stand with our friends in Jordan. I thank the chairman for including this amendment in the en bloc package, and I urge its adoption. Mr. LARSEN of Washington. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Chairman, I want to echo the comments of the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Thornberry) about en bloc No. 7 and its bipartisan nature. I would encourage Members to support it. With that, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Foster). Mr. FOSTER. I would like to thank the ranking member for yielding and the chairman and his staff for working with me on this amendment. Mr. Chairman, the National Defense Authorization Act tasks the Missile Defense Agency with developing a concept for a space-based missile defense system. There is no doubt that missile defense--if technologically feasible, militarily robust, and economically justifiable--would be an important priority for our national security. But as a scientist, I think that we need to do our homework before we begin investing hundreds of billions of dollars into developing this system, and that is why I am introducing this amendment to require a preliminary cost estimate for this project. A 2012 report by the National Academy of Sciences estimated that even to provide limited coverage, hundreds of interceptors would be required to stop an incoming ballistic missile. Because of the cost to launch, maintain, operate, and replenish the interceptors, even a limited system would cost a minimum of $200 billion. We must do our due diligence before investing billions of taxpayer dollars into any project. So I urge my colleagues to join me and vote ``yes'' on this amendment. Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Chairman, at this point, I am pleased to yield 1 minute to the gentleman from California (Mr. Royce), the distinguished chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee. Mr. ROYCE. Mr. Chairman, I very much appreciate Chairman Thornberry and the Armed Services Committee for working collaboratively on this important amendment. In speaking on behalf of this Royce-Maloney amendment, I want to recognize the leadership of Representative Carolyn B. Maloney of New York, who has been dedicated in the fight against Boko Haram and dedicated in terms of trying to raise awareness on this. Many have seen on television the continued kidnappings of Boko Haram, the pillaging of villages, the taking of women and children as captives. I just want to tell you the story that we heard last year in our committee from one young girl, a survivor from Chibok, that touched the hearts of, I think, many people there that day. She gave this brave narration of what happened when Boko Haram broke in and, before her very eyes, killed her father and killed her 14-year- old brother. She is one of the few from her village who survived. The Acting CHAIR. The time of the gentleman has expired. Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Chairman, I yield the gentleman an additional 1 minute. Mr. ROYCE. I thank the chairman for yielding. So I just want to say this: Nigeria and its neighbors--Chad, Niger, Cameroon--have been making headway in the fight against Boko Haram. They have cleared a number of northern Nigerian towns. Now we have an opportunity with the African Union force--but it lacks equipment; it lacks capacity--for a protracted fight there. This amendment expresses support for robust security assistance, training, equipment, the capacity building they need so that the African troops that are fighting against Boko Haram can continue to advance on the field. The amendment also requires the Department of Defense and the State Department to produce a report to make sure the Congress is fully aware of the nature of the assistance being provided. We need to support Nigeria and the African Union authorized force with all appropriate means. It is the best chance we have to eliminate Boko Haram, to eliminate this terror so that other young girls are not snatched and their lives destroyed. The region's stability, by the way, depends upon it. Mr. LARSEN of Washington. Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from New York (Mrs. Carolyn B. Maloney). Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New York. I thank the ranking member for yielding and for his strong leadership. Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong support of the amendment I have cosponsored with the gentleman from California, Representative Royce, and I thank him for his outstanding leadership not only on this issue, but on so many of them. This particular amendment expresses U.S. support for the defeat of the terrorist organization Boko Haram. Combating Boko Haram is in our national interest and is certainly in the interest of security in the region, and the United States should support the regional allies in their operations against Boko Haram, which are making significant progress in combating them. We just marked the 1-year anniversary of the kidnapping of 270 young schoolgirls from Nigeria. This horror raised the awareness of the world to the terror of Boko Haram and what it has unleashed on Nigerians for years. The amendment clearly affirms that Boko Haram represents a threat not just to our Nation, but to the world, and certainly to stability in the region. [[Page H3226]] The amendment calls for United States support--which may be in the form of equipment, training, technical support--for a coordinated military response in Africa to combat Boko Haram. Since its formation, the coalition has made significant gains against this terrorist threat and has started to improve stability in the region. Many of the young girls have escaped and have come here to speak to us in Congress. The amendment also calls for reports to Congress on the progress of the mission and an accounting of U.S. support. Combating Boko Haram is and should remain a national security interest, and we must remain vigilant in fighting this enemy. I urge my colleagues to support this important amendment. Again, I thank Chairman Royce for his attention, strong leadership, and for really saving lives in this region. He is securing stability in the region and for America, too. Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself 30 seconds. Mr. Chairman, I just want to show my appreciation for the work of Chairman Royce and Mrs. Carolyn B. Maloney of New York on this issue with Boko Haram. I noticed in the headlines of this morning's paper, Boko Haram has a new offensive against a military base in Nigeria. The contribution they have made with this amendment to the bill is very important so that the Nigerians and others in the region are better able to fight these terrorists. And there is no other word for them. There are also provisions in this bill to help the Ukrainians fight the aggression that they are undergoing, there are provisions in this bill to help fight ISIS, which is all part of the reason I believe this bill deserves the support of all Members. I appreciate the contributions of both Members on this amendment. I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. LARSEN of Washington. Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from California (Mr. Garamendi). Mr. GARAMENDI. I thank the chairman for yielding. Mr. Chairman, in the legislation today, there is a clause that would cause us to think about what to do in the High Arctic. The Arctic Ocean is melting. There will be a Northwest Passage. We are going to need a new heavy icebreaker to provide the support for the Navy as well as for commercial. Yesterday during a hearing, we hit upon the notion of creating a special fund similar to what exists for the strategic missile submarines. We would like, therefore, to begin the discussion of a national strategic high-latitude icebreaking fund. That discussion could then merge into a way of funding about $1 billion for a new icebreaker, absolutely essential for the U.S. Navy, absolutely essential for the commerce in the Arctic Ocean as well as for providing us with the ability to compete with Russia. I would like to propose that that be discussed and part of the process as we move the NDAA through the committees and the two Houses. Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. LARSEN of Washington. Mr. Chairman, I would encourage folks to vote for en bloc 7, and I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Chairman, I encourage Members to do the same thing, as well as on final passage. I yield back the balance of my time. The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendments en bloc offered by the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Thornberry). The en bloc amendments were agreed to.

Page 754, line 10, after ``operational requirements,'' insert the following: ``not including the requirements of any other organization or country,''. The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 260, the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Thornberry) and the gentleman from Washington (Mr. Smith) each will control 10 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Texas. Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself 30 seconds. Mr. Chairman, this en bloc package consists of 11 amendments. Generally, they are on the issues related to our strategic deterrence: our nuclear weapons, our ICBMs, missile defense against those sorts of weapons from other countries; in other words, they touch on very important issues that are central to our country's security. They have been sponsored by both Republicans and Democrats, and I hope Members of this House will support this en bloc package. I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. SMITH of Washington. Mr. Chairman, I, too, support this en bloc package. I hope that the Members will vote for it. With that, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Chairman, I have no further speakers at this point, so I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. SMITH of Washington. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself the balance of my time to once again say that I want to, first of all, thank the chairman. I want to thank all of the members of the committee and the staff for the hard work that they do and have done on this bill. Every year, this is a very, very difficult process, starting with the committee markup, which, this year, I think--we probably didn't set a record. We set a record for my time in terms of one day going until 4:45 in the morning. But I just want to take one brief moment to recognize the staff that does just an unbelievable amount of work throughout this process. We see the amendments both in committee and on the floor that survive that process. The staff has to sift through literally hundreds more to try to boil them down, to try to find compromises, to basically try to work out whatever they can work out. I don't think there are too many members of the staff on either side that have slept more than 2 or 3 hours a night here for the last few weeks. So I thank them for their hard work, and I thank the committee members for their hard work as well. It is the largest committee in Congress. We have excellent members on it. During the course of the debate and during the course of putting together this bill, every one of those members contributed greatly to the product. As I have said before, there are a lot of good things in this bill. The reform package that the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Thornberry) has made of particular priority I think is a very good first step towards trying to get more efficiency out of the military in a variety in different places. And of course we fund a lot of very necessary programs. But we have one overarching problem that we have had since 2011, starting with the fact that we couldn't pass the appropriations bills for 2011. And most have forgotten this, but at the end of March of 2011, we were looking at a government shutdown. We had a marathon 4- day, every amendment you can imagine on the appropriations bill, and, actually, I think it did go past the moment when the government was supposed to shut down before passing a CR, which pushed us then up against the debt ceiling in 2011, which wasn't going to be raised. We were facing a situation where chunks of the government would shut downs in ways we couldn't even predict, and I want everyone to understand the impact that this has on the Department of Defense. {time} 0945 I vividly remember a dinner that I had in March of 2011 with then- Vice Chief of Staff of the Army, Pete Chiarelli, and I was asking him about how all of this budget uncertainty impacts the Department of Defense. He said: Well, we have got several hundred programs, and every day we try to figure out which ones we are allowed to fund, which ones we are not allowed to fund, where we can get the money, what we can do, and how we can move it around. They didn't know. For the last 4 years plus, that is what the Department of Defense has had to do. We have gone from CR to government shutdown to occasionally getting a spending bill to living with sequestration and the budget caps. The one thing that this bill doesn't do is it doesn't resolve that issue. It goes to the overseas contingency operation fund while leaving the budget caps in place. As Secretary Carter has said, the overseas contingency operations fund is no way to fund the military and does very, very little to remove that uncertainty that I just described. So I want everyone to understand when I talk about the fact that I am opposing this bill because of its impact on the overall budget, that is also very much about the Department of Defense. The Department of Defense is left in that uncertainty and also stuck with OCO funding, which is unpredictable, 1-year money that makes it very difficult for them to plan. So this bill's reliance on the OCO funding is a problem for the Department of Defense. Leaving those budget caps in place is something that I am opposed to. So it is an issue directly related to the Department of Defense. Now, it is also related to the rest of the budget. We have caps that impact the Department of Homeland Security, that impact the Department of Justice, that impact those other areas that, by the way, are very important. I have had some folks mention ISIL and our fight against them. Those departments are incredibly important to that fight. They are still under the budget caps, which are, I believe, jeopardizing our national security. And then there are other issues, infrastructure being the biggest one that those budget caps continue to hamper and continue, I believe, to make our country less safe. So the fact that this bill locks in place and keeps the budget caps, relies on the overseas contingency operations fund, and, most importantly, does not lift the budget cap for defense is the reason I am opposing it and urging other Democrats and Republicans as well to oppose it. It doesn't lift the budget caps. I believe that is harmful to the Department of Defense. So this is a defense issue. Mr. Chairman, I also point out for my conservative colleagues who are so [[Page H3229]] concerned about keeping those budget caps that the OCO goes right around them. I wouldn't think that a conservative who wants to keep government spending under control would encourage the government deciding that they can create free money. The OCO doesn't count against the budget caps. So it is like the money isn't really being spent, only, of course, the money is being spent. It is $38 billion that we are just choosing not to count. It doesn't fix the problem. Lastly, the President has promised to veto all of the appropriations bills and the defense bill that are based on this flawed approach to the budget. So what we are doing here is ultimately not going to be successful until we come up with a better long-term solution to dealing with the budget caps, and I will simply emphasize one more time that has a profoundly negative effect on the Department of Defense, on our obligation to, I believe, properly fund and properly support the men and women who serve in our military. So, Mr. Chairman, while there is a lot of good in this bill, the ongoing budget uncertainty that it continues, I believe, is the fatal flaw in this bill. So I urge people to vote ``no.'' I do appreciate all the work and the effort that went into it. I also emphasize that this is but one step in the process. We have got a long way to go, and I am completely confident by the time we get to the end of it, we will have a National Defense Authorization Act. It will be difficult. We have to work with the President, we have to work with the Senate, and people have a lot of different opinions, but this is but the first step in the process. So, Mr. Chairman, I urge us to continue working to hopefully get a better product that can get the support of the House, the Senate, and the President and fulfill our duty to pass this bill and support our troops. With that, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself the balance of my time. Mr. Chairman, let me start with where the gentleman from Washington left off, that this is one step in the process. That is kind of what I have been saying all along. Earlier the gentleman said he is opposed to this bill because it locks in this OCO approach. No, it doesn't lock anything in. If there is a better way to deal with our budget issues in the appropriation bills, then there is lots of time this year to do that. But the question here for the House is: Will we vote against a defense authorization bill--not an appropriation bill--but a defense authorization bill and prevent it from moving a step ahead? As a matter of fact, Mr. Chairman, I hope all Members had a chance to read the editorial in this morning's Washington Post. Let me just read the last sentence of it: ``Far better for him''--by which it means the President--``and his party's leadership in Congress to help an adequate defense budget keep moving through Congress rather than perpetuate a fight all Americans, whether Republican or Democrat, may later regret.'' That is what we are asking here today: keep this adequate defense budget moving by voting for it. Now, Mr. Chairman, that doesn't solve all the problems. The gentleman is exactly right. There are all sorts of appropriation bills and other things to come in this process. But to try to use this important bill and the authorities it gives as political leverage to somehow make that happen, I think, is not fair to the men and women who serve or to our country's security. Mr. Chairman, there are lots of things that affect the military that this bill does not solve. I admit it. I don't try to solve all of them. When you try to solve all the problems, you usually end up making a mess. But that should not take away from the good that is in this bill. So I want to just emphasize the good that is in this bill has come from both sides of the aisle, and I am incredibly grateful for the contributions the Democratic members of the committee made. Something like 110 provisions in the underlying mark were requested by Democrats. In the committee 96 amendments offered by Democrats were adopted into the mark. We have had 57 amendments offered by Democrats made in order under the rule. We don't know how they are all going to come out yet, but the point is, a substantial part of this measure has been written and contributed to by Members on the Democratic side of the aisle, as well as Members on the Republican side of the aisle. The truth is it is a better product as a result, and the truth is that it is consistent with the bipartisan tradition of this committee. So, Mr. Chairman, I want to end, actually, where Mr. Smith started, and that is to express appreciation to him for being a terrific partner to work with in formulating this bill and dealing with very complex, rapidly changing subjects as the world is swirling around us. As he pointed out, we are the largest committee in Congress--63 members. But each of those members on both sides of the aisle have made important contributions to this bill. I would, like him, also want to appreciate the staff. I think we are unique in the Congress. We have an integrated staff where I can grab someone on the Democratic side or a Democratic member can grab someone who works on the Republican side. They are all integrated, working on the same issues. I think that makes us stronger as a committee. So there is an important bipartisan tradition of this committee, and it is because national security is so important. Let me go back to The Washington Post editorial and read the first sentence: ``There isn't much bipartisan governance left in Washington, but if anything still fits that description, it is probably the annual defense authorization act.'' I am pleased about that. I think that is what the American people want to hear because national security is so important. So for the suggestion to come that we are going to put national security on the back burner while we try to solve all the budget problems of all the agencies and all the government, that is discouraging. Mr. Chairman, I hope that Members will not agree with that tactic, that they will listen to the better angels of their nature as far as supporting this bill because it is a bipartisan bill that is so important for our troops and national security. I hope they will support this en bloc amendment. I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. McCAUL. Mr. Chair, I rise in strong support of the Carter-Rigell- McCaul-Gohmert Amendment to the National Defense Authorization Act of Fiscal Year 2016 and in defense of our servicemembers' Second Amendment rights. Twice my home State of Texas has mourned the loss of our soldiers and civilians after shootings at Fort Hood just north of my district. In 2009, Nidal Hassan walked into Fort Hood's Soldier Readiness Center, shouted ``Allahu Akbar'', and opened fire, killing 13 and wounding 42 others in the most horrific terrorist attack on U.S. soil since 9/11. Five years later, another shooter opened fire on the base, killing four and wounding sixteen others. This is on top of other deadly attacks on military installations, such as the Navy Yard shooting in 2013, and the 2009 shooting at a recruiting center in Little Rock, Arkansas, where another Islamist radical killed one and wounded another. In each case, one has to wonder if something could have been done to stop the shooting sooner and to prevent more lives from being lost. For years, DOD has had a stringent policy which prevents well-trained soldiers from carrying personal firearms on base in compliance with state and local laws. The Carter-Rigell-McCaul-Gohmert Amendment will responsibly adjust this policy and allow members of the Armed Forces to carry a concealed personal firearm if their commander determines it to be necessary as a personal or force protection measure. This is especially important at a time when threats to our soldiers and military bases is growing. In March, ISIS published a ``kill list'' of the names, photos and addresses of American soldiers. Since then, the threat level at U.S. military bases increased to ``Force Protection Bravo,'' in response to the increased threat of terrorism. Mr. Chair, we must give our base commanders more discretion and our soldiers more protection. Thousands of my constituents in Texas already exercise this right responsibly. It is time for our servicemembers to be allowed to do the same. The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendments en bloc offered by the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Thornberry).

Gosar Long Mulvaney Payne Ribble Scalise Stivers Announcement by the Acting Chair The Acting CHAIR (during the vote). There is 1 minute remaining. {time} 1034 So the amendment was rejected. The result of the vote was announced as above recorded. The Acting CHAIR (Mr. Collins of Georgia). The question is on the amendment in the nature of a substitute, as amended. The amendment was agreed to. The Acting CHAIR. Under the rule, the Committee rises. Accordingly, the Committee rose; and the Speaker pro tempore (Mr. Womack) having assumed the chair, Mr. Collins of Georgia, Acting Chair of the Committee of the Whole House on the state of the Union, reported that that Committee, having had under consideration the bill (H.R. 1735) to authorize appropriations for fiscal year 2016 for military activities of the Department of Defense and for military construction, to prescribe military personnel strengths for such fiscal year, and for other purposes, and, pursuant to House Resolution 260, he reported the bill back to the House with an amendment adopted in the Committee of the Whole. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under the rule, the previous question is ordered. Is a separate vote demanded on any amendment to the amendment reported from the Committee of the Whole? If not, the question is on the amendment in the nature of a substitute, as amended. The amendment was agreed to. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the engrossment and third reading of the bill. The bill was ordered to be engrossed and read a third time, and was read the third time. Motion to Recommit Mr. GALLEGO. Mr. Speaker, I have a motion to recommit at the desk. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is the gentleman opposed to the bill? Mr. GALLEGO. Yes, I am opposed. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Clerk will report the motion to recommit. The Clerk read as follows: Mr. Gallego moves to recommit the bill H.R. 1735 to the Committee on Armed Services with instructions to report the same back to the House forthwith, with the following amendment: At the end of subtitle A of title VI, add the following new section: SEC. 6__. GUARANTEEING A PAY INCREASE FOR MEMBERS OF THE UNIFORMED SERVICES AND NO LAPSE IN PAY CAUSED BY A GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWN. (a) Increase in Basic Pay.--As provided in section 1009 of title 37, United States Code, and effective on January 1, 2016, the increase for fiscal year 2016 in the rates of monthly basic pay authorized for members of the uniformed services shall be 2.3 percent. (b) Response to Lapse in Appropriations.--The Secretary of Defense shall take all steps necessary to ensure that members of the Army, Navy, Air Force, and Marine Corps continue to receive compensation for their service in defense of the United States despite any lapse in appropriations after September 30, 2015. Mr. GALLEGO. Mr. Speaker, this is the final amendment to the bill. It will not delay the bill, kill the bill, or send it back to committee. If adopted, the bill will proceed immediately to final passage, as amended. As Members of Congress, we must always honor our promises to the men and women who serve in our military. Unfortunately, I know firsthand what happens when Washington fails our troops on the battlefield and when we come home. I fought the Iraq war on the ground. I was shot at and experienced IED attacks, but because Congress didn't follow through on its promises, our vehicles didn't have the proper armor they needed. This failure cost my friends their lives. Later, when I got home, my friends and I suffered needlessly. When my friends and I got home, we suffered needlessly because of a veterans healthcare system that was shortchanged and mismanaged. These failures of leadership are what encouraged me to run for office, to ensure that my generation of leaders takes better care of our troops than we were taken care of. That is why I am offering this amendment. It is to make good on Congress' promise to give our military men and women a raise. The amendment will lock in a 2.3 percent increase for all of our soldiers, sailors, airmen, and marines. Last year, one in four members of our military had to rely on food pantries and other charities just to make ends meet. That is a disgrace. Mr. Speaker, our troops deserve a raise. My amendment does something else that is just as important. It ensures that even if Congress shuts down the Federal Government, all of our brave men and women in uniform will still get paid. Why should our servicemen and -women miss their paychecks just because we can't do our jobs? [[Page H3234]] Why am I offering this amendment now? Because Republicans don't appear to have learned the lessons of the chaos and confusion they caused by shutting down the government in 2013. Today, my Republican friends are risking another government shutdown by resorting to budget gimmicks, relying on war funding to pay for more routine operations and maintenance. That is completely irresponsible. My Republican friends are fond of comparing the Federal budget to a family budget. Mr. Speaker, working families, military families can't rely on a special slush fund to pay for their daily expenses, and Congress should not either. We must protect our troops from the consequences of this Republican leadership's refusal to confront the realities of sequestration. That is why this amendment is so critical. Yesterday, Speaker Boehner said voting against this bill would be shameful and that we would be turning our back on our troops. As a marine and a combat veteran, I can tell you that the Speaker is wrong. There is no shame in voting against a bill that creates uncertainty for our military and risks another dangerous government shutdown. Mr. Speaker, the real shame would be to vote against the amendment that gives our men and women the raise and certainty they deserve. I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the motion. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Texas is recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Speaker, let me start by saying I very much appreciate the service of Mr. Gallego and all the veterans on both sides of the aisle who have served our Nation. I appreciate all of the contributions Mr. Gallego and all the other 62 members of the committee have made into producing this National Defense Authorization Act. It has been a bipartisan product in the tradition of this committee. You know, if you think about it, for 53 straight years Congresses of both parties have passed and Presidents of both parties have signed into law a Defense Authorization Act, and that has been true through Vietnam and the cold war and 9/11. It has been true through Watergate and race riots, and economic recessions and bitter political feuds. {time} 1045 And yet, through all those things, somehow the parties could come together to do what was needed for our troops and for our country's security. I think that that strong tradition of bipartisanship is something that we should not walk away from lightly. We have heard some discussion--complaints, really--on both sides of the aisle about using OCO to get up to the President's level. If you look at this chart, this is the President's budget, and this is the congressional budget, which this bill is compliant with. There is a little difference in where the light blue and the dark blue start and stop. But the net effect, when you add it all together, is exactly the same: $612 billion. That is what the President asked for. That is what this bill provides. There is no difference between the two. I agree that we ought to find a better way to have fiscal discipline without the arbitrary caps and sequestration that are in the Budget Control Act, but this bill can't do that. This bill is a defense authorization bill. It is not a budget bill. It is not an immigration bill. It is not even a defense appropriation bill. So if this bill fails, how does that get us closer to fixing our budget problems? The truth is we could all find an excuse to vote against every bill, every day, for what is not in it, but that doesn't make a lot of sense. What is important is what is in it. And what is in it is really important for our troops and for our national security. As much as I appreciate Congressman Gallego's service, I find it ironic that he would offer an amendment that tries to make sure our troops get paid, even in the event of a government shutdown; and yet, by voting against this bill, the troops don't get paid. How does that fit together? Let me just mention two of the things that are in this bill for our troops. One is a new retirement system for people who sign up for the military. Right now, 83 percent of the people who serve come away with no retirement. Under this bill, they can put some money aside, the government will match it, and they can have a nest egg. If you vote against that bill, that doesn't happen. One of the complaints we have all heard so many times is that the transition from Active Duty to the VA is problematic because you can't stay on the same drugs. One of the things this bill does is say that they have got to have a joint formulary so you stay on the same drugs and you can take better care of the people as they transition. Doesn't that make sense? I hope all Members had a chance to read The Washington Post editorial today. Let me just read the last sentence: Far better for the President and his party's leadership in Congress to help an adequate defense budget keep moving through Congress rather than perpetuate a fight all Americans, whether Republican or Democrat, may later regret. I think that is the bottom line. This doesn't solve all the problems. It doesn't try to solve all the problems. I know we have got more debate, more discussion to come, but this is a step on what has been a very bipartisan bill. Mr. Speaker, here is the bottom line. We are incredibly privileged to have these jobs, to live in this country, but those privileges only come because brave men and women are willing to volunteer to serve and sacrifice for our country. Now, we can never match their courage and dedication and sacrifice, but surely to goodness we can do better than use them as pawns for some sort of attempt to apply political pressure on issues that have nothing to do with this bill. Surely we can do better than that. And the way to do better than that is to vote against this motion and for final passage. I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore.

The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 260, the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Thornberry) and the gentleman from Washington (Mr. Larsen) each will control 10 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Texas. Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself 30 seconds. Mr. Chairman, this en bloc package consists of 17 total amendments. Nine of them have been offered by Republicans, eight of them have been offered by Democrats. They cover a variety of very important topics for our national security, including cooperation with India, evacuation of U.S. persons from Yemen, the impact of U.S. troop levels on NATO, and violence in Mexico. I believe these are important subjects and important additions to our bill. I hope Members will support this en bloc package. And I hope that all Members who make these contributions will support the final version so that their contribution has a chance to become law. With that, Mr. Chairman, I am pleased to yield 1 minute to the distinguished gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Walberg). {time} 0915 Mr. WALBERG. I thank the chairman for the efforts put forth by himself and the committee on necessary legislation that, indeed, should pass. Mr. Chairman, America has given 14 years, nearly $1 trillion, and thousands of lives to help build a stable Afghanistan. While most of our troops have come home, Congress has still obligated billions of dollars to be spent on reconstruction efforts. As we transfer oversight authority to Afghan officials, the Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction has identified serious deficiencies in our ability to ensure the proper use of these American taxpayer dollars, as the Afghan Ministries currently lack the capacity to effectively manage and account for U.S.-funded assistance. My amendment would require SIGAR to certify it has sufficient access to Afghan accounts to guarantee effective audits. We must ensure that every dollar is spent effectively. I appreciate that this amendment has been added en bloc, and I ask my colleagues to support this legislation and this amendment. Mr. LARSEN of Washington. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Chairman, I would ask Members to support this en bloc package, and I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. Nolan) for comments on en bloc No. 6. Mr. NOLAN. Mr. Chairman and Members of the House, as Mr. Walberg just pointed out, we have spent literally trillions of dollars in the Middle East in what many would describe as wars of choice and nation building. I want to applaud the committee for this underlying legislation to ensure some accountability of how that money goes. All too often, the moneys have made a mockery of our good intentions and ended up in the wrong hands and, in many cases, used against us. The underlying legislation requires the Defense Department now to require them to give us a list of who money has been given to in Syria and Iraq to fight ISIL, and my legislation says that, when they find evidence that those funds have been misused by any one of those parties, they can no longer be recipients of our funding and our intentions in this regard. Mr. Chairman, I urge the adoption of my amendment and the bloc as well. Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Chairman, I am pleased to yield 1 minute to my colleague from Texas (Mr. Poe). Mr. POE of Texas. I thank the chairman for yielding, and I want the chairman to know that I support the amendment en bloc, and I support the bill as well. Mr. Chair, the number of foreign fighters traveling to Syria and Iraq to join ISIS is increasing at an alarming, dramatic rate. The Director of the National Counterterrorism Center said that more foreign fighters have joined ISIS in the last 2 years than those who went to Afghanistan or Iraq in the last 20 years. More than 180 of these fighters are from the United States. These killers are not just going to fight and die on the battlefields of Iraq and Syria. Many return home to their home countries as trained, battle-hardened Islamic radicals. Before Moner Mohammad Abusalha became the first American to carry out a suicide bomb in Syria, he had already been to Syria and back to the United States as a trained suicide killer. The United States Government didn't even know this. We need a comprehensive strategy to reduce the flow of foreign fighters from ISIS to the United States and foreign fighters going to train with ISIS. This amendment requires such a strategy. And that is just the way it is. Mr. LARSEN of Washington. Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from Michigan (Mrs. Dingell). Mrs. DINGELL. I thank the gentleman from Washington (Mr. Larsen). Mr. Chairman, Members of the House, I rise in support of my amendment, No. 103, contained in this bloc, which expresses the sense of Congress that the President should exercise all available authority to evacuate U.S. citizens from Yemen as soon as possible. My district is home to the highest concentration of Yemeni Americans in the United States. Since hostilities began in Yemen, my office hears daily from Yemeni Americans who are terrified, frustrated, desperate, and have no idea how to exit the country. These are United States citizens in Yemen, with nowhere to turn. This week, NPR told the story of Rhonia Aladashi, a 16-year-old girl from my hometown of Dearborn, Michigan. She had traveled to Yemen to visit her father when the hostilities began, and she tried multiple options to escape. She tried to cross the border at Saudi Arabia and got turned back into hostile areas because she did not have a man traveling with her. Ultimately, she ended up on a private fishing boat, going with no food or water on board. My constituents and their families stuck in Yemen need hope, and they need to know that American citizens are not being forgotten. We do not in any way want to put American military in danger, but we need to tell Americans there is hope. [[Page H3222]] I thank Mr. Larsen and Chairman Thornberry. Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Chairman, I am pleased to yield 1 minute to the distinguished gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. Walker). Mr. WALKER. I thank the gentleman from Texas for yielding. Mr. Chairman, I rise today to express my gratitude for the hard work and dedication put forth by Chairman Thornberry, Ranking Member Smith, and their colleagues on the Armed Services Committee in drafting the National Defense Authorization Act of 2016. I would like to thank the Rules Committee, Chairman Sessions, and Ranking Member Slaughter for their efforts in ensuring Members on both sides of the aisle had an avenue to voice their opinion. We recently finished 10 townhalls in 10 counties, and the number one thing from our constituents is making sure that Washington is held accountable. These efforts help restore our constituents' faith in this body and the process of lawmaking. Mr. LARSEN of Washington. Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from New York (Mr. Crowley). Mr. CROWLEY. I thank the gentleman from Washington, my good friend Mr. Larsen, for yielding me this time. Mr. Chairman, the effort to expand U.S.-India relations has always been and continues to be a bipartisan effort, and I want to thank both sides of the aisle in acceptance of the amendment that I put forward. Over the past two decades, we have seen the relationship between the United States and India flourish and blossom under both--I should say starting with President Clinton's Presidency, followed by President George Bush's Presidency, and we have seen how advanced it has become under the Presidency of Barack Obama. I had the opportunity to travel with the President earlier this year to India, and the incredible reception that the President and the delegation received was like no other experience I have ever had in India, and this relationship continues to grow. This is the first time we have had an opportunity to express the support of the House and of the Congress of this burgeoning relationship, especially as it pertains to mil-to-mil cooperation, and I believe that this is the most critical relationship that we will have this decade in the world. India and the United States, we have shared values of civilian control of the military. It is a very important aspect when you consider the part of the world we are talking about. We share that same value with India. India's quest for securing peace not only within her region, but around the world as well, is something that we share with her. India's commitment to democracy and rule of law is something we also share with India and, overall, using democracy and the quest for peace, trying to bring stability throughout the world. I also want to thank the Indian diaspora in helping with this effort. This is truly, as I said earlier, I believe, the most important alliance the United States will have this century. Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Chairman, I am pleased to yield 1 minute to the distinguished gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Kelly). Mr. KELLY of Pennsylvania. I thank the chairman. I rise in strong support of my amendment to renew a 1-year ban on the Obama administration from using any Department of Defense funds to implement the United Nations Arms Trade Treaty. This amendment updates and strengthens the language of my amendments that were entered into law in previous NDAAs. Why? Because this amendment--we must always uphold our fundamental individual right to keep and to bear arms, which is enshrined in our Constitution. We also must uphold the sovereignty of the United States over our arms export control system, which is the gold standard of the world. Now, how do we do this? First, the amendment explicitly forbids the use of DOD funds to facilitate domestic prosecutions of individual Americans. This is a real danger because the Obama administration has already engaged in domestic prosecutions of individuals using treaties. This is totally unacceptable. Second, my amendment specifically bans the use of DOD funds for an ATT secretariat, created for ``effectively implementing'' the ATT, according to the treaty's supporters. Appallingly and equally unacceptable, ATT backers seek to put the U.S. on the hook to fund the activities of a treaty to which it is not a party. I thank the chairman and the ranking member for including this amendment in the en bloc amendments. I urge my colleagues to stand with me in support of the Second Amendment, our Nation's sovereignty, and vote in support of this amendment to renew the annual ban on the funding of the United Nations Arms Trade Treaty. Mr. LARSEN of Washington. Mr. Chairman, may I inquire how much time I have left? The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman has 5 minutes remaining. Mr. LARSEN of Washington. Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. Castor). Ms. CASTOR of Florida. I thank my colleague. Mr. Chair, I rise today in support of the Castor amendment, which is an amendment in support of military families across the country. It expresses the sense of Congress that, when it comes to housing military members, the Pentagon should factor in the commuting times for base personnel and the land available for on-base housing. On-base housing is a critical readiness issue. Having our servicemembers as close to their assignments as possible is vital. DOD must ensure that the decisions relating to base housing take into account relevant factors, and each base is different. For example, at MacDill Air Force Base in my hometown in Tampa, Florida, it is home to the 6th Air Mobility Wing, United States Special Operations Command, and United States Central Command. The recent expansion of on-base housing for military families has been a great success. Pursuant to a public-private partnership that was authorized in 2007, 572 homes have been constructed on the base. This has been a godsend for the families at MacDill, and here is why: the neighborhoods closest to the base are expensive and out of reach for many military families, so servicemembers oftentimes buy homes about 30 miles away and then commute to the base. This recent public-private partnership at MacDill has been a win-win for the military and the families who serve. In fact, one top Pentagon official who oversees installations noted that the MacDill Air Force Base housing initiative was one of her favorites, forcewide, and was exceptional. Think about the difference it makes to that military family when they can live close to where they work and where their children attend school. Now, until recently, the Air Force and the housing contractor were discussing the next phase of on-base housing. MacDill has over 330 families on a waiting list. Unfortunately, despite the long waiting list, the obvious demand, the Air Force has inexplicably terminated discussions. If this is happening in my community, it could be happening in yours, and with scarce Federal dollars, we must continue to encourage fruitful public-private partnerships and the best interests of our brave men and women in the service. I thank Chairman Thornberry, Ranking Member Smith, and Mr. Larsen for their support of the amendment, and I urge adoption. Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. LARSEN of Washington. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Chairman, I support the en bloc. I hope all Members will, and I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. HOLDING. Mr. Chair, I rise today to support the Crowley-Engel- Holding-Bera-Royce amendment to the 2016 NDAA. As Co-Chair of the House India Caucus, I am privileged to spend time highlighting the robust and growing relationship between the United States and India to my colleagues and to my constituents. With the emerging challenges our two nations face in the Indo-Pacific region, we must place an emphasis on increasing the collaboration between our two defense departments and defense industries. In January to move this collaboration forward, the United States and India signed the [[Page H3223]] ``Joint Strategic Vision for the Asia Pacific and Indian Ocean Region'' laying out our shared principles and views for security in the region. Our two nations also agreed to renew--and upgrade--our ten year defense framework well before its expiration date which truly shows our commitment to working together. The United States and India are on the same page and through the diligent work of the Defense Technology and Trade Initiative along with the Department of Defense's India Rapid Reaction Cell, defense cooperation between our two nations is on the right trajectory. But more can, should, and will be done to bring us closer together on defense. Mr. Chair, India has a vital role to play in the Indo-Pacific by becoming a regional security provider and the United States should continue to work lockstep with our counterparts in New Delhi to achieve this. And Mr. Chair, that is precisely what our amendment supports. The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendments en bloc offered by the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Thornberry). The en bloc amendments were agreed to. Amendments En Bloc No. 7 Offered by Mr. Thornberry of Texas Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Chairman, pursuant to House Resolution 260, I offer amendments en bloc.

The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 260, the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Thornberry) and the gentleman from Washington (Mr. Larsen) each will control 10 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Texas. Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself 30 seconds. Mr. Chairman this en bloc package consists of 11 amendments. They touch such important subjects as the nuclear enterprise review, the long-range standoff weapon, military manufacturing arsenals, and a variety of other very important topics. They are sponsored by both Republicans and Democrats. Four of these amendments are sponsored by Democrats. I believe they deserve the support of the whole House, but I also believe the full bill deserves the support of the whole House so that these important amendments have a chance to become law. I hope all Members will support not only the package, but final passage. Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Colorado (Mr. Lamborn), the distinguished vice chair of the Subcommittee on Strategic Forces. {time} 0930 Mr. LAMBORN. Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of my amendment, No. 108, which is included in this en bloc package. My amendment adds a sense of Congress provision regarding our support for the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan. Jordan is one of our most important allies in the region, and I believe that the United States should support Jordan's military efforts to the greatest extent possible. The Jordanians are on the front lines in the fight against ISIS and have suffered the consequences of the President's policy failures regarding Syria. Jordan is under fire from those who wish to do it harm, and we must stand by a country that has been a force for good in the region. In Colorado, we have a unique interest in this relationship, as the Colorado National Guard is partnered with the Jordanian military through the State Partnership Program. Colorado guardsmen are helping train Jordanian servicemembers. This is just one of the ways that we can help stand with our friends in Jordan. I thank the chairman for including this amendment in the en bloc package, and I urge its adoption. Mr. LARSEN of Washington. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Chairman, I want to echo the comments of the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Thornberry) about en bloc No. 7 and its bipartisan nature. I would encourage Members to support it. With that, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Foster). Mr. FOSTER. I would like to thank the ranking member for yielding and the chairman and his staff for working with me on this amendment. Mr. Chairman, the National Defense Authorization Act tasks the Missile Defense Agency with developing a concept for a space-based missile defense system. There is no doubt that missile defense--if technologically feasible, militarily robust, and economically justifiable--would be an important priority for our national security. But as a scientist, I think that we need to do our homework before we begin investing hundreds of billions of dollars into developing this system, and that is why I am introducing this amendment to require a preliminary cost estimate for this project. A 2012 report by the National Academy of Sciences estimated that even to provide limited coverage, hundreds of interceptors would be required to stop an incoming ballistic missile. Because of the cost to launch, maintain, operate, and replenish the interceptors, even a limited system would cost a minimum of $200 billion. We must do our due diligence before investing billions of taxpayer dollars into any project. So I urge my colleagues to join me and vote ``yes'' on this amendment. Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Chairman, at this point, I am pleased to yield 1 minute to the gentleman from California (Mr. Royce), the distinguished chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee. Mr. ROYCE. Mr. Chairman, I very much appreciate Chairman Thornberry and the Armed Services Committee for working collaboratively on this important amendment. In speaking on behalf of this Royce-Maloney amendment, I want to recognize the leadership of Representative Carolyn B. Maloney of New York, who has been dedicated in the fight against Boko Haram and dedicated in terms of trying to raise awareness on this. Many have seen on television the continued kidnappings of Boko Haram, the pillaging of villages, the taking of women and children as captives. I just want to tell you the story that we heard last year in our committee from one young girl, a survivor from Chibok, that touched the hearts of, I think, many people there that day. She gave this brave narration of what happened when Boko Haram broke in and, before her very eyes, killed her father and killed her 14-year- old brother. She is one of the few from her village who survived. The Acting CHAIR. The time of the gentleman has expired. Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Chairman, I yield the gentleman an additional 1 minute. Mr. ROYCE. I thank the chairman for yielding. So I just want to say this: Nigeria and its neighbors--Chad, Niger, Cameroon--have been making headway in the fight against Boko Haram. They have cleared a number of northern Nigerian towns. Now we have an opportunity with the African Union force--but it lacks equipment; it lacks capacity--for a protracted fight there. This amendment expresses support for robust security assistance, training, equipment, the capacity building they need so that the African troops that are fighting against Boko Haram can continue to advance on the field. The amendment also requires the Department of Defense and the State Department to produce a report to make sure the Congress is fully aware of the nature of the assistance being provided. We need to support Nigeria and the African Union authorized force with all appropriate means. It is the best chance we have to eliminate Boko Haram, to eliminate this terror so that other young girls are not snatched and their lives destroyed. The region's stability, by the way, depends upon it. Mr. LARSEN of Washington. Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from New York (Mrs. Carolyn B. Maloney). Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New York. I thank the ranking member for yielding and for his strong leadership. Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong support of the amendment I have cosponsored with the gentleman from California, Representative Royce, and I thank him for his outstanding leadership not only on this issue, but on so many of them. This particular amendment expresses U.S. support for the defeat of the terrorist organization Boko Haram. Combating Boko Haram is in our national interest and is certainly in the interest of security in the region, and the United States should support the regional allies in their operations against Boko Haram, which are making significant progress in combating them. We just marked the 1-year anniversary of the kidnapping of 270 young schoolgirls from Nigeria. This horror raised the awareness of the world to the terror of Boko Haram and what it has unleashed on Nigerians for years. The amendment clearly affirms that Boko Haram represents a threat not just to our Nation, but to the world, and certainly to stability in the region. [[Page H3226]] The amendment calls for United States support--which may be in the form of equipment, training, technical support--for a coordinated military response in Africa to combat Boko Haram. Since its formation, the coalition has made significant gains against this terrorist threat and has started to improve stability in the region. Many of the young girls have escaped and have come here to speak to us in Congress. The amendment also calls for reports to Congress on the progress of the mission and an accounting of U.S. support. Combating Boko Haram is and should remain a national security interest, and we must remain vigilant in fighting this enemy. I urge my colleagues to support this important amendment. Again, I thank Chairman Royce for his attention, strong leadership, and for really saving lives in this region. He is securing stability in the region and for America, too. Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself 30 seconds. Mr. Chairman, I just want to show my appreciation for the work of Chairman Royce and Mrs. Carolyn B. Maloney of New York on this issue with Boko Haram. I noticed in the headlines of this morning's paper, Boko Haram has a new offensive against a military base in Nigeria. The contribution they have made with this amendment to the bill is very important so that the Nigerians and others in the region are better able to fight these terrorists. And there is no other word for them. There are also provisions in this bill to help the Ukrainians fight the aggression that they are undergoing, there are provisions in this bill to help fight ISIS, which is all part of the reason I believe this bill deserves the support of all Members. I appreciate the contributions of both Members on this amendment. I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. LARSEN of Washington. Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from California (Mr. Garamendi). Mr. GARAMENDI. I thank the chairman for yielding. Mr. Chairman, in the legislation today, there is a clause that would cause us to think about what to do in the High Arctic. The Arctic Ocean is melting. There will be a Northwest Passage. We are going to need a new heavy icebreaker to provide the support for the Navy as well as for commercial. Yesterday during a hearing, we hit upon the notion of creating a special fund similar to what exists for the strategic missile submarines. We would like, therefore, to begin the discussion of a national strategic high-latitude icebreaking fund. That discussion could then merge into a way of funding about $1 billion for a new icebreaker, absolutely essential for the U.S. Navy, absolutely essential for the commerce in the Arctic Ocean as well as for providing us with the ability to compete with Russia. I would like to propose that that be discussed and part of the process as we move the NDAA through the committees and the two Houses. Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. LARSEN of Washington. Mr. Chairman, I would encourage folks to vote for en bloc 7, and I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Chairman, I encourage Members to do the same thing, as well as on final passage. I yield back the balance of my time. The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendments en bloc offered by the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Thornberry). The en bloc amendments were agreed to.

Page 754, line 10, after ``operational requirements,'' insert the following: ``not including the requirements of any other organization or country,''. The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 260, the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Thornberry) and the gentleman from Washington (Mr. Smith) each will control 10 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Texas. Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself 30 seconds. Mr. Chairman, this en bloc package consists of 11 amendments. Generally, they are on the issues related to our strategic deterrence: our nuclear weapons, our ICBMs, missile defense against those sorts of weapons from other countries; in other words, they touch on very important issues that are central to our country's security. They have been sponsored by both Republicans and Democrats, and I hope Members of this House will support this en bloc package. I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. SMITH of Washington. Mr. Chairman, I, too, support this en bloc package. I hope that the Members will vote for it. With that, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Chairman, I have no further speakers at this point, so I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. SMITH of Washington. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself the balance of my time to once again say that I want to, first of all, thank the chairman. I want to thank all of the members of the committee and the staff for the hard work that they do and have done on this bill. Every year, this is a very, very difficult process, starting with the committee markup, which, this year, I think--we probably didn't set a record. We set a record for my time in terms of one day going until 4:45 in the morning. But I just want to take one brief moment to recognize the staff that does just an unbelievable amount of work throughout this process. We see the amendments both in committee and on the floor that survive that process. The staff has to sift through literally hundreds more to try to boil them down, to try to find compromises, to basically try to work out whatever they can work out. I don't think there are too many members of the staff on either side that have slept more than 2 or 3 hours a night here for the last few weeks. So I thank them for their hard work, and I thank the committee members for their hard work as well. It is the largest committee in Congress. We have excellent members on it. During the course of the debate and during the course of putting together this bill, every one of those members contributed greatly to the product. As I have said before, there are a lot of good things in this bill. The reform package that the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Thornberry) has made of particular priority I think is a very good first step towards trying to get more efficiency out of the military in a variety in different places. And of course we fund a lot of very necessary programs. But we have one overarching problem that we have had since 2011, starting with the fact that we couldn't pass the appropriations bills for 2011. And most have forgotten this, but at the end of March of 2011, we were looking at a government shutdown. We had a marathon 4- day, every amendment you can imagine on the appropriations bill, and, actually, I think it did go past the moment when the government was supposed to shut down before passing a CR, which pushed us then up against the debt ceiling in 2011, which wasn't going to be raised. We were facing a situation where chunks of the government would shut downs in ways we couldn't even predict, and I want everyone to understand the impact that this has on the Department of Defense. {time} 0945 I vividly remember a dinner that I had in March of 2011 with then- Vice Chief of Staff of the Army, Pete Chiarelli, and I was asking him about how all of this budget uncertainty impacts the Department of Defense. He said: Well, we have got several hundred programs, and every day we try to figure out which ones we are allowed to fund, which ones we are not allowed to fund, where we can get the money, what we can do, and how we can move it around. They didn't know. For the last 4 years plus, that is what the Department of Defense has had to do. We have gone from CR to government shutdown to occasionally getting a spending bill to living with sequestration and the budget caps. The one thing that this bill doesn't do is it doesn't resolve that issue. It goes to the overseas contingency operation fund while leaving the budget caps in place. As Secretary Carter has said, the overseas contingency operations fund is no way to fund the military and does very, very little to remove that uncertainty that I just described. So I want everyone to understand when I talk about the fact that I am opposing this bill because of its impact on the overall budget, that is also very much about the Department of Defense. The Department of Defense is left in that uncertainty and also stuck with OCO funding, which is unpredictable, 1-year money that makes it very difficult for them to plan. So this bill's reliance on the OCO funding is a problem for the Department of Defense. Leaving those budget caps in place is something that I am opposed to. So it is an issue directly related to the Department of Defense. Now, it is also related to the rest of the budget. We have caps that impact the Department of Homeland Security, that impact the Department of Justice, that impact those other areas that, by the way, are very important. I have had some folks mention ISIL and our fight against them. Those departments are incredibly important to that fight. They are still under the budget caps, which are, I believe, jeopardizing our national security. And then there are other issues, infrastructure being the biggest one that those budget caps continue to hamper and continue, I believe, to make our country less safe. So the fact that this bill locks in place and keeps the budget caps, relies on the overseas contingency operations fund, and, most importantly, does not lift the budget cap for defense is the reason I am opposing it and urging other Democrats and Republicans as well to oppose it. It doesn't lift the budget caps. I believe that is harmful to the Department of Defense. So this is a defense issue. Mr. Chairman, I also point out for my conservative colleagues who are so [[Page H3229]] concerned about keeping those budget caps that the OCO goes right around them. I wouldn't think that a conservative who wants to keep government spending under control would encourage the government deciding that they can create free money. The OCO doesn't count against the budget caps. So it is like the money isn't really being spent, only, of course, the money is being spent. It is $38 billion that we are just choosing not to count. It doesn't fix the problem. Lastly, the President has promised to veto all of the appropriations bills and the defense bill that are based on this flawed approach to the budget. So what we are doing here is ultimately not going to be successful until we come up with a better long-term solution to dealing with the budget caps, and I will simply emphasize one more time that has a profoundly negative effect on the Department of Defense, on our obligation to, I believe, properly fund and properly support the men and women who serve in our military. So, Mr. Chairman, while there is a lot of good in this bill, the ongoing budget uncertainty that it continues, I believe, is the fatal flaw in this bill. So I urge people to vote ``no.'' I do appreciate all the work and the effort that went into it. I also emphasize that this is but one step in the process. We have got a long way to go, and I am completely confident by the time we get to the end of it, we will have a National Defense Authorization Act. It will be difficult. We have to work with the President, we have to work with the Senate, and people have a lot of different opinions, but this is but the first step in the process. So, Mr. Chairman, I urge us to continue working to hopefully get a better product that can get the support of the House, the Senate, and the President and fulfill our duty to pass this bill and support our troops. With that, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself the balance of my time. Mr. Chairman, let me start with where the gentleman from Washington left off, that this is one step in the process. That is kind of what I have been saying all along. Earlier the gentleman said he is opposed to this bill because it locks in this OCO approach. No, it doesn't lock anything in. If there is a better way to deal with our budget issues in the appropriation bills, then there is lots of time this year to do that. But the question here for the House is: Will we vote against a defense authorization bill--not an appropriation bill--but a defense authorization bill and prevent it from moving a step ahead? As a matter of fact, Mr. Chairman, I hope all Members had a chance to read the editorial in this morning's Washington Post. Let me just read the last sentence of it: ``Far better for him''--by which it means the President--``and his party's leadership in Congress to help an adequate defense budget keep moving through Congress rather than perpetuate a fight all Americans, whether Republican or Democrat, may later regret.'' That is what we are asking here today: keep this adequate defense budget moving by voting for it. Now, Mr. Chairman, that doesn't solve all the problems. The gentleman is exactly right. There are all sorts of appropriation bills and other things to come in this process. But to try to use this important bill and the authorities it gives as political leverage to somehow make that happen, I think, is not fair to the men and women who serve or to our country's security. Mr. Chairman, there are lots of things that affect the military that this bill does not solve. I admit it. I don't try to solve all of them. When you try to solve all the problems, you usually end up making a mess. But that should not take away from the good that is in this bill. So I want to just emphasize the good that is in this bill has come from both sides of the aisle, and I am incredibly grateful for the contributions the Democratic members of the committee made. Something like 110 provisions in the underlying mark were requested by Democrats. In the committee 96 amendments offered by Democrats were adopted into the mark. We have had 57 amendments offered by Democrats made in order under the rule. We don't know how they are all going to come out yet, but the point is, a substantial part of this measure has been written and contributed to by Members on the Democratic side of the aisle, as well as Members on the Republican side of the aisle. The truth is it is a better product as a result, and the truth is that it is consistent with the bipartisan tradition of this committee. So, Mr. Chairman, I want to end, actually, where Mr. Smith started, and that is to express appreciation to him for being a terrific partner to work with in formulating this bill and dealing with very complex, rapidly changing subjects as the world is swirling around us. As he pointed out, we are the largest committee in Congress--63 members. But each of those members on both sides of the aisle have made important contributions to this bill. I would, like him, also want to appreciate the staff. I think we are unique in the Congress. We have an integrated staff where I can grab someone on the Democratic side or a Democratic member can grab someone who works on the Republican side. They are all integrated, working on the same issues. I think that makes us stronger as a committee. So there is an important bipartisan tradition of this committee, and it is because national security is so important. Let me go back to The Washington Post editorial and read the first sentence: ``There isn't much bipartisan governance left in Washington, but if anything still fits that description, it is probably the annual defense authorization act.'' I am pleased about that. I think that is what the American people want to hear because national security is so important. So for the suggestion to come that we are going to put national security on the back burner while we try to solve all the budget problems of all the agencies and all the government, that is discouraging. Mr. Chairman, I hope that Members will not agree with that tactic, that they will listen to the better angels of their nature as far as supporting this bill because it is a bipartisan bill that is so important for our troops and national security. I hope they will support this en bloc amendment. I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. McCAUL. Mr. Chair, I rise in strong support of the Carter-Rigell- McCaul-Gohmert Amendment to the National Defense Authorization Act of Fiscal Year 2016 and in defense of our servicemembers' Second Amendment rights. Twice my home State of Texas has mourned the loss of our soldiers and civilians after shootings at Fort Hood just north of my district. In 2009, Nidal Hassan walked into Fort Hood's Soldier Readiness Center, shouted ``Allahu Akbar'', and opened fire, killing 13 and wounding 42 others in the most horrific terrorist attack on U.S. soil since 9/11. Five years later, another shooter opened fire on the base, killing four and wounding sixteen others. This is on top of other deadly attacks on military installations, such as the Navy Yard shooting in 2013, and the 2009 shooting at a recruiting center in Little Rock, Arkansas, where another Islamist radical killed one and wounded another. In each case, one has to wonder if something could have been done to stop the shooting sooner and to prevent more lives from being lost. For years, DOD has had a stringent policy which prevents well-trained soldiers from carrying personal firearms on base in compliance with state and local laws. The Carter-Rigell-McCaul-Gohmert Amendment will responsibly adjust this policy and allow members of the Armed Forces to carry a concealed personal firearm if their commander determines it to be necessary as a personal or force protection measure. This is especially important at a time when threats to our soldiers and military bases is growing. In March, ISIS published a ``kill list'' of the names, photos and addresses of American soldiers. Since then, the threat level at U.S. military bases increased to ``Force Protection Bravo,'' in response to the increased threat of terrorism. Mr. Chair, we must give our base commanders more discretion and our soldiers more protection. Thousands of my constituents in Texas already exercise this right responsibly. It is time for our servicemembers to be allowed to do the same. The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendments en bloc offered by the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Thornberry).

Mr. Speaker, I have a motion to recommit at the desk. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is the gentleman opposed to the bill? Mr. GALLEGO. Yes, I am opposed. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Clerk will report the motion to recommit. The Clerk read as follows: Mr. Gallego moves to recommit the bill H.R. 1735 to the Committee on Armed Services with instructions to report the same back to the House forthwith, with the following amendment: At the end of subtitle A of title VI, add the following new section: SEC. 6__. GUARANTEEING A PAY INCREASE FOR MEMBERS OF THE UNIFORMED SERVICES AND NO LAPSE IN PAY CAUSED BY A GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWN. (a) Increase in Basic Pay.--As provided in section 1009 of title 37, United States Code, and effective on January 1, 2016, the increase for fiscal year 2016 in the rates of monthly basic pay authorized for members of the uniformed services shall be 2.3 percent. (b) Response to Lapse in Appropriations.--The Secretary of Defense shall take all steps necessary to ensure that members of the Army, Navy, Air Force, and Marine Corps continue to receive compensation for their service in defense of the United States despite any lapse in appropriations after September 30, 2015. Mr. GALLEGO. Mr. Speaker, this is the final amendment to the bill. It will not delay the bill, kill the bill, or send it back to committee. If adopted, the bill will proceed immediately to final passage, as amended. As Members of Congress, we must always honor our promises to the men and women who serve in our military. Unfortunately, I know firsthand what happens when Washington fails our troops on the battlefield and when we come home. I fought the Iraq war on the ground. I was shot at and experienced IED attacks, but because Congress didn't follow through on its promises, our vehicles didn't have the proper armor they needed. This failure cost my friends their lives. Later, when I got home, my friends and I suffered needlessly. When my friends and I got home, we suffered needlessly because of a veterans healthcare system that was shortchanged and mismanaged. These failures of leadership are what encouraged me to run for office, to ensure that my generation of leaders takes better care of our troops than we were taken care of. That is why I am offering this amendment. It is to make good on Congress' promise to give our military men and women a raise. The amendment will lock in a 2.3 percent increase for all of our soldiers, sailors, airmen, and marines. Last year, one in four members of our military had to rely on food pantries and other charities just to make ends meet. That is a disgrace. Mr. Speaker, our troops deserve a raise. My amendment does something else that is just as important. It ensures that even if Congress shuts down the Federal Government, all of our brave men and women in uniform will still get paid. Why should our servicemen and -women miss their paychecks just because we can't do our jobs? [[Page H3234]] Why am I offering this amendment now? Because Republicans don't appear to have learned the lessons of the chaos and confusion they caused by shutting down the government in 2013. Today, my Republican friends are risking another government shutdown by resorting to budget gimmicks, relying on war funding to pay for more routine operations and maintenance. That is completely irresponsible. My Republican friends are fond of comparing the Federal budget to a family budget. Mr. Speaker, working families, military families can't rely on a special slush fund to pay for their daily expenses, and Congress should not either. We must protect our troops from the consequences of this Republican leadership's refusal to confront the realities of sequestration. That is why this amendment is so critical. Yesterday, Speaker Boehner said voting against this bill would be shameful and that we would be turning our back on our troops. As a marine and a combat veteran, I can tell you that the Speaker is wrong. There is no shame in voting against a bill that creates uncertainty for our military and risks another dangerous government shutdown. Mr. Speaker, the real shame would be to vote against the amendment that gives our men and women the raise and certainty they deserve. I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the motion. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Texas is recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Speaker, let me start by saying I very much appreciate the service of Mr. Gallego and all the veterans on both sides of the aisle who have served our Nation. I appreciate all of the contributions Mr. Gallego and all the other 62 members of the committee have made into producing this National Defense Authorization Act. It has been a bipartisan product in the tradition of this committee. You know, if you think about it, for 53 straight years Congresses of both parties have passed and Presidents of both parties have signed into law a Defense Authorization Act, and that has been true through Vietnam and the cold war and 9/11. It has been true through Watergate and race riots, and economic recessions and bitter political feuds. {time} 1045 And yet, through all those things, somehow the parties could come together to do what was needed for our troops and for our country's security. I think that that strong tradition of bipartisanship is something that we should not walk away from lightly. We have heard some discussion--complaints, really--on both sides of the aisle about using OCO to get up to the President's level. If you look at this chart, this is the President's budget, and this is the congressional budget, which this bill is compliant with. There is a little difference in where the light blue and the dark blue start and stop. But the net effect, when you add it all together, is exactly the same: $612 billion. That is what the President asked for. That is what this bill provides. There is no difference between the two. I agree that we ought to find a better way to have fiscal discipline without the arbitrary caps and sequestration that are in the Budget Control Act, but this bill can't do that. This bill is a defense authorization bill. It is not a budget bill. It is not an immigration bill. It is not even a defense appropriation bill. So if this bill fails, how does that get us closer to fixing our budget problems? The truth is we could all find an excuse to vote against every bill, every day, for what is not in it, but that doesn't make a lot of sense. What is important is what is in it. And what is in it is really important for our troops and for our national security. As much as I appreciate Congressman Gallego's service, I find it ironic that he would offer an amendment that tries to make sure our troops get paid, even in the event of a government shutdown; and yet, by voting against this bill, the troops don't get paid. How does that fit together? Let me just mention two of the things that are in this bill for our troops. One is a new retirement system for people who sign up for the military. Right now, 83 percent of the people who serve come away with no retirement. Under this bill, they can put some money aside, the government will match it, and they can have a nest egg. If you vote against that bill, that doesn't happen. One of the complaints we have all heard so many times is that the transition from Active Duty to the VA is problematic because you can't stay on the same drugs. One of the things this bill does is say that they have got to have a joint formulary so you stay on the same drugs and you can take better care of the people as they transition. Doesn't that make sense? I hope all Members had a chance to read The Washington Post editorial today. Let me just read the last sentence: Far better for the President and his party's leadership in Congress to help an adequate defense budget keep moving through Congress rather than perpetuate a fight all Americans, whether Republican or Democrat, may later regret. I think that is the bottom line. This doesn't solve all the problems. It doesn't try to solve all the problems. I know we have got more debate, more discussion to come, but this is a step on what has been a very bipartisan bill. Mr. Speaker, here is the bottom line. We are incredibly privileged to have these jobs, to live in this country, but those privileges only come because brave men and women are willing to volunteer to serve and sacrifice for our country. Now, we can never match their courage and dedication and sacrifice, but surely to goodness we can do better than use them as pawns for some sort of attempt to apply political pressure on issues that have nothing to do with this bill. Surely we can do better than that. And the way to do better than that is to vote against this motion and for final passage. I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Without objection, the previous question is ordered on the motion to recommit. There was no objection. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion to recommit.

year 2015 (public law 113-291; 128 stat. 3541), as having misused provided training and equipment. the acting chair. pursuant to house resolution 260, the gentleman from texas (mr. thornberry) and the gentleman from washington (mr. larsen) each will control 10 minutes. the chair recognizes the gentleman from texas. mr. thornberry. mr. chairman, i yield myself 30 seconds. mr. chairman, this en bloc package consists of 17 total amendments. nine of them have been offered by republicans, eight of them have been offered by democrats. they cover a variety of very important topics for our national security, including cooperation with india, evacuation of u.s. persons from yemen, the impact of u.s. troop levels on nato, and violence in mexico. i believe these are important subjects and important additions to our bill. i hope members will support this en bloc package. and i hope that all members who make these contributions will support the final version so that their contribution has a chance to become law. with that, mr. chairman, i am pleased to yield 1 minute to the distinguished gentleman from michigan (mr. walberg). {time} 0915 mr. walberg. i thank the chairman for the efforts put forth by himself and the committee on necessary legislation that, indeed, should pass. mr. chairman, america has given 14 years, nearly $1 trillion, and thousands of lives to help build a stable afghanistan. while most of our troops have come home, congress has still obligated billions of dollars to be spent on reconstruction efforts. as we transfer oversight authority to afghan officials, the special inspector general for afghanistan reconstruction has identified serious deficiencies in our ability to ensure the proper use of these american taxpayer dollars, as the afghan ministries currently lack the capacity to effectively manage and account for u.s.-funded assistance. my amendment would require sigar to certify it has sufficient access to afghan accounts to guarantee effective audits. we must ensure that every dollar is spent effectively. i appreciate that this amendment has been added en bloc, and i ask my colleagues to support this legislation and this amendment. mr. larsen of washington. mr. chairman, i yield myself such time as i may consume. mr. chairman, i would ask members to support this en bloc package, and i yield 1 minute to the gentleman from minnesota (mr. nolan) for comments on en bloc no. 6. mr. nolan. mr. chairman and members of the house, as mr. walberg just pointed out, we have spent literally trillions of dollars in the middle east in what many would describe as wars of choice and nation building. i want to applaud the committee for this underlying legislation to ensure some accountability of how that money goes. all too often, the moneys have made a mockery of our good intentions and ended up in the wrong hands and, in many cases, used against us. the underlying legislation requires the defense department now to require them to give us a list of who money has been given to in syria and iraq to fight isil, and my legislation says that, when they find evidence that those funds have been misused by any one of those parties, they can no longer be recipients of our funding and our intentions in this regard. mr. chairman, i urge the adoption of my amendment and the bloc as well. mr. thornberry. mr. chairman, i am pleased to yield 1 minute to my colleague from texas (mr. poe). mr. poe of texas. i thank the chairman for yielding, and i want the chairman to know that i support the amendment en bloc, and i support the bill as well. mr. chair, the number of foreign fighters traveling to syria and iraq to join isis is increasing at an alarming, dramatic rate. the director of the national counterterrorism center said that more foreign fighters have joined isis in the last 2 years than those who went to afghanistan or iraq in the last 20 years. more than 180 of these fighters are from the united states. these killers are not just going to fight and die on the battlefields of iraq and syria. many return home to their home countries as trained, battle-hardened islamic radicals. before moner mohammad abusalha became the first american to carry out a suicide bomb in syria, he had already been to syria and back to the united states as a trained suicide killer. the united states government didn't even know this. we need a comprehensive strategy to reduce the flow of foreign fighters from isis to the united states and foreign fighters going to train with isis. this amendment requires such a strategy. and that is just the way it is. mr. larsen of washington. mr. chairman, i yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from michigan (mrs. dingell). mrs. dingell. i thank the gentleman from washington (mr. larsen). mr. chairman, members of the house, i rise in support of my amendment, no. 103, contained in this bloc, which expresses the sense of congress that the president should exercise all available authority to evacuate u.s. citizens from yemen as soon as possible. my district is home to the highest concentration of yemeni americans in the united states. since hostilities began in yemen, my office hears daily from yemeni americans who are terrified, frustrated, desperate, and have no idea how to exit the country. these are united states citizens in yemen, with nowhere to turn. this week, npr told the story of rhonia aladashi, a 16-year-old girl from my hometown of dearborn, michigan. she had traveled to yemen to visit her father when the hostilities began, and she tried multiple options to escape. she tried to cross the border at saudi arabia and got turned back into hostile areas because she did not have a man traveling with her. ultimately, she ended up on a private fishing boat, going with no food or water on board. my constituents and their families stuck in yemen need hope, and they need to know that american citizens are not being forgotten. we do not in any way want to put american military in danger, but we need to tell americans there is hope. [[page h3222]] i thank mr. larsen and chairman thornberry. mr. thornberry. mr. chairman, i am pleased to yield 1 minute to the distinguished gentleman from north carolina (mr. walker). mr. walker. i thank the gentleman from texas for yielding. mr. chairman, i rise today to express my gratitude for the hard work and dedication put forth by chairman thornberry, ranking member smith, and their colleagues on the armed services committee in drafting the national defense authorization act of 2016. i would like to thank the rules committee, chairman sessions, and ranking member slaughter for their efforts in ensuring members on both sides of the aisle had an avenue to voice their opinion. we recently finished 10 townhalls in 10 counties, and the number one thing from our constituents is making sure that washington is held accountable. these efforts help restore our constituents' faith in this body and the process of lawmaking. mr. larsen of washington. mr. chairman, i yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from new york (mr. crowley). mr. crowley. i thank the gentleman from washington, my good friend mr. larsen, for yielding me this time. mr. chairman, the effort to expand u.s.-india relations has always been and continues to be a bipartisan effort, and i want to thank both sides of the aisle in acceptance of the amendment that i put forward. over the past two decades, we have seen the relationship between the united states and india flourish and blossom under both--i should say starting with president clinton's presidency, followed by president george bush's presidency, and we have seen how advanced it has become under the presidency of barack obama. i had the opportunity to travel with the president earlier this year to india, and the incredible reception that the president and the delegation received was like no other experience i have ever had in india, and this relationship continues to grow. this is the first time we have had an opportunity to express the support of the house and of the congress of this burgeoning relationship, especially as it pertains to mil-to-mil cooperation, and i believe that this is the most critical relationship that we will have this decade in the world. india and the united states, we have shared values of civilian control of the military. it is a very important aspect when you consider the part of the world we are talking about. we share that same value with india. india's quest for securing peace not only within her region, but around the world as well, is something that we share with her. india's commitment to democracy and rule of law is something we also share with india and, overall, using democracy and the quest for peace, trying to bring stability throughout the world. i also want to thank the indian diaspora in helping with this effort. this is truly, as i said earlier, i believe, the most important alliance the united states will have this century. mr. thornberry. mr. chairman, i am pleased to yield 1 minute to the distinguished gentleman from pennsylvania (mr. kelly). mr. kelly of pennsylvania. i thank the chairman. i rise in strong support of my amendment to renew a 1-year ban on the obama administration from using any department of defense funds to implement the united nations arms trade treaty. this amendment updates and strengthens the language of my amendments that were entered into law in previous ndaas. why? because this amendment--we must always uphold our fundamental individual right to keep and to bear arms, which is enshrined in our constitution. we also must uphold the sovereignty of the united states over our arms export control system, which is the gold standard of the world. now, how do we do this? first, the amendment explicitly forbids the use of dod funds to facilitate domestic prosecutions of individual americans. this is a real danger because the obama administration has already engaged in domestic prosecutions of individuals using treaties. this is totally unacceptable. second, my amendment specifically bans the use of dod funds for an att secretariat, created for ``effectively implementing'' the att, according to the treaty's supporters. appallingly and equally unacceptable, att backers seek to put the u.s. on the hook to fund the activities of a treaty to which it is not a party. i thank the chairman and the ranking member for including this amendment in the en bloc amendments. i urge my colleagues to stand with me in support of the second amendment, our nation's sovereignty, and vote in support of this amendment to renew the annual ban on the funding of the united nations arms trade treaty. mr. larsen of washington. mr. chairman, may i inquire how much time i have left? the acting chair. the gentleman has 5 minutes remaining. mr. larsen of washington. mr. chairman, i yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from florida (ms. castor). ms. castor of florida. i thank my colleague. mr. chair, i rise today in support of the castor amendment, which is an amendment in support of military families across the country. it expresses the sense of congress that, when it comes to housing military members, the pentagon should factor in the commuting times for base personnel and the land available for on-base housing. on-base housing is a critical readiness issue. having our servicemembers as close to their assignments as possible is vital. dod must ensure that the decisions relating to base housing take into account relevant factors, and each base is different. for example, at macdill air force base in my hometown in tampa, florida, it is home to the 6th air mobility wing, united states special operations command, and united states central command. the recent expansion of on-base housing for military families has been a great success. pursuant to a public-private partnership that was authorized in 2007, 572 homes have been constructed on the base. this has been a godsend for the families at macdill, and here is why: the neighborhoods closest to the base are expensive and out of reach for many military families, so servicemembers oftentimes buy homes about 30 miles away and then commute to the base. this recent public-private partnership at macdill has been a win-win for the military and the families who serve. in fact, one top pentagon official who oversees installations noted that the macdill air force base housing initiative was one of her favorites, forcewide, and was exceptional. think about the difference it makes to that military family when they can live close to where they work and where their children attend school. now, until recently, the air force and the housing contractor were discussing the next phase of on-base housing. macdill has over 330 families on a waiting list. unfortunately, despite the long waiting list, the obvious demand, the air force has inexplicably terminated discussions. if this is happening in my community, it could be happening in yours, and with scarce federal dollars, we must continue to encourage fruitful public-private partnerships and the best interests of our brave men and women in the service. i thank chairman thornberry, ranking member smith, and mr. larsen for their support of the amendment, and i urge adoption. mr. thornberry. mr. chairman, i reserve the balance of my time. mr. larsen of washington. mr. chairman, i yield back the balance of my time. mr. thornberry. mr. chairman, i support the en bloc. i hope all members will, and i yield back the balance of my time. mr. holding. mr. chair, i rise today to support the crowley-engel- holding-bera-royce amendment to the 2016 ndaa. as co-chair of the house india caucus, i am privileged to spend time highlighting the robust and growing relationship between the united states and india to my colleagues and to my constituents. with the emerging challenges our two nations face in the indo-pacific region, we must place an emphasis on increasing the collaboration between our two defense departments and defense industries. in january to move this collaboration forward, the united states and india signed the [[page h3223]] ``joint strategic vision for the asia pacific and indian ocean region'' laying out our shared principles and views for security in the region. our two nations also agreed to renew--and upgrade--our ten year defense framework well before its expiration date which truly shows our commitment to working together. the united states and india are on the same page and through the diligent work of the defense technology and trade initiative along with the department of defense's india rapid reaction cell, defense cooperation between our two nations is on the right trajectory. but more can, should, and will be done to bring us closer together on defense. mr. chair, india has a vital role to play in the indo-pacific by becoming a regional security provider and the united states should continue to work lockstep with our counterparts in new delhi to achieve this. and mr. chair, that is precisely what our amendment supports. the acting chair. the question is on the amendments en bloc offered by the gentleman from texas (mr. thornberry). the en bloc amendments were agreed to. amendments en bloc no. 7 offered by mr. thornberry of texas mr. thornberry. mr. chairman, pursuant

washington (mr. larsen) each will control 10 minutes. the chair recognizes the gentleman from texas. mr. thornberry. mr. chairman, i yield myself 30 seconds. mr. chairman this en bloc package consists of 11 amendments. they touch such important subjects as the nuclear enterprise review, the long-range standoff weapon, military manufacturing arsenals, and a variety of other very important topics. they are sponsored by both republicans and democrats. four of these amendments are sponsored by democrats. i believe they deserve the support of the whole house, but i also believe the full bill deserves the support of the whole house so that these important amendments have a chance to become law. i hope all members will support not only the package, but final passage. mr. chairman, i yield 1 minute to the gentleman from colorado (mr. lamborn), the distinguished vice chair of the subcommittee on strategic forces. {time} 0930 mr. lamborn. mr. chairman, i rise in support of my amendment, no. 108, which is included in this en bloc package. my amendment adds a sense of congress provision regarding our support for the hashemite kingdom of jordan. jordan is one of our most important allies in the region, and i believe that the united states should support jordan's military efforts to the greatest extent possible. the jordanians are on the front lines in the fight against isis and have suffered the consequences of the president's policy failures regarding syria. jordan is under fire from those who wish to do it harm, and we must stand by a country that has been a force for good in the region. in colorado, we have a unique interest in this relationship, as the colorado national guard is partnered with the jordanian military through the state partnership program. colorado guardsmen are helping train jordanian servicemembers. this is just one of the ways that we can help stand with our friends in jordan. i thank the chairman for including this amendment in the en bloc package, and i urge its adoption. mr. larsen of washington. mr. chairman, i yield myself such time as i may consume. mr. chairman, i want to echo the comments of the gentleman from texas (mr. thornberry) about en bloc no. 7 and its bipartisan nature. i would encourage members to support it. with that, i yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from illinois (mr. foster). mr. foster. i would like to thank the ranking member for yielding and the chairman and his staff for working with me on this amendment. mr. chairman, the national defense authorization act tasks the missile defense agency with developing a concept for a space-based missile defense system. there is no doubt that missile defense--if technologically feasible, militarily robust, and economically justifiable--would be an important priority for our national security. but as a scientist, i think that we need to do our homework before we begin investing hundreds of billions of dollars into developing this system, and that is why i am introducing this amendment to require a preliminary cost estimate for this project. a 2012 report by the national academy of sciences estimated that even to provide limited coverage, hundreds of interceptors would be required to stop an incoming ballistic missile. because of the cost to launch, maintain, operate, and replenish the interceptors, even a limited system would cost a minimum of $200 billion. we must do our due diligence before investing billions of taxpayer dollars into any project. so i urge my colleagues to join me and vote ``yes'' on this amendment. mr. thornberry. mr. chairman, at this point, i am pleased to yield 1 minute to the gentleman from california (mr. royce), the distinguished chairman of the foreign affairs committee. mr. royce. mr. chairman, i very much appreciate chairman thornberry and the armed services committee for working collaboratively on this important amendment. in speaking on behalf of this royce-maloney amendment, i want to recognize the leadership of representative carolyn b. maloney of new york, who has been dedicated in the fight against boko haram and dedicated in terms of trying to raise awareness on this. many have seen on television the continued kidnappings of boko haram, the pillaging of villages, the taking of women and children as captives. i just want to tell you the story that we heard last year in our committee from one young girl, a survivor from chibok, that touched the hearts of, i think, many people there that day. she gave this brave narration of what happened when boko haram broke in and, before her very eyes, killed her father and killed her 14-year- old brother. she is one of the few from her village who survived. the acting chair. the time of the gentleman has expired. mr. thornberry. mr. chairman, i yield the gentleman an additional 1 minute. mr. royce. i thank the chairman for yielding. so i just want to say this: nigeria and its neighbors--chad, niger, cameroon--have been making headway in the fight against boko haram. they have cleared a number of northern nigerian towns. now we have an opportunity with the african union force--but it lacks equipment; it lacks capacity--for a protracted fight there. this amendment expresses support for robust security assistance, training, equipment, the capacity building they need so that the african troops that are fighting against boko haram can continue to advance on the field. the amendment also requires the department of defense and the state department to produce a report to make sure the congress is fully aware of the nature of the assistance being provided. we need to support nigeria and the african union authorized force with all appropriate means. it is the best chance we have to eliminate boko haram, to eliminate this terror so that other young girls are not snatched and their lives destroyed. the region's stability, by the way, depends upon it. mr. larsen of washington. mr. chairman, i yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from new york (mrs. carolyn b. maloney). mrs. carolyn b. maloney of new york. i thank the ranking member for yielding and for his strong leadership. mr. chairman, i rise in strong support of the amendment i have cosponsored with the gentleman from california, representative royce, and i thank him for his outstanding leadership not only on this issue, but on so many of them. this particular amendment expresses u.s. support for the defeat of the terrorist organization boko haram. combating boko haram is in our national interest and is certainly in the interest of security in the region, and the united states should support the regional allies in their operations against boko haram, which are making significant progress in combating them. we just marked the 1-year anniversary of the kidnapping of 270 young schoolgirls from nigeria. this horror raised the awareness of the world to the terror of boko haram and what it has unleashed on nigerians for years. the amendment clearly affirms that boko haram represents a threat not just to our nation, but to the world, and certainly to stability in the region. [[page h3226]] the amendment calls for united states support--which may be in the form of equipment, training, technical support--for a coordinated military response in africa to combat boko haram. since its formation, the coalition has made significant gains against this terrorist threat and has started to improve stability in the region. many of the young girls have escaped and have come here to speak to us in congress. the amendment also calls for reports to congress on the progress of the mission and an accounting of u.s. support. combating boko haram is and should remain a national security interest, and we must remain vigilant in fighting this enemy. i urge my colleagues to support this important amendment. again, i thank chairman royce for his attention, strong leadership, and for really saving lives in this region. he is securing stability in the region and for america, too. mr. thornberry. mr. chairman, i yield myself 30 seconds. mr. chairman, i just want to show my appreciation for the work of chairman royce and mrs. carolyn b. maloney of new york on this issue with boko haram. i noticed in the headlines of this morning's paper, boko haram has a new offensive against a military base in nigeria. the contribution they have made with this amendment to the bill is very important so that the nigerians and others in the region are better able to fight these terrorists. and there is no other word for them. there are also provisions in this bill to help the ukrainians fight the aggression that they are undergoing, there are provisions in this bill to help fight isis, which is all part of the reason i believe this bill deserves the support of all members. i appreciate the contributions of both members on this amendment. i reserve the balance of my time. mr. larsen of washington. mr. chairman, i yield 1 minute to the gentleman from california (mr. garamendi). mr. garamendi. i thank the chairman for yielding. mr. chairman, in the legislation today, there is a clause that would cause us to think about what to do in the high arctic. the arctic ocean is melting. there will be a northwest passage. we are going to need a new heavy icebreaker to provide the support for the navy as well as for commercial. yesterday during a hearing, we hit upon the notion of creating a special fund similar to what exists for the strategic missile submarines. we would like, therefore, to begin the discussion of a national strategic high-latitude icebreaking fund. that discussion could then merge into a way of funding about $1 billion for a new icebreaker, absolutely essential for the u.s. navy, absolutely essential for the commerce in the arctic ocean as well as for providing us with the ability to compete with russia. i would like to propose that that be discussed and part of the process as we move the ndaa through the committees and the two houses. mr. thornberry. mr. chairman, i reserve the balance of my time. mr. larsen of washington. mr. chairman, i would encourage folks to vote for en bloc 7, and i yield back the balance of my time. mr. thornberry. mr. chairman, i encourage members to do the same thing, as well as on final passage. i yield back the balance of my time. the acting chair. the question is on the amendments en bloc offered by the gentleman from texas (mr. thornberry). the en bloc amendments were agreed to. amendments en bloc no. 8 offered by mr. thornberry of texas mr. thornberry. mr. chairman, pursuant to house resolution 260, i offer amendments en bloc. the acting chair. the clerk will designate the amendments en bloc. amendments en bloc no. 8 consisting of amendment nos. 122, 123, 124, 128, 129, 130, 131, 132, 133, 134, and 135 printed in house report no. 114-112, offered by mr. thornberry of texas: amendment no. 122 offered by mr. foster of illinois page 728, line 21, insert before the semicolon the following: ``, including estimates of the appropriate identifiable costs of each such potential program of record''. amendment no. 123 offered by mr. turner of ohio at the end of subtitle e of title xvi, add the following new section: sec. 16__. designation of preferred location of additional missile defense site in the united states. not later than 30 days after the date on which the secretary of defense publishes the draft environmental impact statements pursuant to section 227 of the national defense authorization act for fiscal year 2013 (public law 112-239;

from texas. mr. thornberry. mr. chairman, i yield myself 30 seconds. mr. chairman, this en bloc package consists of 11 amendments. generally, they are on the issues related to our strategic deterrence: our nuclear weapons, our icbms, missile defense against those sorts of weapons from other countries; in other words, they touch on very important issues that are central to our country's security. they have been sponsored by both republicans and democrats, and i hope members of this house will support this en bloc package. i reserve the balance of my time. mr. smith of washington. mr. chairman, i, too, support this en bloc package. i hope that the members will vote for it. with that, i reserve the balance of my time. mr. thornberry. mr. chairman, i have no further speakers at this point, so i reserve the balance of my time. mr. smith of washington. mr. chairman, i yield myself the balance of my time to once again say that i want to, first of all, thank the chairman. i want to thank all of the members of the committee and the staff for the hard work that they do and have done on this bill. every year, this is a very, very difficult process, starting with the committee markup, which, this year, i think--we probably didn't set a record. we set a record for my time in terms of one day going until 4:45 in the morning. but i just want to take one brief moment to recognize the staff that does just an unbelievable amount of work throughout this process. we see the amendments both in committee and on the floor that survive that process. the staff has to sift through literally hundreds more to try to boil them down, to try to find compromises, to basically try to work out whatever they can work out. i don't think there are too many members of the staff on either side that have slept more than 2 or 3 hours a night here for the last few weeks. so i thank them for their hard work, and i thank the committee members for their hard work as well. it is the largest committee in congress. we have excellent members on it. during the course of the debate and during the course of putting together this bill, every one of those members contributed greatly to the product. as i have said before, there are a lot of good things in this bill. the reform package that the gentleman from texas (mr. thornberry) has made of particular priority i think is a very good first step towards trying to get more efficiency out of the military in a variety in different places. and of course we fund a lot of very necessary programs. but we have one overarching problem that we have had since 2011, starting with the fact that we couldn't pass the appropriations bills for 2011. and most have forgotten this, but at the end of march of 2011, we were looking at a government shutdown. we had a marathon 4- day, every amendment you can imagine on the appropriations bill, and, actually, i think it did go past the moment when the government was supposed to shut down before passing a cr, which pushed us then up against the debt ceiling in 2011, which wasn't going to be raised. we were facing a situation where chunks of the government would shut downs in ways we couldn't even predict, and i want everyone to understand the impact that this has on the department of defense. {time} 0945 i vividly remember a dinner that i had in march of 2011 with then- vice chief of staff of the army, pete chiarelli, and i was asking him about how all of this budget uncertainty impacts the department of defense. he said: well, we have got several hundred programs, and every day we try to figure out which ones we are allowed to fund, which ones we are not allowed to fund, where we can get the money, what we can do, and how we can move it around. they didn't know. for the last 4 years plus, that is what the department of defense has had to do. we have gone from cr to government shutdown to occasionally getting a spending bill to living with sequestration and the budget caps. the one thing that this bill doesn't do is it doesn't resolve that issue. it goes to the overseas contingency operation fund while leaving the budget caps in place. as secretary carter has said, the overseas contingency operations fund is no way to fund the military and does very, very little to remove that uncertainty that i just described. so i want everyone to understand when i talk about the fact that i am opposing this bill because of its impact on the overall budget, that is also very much about the department of defense. the department of defense is left in that uncertainty and also stuck with oco funding, which is unpredictable, 1-year money that makes it very difficult for them to plan. so this bill's reliance on the oco funding is a problem for the department of defense. leaving those budget caps in place is something that i am opposed to. so it is an issue directly related to the department of defense. now, it is also related to the rest of the budget. we have caps that impact the department of homeland security, that impact the department of justice, that impact those other areas that, by the way, are very important. i have had some folks mention isil and our fight against them. those departments are incredibly important to that fight. they are still under the budget caps, which are, i believe, jeopardizing our national security. and then there are other issues, infrastructure being the biggest one that those budget caps continue to hamper and continue, i believe, to make our country less safe. so the fact that this bill locks in place and keeps the budget caps, relies on the overseas contingency operations fund, and, most importantly, does not lift the budget cap for defense is the reason i am opposing it and urging other democrats and republicans as well to oppose it. it doesn't lift the budget caps. i believe that is harmful to the department of defense. so this is a defense issue. mr. chairman, i also point out for my conservative colleagues who are so [[page h3229]] concerned about keeping those budget caps that the oco goes right around them. i wouldn't think that a conservative who wants to keep government spending under control would encourage the government deciding that they can create free money. the oco doesn't count against the budget caps. so it is like the money isn't really being spent, only, of course, the money is being spent. it is $38 billion that we are just choosing not to count. it doesn't fix the problem. lastly, the president has promised to veto all of the appropriations bills and the defense bill that are based on this flawed approach to the budget. so what we are doing here is ultimately not going to be successful until we come up with a better long-term solution to dealing with the budget caps, and i will simply emphasize one more time that has a profoundly negative effect on the department of defense, on our obligation to, i believe, properly fund and properly support the men and women who serve in our military. so, mr. chairman, while there is a lot of good in this bill, the ongoing budget uncertainty that it continues, i believe, is the fatal flaw in this bill. so i urge people to vote ``no.'' i do appreciate all the work and the effort that went into it. i also emphasize that this is but one step in the process. we have got a long way to go, and i am completely confident by the time we get to the end of it, we will have a national defense authorization act. it will be difficult. we have to work with the president, we have to work with the senate, and people have a lot of different opinions, but this is but the first step in the process. so, mr. chairman, i urge us to continue working to hopefully get a better product that can get the support of the house, the senate, and the president and fulfill our duty to pass this bill and support our troops. with that, i yield back the balance of my time. mr. thornberry. mr. chairman, i yield myself the balance of my time. mr. chairman, let me start with where the gentleman from washington left off, that this is one step in the process. that is kind of what i have been saying all along. earlier the gentleman said he is opposed to this bill because it locks in this oco approach. no, it doesn't lock anything in. if there is a better way to deal with our budget issues in the appropriation bills, then there is lots of time this year to do that. but the question here for the house is: will we vote against a defense authorization bill--not an appropriation bill--but a defense authorization bill and prevent it from moving a step ahead? as a matter of fact, mr. chairman, i hope all members had a chance to read the editorial in this morning's washington post. let me just read the last sentence of it: ``far better for him''--by which it means the president--``and his party's leadership in congress to help an adequate defense budget keep moving through congress rather than perpetuate a fight all americans, whether republican or democrat, may later regret.'' that is what we are asking here today: keep this adequate defense budget moving by voting for it. now, mr. chairman, that doesn't solve all the problems. the gentleman is exactly right. there are all sorts of appropriation bills and other things to come in this process. but to try to use this important bill and the authorities it gives as political leverage to somehow make that happen, i think, is not fair to the men and women who serve or to our country's security. mr. chairman, there are lots of things that affect the military that this bill does not solve. i admit it. i don't try to solve all of them. when you try to solve all the problems, you usually end up making a mess. but that should not take away from the good that is in this bill. so i want to just emphasize the good that is in this bill has come from both sides of the aisle, and i am incredibly grateful for the contributions the democratic members of the committee made. something like 110 provisions in the underlying mark were requested by democrats. in the committee 96 amendments offered by democrats were adopted into the mark. we have had 57 amendments offered by democrats made in order under the rule. we don't know how they are all going to come out yet, but the point is, a substantial part of this measure has been written and contributed to by members on the democratic side of the aisle, as well as members on the republican side of the aisle. the truth is it is a better product as a result, and the truth is that it is consistent with the bipartisan tradition of this committee. so, mr. chairman, i want to end, actually, where mr. smith started, and that is to express appreciation to him for being a terrific partner to work with in formulating this bill and dealing with very complex, rapidly changing subjects as the world is swirling around us. as he pointed out, we are the largest committee in congress--63 members. but each of those members on both sides of the aisle have made important contributions to this bill. i would, like him, also want to appreciate the staff. i think we are unique in the congress. we have an integrated staff where i can grab someone on the democratic side or a democratic member can grab someone who works on the republican side. they are all integrated, working on the same issues. i think that makes us stronger as a committee. so there is an important bipartisan tradition of this committee, and it is because national security is so important. let me go back to the washington post editorial and read the first sentence: ``there isn't much bipartisan governance left in washington, but if anything still fits that description, it is probably the annual defense authorization act.'' i am pleased about that. i think that is what the american people want to hear because national security is so important. so for the suggestion to come that we are going to put national security on the back burner while we try to solve all the budget problems of all the agencies and all the government, that is discouraging. mr. chairman, i hope that members will not agree with that tactic, that they will listen to the better angels of their nature as far as supporting this bill because it is a bipartisan bill that is so important for our troops and national security. i hope they will support this en bloc amendment. i yield back the balance of my time. mr. mccaul. mr. chair, i rise in strong support of the carter-rigell- mccaul-gohmert amendment to the national defense authorization act of fiscal year 2016 and in defense of our servicemembers' second amendment rights. twice my home state of texas has mourned the loss of our soldiers and civilians after shootings at fort hood just north of my district. in 2009, nidal hassan walked into fort hood's soldier readiness center, shouted ``allahu akbar'', and opened fire, killing 13 and wounding 42 others in the most horrific terrorist attack on u.s. soil since 9/11. five years later, another shooter opened fire on the base, killing four and wounding sixteen others. this is on top of other deadly attacks on military installations, such as the navy yard shooting in 2013, and the 2009 shooting at a recruiting center in little rock, arkansas, where another islamist radical killed one and wounded another. in each case, one has to wonder if something could have been done to stop the shooting sooner and to prevent more lives from being lost. for years, dod has had a stringent policy which prevents well-trained soldiers from carrying personal firearms on base in compliance with state and local laws. the carter-rigell-mccaul-gohmert amendment will responsibly adjust this policy and allow members of the armed forces to carry a concealed personal firearm if their commander determines it to be necessary as a personal or force protection measure. this is especially important at a time when threats to our soldiers and military bases is growing. in march, isis published a ``kill list'' of the names, photos and addresses of american soldiers. since then, the threat level at u.s. military bases increased to ``force protection bravo,'' in response to the increased threat of terrorism. mr. chair, we must give our base commanders more discretion and our soldiers more protection. thousands of my constituents in texas already exercise this right responsibly. it is time for our servicemembers to be allowed to do the same. the acting chair. the question is on the amendments en bloc offered by the gentleman from texas (mr. thornberry). the en bloc amendments were agreed to. announcement by the acting chair the acting chair. pursuant to clause 6 of rule xviii, proceedings

was agreed to. the acting chair. under the rule, the committee rises. accordingly, the committee rose; and the speaker pro tempore (mr. womack) having assumed the chair, mr. collins of georgia, acting

for military activities of the department of defense and for military construction, to prescribe military personnel strengths for such fiscal year, and for other purposes, and, pursuant to house resolution 260, he reported the bill back to the house with an amendment adopted in the committee of the whole. the speaker pro tempore. under the rule, the previous question is ordered. is a separate vote demanded on any amendment to the amendment reported from the committee of the whole? if not, the question is on the amendment in the nature of a substitute, as amended. the amendment was agreed to. the speaker pro tempore. the question is on the engrossment and third reading of the bill. the bill was ordered to be engrossed and read a third time, and was read the third time. motion to recommit mr. gallego. mr. speaker, i have a motion to recommit at the desk. the speaker pro tempore. is the gentleman opposed to the bill? mr. gallego. yes, i am opposed. the speaker pro tempore. the clerk will report the motion to recommit. the clerk read as follows: mr. gallego moves to recommit the bill h.r. 1735 to the committee on armed services with instructions to report the same back to the house forthwith, with the following amendment: at the end of subtitle a of title vi, add the following new section: sec. 6__. guaranteeing a pay increase for members of the uniformed services and no lapse in pay caused by a government shutdown. (a) increase in basic pay.--as provided in section 1009 of title 37, united states code, and effective on january 1, 2016, the increase for fiscal year 2016 in the rates of monthly basic pay authorized for members of the uniformed services shall be 2.3 percent. (b) response to lapse in appropriations.--the secretary of defense shall take all steps necessary to ensure that members of the army, navy, air force, and marine corps continue to receive compensation for their service in defense of the united states despite any lapse in appropriations after september 30, 2015. mr. gallego. mr. speaker, this is the final amendment to the bill. it will not delay the bill, kill the bill, or send it back to committee. if adopted, the bill will proceed immediately to final passage, as amended. as members of congress, we must always honor our promises to the men and women who serve in our military. unfortunately, i know firsthand what happens when washington fails our troops on the battlefield and when we come home. i fought the iraq war on the ground. i was shot at and experienced ied attacks, but because congress didn't follow through on its promises, our vehicles didn't have the proper armor they needed. this failure cost my friends their lives. later, when i got home, my friends and i suffered needlessly. when my friends and i got home, we suffered needlessly because of a veterans healthcare system that was shortchanged and mismanaged. these failures of leadership are what encouraged me to run for office, to ensure that my generation of leaders takes better care of our troops than we were taken care of. that is why i am offering this amendment. it is to make good on congress' promise to give our military men and women a raise. the amendment will lock in a 2.3 percent increase for all of our soldiers, sailors, airmen, and marines. last year, one in four members of our military had to rely on food pantries and other charities just to make ends meet. that is a disgrace. mr. speaker, our troops deserve a raise. my amendment does something else that is just as important. it ensures that even if congress shuts down the federal government, all of our brave men and women in uniform will still get paid. why should our servicemen and -women miss their paychecks just because we can't do our jobs? [[page h3234]] why am i offering this amendment now? because republicans don't appear to have learned the lessons of the chaos and confusion they caused by shutting down the government in 2013. today, my republican friends are risking another government shutdown by resorting to budget gimmicks, relying on war funding to pay for more routine operations and maintenance. that is completely irresponsible. my republican friends are fond of comparing the federal budget to a family budget. mr. speaker, working families, military families can't rely on a special slush fund to pay for their daily expenses, and congress should not either. we must protect our troops from the consequences of this republican leadership's refusal to confront the realities of sequestration. that is why this amendment is so critical. yesterday, speaker boehner said voting against this bill would be shameful and that we would be turning our back on our troops. as a marine and a combat veteran, i can tell you that the speaker is wrong. there is no shame in voting against a bill that creates uncertainty for our military and risks another dangerous government shutdown. mr. speaker, the real shame would be to vote against the amendment that gives our men and women the raise and certainty they deserve. i yield back the balance of my time. mr. thornberry. mr. chairman, i rise in opposition to the motion. the speaker pro tempore. the gentleman from texas is recognized for 5 minutes. mr. thornberry. mr. speaker, let me start by saying i very much appreciate the service of mr. gallego and all the veterans on both sides of the aisle who have served our nation. i appreciate all of the contributions mr. gallego and all the other 62 members of the committee have made into producing this national defense authorization act. it has been a bipartisan product in the tradition of this committee. you know, if you think about it, for 53 straight years congresses of both parties have passed and presidents of both parties have signed into law a defense authorization act, and that has been true through vietnam and the cold war and 9/11. it has been true through watergate and race riots, and economic recessions and bitter political feuds. {time} 1045 and yet, through all those things, somehow the parties could come together to do what was needed for our troops and for our country's security. i think that that strong tradition of bipartisanship is something that we should not walk away from lightly. we have heard some discussion--complaints, really--on both sides of the aisle about using oco to get up to the president's level. if you look at this chart, this is the president's budget, and this is the congressional budget, which this bill is compliant with. there is a little difference in where the light blue and the dark blue start and stop. but the net effect, when you add it all together, is exactly the same: $612 billion. that is what the president asked for. that is what this bill provides. there is no difference between the two. i agree that we ought to find a better way to have fiscal discipline without the arbitrary caps and sequestration that are in the budget control act, but this bill can't do that. this bill is a defense authorization bill. it is not a budget bill. it is not an immigration bill. it is not even a defense appropriation bill. so if this bill fails, how does that get us closer to fixing our budget problems? the truth is we could all find an excuse to vote against every bill, every day, for what is not in it, but that doesn't make a lot of sense. what is important is what is in it. and what is in it is really important for our troops and for our national security. as much as i appreciate congressman gallego's service, i find it ironic that he would offer an amendment that tries to make sure our troops get paid, even in the event of a government shutdown; and yet, by voting against this bill, the troops don't get paid. how does that fit together? let me just mention two of the things that are in this bill for our troops. one is a new retirement system for people who sign up for the military. right now, 83 percent of the people who serve come away with no retirement. under this bill, they can put some money aside, the government will match it, and they can have a nest egg. if you vote against that bill, that doesn't happen. one of the complaints we have all heard so many times is that the transition from active duty to the va is problematic because you can't stay on the same drugs. one of the things this bill does is say that they have got to have a joint formulary so you stay on the same drugs and you can take better care of the people as they transition. doesn't that make sense? i hope all members had a chance to read the washington post editorial today. let me just read the last sentence: far better for the president and his party's leadership in congress to help an adequate defense budget keep moving through congress rather than perpetuate a fight all americans, whether republican or democrat, may later regret. i think that is the bottom line. this doesn't solve all the problems. it doesn't try to solve all the problems. i know we have got more debate, more discussion to come, but this is a step on what has been a very bipartisan bill. mr. speaker, here is the bottom line. we are incredibly privileged to have these jobs, to live in this country, but those privileges only come because brave men and women are willing to volunteer to serve and sacrifice for our country. now, we can never match their courage and dedication and sacrifice, but surely to goodness we can do better than use them as pawns for some sort of attempt to apply political pressure on issues that have nothing to do with this bill. surely we can do better than that. and the way to do better than that is to vote against this motion and for final passage. i yield back the balance of my time. the speaker pro tempore. without objection, the previous question is ordered on the motion to recommit. there was no objection. the speaker pro tempore. the question is on the motion to recommit. the question was taken; and the speaker pro tempore announced that the noes appeared to have it. recorded vote mr. gallego. mr. speaker, i demand a recorded vote. a recorded vote was ordered. the speaker pro tempore. pursuant to clause 8 and clause 9 of rule xx, this 5-minute vote on the motion to recommit will be followed 5- minutes votes on passage of h.r. 1735, if ordered;

Mr. LABRADOR. Mr. Speaker, I come to the floor today on Peace Officers Memorial Day to acknowledge and honor the life and service of Coeur d'Alene Police Sergeant Greg Moore. Sergeant Moore was shot and killed in the line of duty on May 5, 2015. Sergeant Moore's 12-year-old son Dylon wrote these words to honor his father: My dad was the best. He would tell me anything and was always there for me. All the times I was sad or lonely, he would be right by my side to comfort me. Dad would also reassure me that he was okay going to work by telling me he was Batman because he worked at night, had lots of gadgets, was skilled and charming. Also, wherever we went, he would know someone that was there. I would always wonder how and why he knew those people. Dad's favorite place to eat was Qdoba. It ended up being my favorite place as well. He was a Boston fan, and he has gone to a couple of games, but I know he would have liked to see more. Every day, though, almost like tradition, we would wrestle on the ground and try to beat each other. I've only won once, but I have learned so many things from him. I love him so much because he was a good dad, always helping people, and I want everyone to know that he is the best. He was the best. Sergeant Moore, rest in peace. Mr. Speaker, I come to the floor to day on Peace Officers Memorial Day to acknowledge and honor the life and service of Coeur d'Alene Police Sergeant Greg Moore. Sergeant Moore was shot and killed in the line of duty May 5, 2015. Gregory King Moore was born in Walla Walla, Washington; he attended Walla Walla High School and Walla Walla Community College before moving to Idaho to attend the University of Idaho. After graduating from the University of Idaho he joined the Asotin County Sheriff's Department before transferring to the Coeur d'Alene Police Department. During his tenure at the Coeur d'Alene Police Department he served as a Patrol Officer, Field Training Officer, and School Resource Officer. I did not have the pleasure of knowing Sergeant Moore personally. But the outpouring of support from his community tells me much about his character and service. More than 4,000 people attended his funeral, including officers from across Idaho, as well as Washington, Montana and Canada. This outpouring of support warmed my heart and reminded me of the goodness of the people of Idaho. I hope this public support was comforting to Sergeant Moore's family. Sergeant Moore's 12-year-old son Dylon wrote these words to honor his father. ``My dad was the best. He would tell me anything, and was always there for me.

Coeur d'Alene Police Chief Lee White said ``Greg was part of a proud profession, and an even prouder police department. Greg did things right. He was a leader, he was a supervisor, and he was not satisfied sitting at a desk. In the end, and the reason we're here today, is that he personified the oath that we take when we raise our right hand and we're sworn in. Greg was killed protecting the life and property and way of life of the citizens of Coeur d'Alene, Idaho. He will never be forgotten.'' Throughout Idaho hundreds of vehicles are now displaying a decal that reads K27 in honor of Sergeant Moore's call number. I would like to add my voice to those that honored Sergeant Moore by closing with phrase that had passed over the lips of those thousands who have honored Sergeant Moore over the past week. K27 rest in peace. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 75 (Friday, May 15, 2015)] [House] [Page H3237] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] HONORING THE LIFE AND SERVICE OF COEUR D'ALENE POLICE SERGEANT GREG MOORE (Mr. LABRADOR asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)

I love him so much because he was a good dad, always helping people. And I want everyone to know that he is the best.'' Coeur d'Alene Police Chief Lee White said ``Greg was part of a proud profession, and an even prouder police department. Greg did things right. He was a leader, he was a supervisor, and he was not satisfied sitting at a desk. In the end, and the reason we're here today, is that he personified the oath that we take when we raise our right hand and we're sworn in. Greg was killed protecting the life and property and way of life of the citizens of Coeur d'Alene, Idaho. He will never be forgotten.'' Throughout Idaho hundreds of vehicles are now displaying a decal that reads K27 in honor of Sergeant Moore's call number. I would like to add my voice to those that honored Sergeant Moore by closing with phrase that had passed over the lips of those thousands who have honored Sergeant Moore over the past week.

With a 5-1 victory over Coral Reef on Saturday, the Wolves secured their first State title in the history of Newsome High. In the championship game, the Wolves were led by lockdown pitching and power hitting from Cassidy Davis, a clutch performance in relief from Claire Feldman, and runs from Maddy Lyn, Hannah Pridemore, and Livia Chandler. The Wolves worked hard all year, playing a tough schedule in Hillsborough County. That helped them prepare for the playoffs, and it showed them and their opponents that they had what it takes to win it all.

Under the Speaker's announced policy of January 6, 2015, the gentleman from California (Mr. Rohrabacher) is recognized for 60 minutes as the designee of the majority leader. Mr. ROHRABACHER. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Conaway), my very good friend. Repeal the Oil Export Ban Mr. CONAWAY. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from California for yielding. This may not be the topic that he is going to talk about here, but I appreciate the time to be able to talk to something that is important to the folks of west Texas and is actually important to all Americans. I rise today to bring attention to an important issue that is gathering nationwide support, that is, repealing the export ban on crude oil. This week, I submitted an amendment to the National Defense Authorization Act that would, in fact, repeal the ban. While the amendment did not ultimately make it into the final bill, I would like to take a moment to talk about the importance of lifting that ban. First, let's remember why the export ban was placed into law to begin with. Because of the OPEC oil embargo of 1973, Congress enacted the Energy Policy and Conservation Act, directing the President to ban crude oil exports. At the time, the ban served a purpose: to keep our oil at home in order to reduce our exposure to the wildly fluctuating markets of that time. Today, though, the ban has outlived its purpose. It is an antiquated policy that is now only serving to harm Americans and punish domestic production. For example, right now we allow Iran to export more oil from their country than we do from our own domestic producers. This is wrongheaded and is long overdue for a change. The ban should be lifted, while leaving in place the necessary authorities to allow the President to act in an emergency and while preserving our Strategic Petroleum Reserve. Some claim that gasoline prices would increase if the ban is lifted, but analysis shows that to be incorrect. It shows that prices will actually fall, reducing the cost of the product that American families rely on every single day, which is another reason to support lifting the ban. In 2013, the United States was the number one oil producing nation in the world, surpassing Saudi Arabia and Russia, a fact that many thought impossible only a decade ago. Taking advantage of our Nation's abundant resources by lifting the ban will, in fact, lower gasoline prices, create dependable, long- lasting jobs, and help expand our energy supply, making our Nation more energy independent. I urge my colleagues to listen to the growing voice of the American people. It is time to lift the export ban on crude oil. Mr. ROHRABACHER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to warn my colleagues and [[Page H3239]] the American people of several threats to their safety and their prosperity. These threats are observable from Washington, D.C., but may not be observable to the American people. So I ask my colleagues to pay attention, number one, to what we are doing here, but I also would ask the American people to pay attention to what we are doing here. There are changes being maneuvered through our legislative branch and being mandated by executive orders from President Obama that will undermine the economic well-being of hard-working Americans and put us in jeopardy as a nation, both economically and in terms of our national security. Those pursuing these egregious policy initiatives are fulfilling President Obama's pledge to change America. And what most Americans believed was a commitment to make our country better, to change America, was, in reality, an elitist and, I believe, an arrogant pledge to dramatically alter the basic and fundamental institutions and values that have been thought of by our patriots to be the essential elements defining our country and, of course, ensuring our freedom, security, and prosperity. What are these threats that I talk about? What are these threats that we need to pay attention to? They are not coming from one political party. They are not coming from the Republicans or the Democrats, as a party. You can see support across the board on both sides of the aisle on various sides of these issues. It is also not a threat just stemming from one person or one political leader, but it is, of course, what we are talking about. This threat is coming from a very powerful coalition seeking profit for themselves, even if it impoverishes the people or diminishes, at least, the economic well-being of the people of the United States. Ironically, people who are enjoying their freedom and people who are enjoying their relative prosperity don't pay attention to some of the very intricate matters that have come before us in Congress. But I can assure all of my fellow Americans, there are powerful interests who are paying attention, and they are doing what they best can do to manipulate the law in a way that will enhance their profits, even if it is being done at the expense of the well-being of the American people. We can see this in dramatic changes that are being suggested in something that probably is very boring and tame to most Americans when they even hear that someone is going to even talk about patent law-- patent law, which is the legal structure that enforces an inventor's right to own and control the product of his or her genius, labor, and investment for a given period of time. So I say, of course, that sounds pretty mundane, patent law. Is it some detailed, intricate regulation and control of this area of economic life, of jobs, and things that we do in America? Well, it is more than that. It may sound mundane; but, in reality, patent law and the patent rights of our people--the right of our people to own the technology they have created for a specific period of time-- has been a significant determinant in our country's way of life, our country's quality of life, and the security of our Nation. This intellectual property right, the right through a patent ownership of 17 years' control and--not only of 17 years of control, but also of profit from one's own inventions, has been vital to our well-being as a nation and an essential part of the American Dream. Let's note that this was a right that was written into the Constitution by our Founding Fathers. People know about the Bill of Rights. But the word ``right'' was only used in the body of the Constitution once, and that was a section that guaranteed that Americans--that what Congress should do is to make sure that Americans were guaranteed the right to control their own creations, if they are inventors or writers, for a given period of time, to profit from it so that they would have incentives to come up and be the most creative people in the world. {time} 1130 Our Founding Fathers believed that technology and freedom would uplift ordinary Americans and give all Americans a chance at a decent life. And they were right. They wrote that into the Constitution. It is right there. I believe it probably was under the influence of my favorite Founding Father, Benjamin Franklin. What we have to recognize is that over the years of our country, what has made us a great nation is our freedom and technology. This is especially true for minority Americans and especially of Black Americans. Let me note that Black Americans, if you take a look at the history of our patent system, are disproportionately inventive. In the history of this country, actually, as a proportion of their population, our Black Americans have been more inventive than any other group in our country. Why is that? Because patent law and property law were considered a constitutional right, and this was in the one area in which Black Americans were not discriminated against once they were freed in 1860 to 1865, when our Black citizens were freed. After that we found that more patents proportionately went to that community because they needed an opportunity to uplift themselves free from outside forces beating down on them and denying their rights. Mr. Speaker, our patent system and the patents granted by Washington thus respected the rights of all of our citizens, including our minority citizens. Thus, making sure that we have patent protection has been one of the great boons to our minority populations, who otherwise suffered great discrimination and suffered from a lack of rights, except for the property rights that come from inventions. We see this has been good not just for minority Americans however. Let me note that we have, with technology, enhanced the ability of our people to work hard and get the job done and thus create wealth that was then owned by a large number of people rather than an elite. Of course, when people understand the importance of technology--and business has more and more come to the understanding that it is new technology that will give them leverage and control over wealth. There has been an ongoing attempt in these last 20 years to dramatically diminish the patent protection enjoyed by Americans, the patent protection written right into our Constitution. The fact is that, for the last 20 years, I have been personally engaged along with a small group of people who believe that technology and freedom are essential to the well-being of our country. Marcy Kaptur of Ohio and others have beat back many of these attempts to diminish the patent protection of our citizens. Mr. Speaker, America does have a patent system now. It is the strongest in the world. It is the strongest patent system in the world. We have always been proud of that. We have been proud that it has resulted in the fact that ordinary people have high standards of living here and they earn a good living from work because their work is enhanced by technological superiority over their competitors. By the way, Mr. Speaker, people work hard all over the world. Everybody works hard. In all of these countries they work hard like our people work hard, but they don't have the technology that enhances their work and amplifies their energy and hard work so that more wealth is created. We have encouraged that since the day our Constitution was ratified. That is why our people, when they work hard, end up living better because it gives us a competitive edge over the slave and oppressed labor in other countries. We, in fact, of course, know that the prosperity of average Americans to us and to our Founding Fathers was an important goal. It wasn't just we were going to have a country that worked, but it was going to be a system with respect for rights that would lead to a good and decent living for all of us, for all the people, and not just a small elite of businessmen. Well, we have done this over the years, and it has worked well. We have not had to have our own people who do work hard having to compete in terms of muscular and use of their physiques in order to produce goods, services, and wealth. They had the technology that permitted them to outcompete those other countries. Also, Mr. Speaker, it ensures we have a more secure country. Having a strong patent system where people are encouraged to invent new things and to be innovative has given us the edge over people who would do harm to our country. It has been important to our national security because we can't take [[Page H3240]] on adversaries that don't respect human rights. If America was trying to secure itself from threats from groups of people around the world, leaders and gangsters who have no respect for human rights whatsoever, we lose because they are willing to lose all of their people, and they are willing for any amount of bloodshed to maintain control and power and, yes, to beat the United States and democratic countries. Instead, Mr. Speaker, we have had technology at work helping defend our country, technology that would not have existed had we not had the patent protection that has been traditional to our country. Even look today what is happening. Without drones, where would we be? Without drones fighting the good fight against ISIL, we would have to have thousands of Americans there to fight that threat to mankind and the freedom of the world. Instead, we have joined with the forces in Erbil, which is the Kurds, in standing tough directly against this onslaught of radical Islam, and they are holding firm. But without our drones there to help them, they would be overrun. So this idea of property ownership of technology, of your technological developments, has been heart and soul to a prosperous and secure America. So when I say there are changes being proposed here in Congress, they are trying to manipulate through the system that will affect the prosperity of the average American and the security of our Nation. The public and my fellow colleagues need to pay attention because we are again facing a major onslaught, an attack on this fundamental right of technology ownership by those who create that technology. We are facing an onslaught that is being what? Being masterminded, being masterminded and being pushed by megamultinational corporations who are not operating in the interests of the people of the United States. They could care less about all of that. But they are operating after what they can do to enrich themselves, even if it is not in the interests of the people of the United States and the interests of our security. These megamultinational corporations have pumped millions upon millions of dollars into lobbying for changes in our patent system that diminish the rights of the inventor and enables these multinational corporations to steal the intellectual property of our inventors and use it without giving compensation to the owners. This is in direct contradiction to what the Constitution meant to guarantee and why it was written directly into the body of the Constitution that this was a right that Americans should be concerned about. Mr. Speaker, for the last 20 years there has been a stealth attack on America's strong and effective patent system. Let us note that we have had the strongest and the most effective and recognized fair patent system in the world. All other patent systems have been judged against us, and now we have had these last 20 years an insidious undermining, and we are on the edge of a huge attack and perhaps successful destruction of fundamental patent rights that have been part of our people for many years. For example, 20 years ago, shortly after I came here, I found that in the GATT--that is a trade treaty that we have--there were provisions that were snuck into the GATT implementation legislation. That is legislation we passed here in Congress in order to implement a trade agreement. These big corporate interests had put into the GATT implementation legislation without telling anybody two provisions that would have dramatically hurt the small inventors in this country. Up until now, the Constitution actually says that the inventors and the writers are guaranteed a specific time where they will control. They will be granted a specific time where they will control their patent, the rights to their patent, and the rights of their creative genius. Well, it has traditionally been that once you file, as soon as the patent is actually granted to the inventor, then the clock starts ticking, and you get 17 years of protection. In different parts of the world, that is not what the law has been. In Japan and in Europe, it has been, oh, no, once you apply, after 20 years, even if it takes you 10 or 15 years to get your patent or 19 years, no, the clock is ticking then. You may not be granted your patent for 19 years, and then you have 1 year left, and that is no patent protection at all. So now they are trying to foist that on us. By the way, that would give people, knowing the clock is ticking--those small inventors in other countries are faced by people who are trying to pressure them to accept lesser claims to the legitimacy of their patent in order to basically prevent these guys, men and women, from being compensated the way they would be if they had a guaranteed term, which is part of our Constitution. Mr. Speaker, the other provision that was there 20 years ago was the 18-month publication demand. That is, after 18 months, when someone applies for a patent--now, it is that once someone applies for a patent, that patent application is absolutely secret until that patent is granted. Unless you have a patent in your hand--then it is published for the world because their ownership has been established. Well, that has been traditionally what our Patent Office and our patent protection has been. Basically, you have a secret and you developed it, you give it to the Patent Office. In fact, if anybody leaked that information, up until this point it has been a felony for anybody to tell anyone else until that patent is actually granted to the inventor. Well, Mr. Speaker, they want to change this and say, if you haven't been granted your patent within 18 months, it will be published for the whole world. Think about that. Think about what I am saying. Before, for our entire country's history, we have made sure that an application is secret so that nobody can get ahead of the inventor himself and the inventor won't be put in a bad spot. We made sure that until the patent is granted it is secret. They want to change that so that after 18 months it is published. What if that patent takes 10 years to issue? That means the man or woman who invented this piece of technology, our competitors overseas will be able to use it for all of that time because they will know all about it, but the patent hasn't been granted to the inventor yet. {time} 1145 I called that the ``Steal American Technologies Act.'' That is what they were trying to do. That is what it would result in, and keep that in mind. The large multinationals sought to weaken the ability of our inventors to enforce patent rights. Why? Why do they want these big companies here in the United States? Well, mostly, they are multinational companies now--they are big guys--and what they want to do is steal from the little guy--surprise, surprise. The big guys would try to manipulate the creation of law here that will enable them to take something from some person who has less economic power than themselves. Our constitutional rights are supposed to protect the little guy's rights. We believe the newspaper should be able to be published, but little guys should be able to print a mimeographed piece of information themselves and distribute it or to gather. Actually, what is hard for me to imagine is that, if these big guys were actually trying to diminish the rights of religion or speech in this country, or assembly, there would be an outcry; but, because it is the rights to own technology that you have created for a given period of time--it sounds too confusing, and they have let this feeling that maybe the people can't understand it, so they don't pay attention--they have let that lack of attention give them an opening to destroy and undermine the rights of Americans, and I think this right is every bit as important as those other rights of religion and speech, et cetera. What they have set up in these last 20 years, it is an ongoing David versus Goliath because some of the biggest corporations in the world are behind the effort to change the patent law. Well, we beat them back. As I say, there was a coalition of us-- Democrat and Republican, Marcy Kaptur. We had some very good support from the Black Caucus. I might add that, again, they recognized how important inventions have been to the Black community; but we beat them back. It was a bipartisan coalition. We have had to, over the years, compromise and negotiate certain things, but they have not gotten their way; but every time they have tried--they [[Page H3241]] have tried to overwhelm those of us who are preventing the diminishing of patent rights--they have had to use scare tactics, always claiming that there is a boogeyman, there is a boogeyman out there, and that is the reason why we have to attack the inventor, because there is something out there that is really threatening and it is sinister and it is a sinister force that has to be defeated, that is why we have to take away all of the rights of the inventors over here, because they have now tried to tell the story in a way. It is the equivalent of saying we are going to take away the rights of every American to sue someone--or a company or anyone else who has caused them damage--because there are frivolous lawsuits. Yes, there are frivolous lawsuits. There are some people who misuse our legal system. The last thing we want to do is eliminate the rights of all Americans to use the court system to protect their rights. That is basically what is going on here. Our own cherished patent rights to own what you have created--and this constitutional right that was given to Americans--is on the verge of being dramatically altered and diminished and destroyed. By the way, the first boogeyman that was used in order to try to gain support for these very same two items that they snuck in the GATT, the boogeyman was called the submarine patentors. Submarine patents--that is all you heard about before--as if a person who was filing for a patent was a submarine patentor. Everybody has got to lose their patent rights in order to get the submarine patentor. What was the submarine patentor? A submarine patentor was--their definition--someone who files for a patent and then does everything they can to delay the patent from being issued; and then, after years and years, the patent is finally granted, and they have got all this leverage on all the people who have used the technology in the meantime. Well, I am sorry; there were very few submarine patentors--there were some--but the fact is most inventors were struggling to get their patents issued to them as soon as possible because they needed the money, especially the little guys needed the money, and they were struggling, ``Please, give us the patent so we can move forward on this,'' but, no, they were being presented as if they were trying to slow down the process. Well, we finally, after really fighting for 10 years on this, reached the compromise, which my chief of staff, Rick Dykema, and myself negotiated, along with Marcy Kaptur, who negotiated this agreement with us, that if, indeed, there is a patent applicant who uses his abilities or uses various powers that he has in the bureaucratic process to delay the issue of the patent, well, if that happens, then, indeed, that patent, the time, the clock, has to start ticking against that guy, so he is using his own time when it has not been issued. Well, that solved the problem--there it was--without diminishing the rights of those people who were struggling to get their patents out, but took 10 years or 15 years to get the patent issued. That wasn't a hard thing to negotiate, a hard thing to do, but it was a hard thing to accomplish because the people who were pushing submarine patents were really trying to diminish the patent rights of all Americans so that they could steal from little guys and could take away their patent rights basically as soon as possible. Well, now, the current boogeyman is the patent troll. Now, there are some people who misuse and have frivolous lawsuits who use the patent system. There is no doubt about it. I might add this idea that people will be sent a thing--you are violating my patent, you either give my $5,000, or I am going to sue you, and then small businesses go along with it--there have been court cases now that have taken care of that. Obviously, that is a swindle and something we can't put up with; that was happening to a degree, but there is no excuse, as I say, to eliminate the rights of all Americans because somebody abuses a right. That is not what is acceptable. The patent troll is being used as a straw man. We are going to have legislation that will get this guy who has these frivolous lawsuits and is creating such havoc among small-business men and ripping them off. Just like the submarine patents, that can be taken care of without eliminating the patent rights of our people. What we have now is the straw man, the patent troll. When you hear a debate on this issue, all you will hear is patent troll, patent troll, patent troll, not recognizing that every provision in this bill diminishes--it is H.R. 9 that is before our Judiciary Committee now-- every provision makes it more difficult for the small inventor to enforce his patent against infringement by future megacorporations. Guess who is pushing this legislation? Huge megacorporations who want that little guy not to be able to sue a corporation that has stolen his intellectual property rights--this is basically--but they are going to say: Oh, no, it is the troll we are after, the troll. Well, as I say, there have been frivolous lawsuits, and there have been changes made in the judicial system itself of how to handle that, but there is no excuse for a troll--for this word ``troll,'' a straw man--get him to be used to damage and destroy the rights of the 95 percent of the technology creators in our country, take away their rights to get this straw man. Well, let me tell you how the word ``troll'' came about, the word ``patent troll.'' That is the reason you are hearing it. Every time you hear somebody say it, remember this. A group of corporate elitists got in a circle in a room--I know because one of the people who was in that meeting switched sides and came over and disclosed that these corporate executives said: What can we do to make it sound so sinister that we can get this passed? What words can we come up with that will just basically create such a bad feeling that the American people will not recognize that what we are really doing is trying to get the small inventor and make sure that the small inventor cannot sue us for things that we are using? Okay. They went around the room. This friend, the fellow who told me about this meeting, said: I came up with the words ``patent pirate,'' and then, by the time it got around the circle, somebody came up with the words ``patent troll.'' They said: That is it. That sounds so horrible, we can distract everybody's attention using that, and that is good enough. That sounds so evil that we can make sure that we go into battle using that in front of us, instead of we want to diminish the patent rights of honest, hard-working inventors who deserve to have a profit from their creation of their technology. That is just how cynical this debate has been. Every provision of H.R. 9--a bill now sitting in the Judiciary Committee--prevents--makes it more difficult for an inventor to actually enforce his rights and sue a company that is trying to steal, use his property rights, intellectual property rights, without compensating him. Let me give you an example of something in the bill and the changes they are proposing. Now, they are changing to loser pays legal fees. If you have a small inventor and if he sues that company and it is a huge company, that is usually what he has created and making profit from it, if he sues them and he loses, he will have to pay the legal fees for that huge company. Now, for the huge company, that is almost nothing. Taking on a case of one guy is nothing in their expense account because they have got 100 lawyers in a stable, waiting to help and being paid for. Well, if the inventor loses, that is it for him. That alone is wrong. In this legislation, H.R. 9, they have added another little proviso to destroy the small inventor; and that is, if someone invests in his invention, if someone invests in the invention and he manages to be successful and comes up with a new piece of technology and he is granted the patent and some megacorporation comes along and incorporates it and uses it and refuses to give this guy even a small payment for using the technology that he created, his intellectual property rights, if someone has invested in that inventor to help him make the invention, let's say that, when that inventor goes up to battle Goliath in his megacorporation, and let's say, even though he is right, he loses--because that happens sometimes in our country many times, where some people with a great number [[Page H3242]] of very sophisticated lawyers against the little guy, the little guy sometimes loses--well, what is going to happen now, according to this bill, is anyone who has invested in the inventor is going to have to be liable for the legal fees that come out of that suit. Who is ever going to give an investment to an inventor if that may open them up to liability? It is a liability, I might add, to some megacorporation, megamultinational corporation. Well, this provision just demonstrates what is the purpose of that provision. The provision is to beat down the little guy so that the big guys can steal, and that is evident, very evident; yet this bill is still moving forward. It is H.R. 9. It is in the Judiciary Committee now. As I say, H.R. 9 is the equivalent of saying: Because there are frivolous lawsuits, we are going to do everything we can to diminish the power of ordinary citizens to use the law and legal lawsuits for compensation for damages done to them. {time} 1200 Every provision of the bill weakens the right of the inventor to enforce his or her own patents. This bill actually passed the House last year. We struggled against it here in the House, but what happens is 90 percent of the people here in this body are just so busy that it is hard to pay attention to something that seems mundane like a patent law, and they just can't get themselves to focus on it. The American people also think that issues like this are so complicated that they can't get involved, but that leaves the whole playing field open to huge corporations that are out to enrich themselves by basically structuring law in a way that the power and the wealth will flow to them. Supposedly, the system our Founding Fathers wanted was for the wealth to flow broadly across our country so that every American could benefit from new technologies and new wealth that was being created. Now they want to corral that wealth; they want to diminish our rights in order to enrich themselves. These companies are not companies that are loyal to the United States. They are being loyal to their own profits, and some of them are multinational corporations that have actually no ties, real ties, to the United States. Let me just suggest that this bill did pass the House last year, but it was stopped in the Senate because, by then, we had made so much noise here. As I say, a bipartisan group, led by myself, Marcy Kaptur from Ohio, Mr. Massie from Kentucky, and other very strong activists, got together, and we made so much noise that the American universities finally paid attention because that bill that lets people steal patent rights was a huge threat to our university system. Had it been signed into law, the value of patents would have gone down dramatically. Let me go back to how that works. Remember, we were talking about a troll. What their definition of ``troll'' is is anybody who buys the patent rights from someone who has invented something and has a patent but who doesn't have the money to enforce it. Anybody who actually buys the patent rights but is not aiming at commercializing it himself and is going to enforce that and make a profit from it, that is going to be what they are stamping out. The universities are not there to commercialize what they are doing. They are there to basically have new discoveries, and they realize they have got a lot of patents that they own as part of their portfolios and that the actual values of those patent collections by the universities would have dramatically gone down. As well, of course, the patent value of any American would have gone down at that point. Also, other industries that are really important industries to our well-being--PhRMA and others, biotech industries--which struggle hard to come up with one patent that they then can sell in the market, are totally undermined by this effort to weaken our patent system. We managed to mobilize those people, and we stopped it the last time around; but the multinational corporations behind this legislation are so arrogant that this bill is now going to be shoved through again. This time, I think, with the American people, we can actually stop it here in the House, and we can certainly stop it in the Senate. We need the American people to mobilize and to call their Congressmen and ask: How do you stand on this terrible patent bill, H.R. 9? We need people who are going to stand up for the little guy in America, not for some megacorporation that is trying to permit the theft of American intellectual property rights by multinational corporations. Whether or not we succeed this time around is going to depend on, yes, the people here who understand the issue, fighting it out, being as aggressive as we can be, and the American people mobilizing to make sure we protect our sacred rights granted in the Constitution. One of the most important, I believe to be, is the right of technology ownership to people who create that technology. As I say, there are powerful interest groups in this city and in our country and in the world that try to change policy and are manipulating government. That is clear. That is fine. We have a democratic process. We just need to make sure that we are all being held accountable--that all of the Members of the House and the Senate are accountable for their votes--and that we know and the public at least has the chance to know what we are voting on. Actually, there is something happening right now where that is not true at all, and I sure hope the American people are paying attention to what is going on here in Washington concerning what they call TPP, the trade promotion pact, and then there is the TPA, which gives trade promotion authority to the Trans-Pacific Partnership, which is a trade treaty with the nations around the Pacific. The sinister nature of this can be seen because this trade treaty with the Pacific nations is secret. It has been declared classified. Right now, if I had gone down and read what now exists of this trade treaty and if I had announced it here on the floor, I would have been violating secrecy restrictions that they have declared--how about this?--in a policy about trade with major countries of the world, which will have an enormous impact on our well-being. It is being kept totally secret from the American people. How is that? Then they say Members of Congress can go down and look at it if they want to. Of course, as they have said, you can only do it within a certain time. They have regulated the time we can go down, and we are so busy that almost no Members of Congress will have gone down and read the actual documents that explain what that trade policy is that they are trying to foist on us. Please, I hope the American people understand that Members of Congress should not be voting on things that, number one, they don't have access to, but we should not be voting on something if we have not permitted the American people to know what that is. You will remember the famous statement by Ms. Pelosi about ObamaCare, which was that we have to pass it in order to find out what is in it. That is totally unacceptable. In trade treaties, these things will now pass rules and regulations based on this treaty that will impact our way of life here. Now, we have been briefed on it. I am on the Foreign Affairs Committee, and we were briefed on this the other day. The two main administration guys there--the people who had been Ambassadors and who are currently with the State Department--were briefing us. It is just like the boogey words over here, the scare words, in terms of patents. Now, this is all being used in just the opposite way with every glorious word--higher income for our people, more competitive for America, and all of the trade will come in our direction. Yet, when I asked these briefers, ``Hey, have you read this treaty?'' neither one of them had read it. So the people advocating for this treaty have not even read the treaty themselves. I found a provision in the treaty, or at least I understand it is in there--I have not verified it yet because we have all of this trouble to go through to verify what we are being asked to support--that says that patents in the United States will basically have to be published after 18 months. If a patent application is made and if after 18 months the patent is not granted, the patent will be published for the whole world to see. Uh-huh. Does that sound familiar? They tried to put that over on us 20 years ago. We managed to [[Page H3243]] thwart it then, and now they want to sneak it into a treaty, and the American people are not permitted to know what is in the treaty. Will that hurt us in some way? It will only make all of our technological discoveries available for our competitors overseas to be using long before the patent is even granted to the American inventor. You see what type of sinister forces we are up against. Who can sit down here and say how wonderful this treaty is going to be when the American people aren't allowed to see it and when almost all of us have not read it and when our briefers who come here have not even read it? I asked them yesterday, these briefers, ``Well, is this in the treaty?'' They didn't know. They didn't know whether or not this provision on patents was in there, which would undermine our rights to control our own creations here and have our opponents and our competitors overseas have all of the information about our technology even before the patent is granted. They didn't even know that was in there. They didn't know if it was or if it wasn't. By the way, if I had gone down and had finally gotten through the maze and had read the actual wording in the treaty, I would have been required not to have mentioned it today on the House floor as we are being restricted because it has been declared secret from the American people. This is outrageous. We don't need to have a trade promotion authority that will keep things from the American people, and we don't need to have a trade treaty with the Pacific and with all of these nations in Asia that will open us up to having our technology stolen, but also we don't know the other parts of it either. We keep hearing of the great things that are in it that are going to benefit the American workers, but we know what has happened in China. As for China, we were told, if we opened up our trade with China, China would modernize, and they would become a liberal, democratic country over the years. I call it the ``hug a Nazi, make a liberal'' theory. Basically, we were told that China would become a benevolent force. As we know now, China is becoming a malevolent force. China is becoming a threat to world peace, and the American people have not benefited from China trade as our good-paying jobs have gone to China. We don't want that for the rest of the world. We need to know what is in these trade treaties because they might have a major impact on bringing our working people's salaries down even more. Whether it is immigration or trade or patent law, our criteria should be what is in the interests of the people of the United States or whether it is in trade, where we have been basically having trade for the benefit of some mega-multinational corporations or patent law for the same clique. Guess what they also want? They want cheap labor, and that is why you see today this push to give 11 million people amnesty who have come here illegally. It is not 11 million. That is a 10-year-old figure. By the time they get done, they are going to bring 50 million people into our country who wouldn't be here otherwise. What is that going to do to our wage base? What is that going to do to Americans who are out looking for work right now? What is that going to do to our schools? to the money we have for our veterans' benefits? What is that going to do? We are undermining the well-being of the American people for the profits of some mega-multinational corporations. That is wrong. I am a Republican--I believe in free enterprise; I believe in private property; I believe in the profit motive--but we have to have a Congress that is working for the benefit of and protecting the rights of the American people, and they need to mobilize to make sure we are doing that by supporting them to make sure that our communities are not overrun with illegal immigrants. By the way, if you grant amnesty to 25 million illegals, there will be a huge surge of people from around the world who will know that all they have to do is outlast us, and they will get their amnesty. We need to make sure that these decisions, those things--immigration policy and trade policy and, yes, intellectual property protection policy--are done in a way that will benefit us and will not benefit our competitors. {time} 1215 When I say us, United States, it is us, U-S, us, the American people. That should be the basis of our criteria: what is going to be in the interests of the American people; not bring down their wages, not let people steal our technology and use it to compete against us. I ask my colleagues, please pay attention to H.R. 9 and these issues. Join with me in supporting the cause of the American people, of us instead of the big corporations. I yield back the balance of my time. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 75 (Friday, May 15, 2015)] [House] [Pages H3238-H3243] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] AMERICAN PATENT SYSTEM IN DANGER The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under the Speaker's announced policy of January 6, 2015, the gentleman from California (Mr. Rohrabacher) is recognized for 60 minutes as the designee of the majority leader. Mr. ROHRABACHER. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Conaway), my very good friend. Repeal the Oil Export Ban Mr. CONAWAY. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from California for yielding. This may not be the topic that he is going to talk about here, but I appreciate the time to be able to talk to something that is important to the folks of west Texas and is actually important to all Americans. I rise today to bring attention to an important issue that is gathering nationwide support, that is, repealing the export ban on crude oil. This week, I submitted an amendment to the National Defense Authorization Act that would, in fact, repeal the ban. While the amendment did not ultimately make it into the final bill, I would like to take a moment to talk about the importance of lifting that ban. First, let's remember why the export ban was placed into law to begin with. Because of the OPEC oil embargo of 1973, Congress enacted the Energy Policy and Conservation Act, directing the President to ban crude oil exports. At the time, the ban served a purpose: to keep our oil at home in order to reduce our exposure to the wildly fluctuating markets of that time. Today, though, the ban has outlived its purpose. It is an antiquated policy that is now only serving to harm Americans and punish domestic production. For example, right now we allow Iran to export more oil from their country than we do from our own domestic producers. This is wrongheaded and is long overdue for a change. The ban should be lifted, while leaving in place the necessary authorities to allow the President to act in an emergency and while preserving our Strategic Petroleum Reserve. Some claim that gasoline prices would increase if the ban is lifted, but analysis shows that to be incorrect. It shows that prices will actually fall, reducing the cost of the product that American families rely on every single day, which is another reason to support lifting the ban. In 2013, the United States was the number one oil producing nation in the world, surpassing Saudi Arabia and Russia, a fact that many thought impossible only a decade ago. Taking advantage of our Nation's abundant resources by lifting the ban will, in fact, lower gasoline prices, create dependable, long- lasting jobs, and help expand our energy supply, making our Nation more energy independent. I urge my colleagues to listen to the growing voice of the American people. It is time to lift the export ban on crude oil. Mr. ROHRABACHER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to warn my colleagues and [[Page H3239]] the American people of several threats to their safety and their prosperity. These threats are observable from Washington, D.C., but may not be observable to the American people. So I ask my colleagues to pay attention, number one, to what we are doing here, but I also would ask the American people to pay attention to what we are doing here. There are changes being maneuvered through our legislative branch and being mandated by executive orders from President Obama that will undermine the economic well-being of hard-working Americans and put us in jeopardy as a nation, both economically and in terms of our national security. Those pursuing these egregious policy initiatives are fulfilling President Obama's pledge to change America. And what most Americans believed was a commitment to make our country better, to change America, was, in reality, an elitist and, I believe, an arrogant pledge to dramatically alter the basic and fundamental institutions and values that have been thought of by our patriots to be the essential elements defining our country and, of course, ensuring our freedom, security, and prosperity. What are these threats that I talk about? What are these threats that we need to pay attention to? They are not coming from one political party. They are not coming from the Republicans or the Democrats, as a party. You can see support across the board on both sides of the aisle on various sides of these issues. It is also not a threat just stemming from one person or one political leader, but it is, of course, what we are talking about. This threat is coming from a very powerful coalition seeking profit for themselves, even if it impoverishes the people or diminishes, at least, the economic well-being of the people of the United States. Ironically, people who are enjoying their freedom and people who are enjoying their relative prosperity don't pay attention to some of the very intricate matters that have come before us in Congress. But I can assure all of my fellow Americans, there are powerful interests who are paying attention, and they are doing what they best can do to manipulate the law in a way that will enhance their profits, even if it is being done at the expense of the well-being of the American people. We can see this in dramatic changes that are being suggested in something that probably is very boring and tame to most Americans when they even hear that someone is going to even talk about patent law-- patent law, which is the legal structure that enforces an inventor's right to own and control the product of his or her genius, labor, and investment for a given period of time. So I say, of course, that sounds pretty mundane, patent law. Is it some detailed, intricate regulation and control of this area of economic life, of jobs, and things that we do in America? Well, it is more than that. It may sound mundane; but, in reality, patent law and the patent rights of our people--the right of our people to own the technology they have created for a specific period of time-- has been a significant determinant in our country's way of life, our country's quality of life, and the security of our Nation. This intellectual property right, the right through a patent ownership of 17 years' control and--not only of 17 years of control, but also of profit from one's own inventions, has been vital to our well-being as a nation and an essential part of the American Dream. Let's note that this was a right that was written into the Constitution by our Founding Fathers. People know about the Bill of Rights. But the word ``right'' was only used in the body of the Constitution once, and that was a section that guaranteed that Americans--that what Congress should do is to make sure that Americans were guaranteed the right to control their own creations, if they are inventors or writers, for a given period of time, to profit from it so that they would have incentives to come up and be the most creative people in the world. {time} 1130 Our Founding Fathers believed that technology and freedom would uplift ordinary Americans and give all Americans a chance at a decent life. And they were right. They wrote that into the Constitution. It is right there. I believe it probably was under the influence of my favorite Founding Father, Benjamin Franklin. What we have to recognize is that over the years of our country, what has made us a great nation is our freedom and technology. This is especially true for minority Americans and especially of Black Americans. Let me note that Black Americans, if you take a look at the history of our patent system, are disproportionately inventive. In the history of this country, actually, as a proportion of their population, our Black Americans have been more inventive than any other group in our country. Why is that? Because patent law and property law were considered a constitutional right, and this was in the one area in which Black Americans were not discriminated against once they were freed in 1860 to 1865, when our Black citizens were freed. After that we found that more patents proportionately went to that community because they needed an opportunity to uplift themselves free from outside forces beating down on them and denying their rights. Mr. Speaker, our patent system and the patents granted by Washington thus respected the rights of all of our citizens, including our minority citizens. Thus, making sure that we have patent protection has been one of the great boons to our minority populations, who otherwise suffered great discrimination and suffered from a lack of rights, except for the property rights that come from inventions. We see this has been good not just for minority Americans however. Let me note that we have, with technology, enhanced the ability of our people to work hard and get the job done and thus create wealth that was then owned by a large number of people rather than an elite. Of course, when people understand the importance of technology--and business has more and more come to the understanding that it is new technology that will give them leverage and control over wealth. There has been an ongoing attempt in these last 20 years to dramatically diminish the patent protection enjoyed by Americans, the patent protection written right into our Constitution. The fact is that, for the last 20 years, I have been personally engaged along with a small group of people who believe that technology and freedom are essential to the well-being of our country. Marcy Kaptur of Ohio and others have beat back many of these attempts to diminish the patent protection of our citizens. Mr. Speaker, America does have a patent system now. It is the strongest in the world. It is the strongest patent system in the world. We have always been proud of that. We have been proud that it has resulted in the fact that ordinary people have high standards of living here and they earn a good living from work because their work is enhanced by technological superiority over their competitors. By the way, Mr. Speaker, people work hard all over the world. Everybody works hard. In all of these countries they work hard like our people work hard, but they don't have the technology that enhances their work and amplifies their energy and hard work so that more wealth is created. We have encouraged that since the day our Constitution was ratified. That is why our people, when they work hard, end up living better because it gives us a competitive edge over the slave and oppressed labor in other countries. We, in fact, of course, know that the prosperity of average Americans to us and to our Founding Fathers was an important goal. It wasn't just we were going to have a country that worked, but it was going to be a system with respect for rights that would lead to a good and decent living for all of us, for all the people, and not just a small elite of businessmen. Well, we have done this over the years, and it has worked well. We have not had to have our own people who do work hard having to compete in terms of muscular and use of their physiques in order to produce goods, services, and wealth. They had the technology that permitted them to outcompete those other countries. Also, Mr. Speaker, it ensures we have a more secure country. Having a strong patent system where people are encouraged to invent new things and to be innovative has given us the edge over people who would do harm to our country. It has been important to our national security because we can't take [[Page H3240]] on adversaries that don't respect human rights. If America was trying to secure itself from threats from groups of people around the world, leaders and gangsters who have no respect for human rights whatsoever, we lose because they are willing to lose all of their people, and they are willing for any amount of bloodshed to maintain control and power and, yes, to beat the United States and democratic countries. Instead, Mr. Speaker, we have had technology at work helping defend our country, technology that would not have existed had we not had the patent protection that has been traditional to our country. Even look today what is happening. Without drones, where would we be? Without drones fighting the good fight against ISIL, we would have to have thousands of Americans there to fight that threat to mankind and the freedom of the world. Instead, we have joined with the forces in Erbil, which is the Kurds, in standing tough directly against this onslaught of radical Islam, and they are holding firm. But without our drones there to help them, they would be overrun. So this idea of property ownership of technology, of your technological developments, has been heart and soul to a prosperous and secure America. So when I say there are changes being proposed here in Congress, they are trying to manipulate through the system that will affect the prosperity of the average American and the security of our Nation. The public and my fellow colleagues need to pay attention because we are again facing a major onslaught, an attack on this fundamental right of technology ownership by those who create that technology. We are facing an onslaught that is being what? Being masterminded, being masterminded and being pushed by megamultinational corporations who are not operating in the interests of the people of the United States. They could care less about all of that. But they are operating after what they can do to enrich themselves, even if it is not in the interests of the people of the United States and the interests of our security. These megamultinational corporations have pumped millions upon millions of dollars into lobbying for changes in our patent system that diminish the rights of the inventor and enables these multinational corporations to steal the intellectual property of our inventors and use it without giving compensation to the owners. This is in direct contradiction to what the Constitution meant to guarantee and why it was written directly into the body of the Constitution that this was a right that Americans should be concerned about. Mr. Speaker, for the last 20 years there has been a stealth attack on America's strong and effective patent system. Let us note that we have had the strongest and the most effective and recognized fair patent system in the world. All other patent systems have been judged against us, and now we have had these last 20 years an insidious undermining, and we are on the edge of a huge attack and perhaps successful destruction of fundamental patent rights that have been part of our people for many years. For example, 20 years ago, shortly after I came here, I found that in the GATT--that is a trade treaty that we have--there were provisions that were snuck into the GATT implementation legislation. That is legislation we passed here in Congress in order to implement a trade agreement. These big corporate interests had put into the GATT implementation legislation without telling anybody two provisions that would have dramatically hurt the small inventors in this country. Up until now, the Constitution actually says that the inventors and the writers are guaranteed a specific time where they will control. They will be granted a specific time where they will control their patent, the rights to their patent, and the rights of their creative genius. Well, it has traditionally been that once you file, as soon as the patent is actually granted to the inventor, then the clock starts ticking, and you get 17 years of protection. In different parts of the world, that is not what the law has been. In Japan and in Europe, it has been, oh, no, once you apply, after 20 years, even if it takes you 10 or 15 years to get your patent or 19 years, no, the clock is ticking then. You may not be granted your patent for 19 years, and then you have 1 year left, and that is no patent protection at all. So now they are trying to foist that on us. By the way, that would give people, knowing the clock is ticking--those small inventors in other countries are faced by people who are trying to pressure them to accept lesser claims to the legitimacy of their patent in order to basically prevent these guys, men and women, from being compensated the way they would be if they had a guaranteed term, which is part of our Constitution. Mr. Speaker, the other provision that was there 20 years ago was the 18-month publication demand. That is, after 18 months, when someone applies for a patent--now, it is that once someone applies for a patent, that patent application is absolutely secret until that patent is granted. Unless you have a patent in your hand--then it is published for the world because their ownership has been established. Well, that has been traditionally what our Patent Office and our patent protection has been. Basically, you have a secret and you developed it, you give it to the Patent Office. In fact, if anybody leaked that information, up until this point it has been a felony for anybody to tell anyone else until that patent is actually granted to the inventor. Well, Mr. Speaker, they want to change this and say, if you haven't been granted your patent within 18 months, it will be published for the whole world. Think about that. Think about what I am saying. Before, for our entire country's history, we have made sure that an application is secret so that nobody can get ahead of the inventor himself and the inventor won't be put in a bad spot. We made sure that until the patent is granted it is secret. They want to change that so that after 18 months it is published. What if that patent takes 10 years to issue? That means the man or woman who invented this piece of technology, our competitors overseas will be able to use it for all of that time because they will know all about it, but the patent hasn't been granted to the inventor yet. {time} 1145 I called that the ``Steal American Technologies Act.'' That is what they were trying to do. That is what it would result in, and keep that in mind. The large multinationals sought to weaken the ability of our inventors to enforce patent rights. Why? Why do they want these big companies here in the United States? Well, mostly, they are multinational companies now--they are big guys--and what they want to do is steal from the little guy--surprise, surprise. The big guys would try to manipulate the creation of law here that will enable them to take something from some person who has less economic power than themselves. Our constitutional rights are supposed to protect the little guy's rights. We believe the newspaper should be able to be published, but little guys should be able to print a mimeographed piece of information themselves and distribute it or to gather. Actually, what is hard for me to imagine is that, if these big guys were actually trying to diminish the rights of religion or speech in this country, or assembly, there would be an outcry; but, because it is the rights to own technology that you have created for a given period of time--it sounds too confusing, and they have let this feeling that maybe the people can't understand it, so they don't pay attention--they have let that lack of attention give them an opening to destroy and undermine the rights of Americans, and I think this right is every bit as important as those other rights of religion and speech, et cetera. What they have set up in these last 20 years, it is an ongoing David versus Goliath because some of the biggest corporations in the world are behind the effort to change the patent law. Well, we beat them back. As I say, there was a coalition of us-- Democrat and Republican, Marcy Kaptur. We had some very good support from the Black Caucus. I might add that, again, they recognized how important inventions have been to the Black community; but we beat them back. It was a bipartisan coalition. We have had to, over the years, compromise and negotiate certain things, but they have not gotten their way; but every time they have tried--they [[Page H3241]] have tried to overwhelm those of us who are preventing the diminishing of patent rights--they have had to use scare tactics, always claiming that there is a boogeyman, there is a boogeyman out there, and that is the reason why we have to attack the inventor, because there is something out there that is really threatening and it is sinister and it is a sinister force that has to be defeated, that is why we have to take away all of the rights of the inventors over here, because they have now tried to tell the story in a way. It is the equivalent of saying we are going to take away the rights of every American to sue someone--or a company or anyone else who has caused them damage--because there are frivolous lawsuits. Yes, there are frivolous lawsuits. There are some people who misuse our legal system. The last thing we want to do is eliminate the rights of all Americans to use the court system to protect their rights. That is basically what is going on here. Our own cherished patent rights to own what you have created--and this constitutional right that was given to Americans--is on the verge of being dramatically altered and diminished and destroyed. By the way, the first boogeyman that was used in order to try to gain support for these very same two items that they snuck in the GATT, the boogeyman was called the submarine patentors. Submarine patents--that is all you heard about before--as if a person who was filing for a patent was a submarine patentor. Everybody has got to lose their patent rights in order to get the submarine patentor. What was the submarine patentor? A submarine patentor was--their definition--someone who files for a patent and then does everything they can to delay the patent from being issued; and then, after years and years, the patent is finally granted, and they have got all this leverage on all the people who have used the technology in the meantime. Well, I am sorry; there were very few submarine patentors--there were some--but the fact is most inventors were struggling to get their patents issued to them as soon as possible because they needed the money, especially the little guys needed the money, and they were struggling, ``Please, give us the patent so we can move forward on this,'' but, no, they were being presented as if they were trying to slow down the process. Well, we finally, after really fighting for 10 years on this, reached the compromise, which my chief of staff, Rick Dykema, and myself negotiated, along with Marcy Kaptur, who negotiated this agreement with us, that if, indeed, there is a patent applicant who uses his abilities or uses various powers that he has in the bureaucratic process to delay the issue of the patent, well, if that happens, then, indeed, that patent, the time, the clock, has to start ticking against that guy, so he is using his own time when it has not been issued. Well, that solved the problem--there it was--without diminishing the rights of those people who were struggling to get their patents out, but took 10 years or 15 years to get the patent issued. That wasn't a hard thing to negotiate, a hard thing to do, but it was a hard thing to accomplish because the people who were pushing submarine patents were really trying to diminish the patent rights of all Americans so that they could steal from little guys and could take away their patent rights basically as soon as possible. Well, now, the current boogeyman is the patent troll. Now, there are some people who misuse and have frivolous lawsuits who use the patent system. There is no doubt about it. I might add this idea that people will be sent a thing--you are violating my patent, you either give my $5,000, or I am going to sue you, and then small businesses go along with it--there have been court cases now that have taken care of that. Obviously, that is a swindle and something we can't put up with; that was happening to a degree, but there is no excuse, as I say, to eliminate the rights of all Americans because somebody abuses a right. That is not what is acceptable. The patent troll is being used as a straw man. We are going to have legislation that will get this guy who has these frivolous lawsuits and is creating such havoc among small-business men and ripping them off. Just like the submarine patents, that can be taken care of without eliminating the patent rights of our people. What we have now is the straw man, the patent troll. When you hear a debate on this issue, all you will hear is patent troll, patent troll, patent troll, not recognizing that every provision in this bill diminishes--it is H.R. 9 that is before our Judiciary Committee now-- every provision makes it more difficult for the small inventor to enforce his patent against infringement by future megacorporations. Guess who is pushing this legislation? Huge megacorporations who want that little guy not to be able to sue a corporation that has stolen his intellectual property rights--this is basically--but they are going to say: Oh, no, it is the troll we are after, the troll. Well, as I say, there have been frivolous lawsuits, and there have been changes made in the judicial system itself of how to handle that, but there is no excuse for a troll--for this word ``troll,'' a straw man--get him to be used to damage and destroy the rights of the 95 percent of the technology creators in our country, take away their rights to get this straw man. Well, let me tell you how the word ``troll'' came about, the word ``patent troll.'' That is the reason you are hearing it. Every time you hear somebody say it, remember this. A group of corporate elitists got in a circle in a room--I know because one of the people who was in that meeting switched sides and came over and disclosed that these corporate executives said: What can we do to make it sound so sinister that we can get this passed? What words can we come up with that will just basically create such a bad feeling that the American people will not recognize that what we are really doing is trying to get the small inventor and make sure that the small inventor cannot sue us for things that we are using? Okay. They went around the room. This friend, the fellow who told me about this meeting, said: I came up with the words ``patent pirate,'' and then, by the time it got around the circle, somebody came up with the words ``patent troll.'' They said: That is it. That sounds so horrible, we can distract everybody's attention using that, and that is good enough. That sounds so evil that we can make sure that we go into battle using that in front of us, instead of we want to diminish the patent rights of honest, hard-working inventors who deserve to have a profit from their creation of their technology. That is just how cynical this debate has been. Every provision of H.R. 9--a bill now sitting in the Judiciary Committee--prevents--makes it more difficult for an inventor to actually enforce his rights and sue a company that is trying to steal, use his property rights, intellectual property rights, without compensating him. Let me give you an example of something in the bill and the changes they are proposing. Now, they are changing to loser pays legal fees. If you have a small inventor and if he sues that company and it is a huge company, that is usually what he has created and making profit from it, if he sues them and he loses, he will have to pay the legal fees for that huge company. Now, for the huge company, that is almost nothing. Taking on a case of one guy is nothing in their expense account because they have got 100 lawyers in a stable, waiting to help and being paid for. Well, if the inventor loses, that is it for him. That alone is wrong. In this legislation, H.R. 9, they have added another little proviso to destroy the small inventor; and that is, if someone invests in his invention, if someone invests in the invention and he manages to be successful and comes up with a new piece of technology and he is granted the patent and some megacorporation comes along and incorporates it and uses it and refuses to give this guy even a small payment for using the technology that he created, his intellectual property rights, if someone has invested in that inventor to help him make the invention, let's say that, when that inventor goes up to battle Goliath in his megacorporation, and let's say, even though he is right, he loses--because that happens sometimes in our country many times, where some people with a great number [[Page H3242]] of very sophisticated lawyers against the little guy, the little guy sometimes loses--well, what is going to happen now, according to this bill, is anyone who has invested in the inventor is going to have to be liable for the legal fees that come out of that suit. Who is ever going to give an investment to an inventor if that may open them up to liability? It is a liability, I might add, to some megacorporation, megamultinational corporation. Well, this provision just demonstrates what is the purpose of that provision. The provision is to beat down the little guy so that the big guys can steal, and that is evident, very evident; yet this bill is still moving forward. It is H.R. 9. It is in the Judiciary Committee now. As I say, H.R. 9 is the equivalent of saying: Because there are frivolous lawsuits, we are going to do everything we can to diminish the power of ordinary citizens to use the law and legal lawsuits for compensation for damages done to them. {time} 1200 Every provision of the bill weakens the right of the inventor to enforce his or her own patents. This bill actually passed the House last year. We struggled against it here in the House, but what happens is 90 percent of the people here in this body are just so busy that it is hard to pay attention to something that seems mundane like a patent law, and they just can't get themselves to focus on it. The American people also think that issues like this are so complicated that they can't get involved, but that leaves the whole playing field open to huge corporations that are out to enrich themselves by basically structuring law in a way that the power and the wealth will flow to them. Supposedly, the system our Founding Fathers wanted was for the wealth to flow broadly across our country so that every American could benefit from new technologies and new wealth that was being created. Now they want to corral that wealth; they want to diminish our rights in order to enrich themselves. These companies are not companies that are loyal to the United States. They are being loyal to their own profits, and some of them are multinational corporations that have actually no ties, real ties, to the United States. Let me just suggest that this bill did pass the House last year, but it was stopped in the Senate because, by then, we had made so much noise here. As I say, a bipartisan group, led by myself, Marcy Kaptur from Ohio, Mr. Massie from Kentucky, and other very strong activists, got together, and we made so much noise that the American universities finally paid attention because that bill that lets people steal patent rights was a huge threat to our university system. Had it been signed into law, the value of patents would have gone down dramatically. Let me go back to how that works. Remember, we were talking about a troll. What their definition of ``troll'' is is anybody who buys the patent rights from someone who has invented something and has a patent but who doesn't have the money to enforce it. Anybody who actually buys the patent rights but is not aiming at commercializing it himself and is going to enforce that and make a profit from it, that is going to be what they are stamping out. The universities are not there to commercialize what they are doing. They are there to basically have new discoveries, and they realize they have got a lot of patents that they own as part of their portfolios and that the actual values of those patent collections by the universities would have dramatically gone down. As well, of course, the patent value of any American would have gone down at that point. Also, other industries that are really important industries to our well-being--PhRMA and others, biotech industries--which struggle hard to come up with one patent that they then can sell in the market, are totally undermined by this effort to weaken our patent system. We managed to mobilize those people, and we stopped it the last time around; but the multinational corporations behind this legislation are so arrogant that this bill is now going to be shoved through again. This time, I think, with the American people, we can actually stop it here in the House, and we can certainly stop it in the Senate. We need the American people to mobilize and to call their Congressmen and ask: How do you stand on this terrible patent bill, H.R. 9? We need people who are going to stand up for the little guy in America, not for some megacorporation that is trying to permit the theft of American intellectual property rights by multinational corporations. Whether or not we succeed this time around is going to depend on, yes, the people here who understand the issue, fighting it out, being as aggressive as we can be, and the American people mobilizing to make sure we protect our sacred rights granted in the Constitution. One of the most important, I believe to be, is the right of technology ownership to people who create that technology. As I say, there are powerful interest groups in this city and in our country and in the world that try to change policy and are manipulating government. That is clear. That is fine. We have a democratic process. We just need to make sure that we are all being held accountable--that all of the Members of the House and the Senate are accountable for their votes--and that we know and the public at least has the chance to know what we are voting on. Actually, there is something happening right now where that is not true at all, and I sure hope the American people are paying attention to what is going on here in Washington concerning what they call TPP, the trade promotion pact, and then there is the TPA, which gives trade promotion authority to the Trans-Pacific Partnership, which is a trade treaty with the nations around the Pacific. The sinister nature of this can be seen because this trade treaty with the Pacific nations is secret. It has been declared classified. Right now, if I had gone down and read what now exists of this trade treaty and if I had announced it here on the floor, I would have been violating secrecy restrictions that they have declared--how about this?--in a policy about trade with major countries of the world, which will have an enormous impact on our well-being. It is being kept totally secret from the American people. How is that? Then they say Members of Congress can go down and look at it if they want to. Of course, as they have said, you can only do it within a certain time. They have regulated the time we can go down, and we are so busy that almost no Members of Congress will have gone down and read the actual documents that explain what that trade policy is that they are trying to foist on us. Please, I hope the American people understand that Members of Congress should not be voting on things that, number one, they don't have access to, but we should not be voting on something if we have not permitted the American people to know what that is. You will remember the famous statement by Ms. Pelosi about ObamaCare, which was that we have to pass it in order to find out what is in it. That is totally unacceptable. In trade treaties, these things will now pass rules and regulations based on this treaty that will impact our way of life here. Now, we have been briefed on it. I am on the Foreign Affairs Committee, and we were briefed on this the other day. The two main administration guys there--the people who had been Ambassadors and who are currently with the State Department--were briefing us. It is just like the boogey words over here, the scare words, in terms of patents. Now, this is all being used in just the opposite way with every glorious word--higher income for our people, more competitive for America, and all of the trade will come in our direction. Yet, when I asked these briefers, ``Hey, have you read this treaty?'' neither one of them had read it. So the people advocating for this treaty have not even read the treaty themselves. I found a provision in the treaty, or at least I understand it is in there--I have not verified it yet because we have all of this trouble to go through to verify what we are being asked to support--that says that patents in the United States will basically have to be published after 18 months. If a patent application is made and if after 18 months the patent is not granted, the patent will be published for the whole world to see. Uh-huh. Does that sound familiar? They tried to put that over on us 20 years ago. We managed to [[Page H3243]] thwart it then, and now they want to sneak it into a treaty, and the American people are not permitted to know what is in the treaty. Will that hurt us in some way? It will only make all of our technological discoveries available for our competitors overseas to be using long before the patent is even granted to the American inventor. You see what type of sinister forces we are up against. Who can sit down here and say how wonderful this treaty is going to be when the American people aren't allowed to see it and when almost all of us have not read it and when our briefers who come here have not even read it? I asked them yesterday, these briefers, ``Well, is this in the treaty?'' They didn't know. They didn't know whether or not this provision on patents was in there, which would undermine our rights to control our own creations here and have our opponents and our competitors overseas have all of the information about our technology even before the patent is granted. They didn't even know that was in there. They didn't know if it was or if it wasn't. By the way, if I had gone down and had finally gotten through the maze and had read the actual wording in the treaty, I would have been required not to have mentioned it today on the House floor as we are being restricted because it has been declared secret from the American people. This is outrageous. We don't need to have a trade promotion authority that will keep things from the American people, and we don't need to have a trade treaty with the Pacific and with all of these nations in Asia that will open us up to having our technology stolen, but also we don't know the other parts of it either. We keep hearing of the great things that are in it that are going to benefit the American workers, but we know what has happened in China. As for China, we were told, if we opened up our trade with China, China would modernize, and they would become a liberal, democratic country over the years. I call it the ``hug a Nazi, make a liberal'' theory. Basically, we were told that China would become a benevolent force. As we know now, China is becoming a malevolent force. China is becoming a threat to world peace, and the American people have not benefited from China trade as our good-paying jobs have gone to China. We don't want that for the rest of the world. We need to know what is in these trade treaties because they might have a major impact on bringing our working people's salaries down even more. Whether it is immigration or trade or patent law, our criteria should be what is in the interests of the people of the United States or whether it is in trade, where we have been basically having trade for the benefit of some mega-multinational corporations or patent law for the same clique. Guess what they also want? They want cheap labor, and that is why you see today this push to give 11 million people amnesty who have come here illegally. It is not 11 million. That is a 10-year-old figure. By the time they get done, they are going to bring 50 million people into our country who wouldn't be here otherwise. What is that going to do to our wage base? What is that going to do to Americans who are out looking for work right now? What is that going to do to our schools? to the money we have for our veterans' benefits? What is that going to do? We are undermining the well-being of the American people for the profits of some mega-multinational corporations. That is wrong. I am a Republican--I believe in free enterprise; I believe in private property; I believe in the profit motive--but we have to have a Congress that is working for the benefit of and protecting the rights of the American people, and they need to mobilize to make sure we are doing that by supporting them to make sure that our communities are not overrun with illegal immigrants. By the way, if you grant amnesty to 25 million illegals, there will be a huge surge of people from around the world who will know that all they have to do is outlast us, and they will get their amnesty. We need to make sure that these decisions, those things--immigration policy and trade policy and, yes, intellectual property protection policy--are done in a way that will benefit us and will not benefit our competitors. {time} 1215 When I say us, United States, it is us, U-S, us, the American people. That should be the basis of our criteria: what is going to be in the interests of the American people; not bring down their wages, not let people steal our technology and use it to compete against us. I ask my colleagues, please pay attention to H.R. 9 and these issues. Join with me in supporting the cause of the American people, of us instead of the big corporations. I yield back the balance of my time. ____________________","Congressional Record, Volume 161 Issue 75 (Friday, May 15, 2015) [Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 75 (Friday, May 15, 2015)] [House] [Pages H3238-H3243] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] AMERICAN PATENT SYSTEM IN DANGER The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under the Speaker's announced policy of January 6, 2015, the gentleman from California (Mr. Rohrabacher) is recognized for 60 minutes as the designee of the majority leader. Mr. ROHRABACHER. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Conaway), my very good friend. Repeal the Oil Export Ban Mr. CONAWAY. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from California for yielding. This may not be the topic that he is going to talk about here, but I appreciate the time to be able to talk to something that is important to the folks of west Texas and is actually important to all Americans. I rise today to bring attention to an important issue that is gathering nationwide support, that is, repealing the export ban on crude oil. This week, I submitted an amendment to the National Defense Authorization Act that would, in fact, repeal the ban. While the amendment did not ultimately make it into the final bill, I would like to take a moment to talk about the importance of lifting that ban. First, let's remember why the export ban was placed into law to begin with. Because of the OPEC oil embargo of 1973, Congress enacted the Energy Policy and Conservation Act, directing the President to ban crude oil exports. At the time, the ban served a purpose: to keep our oil at home in order to reduce our exposure to the wildly fluctuating markets of that time. Today, though, the ban has outlived its purpose. It is an antiquated policy that is now only serving to harm Americans and punish domestic production. For example, right now we allow Iran to export more oil from their country than we do from our own domestic producers. This is wrongheaded and is long overdue for a change. The ban should be lifted, while leaving in place the necessary authorities to allow the President to act in an emergency and while preserving our Strategic Petroleum Reserve. Some claim that gasoline prices would increase if the ban is lifted, but analysis shows that to be incorrect. It shows that prices will actually fall, reducing the cost of the product that American families rely on every single day, which is another reason to support lifting the ban. In 2013, the United States was the number one oil producing nation in the world, surpassing Saudi Arabia and Russia, a fact that many thought impossible only a decade ago. Taking advantage of our Nation's abundant resources by lifting the ban will, in fact, lower gasoline prices, create dependable, long- lasting jobs, and help expand our energy supply, making our Nation more energy independent. I urge my colleagues to listen to the growing voice of the American people. It is time to lift the export ban on crude oil. Mr. ROHRABACHER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to warn my colleagues and [[Page H3239]] the American people of several threats to their safety and their prosperity. These threats are observable from Washington, D.C., but may not be observable to the American people. So I ask my colleagues to pay attention, number one, to what we are doing here, but I also would ask the American people to pay attention to what we are doing here. There are changes being maneuvered through our legislative branch and being mandated by executive orders from President Obama that will undermine the economic well-being of hard-working Americans and put us in jeopardy as a nation, both economically and in terms of our national security. Those pursuing these egregious policy initiatives are fulfilling President Obama's pledge to change America. And what most Americans believed was a commitment to make our country better, to change America, was, in reality, an elitist and, I believe, an arrogant pledge to dramatically alter the basic and fundamental institutions and values that have been thought of by our patriots to be the essential elements defining our country and, of course, ensuring our freedom, security, and prosperity. What are these threats that I talk about? What are these threats that we need to pay attention to? They are not coming from one political party. They are not coming from the Republicans or the Democrats, as a party. You can see support across the board on both sides of the aisle on various sides of these issues. It is also not a threat just stemming from one person or one political leader, but it is, of course, what we are talking about. This threat is coming from a very powerful coalition seeking profit for themselves, even if it impoverishes the people or diminishes, at least, the economic well-being of the people of the United States. Ironically, people who are enjoying their freedom and people who are enjoying their relative prosperity don't pay attention to some of the very intricate matters that have come before us in Congress. But I can assure all of my fellow Americans, there are powerful interests who are paying attention, and they are doing what they best can do to manipulate the law in a way that will enhance their profits, even if it is being done at the expense of the well-being of the American people. We can see this in dramatic changes that are being suggested in something that probably is very boring and tame to most Americans when they even hear that someone is going to even talk about patent law-- patent law, which is the legal structure that enforces an inventor's right to own and control the product of his or her genius, labor, and investment for a given period of time. So I say, of course, that sounds pretty mundane, patent law. Is it some detailed, intricate regulation and control of this area of economic life, of jobs, and things that we do in America? Well, it is more than that. It may sound mundane; but, in reality, patent law and the patent rights of our people--the right of our people to own the technology they have created for a specific period of time-- has been a significant determinant in our country's way of life, our country's quality of life, and the security of our Nation. This intellectual property right, the right through a patent ownership of 17 years' control and--not only of 17 years of control, but also of profit from one's own inventions, has been vital to our well-being as a nation and an essential part of the American Dream. Let's note that this was a right that was written into the Constitution by our Founding Fathers. People know about the Bill of Rights. But the word ``right'' was only used in the body of the Constitution once, and that was a section that guaranteed that Americans--that what Congress should do is to make sure that Americans were guaranteed the right to control their own creations, if they are inventors or writers, for a given period of time, to profit from it so that they would have incentives to come up and be the most creative people in the world. {time} 1130 Our Founding Fathers believed that technology and freedom would uplift ordinary Americans and give all Americans a chance at a decent life. And they were right. They wrote that into the Constitution. It is right there. I believe it probably was under the influence of my favorite Founding Father, Benjamin Franklin. What we have to recognize is that over the years of our country, what has made us a great nation is our freedom and technology. This is especially true for minority Americans and especially of Black Americans. Let me note that Black Americans, if you take a look at the history of our patent system, are disproportionately inventive. In the history of this country, actually, as a proportion of their population, our Black Americans have been more inventive than any other group in our country. Why is that? Because patent law and property law were considered a constitutional right, and this was in the one area in which Black Americans were not discriminated against once they were freed in 1860 to 1865, when our Black citizens were freed. After that we found that more patents proportionately went to that community because they needed an opportunity to uplift themselves free from outside forces beating down on them and denying their rights. Mr. Speaker, our patent system and the patents granted by Washington thus respected the rights of all of our citizens, including our minority citizens. Thus, making sure that we have patent protection has been one of the great boons to our minority populations, who otherwise suffered great discrimination and suffered from a lack of rights, except for the property rights that come from inventions. We see this has been good not just for minority Americans however. Let me note that we have, with technology, enhanced the ability of our people to work hard and get the job done and thus create wealth that was then owned by a large number of people rather than an elite. Of course, when people understand the importance of technology--and business has more and more come to the understanding that it is new technology that will give them leverage and control over wealth. There has been an ongoing attempt in these last 20 years to dramatically diminish the patent protection enjoyed by Americans, the patent protection written right into our Constitution. The fact is that, for the last 20 years, I have been personally engaged along with a small group of people who believe that technology and freedom are essential to the well-being of our country. Marcy Kaptur of Ohio and others have beat back many of these attempts to diminish the patent protection of our citizens. Mr. Speaker, America does have a patent system now. It is the strongest in the world. It is the strongest patent system in the world. We have always been proud of that. We have been proud that it has resulted in the fact that ordinary people have high standards of living here and they earn a good living from work because their work is enhanced by technological superiority over their competitors. By the way, Mr. Speaker, people work hard all over the world. Everybody works hard. In all of these countries they work hard like our people work hard, but they don't have the technology that enhances their work and amplifies their energy and hard work so that more wealth is created. We have encouraged that since the day our Constitution was ratified. That is why our people, when they work hard, end up living better because it gives us a competitive edge over the slave and oppressed labor in other countries. We, in fact, of course, know that the prosperity of average Americans to us and to our Founding Fathers was an important goal. It wasn't just we were going to have a country that worked, but it was going to be a system with respect for rights that would lead to a good and decent living for all of us, for all the people, and not just a small elite of businessmen. Well, we have done this over the years, and it has worked well. We have not had to have our own people who do work hard having to compete in terms of muscular and use of their physiques in order to produce goods, services, and wealth. They had the technology that permitted them to outcompete those other countries. Also, Mr. Speaker, it ensures we have a more secure country. Having a strong patent system where people are encouraged to invent new things and to be innovative has given us the edge over people who would do harm to our country. It has been important to our national security because we can't take [[Page H3240]] on adversaries that don't respect human rights. If America was trying to secure itself from threats from groups of people around the world, leaders and gangsters who have no respect for human rights whatsoever, we lose because they are willing to lose all of their people, and they are willing for any amount of bloodshed to maintain control and power and, yes, to beat the United States and democratic countries. Instead, Mr. Speaker, we have had technology at work helping defend our country, technology that would not have existed had we not had the patent protection that has been traditional to our country. Even look today what is happening. Without drones, where would we be? Without drones fighting the good fight against ISIL, we would have to have thousands of Americans there to fight that threat to mankind and the freedom of the world. Instead, we have joined with the forces in Erbil, which is the Kurds, in standing tough directly against this onslaught of radical Islam, and they are holding firm. But without our drones there to help them, they would be overrun. So this idea of property ownership of technology, of your technological developments, has been heart and soul to a prosperous and secure America. So when I say there are changes being proposed here in Congress, they are trying to manipulate through the system that will affect the prosperity of the average American and the security of our Nation. The public and my fellow colleagues need to pay attention because we are again facing a major onslaught, an attack on this fundamental right of technology ownership by those who create that technology. We are facing an onslaught that is being what? Being masterminded, being masterminded and being pushed by megamultinational corporations who are not operating in the interests of the people of the United States. They could care less about all of that. But they are operating after what they can do to enrich themselves, even if it is not in the interests of the people of the United States and the interests of our security. These megamultinational corporations have pumped millions upon millions of dollars into lobbying for changes in our patent system that diminish the rights of the inventor and enables these multinational corporations to steal the intellectual property of our inventors and use it without giving compensation to the owners. This is in direct contradiction to what the Constitution meant to guarantee and why it was written directly into the body of the Constitution that this was a right that Americans should be concerned about. Mr. Speaker, for the last 20 years there has been a stealth attack on America's strong and effective patent system. Let us note that we have had the strongest and the most effective and recognized fair patent system in the world. All other patent systems have been judged against us, and now we have had these last 20 years an insidious undermining, and we are on the edge of a huge attack and perhaps successful destruction of fundamental patent rights that have been part of our people for many years. For example, 20 years ago, shortly after I came here, I found that in the GATT--that is a trade treaty that we have--there were provisions that were snuck into the GATT implementation legislation. That is legislation we passed here in Congress in order to implement a trade agreement. These big corporate interests had put into the GATT implementation legislation without telling anybody two provisions that would have dramatically hurt the small inventors in this country. Up until now, the Constitution actually says that the inventors and the writers are guaranteed a specific time where they will control. They will be granted a specific time where they will control their patent, the rights to their patent, and the rights of their creative genius. Well, it has traditionally been that once you file, as soon as the patent is actually granted to the inventor, then the clock starts ticking, and you get 17 years of protection. In different parts of the world, that is not what the law has been. In Japan and in Europe, it has been, oh, no, once you apply, after 20 years, even if it takes you 10 or 15 years to get your patent or 19 years, no, the clock is ticking then. You may not be granted your patent for 19 years, and then you have 1 year left, and that is no patent protection at all. So now they are trying to foist that on us. By the way, that would give people, knowing the clock is ticking--those small inventors in other countries are faced by people who are trying to pressure them to accept lesser claims to the legitimacy of their patent in order to basically prevent these guys, men and women, from being compensated the way they would be if they had a guaranteed term, which is part of our Constitution. Mr. Speaker, the other provision that was there 20 years ago was the 18-month publication demand. That is, after 18 months, when someone applies for a patent--now, it is that once someone applies for a patent, that patent application is absolutely secret until that patent is granted. Unless you have a patent in your hand--then it is published for the world because their ownership has been established. Well, that has been traditionally what our Patent Office and our patent protection has been. Basically, you have a secret and you developed it, you give it to the Patent Office. In fact, if anybody leaked that information, up until this point it has been a felony for anybody to tell anyone else until that patent is actually granted to the inventor. Well, Mr. Speaker, they want to change this and say, if you haven't been granted your patent within 18 months, it will be published for the whole world. Think about that. Think about what I am saying. Before, for our entire country's history, we have made sure that an application is secret so that nobody can get ahead of the inventor himself and the inventor won't be put in a bad spot. We made sure that until the patent is granted it is secret. They want to change that so that after 18 months it is published. What if that patent takes 10 years to issue? That means the man or woman who invented this piece of technology, our competitors overseas will be able to use it for all of that time because they will know all about it, but the patent hasn't been granted to the inventor yet. {time} 1145 I called that the ``Steal American Technologies Act.'' That is what they were trying to do. That is what it would result in, and keep that in mind. The large multinationals sought to weaken the ability of our inventors to enforce patent rights. Why? Why do they want these big companies here in the United States? Well, mostly, they are multinational companies now--they are big guys--and what they want to do is steal from the little guy--surprise, surprise. The big guys would try to manipulate the creation of law here that will enable them to take something from some person who has less economic power than themselves. Our constitutional rights are supposed to protect the little guy's rights. We believe the newspaper should be able to be published, but little guys should be able to print a mimeographed piece of information themselves and distribute it or to gather. Actually, what is hard for me to imagine is that, if these big guys were actually trying to diminish the rights of religion or speech in this country, or assembly, there would be an outcry; but, because it is the rights to own technology that you have created for a given period of time--it sounds too confusing, and they have let this feeling that maybe the people can't understand it, so they don't pay attention--they have let that lack of attention give them an opening to destroy and undermine the rights of Americans, and I think this right is every bit as important as those other rights of religion and speech, et cetera. What they have set up in these last 20 years, it is an ongoing David versus Goliath because some of the biggest corporations in the world are behind the effort to change the patent law. Well, we beat them back. As I say, there was a coalition of us-- Democrat and Republican, Marcy Kaptur. We had some very good support from the Black Caucus. I might add that, again, they recognized how important inventions have been to the Black community; but we beat them back. It was a bipartisan coalition. We have had to, over the years, compromise and negotiate certain things, but they have not gotten their way; but every time they have tried--they [[Page H3241]] have tried to overwhelm those of us who are preventing the diminishing of patent rights--they have had to use scare tactics, always claiming that there is a boogeyman, there is a boogeyman out there, and that is the reason why we have to attack the inventor, because there is something out there that is really threatening and it is sinister and it is a sinister force that has to be defeated, that is why we have to take away all of the rights of the inventors over here, because they have now tried to tell the story in a way. It is the equivalent of saying we are going to take away the rights of every American to sue someone--or a company or anyone else who has caused them damage--because there are frivolous lawsuits. Yes, there are frivolous lawsuits. There are some people who misuse our legal system. The last thing we want to do is eliminate the rights of all Americans to use the court system to protect their rights. That is basically what is going on here. Our own cherished patent rights to own what you have created--and this constitutional right that was given to Americans--is on the verge of being dramatically altered and diminished and destroyed. By the way, the first boogeyman that was used in order to try to gain support for these very same two items that they snuck in the GATT, the boogeyman was called the submarine patentors. Submarine patents--that is all you heard about before--as if a person who was filing for a patent was a submarine patentor. Everybody has got to lose their patent rights in order to get the submarine patentor. What was the submarine patentor? A submarine patentor was--their definition--someone who files for a patent and then does everything they can to delay the patent from being issued; and then, after years and years, the patent is finally granted, and they have got all this leverage on all the people who have used the technology in the meantime. Well, I am sorry; there were very few submarine patentors--there were some--but the fact is most inventors were struggling to get their patents issued to them as soon as possible because they needed the money, especially the little guys needed the money, and they were struggling, ``Please, give us the patent so we can move forward on this,'' but, no, they were being presented as if they were trying to slow down the process. Well, we finally, after really fighting for 10 years on this, reached the compromise, which my chief of staff, Rick Dykema, and myself negotiated, along with Marcy Kaptur, who negotiated this agreement with us, that if, indeed, there is a patent applicant who uses his abilities or uses various powers that he has in the bureaucratic process to delay the issue of the patent, well, if that happens, then, indeed, that patent, the time, the clock, has to start ticking against that guy, so he is using his own time when it has not been issued. Well, that solved the problem--there it was--without diminishing the rights of those people who were struggling to get their patents out, but took 10 years or 15 years to get the patent issued. That wasn't a hard thing to negotiate, a hard thing to do, but it was a hard thing to accomplish because the people who were pushing submarine patents were really trying to diminish the patent rights of all Americans so that they could steal from little guys and could take away their patent rights basically as soon as possible. Well, now, the current boogeyman is the patent troll. Now, there are some people who misuse and have frivolous lawsuits who use the patent system. There is no doubt about it. I might add this idea that people will be sent a thing--you are violating my patent, you either give my $5,000, or I am going to sue you, and then small businesses go along with it--there have been court cases now that have taken care of that. Obviously, that is a swindle and something we can't put up with; that was happening to a degree, but there is no excuse, as I say, to eliminate the rights of all Americans because somebody abuses a right. That is not what is acceptable. The patent troll is being used as a straw man. We are going to have legislation that will get this guy who has these frivolous lawsuits and is creating such havoc among small-business men and ripping them off. Just like the submarine patents, that can be taken care of without eliminating the patent rights of our people. What we have now is the straw man, the patent troll. When you hear a debate on this issue, all you will hear is patent troll, patent troll, patent troll, not recognizing that every provision in this bill diminishes--it is H.R. 9 that is before our Judiciary Committee now-- every provision makes it more difficult for the small inventor to enforce his patent against infringement by future megacorporations. Guess who is pushing this legislation? Huge megacorporations who want that little guy not to be able to sue a corporation that has stolen his intellectual property rights--this is basically--but they are going to say: Oh, no, it is the troll we are after, the troll. Well, as I say, there have been frivolous lawsuits, and there have been changes made in the judicial system itself of how to handle that, but there is no excuse for a troll--for this word ``troll,'' a straw man--get him to be used to damage and destroy the rights of the 95 percent of the technology creators in our country, take away their rights to get this straw man. Well, let me tell you how the word ``troll'' came about, the word ``patent troll.'' That is the reason you are hearing it. Every time you hear somebody say it, remember this. A group of corporate elitists got in a circle in a room--I know because one of the people who was in that meeting switched sides and came over and disclosed that these corporate executives said: What can we do to make it sound so sinister that we can get this passed? What words can we come up with that will just basically create such a bad feeling that the American people will not recognize that what we are really doing is trying to get the small inventor and make sure that the small inventor cannot sue us for things that we are using? Okay. They went around the room. This friend, the fellow who told me about this meeting, said: I came up with the words ``patent pirate,'' and then, by the time it got around the circle, somebody came up with the words ``patent troll.'' They said: That is it. That sounds so horrible, we can distract everybody's attention using that, and that is good enough. That sounds so evil that we can make sure that we go into battle using that in front of us, instead of we want to diminish the patent rights of honest, hard-working inventors who deserve to have a profit from their creation of their technology. That is just how cynical this debate has been. Every provision of H.R. 9--a bill now sitting in the Judiciary Committee--prevents--makes it more difficult for an inventor to actually enforce his rights and sue a company that is trying to steal, use his property rights, intellectual property rights, without compensating him. Let me give you an example of something in the bill and the changes they are proposing. Now, they are changing to loser pays legal fees. If you have a small inventor and if he sues that company and it is a huge company, that is usually what he has created and making profit from it, if he sues them and he loses, he will have to pay the legal fees for that huge company. Now, for the huge company, that is almost nothing. Taking on a case of one guy is nothing in their expense account because they have got 100 lawyers in a stable, waiting to help and being paid for. Well, if the inventor loses, that is it for him. That alone is wrong. In this legislation, H.R. 9, they have added another little proviso to destroy the small inventor; and that is, if someone invests in his invention, if someone invests in the invention and he manages to be successful and comes up with a new piece of technology and he is granted the patent and some megacorporation comes along and incorporates it and uses it and refuses to give this guy even a small payment for using the technology that he created, his intellectual property rights, if someone has invested in that inventor to help him make the invention, let's say that, when that inventor goes up to battle Goliath in his megacorporation, and let's say, even though he is right, he loses--because that happens sometimes in our country many times, where some people with a great number [[Page H3242]] of very sophisticated lawyers against the little guy, the little guy sometimes loses--well, what is going to happen now, according to this bill, is anyone who has invested in the inventor is going to have to be liable for the legal fees that come out of that suit. Who is ever going to give an investment to an inventor if that may open them up to liability? It is a liability, I might add, to some megacorporation, megamultinational corporation. Well, this provision just demonstrates what is the purpose of that provision. The provision is to beat down the little guy so that the big guys can steal, and that is evident, very evident; yet this bill is still moving forward. It is H.R. 9. It is in the Judiciary Committee now. As I say, H.R. 9 is the equivalent of saying: Because there are frivolous lawsuits, we are going to do everything we can to diminish the power of ordinary citizens to use the law and legal lawsuits for compensation for damages done to them. {time} 1200 Every provision of the bill weakens the right of the inventor to enforce his or her own patents. This bill actually passed the House last year. We struggled against it here in the House, but what happens is 90 percent of the people here in this body are just so busy that it is hard to pay attention to something that seems mundane like a patent law, and they just can't get themselves to focus on it. The American people also think that issues like this are so complicated that they can't get involved, but that leaves the whole playing field open to huge corporations that are out to enrich themselves by basically structuring law in a way that the power and the wealth will flow to them. Supposedly, the system our Founding Fathers wanted was for the wealth to flow broadly across our country so that every American could benefit from new technologies and new wealth that was being created. Now they want to corral that wealth; they want to diminish our rights in order to enrich themselves. These companies are not companies that are loyal to the United States. They are being loyal to their own profits, and some of them are multinational corporations that have actually no ties, real ties, to the United States. Let me just suggest that this bill did pass the House last year, but it was stopped in the Senate because, by then, we had made so much noise here. As I say, a bipartisan group, led by myself, Marcy Kaptur from Ohio, Mr. Massie from Kentucky, and other very strong activists, got together, and we made so much noise that the American universities finally paid attention because that bill that lets people steal patent rights was a huge threat to our university system. Had it been signed into law, the value of patents would have gone down dramatically. Let me go back to how that works. Remember, we were talking about a troll. What their definition of ``troll'' is is anybody who buys the patent rights from someone who has invented something and has a patent but who doesn't have the money to enforce it. Anybody who actually buys the patent rights but is not aiming at commercializing it himself and is going to enforce that and make a profit from it, that is going to be what they are stamping out. The universities are not there to commercialize what they are doing. They are there to basically have new discoveries, and they realize they have got a lot of patents that they own as part of their portfolios and that the actual values of those patent collections by the universities would have dramatically gone down. As well, of course, the patent value of any American would have gone down at that point. Also, other industries that are really important industries to our well-being--PhRMA and others, biotech industries--which struggle hard to come up with one patent that they then can sell in the market, are totally undermined by this effort to weaken our patent system. We managed to mobilize those people, and we stopped it the last time around; but the multinational corporations behind this legislation are so arrogant that this bill is now going to be shoved through again. This time, I think, with the American people, we can actually stop it here in the House, and we can certainly stop it in the Senate. We need the American people to mobilize and to call their Congressmen and ask: How do you stand on this terrible patent bill, H.R. 9? We need people who are going to stand up for the little guy in America, not for some megacorporation that is trying to permit the theft of American intellectual property rights by multinational corporations. Whether or not we succeed this time around is going to depend on, yes, the people here who understand the issue, fighting it out, being as aggressive as we can be, and the American people mobilizing to make sure we protect our sacred rights granted in the Constitution. One of the most important, I believe to be, is the right of technology ownership to people who create that technology. As I say, there are powerful interest groups in this city and in our country and in the world that try to change policy and are manipulating government. That is clear. That is fine. We have a democratic process. We just need to make sure that we are all being held accountable--that all of the Members of the House and the Senate are accountable for their votes--and that we know and the public at least has the chance to know what we are voting on. Actually, there is something happening right now where that is not true at all, and I sure hope the American people are paying attention to what is going on here in Washington concerning what they call TPP, the trade promotion pact, and then there is the TPA, which gives trade promotion authority to the Trans-Pacific Partnership, which is a trade treaty with the nations around the Pacific. The sinister nature of this can be seen because this trade treaty with the Pacific nations is secret. It has been declared classified. Right now, if I had gone down and read what now exists of this trade treaty and if I had announced it here on the floor, I would have been violating secrecy restrictions that they have declared--how about this?--in a policy about trade with major countries of the world, which will have an enormous impact on our well-being. It is being kept totally secret from the American people. How is that? Then they say Members of Congress can go down and look at it if they want to. Of course, as they have said, you can only do it within a certain time. They have regulated the time we can go down, and we are so busy that almost no Members of Congress will have gone down and read the actual documents that explain what that trade policy is that they are trying to foist on us. Please, I hope the American people understand that Members of Congress should not be voting on things that, number one, they don't have access to, but we should not be voting on something if we have not permitted the American people to know what that is. You will remember the famous statement by Ms. Pelosi about ObamaCare, which was that we have to pass it in order to find out what is in it. That is totally unacceptable. In trade treaties, these things will now pass rules and regulations based on this treaty that will impact our way of life here. Now, we have been briefed on it. I am on the Foreign Affairs Committee, and we were briefed on this the other day. The two main administration guys there--the people who had been Ambassadors and who are currently with the State Department--were briefing us. It is just like the boogey words over here, the scare words, in terms of patents. Now, this is all being used in just the opposite way with every glorious word--higher income for our people, more competitive for America, and all of the trade will come in our direction. Yet, when I asked these briefers, ``Hey, have you read this treaty?'' neither one of them had read it. So the people advocating for this treaty have not even read the treaty themselves. I found a provision in the treaty, or at least I understand it is in there--I have not verified it yet because we have all of this trouble to go through to verify what we are being asked to support--that says that patents in the United States will basically have to be published after 18 months. If a patent application is made and if after 18 months the patent is not granted, the patent will be published for the whole world to see. Uh-huh. Does that sound familiar? They tried to put that over on us 20 years ago. We managed to [[Page H3243]] thwart it then, and now they want to sneak it into a treaty, and the American people are not permitted to know what is in the treaty. Will that hurt us in some way? It will only make all of our technological discoveries available for our competitors overseas to be using long before the patent is even granted to the American inventor. You see what type of sinister forces we are up against. Who can sit down here and say how wonderful this treaty is going to be when the American people aren't allowed to see it and when almost all of us have not read it and when our briefers who come here have not even read it? I asked them yesterday, these briefers, ``Well, is this in the treaty?'' They didn't know. They didn't know whether or not this provision on patents was in there, which would undermine our rights to control our own creations here and have our opponents and our competitors overseas have all of the information about our technology even before the patent is granted. They didn't even know that was in there. They didn't know if it was or if it wasn't. By the way, if I had gone down and had finally gotten through the maze and had read the actual wording in the treaty, I would have been required not to have mentioned it today on the House floor as we are being restricted because it has been declared secret from the American people. This is outrageous. We don't need to have a trade promotion authority that will keep things from the American people, and we don't need to have a trade treaty with the Pacific and with all of these nations in Asia that will open us up to having our technology stolen, but also we don't know the other parts of it either. We keep hearing of the great things that are in it that are going to benefit the American workers, but we know what has happened in China. As for China, we were told, if we opened up our trade with China, China would modernize, and they would become a liberal, democratic country over the years. I call it the ``hug a Nazi, make a liberal'' theory. Basically, we were told that China would become a benevolent force. As we know now, China is becoming a malevolent force. China is becoming a threat to world peace, and the American people have not benefited from China trade as our good-paying jobs have gone to China. We don't want that for the rest of the world. We need to know what is in these trade treaties because they might have a major impact on bringing our working people's salaries down even more. Whether it is immigration or trade or patent law, our criteria should be what is in the interests of the people of the United States or whether it is in trade, where we have been basically having trade for the benefit of some mega-multinational corporations or patent law for the same clique. Guess what they also want? They want cheap labor, and that is why you see today this push to give 11 million people amnesty who have come here illegally. It is not 11 million. That is a 10-year-old figure. By the time they get done, they are going to bring 50 million people into our country who wouldn't be here otherwise. What is that going to do to our wage base? What is that going to do to Americans who are out looking for work right now? What is that going to do to our schools? to the money we have for our veterans' benefits? What is that going to do? We are undermining the well-being of the American people for the profits of some mega-multinational corporations. That is wrong. I am a Republican--I believe in free enterprise; I believe in private property; I believe in the profit motive--but we have to have a Congress that is working for the benefit of and protecting the rights of the American people, and they need to mobilize to make sure we are doing that by supporting them to make sure that our communities are not overrun with illegal immigrants. By the way, if you grant amnesty to 25 million illegals, there will be a huge surge of people from around the world who will know that all they have to do is outlast us, and they will get their amnesty. We need to make sure that these decisions, those things--immigration policy and trade policy and, yes, intellectual property protection policy--are done in a way that will benefit us and will not benefit our competitors. {time} 1215 When I say us, United States, it is us, U-S, us, the American people. That should be the basis of our criteria: what is going to be in the interests of the American people; not bring down their wages, not let people steal our technology and use it to compete against us. I ask my colleagues, please pay attention to H.R. 9 and these issues. Join with me in supporting the cause of the American people, of us instead of the big corporations. I yield back the balance of my time. ____________________",package_114_249.csv,41893,41893,41958,"[congressional record volume 161, number 75 (friday, may 15, 2015)] [house] [pages h3238-h3243] from the congressional record online through the government publishing office [ www.gpo.gov ] american patent system in danger the speaker pro tempore. under the speaker's announced policy of january 6, 2015, the gentleman from california (mr. rohrabacher) is recognized for 60 minutes as the designee of the majority leader. mr. rohrabacher. mr. speaker, i yield to the gentleman from texas (mr. conaway), my very good friend. repeal the oil export ban mr. conaway. mr. speaker, i thank the gentleman from california for yielding. this may not be the topic that he is going to talk about here, but i appreciate the time to be able to talk to something that is important to the folks of west texas and is actually important to all americans. i rise today to bring attention to an important issue that is gathering nationwide support, that is, repealing the export ban on crude oil. this week, i submitted an amendment to the national defense authorization act that would, in fact, repeal the ban. while the amendment did not ultimately make it into the final bill, i would like to take a moment to talk about the importance of lifting that ban. first, let's remember why the export ban was placed into law to begin with. because of the opec oil embargo of 1973, congress enacted the energy policy and conservation act, directing the president to ban crude oil exports. at the time, the ban served a purpose: to keep our oil at home in order to reduce our exposure to the wildly fluctuating markets of that time. today, though, the ban has outlived its purpose. it is an antiquated policy that is now only serving to harm americans and punish domestic production. for example, right now we allow iran to export more oil from their country than we do from our own domestic producers. this is wrongheaded and is long overdue for a change. the ban should be lifted, while leaving in place the necessary authorities to allow the president to act in an emergency and while preserving our strategic petroleum reserve. some claim that gasoline prices would increase if the ban is lifted, but analysis shows that to be incorrect. it shows that prices will actually fall, reducing the cost of the product that american families rely on every single day, which is another reason to support lifting the ban. in 2013, the united states was the number one oil producing nation in the world, surpassing saudi arabia and russia, a fact that many thought impossible only a decade ago. taking advantage of our nation's abundant resources by lifting the ban will, in fact, lower gasoline prices, create dependable, long- lasting jobs, and help expand our energy supply, making our nation more energy independent. i urge my colleagues to listen to the growing voice of the american people. it is time to lift the export ban on crude oil. mr. rohrabacher. mr. speaker, i rise today to warn my colleagues and [[page h3239]] the american people of several threats to their safety and their prosperity. these threats are observable from washington, d.c., but may not be observable to the american people. so i ask my colleagues to pay attention, number one, to what we are doing here, but i also would ask the american people to pay attention to what we are doing here. there are changes being maneuvered through our legislative branch and being mandated by executive orders from president obama that will undermine the economic well-being of hard-working americans and put us in jeopardy as a nation, both economically and in terms of our national security. those pursuing these egregious policy initiatives are fulfilling president obama's pledge to change america. and what most americans believed was a commitment to make our country better, to change america, was, in reality, an elitist and, i believe, an arrogant pledge to dramatically alter the basic and fundamental institutions and values that have been thought of by our patriots to be the essential elements defining our country and, of course, ensuring our freedom, security, and prosperity. what are these threats that i talk about? what are these threats that we need to pay attention to? they are not coming from one political party. they are not coming from the republicans or the democrats, as a party. you can see support across the board on both sides of the aisle on various sides of these issues. it is also not a threat just stemming from one person or one political leader, but it is, of course, what we are talking about. this threat is coming from a very powerful coalition seeking profit for themselves, even if it impoverishes the people or diminishes, at least, the economic well-being of the people of the united states. ironically, people who are enjoying their freedom and people who are enjoying their relative prosperity don't pay attention to some of the very intricate matters that have come before us in congress. but i can assure all of my fellow americans, there are powerful interests who are paying attention, and they are doing what they best can do to manipulate the law in a way that will enhance their profits, even if it is being done at the expense of the well-being of the american people. we can see this in dramatic changes that are being suggested in something that probably is very boring and tame to most americans when they even hear that someone is going to even talk about patent law-- patent law, which is the legal structure that enforces an inventor's right to own and control the product of his or her genius, labor, and investment for a given period of time. so i say, of course, that sounds pretty mundane, patent law. is it some detailed, intricate regulation and control of this area of economic life, of jobs, and things that we do in america? well, it is more than that. it may sound mundane; but, in reality, patent law and the patent rights of our people--the right of our people to own the technology they have created for a specific period of time-- has been a significant determinant in our country's way of life, our country's quality of life, and the security of our nation. this intellectual property right, the right through a patent ownership of 17 years' control and--not only of 17 years of control, but also of profit from one's own inventions, has been vital to our well-being as a nation and an essential part of the american dream. let's note that this was a right that was written into the constitution by our founding fathers. people know about the bill of rights. but the word ``right'' was only used in the body of the constitution once, and that was a section that guaranteed that americans--that what congress should do is to make sure that americans were guaranteed the right to control their own creations, if they are inventors or writers, for a given period of time, to profit from it so that they would have incentives to come up and be the most creative people in the world. {time} 1130 our founding fathers believed that technology and freedom would uplift ordinary americans and give all americans a chance at a decent life. and they were right. they wrote that into the constitution. it is right there. i believe it probably was under the influence of my favorite founding father, benjamin franklin. what we have to recognize is that over the years of our country, what has made us a great nation is our freedom and technology. this is especially true for minority americans and especially of black americans. let me note that black americans, if you take a look at the history of our patent system, are disproportionately inventive. in the history of this country, actually, as a proportion of their population, our black americans have been more inventive than any other group in our country. why is that? because patent law and property law were considered a constitutional right, and this was in the one area in which black americans were not discriminated against once they were freed in 1860 to 1865, when our black citizens were freed. after that we found that more patents proportionately went to that community because they needed an opportunity to uplift themselves free from outside forces beating down on them and denying their rights. mr. speaker, our patent system and the patents granted by washington thus respected the rights of all of our citizens, including our minority citizens. thus, making sure that we have patent protection has been one of the great boons to our minority populations, who otherwise suffered great discrimination and suffered from a lack of rights, except for the property rights that come from inventions. we see this has been good not just for minority americans however. let me note that we have, with technology, enhanced the ability of our people to work hard and get the job done and thus create wealth that was then owned by a large number of people rather than an elite. of course, when people understand the importance of technology--and business has more and more come to the understanding that it is new technology that will give them leverage and control over wealth. there has been an ongoing attempt in these last 20 years to dramatically diminish the patent protection enjoyed by americans, the patent protection written right into our constitution. the fact is that, for the last 20 years, i have been personally engaged along with a small group of people who believe that technology and freedom are essential to the well-being of our country. marcy kaptur of ohio and others have beat back many of these attempts to diminish the patent protection of our citizens. mr. speaker, america does have a patent system now. it is the strongest in the world. it is the strongest patent system in the world. we have always been proud of that. we have been proud that it has resulted in the fact that ordinary people have high standards of living here and they earn a good living from work because their work is enhanced by technological superiority over their competitors. by the way, mr. speaker, people work hard all over the world. everybody works hard. in all of these countries they work hard like our people work hard, but they don't have the technology that enhances their work and amplifies their energy and hard work so that more wealth is created. we have encouraged that since the day our constitution was ratified. that is why our people, when they work hard, end up living better because it gives us a competitive edge over the slave and oppressed labor in other countries. we, in fact, of course, know that the prosperity of average americans to us and to our founding fathers was an important goal. it wasn't just we were going to have a country that worked, but it was going to be a system with respect for rights that would lead to a good and decent living for all of us, for all the people, and not just a small elite of businessmen. well, we have done this over the years, and it has worked well. we have not had to have our own people who do work hard having to compete in terms of muscular and use of their physiques in order to produce goods, services, and wealth. they had the technology that permitted them to outcompete those other countries. also, mr. speaker, it ensures we have a more secure country. having a strong patent system where people are encouraged to invent new things and to be innovative has given us the edge over people who would do harm to our country. it has been important to our national security because we can't take [[page h3240]] on adversaries that don't respect human rights. if america was trying to secure itself from threats from groups of people around the world, leaders and gangsters who have no respect for human rights whatsoever, we lose because they are willing to lose all of their people, and they are willing for any amount of bloodshed to maintain control and power and, yes, to beat the united states and democratic countries. instead, mr. speaker, we have had technology at work helping defend our country, technology that would not have existed had we not had the patent protection that has been traditional to our country. even look today what is happening. without drones, where would we be? without drones fighting the good fight against isil, we would have to have thousands of americans there to fight that threat to mankind and the freedom of the world. instead, we have joined with the forces in erbil, which is the kurds, in standing tough directly against this onslaught of radical islam, and they are holding firm. but without our drones there to help them, they would be overrun. so this idea of property ownership of technology, of your technological developments, has been heart and soul to a prosperous and secure america. so when i say there are changes being proposed here in congress, they are trying to manipulate through the system that will affect the prosperity of the average american and the security of our nation. the public and my fellow colleagues need to pay attention because we are again facing a major onslaught, an attack on this fundamental right of technology ownership by those who create that technology. we are facing an onslaught that is being what? being masterminded, being masterminded and being pushed by megamultinational corporations who are not operating in the interests of the people of the united states. they could care less about all of that. but they are operating after what they can do to enrich themselves, even if it is not in the interests of the people of the united states and the interests of our security. these megamultinational corporations have pumped millions upon millions of dollars into lobbying for changes in our patent system that diminish the rights of the inventor and enables these multinational corporations to steal the intellectual property of our inventors and use it without giving compensation to the owners. this is in direct contradiction to what the constitution meant to guarantee and why it was written directly into the body of the constitution that this was a right that americans should be concerned about. mr. speaker, for the last 20 years there has been a stealth attack on america's strong and effective patent system. let us note that we have had the strongest and the most effective and recognized fair patent system in the world. all other patent systems have been judged against us, and now we have had these last 20 years an insidious undermining, and we are on the edge of a huge attack and perhaps successful destruction of fundamental patent rights that have been part of our people for many years. for example, 20 years ago, shortly after i came here, i found that in the gatt--that is a trade treaty that we have--there were provisions that were snuck into the gatt implementation legislation. that is legislation we passed here in congress in order to implement a trade agreement. these big corporate interests had put into the gatt implementation legislation without telling anybody two provisions that would have dramatically hurt the small inventors in this country. up until now, the constitution actually says that the inventors and the writers are guaranteed a specific time where they will control. they will be granted a specific time where they will control their patent, the rights to their patent, and the rights of their creative genius. well, it has traditionally been that once you file, as soon as the patent is actually granted to the inventor, then the clock starts ticking, and you get 17 years of protection. in different parts of the world, that is not what the law has been. in japan and in europe, it has been, oh, no, once you apply, after 20 years, even if it takes you 10 or 15 years to get your patent or 19 years, no, the clock is ticking then. you may not be granted your patent for 19 years, and then you have 1 year left, and that is no patent protection at all. so now they are trying to foist that on us. by the way, that would give people, knowing the clock is ticking--those small inventors in other countries are faced by people who are trying to pressure them to accept lesser claims to the legitimacy of their patent in order to basically prevent these guys, men and women, from being compensated the way they would be if they had a guaranteed term, which is part of our constitution. mr. speaker, the other provision that was there 20 years ago was the 18-month publication demand. that is, after 18 months, when someone applies for a patent--now, it is that once someone applies for a patent, that patent application is absolutely secret until that patent is granted. unless you have a patent in your hand--then it is published for the world because their ownership has been established. well, that has been traditionally what our patent office and our patent protection has been. basically, you have a secret and you developed it, you give it to the patent office. in fact, if anybody leaked that information, up until this point it has been a felony for anybody to tell anyone else until that patent is actually granted to the inventor. well, mr. speaker, they want to change this and say, if you haven't been granted your patent within 18 months, it will be published for the whole world. think about that. think about what i am saying. before, for our entire country's history, we have made sure that an application is secret so that nobody can get ahead of the inventor himself and the inventor won't be put in a bad spot. we made sure that until the patent is granted it is secret. they want to change that so that after 18 months it is published. what if that patent takes 10 years to issue? that means the man or woman who invented this piece of technology, our competitors overseas will be able to use it for all of that time because they will know all about it, but the patent hasn't been granted to the inventor yet. {time} 1145 i called that the ``steal american technologies act.'' that is what they were trying to do. that is what it would result in, and keep that in mind. the large multinationals sought to weaken the ability of our inventors to enforce patent rights. why? why do they want these big companies here in the united states? well, mostly, they are multinational companies now--they are big guys--and what they want to do is steal from the little guy--surprise, surprise. the big guys would try to manipulate the creation of law here that will enable them to take something from some person who has less economic power than themselves. our constitutional rights are supposed to protect the little guy's rights. we believe the newspaper should be able to be published, but little guys should be able to print a mimeographed piece of information themselves and distribute it or to gather. actually, what is hard for me to imagine is that, if these big guys were actually trying to diminish the rights of religion or speech in this country, or assembly, there would be an outcry; but, because it is the rights to own technology that you have created for a given period of time--it sounds too confusing, and they have let this feeling that maybe the people can't understand it, so they don't pay attention--they have let that lack of attention give them an opening to destroy and undermine the rights of americans, and i think this right is every bit as important as those other rights of religion and speech, et cetera. what they have set up in these last 20 years, it is an ongoing david versus goliath because some of the biggest corporations in the world are behind the effort to change the patent law. well, we beat them back. as i say, there was a coalition of us-- democrat and republican, marcy kaptur. we had some very good support from the black caucus. i might add that, again, they recognized how important inventions have been to the black community; but we beat them back. it was a bipartisan coalition. we have had to, over the years, compromise and negotiate certain things, but they have not gotten their way; but every time they have tried--they [[page h3241]] have tried to overwhelm those of us who are preventing the diminishing of patent rights--they have had to use scare tactics, always claiming that there is a boogeyman, there is a boogeyman out there, and that is the reason why we have to attack the inventor, because there is something out there that is really threatening and it is sinister and it is a sinister force that has to be defeated, that is why we have to take away all of the rights of the inventors over here, because they have now tried to tell the story in a way. it is the equivalent of saying we are going to take away the rights of every american to sue someone--or a company or anyone else who has caused them damage--because there are frivolous lawsuits. yes, there are frivolous lawsuits. there are some people who misuse our legal system. the last thing we want to do is eliminate the rights of all americans to use the court system to protect their rights. that is basically what is going on here. our own cherished patent rights to own what you have created--and this constitutional right that was given to americans--is on the verge of being dramatically altered and diminished and destroyed. by the way, the first boogeyman that was used in order to try to gain support for these very same two items that they snuck in the gatt, the boogeyman was called the submarine patentors. submarine patents--that is all you heard about before--as if a person who was filing for a patent was a submarine patentor. everybody has got to lose their patent rights in order to get the submarine patentor. what was the submarine patentor? a submarine patentor was--their definition--someone who files for a patent and then does everything they can to delay the patent from being issued; and then, after years and years, the patent is finally granted, and they have got all this leverage on all the people who have used the technology in the meantime. well, i am sorry; there were very few submarine patentors--there were some--but the fact is most inventors were struggling to get their patents issued to them as soon as possible because they needed the money, especially the little guys needed the money, and they were struggling, ``please, give us the patent so we can move forward on this,'' but, no, they were being presented as if they were trying to slow down the process. well, we finally, after really fighting for 10 years on this, reached the compromise, which my chief of staff, rick dykema, and myself negotiated, along with marcy kaptur, who negotiated this agreement with us, that if, indeed, there is a patent applicant who uses his abilities or uses various powers that he has in the bureaucratic process to delay the issue of the patent, well, if that happens, then, indeed, that patent, the time, the clock, has to start ticking against that guy, so he is using his own time when it has not been issued. well, that solved the problem--there it was--without diminishing the rights of those people who were struggling to get their patents out, but took 10 years or 15 years to get the patent issued. that wasn't a hard thing to negotiate, a hard thing to do, but it was a hard thing to accomplish because the people who were pushing submarine patents were really trying to diminish the patent rights of all americans so that they could steal from little guys and could take away their patent rights basically as soon as possible. well, now, the current boogeyman is the patent troll. now, there are some people who misuse and have frivolous lawsuits who use the patent system. there is no doubt about it. i might add this idea that people will be sent a thing--you are violating my patent, you either give my $5,000, or i am going to sue you, and then small businesses go along with it--there have been court cases now that have taken care of that. obviously, that is a swindle and something we can't put up with; that was happening to a degree, but there is no excuse, as i say, to eliminate the rights of all americans because somebody abuses a right. that is not what is acceptable. the patent troll is being used as a straw man. we are going to have legislation that will get this guy who has these frivolous lawsuits and is creating such havoc among small-business men and ripping them off. just like the submarine patents, that can be taken care of without eliminating the patent rights of our people. what we have now is the straw man, the patent troll. when you hear a debate on this issue, all you will hear is patent troll, patent troll, patent troll, not recognizing that every provision in this bill diminishes--it is h.r. 9 that is before our judiciary committee now-- every provision makes it more difficult for the small inventor to enforce his patent against infringement by future megacorporations. guess who is pushing this legislation? huge megacorporations who want that little guy not to be able to sue a corporation that has stolen his intellectual property rights--this is basically--but they are going to say: oh, no, it is the troll we are after, the troll. well, as i say, there have been frivolous lawsuits, and there have been changes made in the judicial system itself of how to handle that, but there is no excuse for a troll--for this word ``troll,'' a straw man--get him to be used to damage and destroy the rights of the 95 percent of the technology creators in our country, take away their rights to get this straw man. well, let me tell you how the word ``troll'' came about, the word ``patent troll.'' that is the reason you are hearing it. every time you hear somebody say it, remember this. a group of corporate elitists got in a circle in a room--i know because one of the people who was in that meeting switched sides and came over and disclosed that these corporate executives said: what can we do to make it sound so sinister that we can get this passed? what words can we come up with that will just basically create such a bad feeling that the american people will not recognize that what we are really doing is trying to get the small inventor and make sure that the small inventor cannot sue us for things that we are using? okay. they went around the room. this friend, the fellow who told me about this meeting, said: i came up with the words ``patent pirate,'' and then, by the time it got around the circle, somebody came up with the words ``patent troll.'' they said: that is it. that sounds so horrible, we can distract everybody's attention using that, and that is good enough. that sounds so evil that we can make sure that we go into battle using that in front of us, instead of we want to diminish the patent rights of honest, hard-working inventors who deserve to have a profit from their creation of their technology. that is just how cynical this debate has been. every provision of h.r. 9--a bill now sitting in the judiciary committee--prevents--makes it more difficult for an inventor to actually enforce his rights and sue a company that is trying to steal, use his property rights, intellectual property rights, without compensating him. let me give you an example of something in the bill and the changes they are proposing. now, they are changing to loser pays legal fees. if you have a small inventor and if he sues that company and it is a huge company, that is usually what he has created and making profit from it, if he sues them and he loses, he will have to pay the legal fees for that huge company. now, for the huge company, that is almost nothing. taking on a case of one guy is nothing in their expense account because they have got 100 lawyers in a stable, waiting to help and being paid for. well, if the inventor loses, that is it for him. that alone is wrong. in this legislation, h.r. 9, they have added another little proviso to destroy the small inventor; and that is, if someone invests in his invention, if someone invests in the invention and he manages to be successful and comes up with a new piece of technology and he is granted the patent and some megacorporation comes along and incorporates it and uses it and refuses to give this guy even a small payment for using the technology that he created, his intellectual property rights, if someone has invested in that inventor to help him make the invention, let's say that, when that inventor goes up to battle goliath in his megacorporation, and let's say, even though he is right, he loses--because that happens sometimes in our country many times, where some people with a great number [[page h3242]] of very sophisticated lawyers against the little guy, the little guy sometimes loses--well, what is going to happen now, according to this bill, is anyone who has invested in the inventor is going to have to be liable for the legal fees that come out of that suit. who is ever going to give an investment to an inventor if that may open them up to liability? it is a liability, i might add, to some megacorporation, megamultinational corporation. well, this provision just demonstrates what is the purpose of that provision. the provision is to beat down the little guy so that the big guys can steal, and that is evident, very evident; yet this bill is still moving forward. it is h.r. 9. it is in the judiciary committee now. as i say, h.r. 9 is the equivalent of saying: because there are frivolous lawsuits, we are going to do everything we can to diminish the power of ordinary citizens to use the law and legal lawsuits for compensation for damages done to them. {time} 1200 every provision of the bill weakens the right of the inventor to enforce his or her own patents. this bill actually passed the house last year. we struggled against it here in the house, but what happens is 90 percent of the people here in this body are just so busy that it is hard to pay attention to something that seems mundane like a patent law, and they just can't get themselves to focus on it. the american people also think that issues like this are so complicated that they can't get involved, but that leaves the whole playing field open to huge corporations that are out to enrich themselves by basically structuring law in a way that the power and the wealth will flow to them. supposedly, the system our founding fathers wanted was for the wealth to flow broadly across our country so that every american could benefit from new technologies and new wealth that was being created. now they want to corral that wealth; they want to diminish our rights in order to enrich themselves. these companies are not companies that are loyal to the united states. they are being loyal to their own profits, and some of them are multinational corporations that have actually no ties, real ties, to the united states. let me just suggest that this bill did pass the house last year, but it was stopped in the senate because, by then, we had made so much noise here. as i say, a bipartisan group, led by myself, marcy kaptur from ohio, mr. massie from kentucky, and other very strong activists, got together, and we made so much noise that the american universities finally paid attention because that bill that lets people steal patent rights was a huge threat to our university system. had it been signed into law, the value of patents would have gone down dramatically. let me go back to how that works. remember, we were talking about a troll. what their definition of ``troll'' is is anybody who buys the patent rights from someone who has invented something and has a patent but who doesn't have the money to enforce it. anybody who actually buys the patent rights but is not aiming at commercializing it himself and is going to enforce that and make a profit from it, that is going to be what they are stamping out. the universities are not there to commercialize what they are doing. they are there to basically have new discoveries, and they realize they have got a lot of patents that they own as part of their portfolios and that the actual values of those patent collections by the universities would have dramatically gone down. as well, of course, the patent value of any american would have gone down at that point. also, other industries that are really important industries to our well-being--phrma and others, biotech industries--which struggle hard to come up with one patent that they then can sell in the market, are totally undermined by this effort to weaken our patent system. we managed to mobilize those people, and we stopped it the last time around; but the multinational corporations behind this legislation are so arrogant that this bill is now going to be shoved through again. this time, i think, with the american people, we can actually stop it here in the house, and we can certainly stop it in the senate. we need the american people to mobilize and to call their congressmen and ask: how do you stand on this terrible patent bill, h.r. 9? we need people who are going to stand up for the little guy in america, not for some megacorporation that is trying to permit the theft of american intellectual property rights by multinational corporations. whether or not we succeed this time around is going to depend on, yes, the people here who understand the issue, fighting it out, being as aggressive as we can be, and the american people mobilizing to make sure we protect our sacred rights granted in the constitution. one of the most important, i believe to be, is the right of technology ownership to people who create that technology. as i say, there are powerful interest groups in this city and in our country and in the world that try to change policy and are manipulating government. that is clear. that is fine. we have a democratic process. we just need to make sure that we are all being held accountable--that all of the members of the house and the senate are accountable for their votes--and that we know and the public at least has the chance to know what we are voting on. actually, there is something happening right now where that is not true at all, and i sure hope the american people are paying attention to what is going on here in washington concerning what they call tpp, the trade promotion pact, and then there is the tpa, which gives trade promotion authority to the trans-pacific partnership, which is a trade treaty with the nations around the pacific. the sinister nature of this can be seen because this trade treaty with the pacific nations is secret. it has been declared classified. right now, if i had gone down and read what now exists of this trade treaty and if i had announced it here on the floor, i would have been violating secrecy restrictions that they have declared--how about this?--in a policy about trade with major countries of the world, which will have an enormous impact on our well-being. it is being kept totally secret from the american people. how is that? then they say members of congress can go down and look at it if they want to. of course, as they have said, you can only do it within a certain time. they have regulated the time we can go down, and we are so busy that almost no members of congress will have gone down and read the actual documents that explain what that trade policy is that they are trying to foist on us. please, i hope the american people understand that members of congress should not be voting on things that, number one, they don't have access to, but we should not be voting on something if we have not permitted the american people to know what that is. you will remember the famous statement by ms. pelosi about obamacare, which was that we have to pass it in order to find out what is in it. that is totally unacceptable. in trade treaties, these things will now pass rules and regulations based on this treaty that will impact our way of life here. now, we have been briefed on it. i am on the foreign affairs committee, and we were briefed on this the other day. the two main administration guys there--the people who had been ambassadors and who are currently with the state department--were briefing us. it is just like the boogey words over here, the scare words, in terms of patents. now, this is all being used in just the opposite way with every glorious word--higher income for our people, more competitive for america, and all of the trade will come in our direction. yet, when i asked these briefers, ``hey, have you read this treaty?'' neither one of them had read it. so the people advocating for this treaty have not even read the treaty themselves. i found a provision in the treaty, or at least i understand it is in there--i have not verified it yet because we have all of this trouble to go through to verify what we are being asked to support--that says that patents in the united states will basically have to be published after 18 months. if a patent application is made and if after 18 months the patent is not granted, the patent will be published for the whole world to see. uh-huh. does that sound familiar? they tried to put that over on us 20 years ago. we managed to [[page h3243]] thwart it then, and now they want to sneak it into a treaty, and the american people are not permitted to know what is in the treaty. will that hurt us in some way? it will only make all of our technological discoveries available for our competitors overseas to be using long before the patent is even granted to the american inventor. you see what type of sinister forces we are up against. who can sit down here and say how wonderful this treaty is going to be when the american people aren't allowed to see it and when almost all of us have not read it and when our briefers who come here have not even read it? i asked them yesterday, these briefers, ``well, is this in the treaty?'' they didn't know. they didn't know whether or not this provision on patents was in there, which would undermine our rights to control our own creations here and have our opponents and our competitors overseas have all of the information about our technology even before the patent is granted. they didn't even know that was in there. they didn't know if it was or if it wasn't. by the way, if i had gone down and had finally gotten through the maze and had read the actual wording in the treaty, i would have been required not to have mentioned it today on the house floor as we are being restricted because it has been declared secret from the american people. this is outrageous. we don't need to have a trade promotion authority that will keep things from the american people, and we don't need to have a trade treaty with the pacific and with all of these nations in asia that will open us up to having our technology stolen, but also we don't know the other parts of it either. we keep hearing of the great things that are in it that are going to benefit the american workers, but we know what has happened in china. as for china, we were told, if we opened up our trade with china, china would modernize, and they would become a liberal, democratic country over the years. i call it the ``hug a nazi, make a liberal'' theory. basically, we were told that china would become a benevolent force. as we know now, china is becoming a malevolent force. china is becoming a threat to world peace, and the american people have not benefited from china trade as our good-paying jobs have gone to china. we don't want that for the rest of the world. we need to know what is in these trade treaties because they might have a major impact on bringing our working people's salaries down even more. whether it is immigration or trade or patent law, our criteria should be what is in the interests of the people of the united states or whether it is in trade, where we have been basically having trade for the benefit of some mega-multinational corporations or patent law for the same clique. guess what they also want? they want cheap labor, and that is why you see today this push to give 11 million people amnesty who have come here illegally. it is not 11 million. that is a 10-year-old figure. by the time they get done, they are going to bring 50 million people into our country who wouldn't be here otherwise. what is that going to do to our wage base? what is that going to do to americans who are out looking for work right now? what is that going to do to our schools? to the money we have for our veterans' benefits? what is that going to do? we are undermining the well-being of the american people for the profits of some mega-multinational corporations. that is wrong. i am a republican--i believe in free enterprise; i believe in private property; i believe in the profit motive--but we have to have a congress that is working for the benefit of and protecting the rights of the american people, and they need to mobilize to make sure we are doing that by supporting them to make sure that our communities are not overrun with illegal immigrants. by the way, if you grant amnesty to 25 million illegals, there will be a huge surge of people from around the world who will know that all they have to do is outlast us, and they will get their amnesty. we need to make sure that these decisions, those things--immigration policy and trade policy and, yes, intellectual property protection policy--are done in a way that will benefit us and will not benefit our competitors. {time} 1215 when i say us, united states, it is us, u-s, us, the american people. that should be the basis of our criteria: what is going to be in the interests of the american people; not bring down their wages, not let people steal our technology and use it to compete against us. i ask my colleagues, please pay attention to h.r. 9 and these issues. join with me in supporting the cause of the american people, of us instead of the big corporations. i yield back the balance of my time. ____________________",41893
CREC-2015-05-15-pt1-PgH3243-2,CREC-2015-05-15,114,A MISSION OF MERCY,"[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 75 (Friday, May 15, 2015)] [House] [Pages H3243-H3246] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] A MISSION OF MERCY The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. LaMalfa). Under the Speaker's announced policy of January 6, 2015, the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Al Green) is recognized for 60 minutes as the designee of the minority leader. Mr. AL GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, today I am on a mission of mercy; a mission of mercy, Mr. Speaker, because a U.S. military helicopter has gone down in Nepal on Tuesday, May 12. They were on a mission of mercy. The United States of America always responds to those who are in need, those who are in harm's way. This was no exception. Our very finest volunteer to serve in our military. Many of them will go to distant places, and some of them will not always return home the same way they left. Some will not return at all. I am honored to say that we should be proud of those who serve. Regardless as to how we feel about conflicts around the world, we ought to appreciate the service of those who are in our military, and we ought to want every one of them to return home safely. So today I stand in the well of the House on a mission of mercy for our military persons who have lost their lives in distant places, but more specifically in Nepal. We are there for a reason, Mr. Speaker. We are there because Ruth Smeltzer is right: Some measure their lives by days and years, Others by heartthrobs, passions, and tears, But the surest measure under God's Sun. Is what for others in your lifetime have you done. We, in the United States of America, are doing things for others in the lifetime of people in this country currently, and we do it in the lifetime of our Nation. We want it said that we were there to help those in time of need. So, Mr. Speaker, there is a time of need for those in Nepal. On April 25, a 7.8 magnitude earthquake hit Nepal; 7.8. Thereafter, on May 12, a 7.3 magnitude earthquake hit Nepal. These earthquakes have devastated this country. Lives have been lost, more than 8,000 lives. People have been injured, [[Page H3244]] more than 17,000. Millions have been displaced, nearly 3 million. Millions have been affected, more than 8 million. Four Americans lost their lives. The United States moved quickly. We committed the sum of approximately $10 million initially, but that has now grown to more than $32 million. The relief efforts from the United States are growing. Not only are we placing dollars into the relief effort, we are also placing our military equipment into these efforts. That is why the helicopter was there in Nepal, to help in this time of need. So I am proud to say that we are there to help. The need is estimated to be approximately $415 million. The number could go up. But if it is that amount, we can do as much as we can, and we should do as much as we can to help the people of Nepal. I want you to know that the people of Nepal and the Nepalese community in the United States of America across the length and breadth of our country are pitching in. In my district, the Ninth Congressional District of Houston, Texas, on May 2, 2015, we held a meeting. That meeting was to discuss how we can be of service, the congressional office, and how the community can come together to provide assistance for those in need in Nepal. At that meeting, I am proud to say we had a good many persons in attendance. It was a community meeting. In the true spirit of community, which has the word ``unity'' in it, there was unity within this community meeting. I am proud to say that the members of the Nepalese Association of Houston were present. The president, Mr. Ghimirey was there, and he gave a report. The secretary, Mr. Nepal, was there. He gave a report. The building that we were in was at the International Center owned by Mr. Wei Li, and we are honored that he opened the doors of his facility for this purpose. But it is important to know that the community was in unity on the effort to help those in Nepal. Some of the members of the community in attendance: the Bhutanese community was there. The Taiwanese community was there. The Latino community was in attendance. The Burmese community was in attendance. The Pakistani community, the Vietnamese community, all in attendance. Asian realtors were there. The Southwest Management District was there. There were Venerables there, those who are of the Buddhist faith. The Filipino community was represented. The community activists of all stripes, of different ethnicities were in attendance. The Jewish community was there, and a report was given in terms of how Israel has been involved. The Turkish community was there, the Indian community. The Lion's Club was represented. The Chinese community was in attendance. And the African American community was there, as well as a representative of the NAACP. We had a cross-section of people all there for the purpose of becoming a part of the mission of mercy, for the purpose of making sure that we fulfill our obligation to help those in times of need, and I am proud to say that a goal of $100,000 was set for the purpose of aiding those in Nepal just from that meeting. There are many others who have other goals, some higher, some lower, but I believe this goal will be met because it was indicated at the meeting that approximately $60,000 had been committed. I am proud to know that the community, in the spirit of unity, has come together. We announced at that meeting that our congressional office, working with other Members of Congress, we have filed a bill, H.R. 2033, to accord, to provide temporary protected status for the Nepalese community in Texas, in the United States of America, if you are a citizen of Nepal. If you are a citizen of Nepal, and you find yourself here on some sort of visa, if you are here lawfully in the country, temporary protected status would extend the stay for those who are lawfully in the country. It will not change the immigration status of a single person. It will simply extend the stay. This is the American way. It is not the first time we have done this. This is the American way. When people are here and their visas expire, and they are subject to going back into harm's way or going back to their country, which would place them in harm's way, we have done the honorable thing, the right thing. We have on many occasions allowed them to stay here rather than send them into harm's way. That is what this bill would do, H.R. 2033. It would permit them to stay in this country and not return to a country that has been devastated by not one, but two earthquakes, a 7.3 and a 7.8. These two earthquakes have left much damage across the length and breadth of the country. The country is recovering. We need to make sure that we do all that we can to help the people of Nepal. This is why the bill was introduced, and I am proud to say that a good many persons have joined this mission of mercy. The Honorable Mike Honda is an original cosponsor, but there are others who are cosponsors, and in our tradition we like to thank people. It is a tradition of the House to thank people who are a part of a process that is helping someone. When you have people of goodwill who have put their names on the line, you ought to acknowledge that they are doing it. So I am proud to acknowledge people of goodwill, members of the United States House of Representatives who are a part of this mission of mercy, who have signed on to H.R. 2033. I want to mention each and every name. There are others who will sign on. This is not an all-inclusive list, but as of today: The Honorable Mike Honda, who was an original cosponsor; the Honorable Rrad Ashford-- and by the way these are alphabetized--the Honorable Karen Bass; the Honorable Mike Capuano; the Honorable Tony Cardenas; the Honorable Judy Chu; the Honorable Yvette Clarke; the Honorable Emanuel Cleaver; the Honorable James Clyburn; the Honorable Steve Cohen; the Honorable John Conyers. For those of you who may just have joined us, these are the people who are on a mission of mercy. These are the people who are on H.R. 2033, a bill designed to help people stay in this country and not go back into harm's way to Nepal. By the way, this bill would impact about 10,000 to 25,000 people. It is very difficult to count, but this is a guesstimate at best, the number of people who might benefit by staying in this country. I said the Honorable John Conyers is on this mission of mercy; the Honorable Joseph Crowley; the Honorable Henry Cuellar; the Honorable Danny Davis; the Honorable John Delaney; the Honorable Suzan DelBene; the Honorable Mark DeSaulnier; the Honorable Tammy Duckworth; the Honorable Keith Ellison; the Honorable Marcia Fudge; the Honorable Alan Grayson; the Honorable Gene Green; the Honorable Raul Grijalva. As I continue with this list, let me make mention of this: This is not the first time, as I have indicated, that we have had temporary status granted to other countries. {time} 1230 It was done under the Clinton administration, and it was granted to Montserrat. It was done under the Clinton administration as well for Nicaragua, following a hurricane, as well as for the Honduras. It was done with the Bush administration for El Salvador. It was done for the Obama administration for those who suffered from an earthquake in Haiti. So these are some of the people: the Honorable Tammy Duckworth, the Honorable Keith Ellison, the Honorable Marcia Fudge, the Honorable Alan Grayson, the Honorable Gene Green, the Honorable Raul Grijalva, the Honorable Luis Gutierrez, the Honorable Denny Heck, the Honorable Sheila Jackson Lee, the Honorable Hakeem Jeffries, the Honorable Eddie Bernice Johnson, the Honorable Hank Johnson, the Honorable Daniel Kildee, the Honorable Barbara Lee, the Honorable John Lewis, the Honorable Zoe Lofgren, the Honorable Jim McDermott, the Honorable Grace Meng, the Honorable Gwen Moore, the Honorable Grace Napolitano, the Honorable Jared Polis, the Honorable Charles Rangel, the Honorable Cedric Richmond, the Honorable Bobby Rush, the Honorable Linda T. Sanchez, the Honorable Loretta Sanchez, the Honorable Bobby Scott, the Honorable Jose Serrano, the Honorable Brad Sherman, the Honorable Chris Smith, the Honorable Jackie Speier, the Honorable Bennie Thompson, the Honorable Chris Van Hollen, the Honorable Maxine Waters, and the Honorable Bonnie Watson Coleman. [[Page H3245]] I might add that this is bipartisan. It is always a wonderful thing to have bipartisan legislation. This legislation is bipartisan in nature. I want you to know that, in sponsoring this legislation, it is our hope that the United States House of Representatives will take it up and that it will come to the floor of the House for a vote, so that we can do more than say we support the people of Nepal. This is a way for the Congress of the United States of America to go beyond endorsing aid. It is a way to provide aid because the people who are here will have an opportunity to continue to work. As they continue to work, they will be permitted to return funds to their home country. This is a way for us to not only keep people out of harm's way, but to allow those who are here to send money to those who are in harm's way. They can send dollars back to Nepal to help their country in a time of need. When we had the circumstance in Honduras that required temporary protective status, persons were allowed to stay. Since that occurred, approximately $31 billion has been sent back to Honduras from those who are in the diaspora. With reference to Nicaragua, for those who are in the diaspora, I want to commend you because you have sent approximately $10 billion home. For those in El Salvador, I want to commend you because you have sent approximately $45 billion home. For those in Haiti, in the diaspora, you have sent approximately $6 billion home. People in the diaspora from these various countries want to do what they can to be of assistance to their people at home. This is a way of providing them an opportunity to be of assistance to those that they love, those who find themselves in harm's way, those who are in their homelands. Well, we hope that this piece of legislation will pass. If this piece of legislation passes, it will give those persons who are here the opportunity to continue to be a part of the mission of mercy by sending dollars to those who are in harm's way. It is nothing unique, but it is something very much needed for those who are in Nepal. I am proud to tell you that, as we go forward with this effort, we will extend the reach to the United States Senate. We will ask that the Senators please become a part of this. This is an effort that we all, in my opinion, can embrace. We can do this, and we can do it without it costing us--meaning the government--any money. The Government of the United States of America is already sending tens of millions of dollars by way of aid and equipment, and we are doing a lot, but this is another way for the government to be of assistance without spending additional money to be of assistance to the people who are here by not putting them back in harm's way, but at the same time, to allow them--those who are here--to be of benefit to their country by sending dollars back in the form of remittances. I believe that the House of Representatives and the Senate of the United States of America can get this done. I am going to ask my colleagues to please give consideration to H.R. 2033. Let us join hands together, those in the House and Senate, and be on this mission of mercy to see if we can do something to provide aid and comfort for those who are in Nepal by passing legislation to allow those who are in this country to stay in the United States of America. We also are on this mission of mercy because Dr. King is right--I mentioned Ruth Smeltzer--when he reminded us that life is an ``inescapable network of mutuality, tied in a single garment of destiny.'' What impacts one directly impacts all indirectly, meaning what is happening to those in Nepal will have an impact on us. It may not be a direct impact, but there will be an indirect impact. It will happen in ways that we may not be able to measure, but it will. It will impact because there are people who are going to try to migrate, people trying to get out of harm's way and try to get to other countries. My hope is that we will do our share to help those who are trying to get out of harm's way and do our share to prevent those who are here from going back into harm's way. Dr. King is right; life is an inescapable network of mutuality. We are bonded together. This is one island that we are all stranded on, the island that we know as Earth. If we are going to live together as brothers and sisters, we have to treat each other as such. This is a time for us to be responsive to our brothers and sisters in Nepal because there is another comment I hear quite regularly when we hear of disasters like these. People will mention that: ``But for the grace of God, there go I.'' We have had our share of mishaps in the United States of America; and, when we have had our share of mishaps, people have always sent their best wishes and aid to us. People have been of assistance to us throughout the years, the decades, the century. People have been of assistance to us. But for the grace of God, there go I. I am so proud of the response that we had in this country after we suffered 9/11. There were people who showed us a great amount of sympathy and empathy, people who wanted to do all that they can to let us know that they cared and that they were concerned and that they did not, in fact, support--and, in fact, condemned--the dastardly deeds that were perpetrated. It was a time for the world to come together. This is another such occasion, but not the same--no two unpleasant circumstances are the same--but this one in Nepal is one that we can embrace. This is a time for us to show the world that we understand that there are things that we can do and will do. We are, by the way. We have sent millions of dollars. We have our aid in the form of the soft side of our military. Our heavy equipment and helicopters are there. As I mentioned earlier, we did lose a helicopter, and we lost some lives. We are stepping up to the plate. The United States of America is doing its part. I want us to continue to do our part. I want us to do all that we can to make sure that every person knows where we stand. In so doing, I want to mention that we in the United States have been blessed to have this melting pot of people who come from all over the world to be a part of this great American Dream, the great American ideal, and the people who have come here from the country of Nepal are no exception. They are hard-working people. They have shown their desire to be a part of the fiber and fabric of the United States of America. They have been people of good will. I ask that we extend the hand of friendship to these people of good will, especially during this month, which is a month that we are to give honor and show respect to those of Asian heritage, if you will. This is Asian and Pacific Islander Heritage Month. This is a great time for us, during this month, to show our concern for the Asian population that is in Nepal. We have the opportunity to pass H.R. 2033 and make a difference in the lives of a good many people in this country. I do want to mention again, for fear that some may not have heard, the community in Houston is well organized. Immediately after the first earthquake hit, we had a meeting, and we had scores of people in attendance. These were Nepalese persons. They were there to show their unity with each other. They also had a plan of action. Their plan of action included raising money so that they could send it to their homeland to be of assistance, and they want to send this money directly there themselves. I admire them for their lofty goals and their efforts. They want to send the money themselves to their homeland. They want to make sure that there is no question that they have done their part. The beautiful thing about this effort is that it became infectious and other members of the community decided: If not but for the grace of God, there go I. Here is my opportunity to be of assistance. Here is my opportunity to unify. It was an amazing sight to see, on May 2, when we had all of these various organizations and groups coming together, all of them pledging their support, all of them pledging their desire to be of assistance to the Nepalese community in Houston, Texas, across the length and breadth of this country, but also to those who are actually in Nepal in a time of need. [[Page H3246]] I am so honored that they have lofty goals that they, I believe, will meet--I plan to do my part--but I am also honored that they decided that this was something that we could all embrace. They have reached out to the entire community, and the community has responded. I beg my friends across all sides of the aisle, this is not a Republican or a Democratic resolution--or bill, if you will. This is a bill, H.R. 2033, that already has bipartisan support. It is not about what part of the country you are from. It is not about how many people you happen to represent from a certain community. It is about helping somebody in a country that is in need of help. I beg that my colleagues would sign on to H.R. 2033--those who have not, many have indicated they will--so that we can bring this bill to the floor of the United States House of Representatives. It is not going to cost us any additional money to bring it to the House of Representatives. It will not in any way grant any status to persons that they don't already have. It will simply extend the period of time that they will be allowed to stay in this country without having to return to harm's way. I am grateful for the time today, Mr. Speaker. I do believe that this is time that has been well spent, and I do want to, as I close, let those families who have friends and relatives who are serving in our military or who are in Nepal, especially those who have family members that were associated with the military and the loss related to that helicopter crash, but also those who are with USAID and those there with various other organizations that are in service and doing what they do to make a difference, thank all of them for being there on the ground. I also heard someone representing our military this morning. When speaking of those who are there as a part of that military effort and those who lost their lives, there was a request for prayers. There was a request that we would pray for those who are injured and those who have lost their lives. I believe in prayer. I do believe that it has a positive impact. I believe it can make a difference. I believe that there are times when there are no answers available to people, when you cannot explain what has happened, when the inexplicable is confronting you. At those times, many people turn to prayer because prayer can provide what words cannot explain. {time} 1245 Prayer can give you the hope that you need to go forward. Prayer can give you the sense of I can, the belief that I will, the belief that I will go on and continue to make a difference, that it is expected that I go on sometimes. People think that there is no more hope, and they should just give up right here and right now. Prayer can do marvelous things, so I am going to end with a prayer because I believe that the request should be honored from the military person who made the request. Without knowing the name, I want you to know that I appreciate that you indicated that we should pray for our people in harm's way. I will give this prayer from my heart, not from my head. I have no paper that I will be reading when I present this prayer. It is a prayer that has been written across my heart for a time such as this, and I pray, as I give this prayer, that it will be received with the intentionality that I will send it. It is a prayer for all. Those who would like to can join me in your tradition. However you pray is okay with me. I will lower my head to give this prayer, and I will close my eyes. Most gracious Creator, we know You by many names, but we also know that, by any name, You are the creator of all that was, is, and ever shall be, and we know that we are Your children, and as Your children, You have given us the greatest gift that we could ever receive, the gift of life. Regardless as to what we think of ourselves, we know, many of us in our hearts, that we are blessed beyond measure to simply have the gift of life. We know that we are better than we deserve, simply because we have the gift of life, because we cannot earn the gift of life. There is nothing that we could have done to earn it or merit the gift of life. It is something that we get because of grace. By Your grace, I stand here as Your servant, asking Your mercy for those who are in harm's way in the nation of Nepal. I ask Your mercy, I ask Your blessings for those who are reaching out and trying to do what they can to help someone in a time of need. I ask that You please strengthen those who are there who, tonight, may find that they do not have shelter, but please give them some sense of belief that help is on the way. Help them to believe that there are people in a distant place called the United States of America who are people of good will who are going to do what they can to make sure that they get the shelter they need. Please help those who may be suffering the pains associated with having been a part of a tragic circumstance and having been hurt physically. Help those who are suffering to know that help is on the way, that we plan to make sure that they get the medical aid that they need and the treatment that they need because You have given us so much and those who have so much, as we, should do as much as we can to help people who have little. I ask, gracious Creator, that You strengthen all of us in this House of Representatives so that we may continue to go forward to do Your will to make Your world a better place. We were given the precious gift of the life for a reason. There are many reasons that may be cited, but I believe that we have been blessed with the gift of life so that we may be a blessing to others. This is our opportunity to be a blessing to others, and I beg and I pray that we, who have received the precious gift of life, when we finally, 1 day, have the opportunity to look back upon all that our lives stand for, perhaps we will, at some point in time, have an opportunity to see the omniscient, the omnipresent, and the omnipotent, and we will have an opportunity to tell and go over the record of our lives. On that day, I hope that we will be able to say that we did all that we could to help the people of Nepal. We thank You for the gift of life, and we pray that we will use it wisely and well and make a difference in the lives of others. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. God bless you, Mr. Speaker, and God bless the United States of America. I yield back the balance of my time. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 75 (Friday, May 15, 2015)] [House] [Pages H3243-H3246] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] A MISSION OF MERCY The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. LaMalfa). Under the Speaker's announced policy of January 6, 2015, the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Al Green) is recognized for 60 minutes as the designee of the minority leader. Mr. AL GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, today I am on a mission of mercy; a mission of mercy, Mr. Speaker, because a U.S. military helicopter has gone down in Nepal on Tuesday, May 12. They were on a mission of mercy. The United States of America always responds to those who are in need, those who are in harm's way. This was no exception. Our very finest volunteer to serve in our military. Many of them will go to distant places, and some of them will not always return home the same way they left. Some will not return at all. I am honored to say that we should be proud of those who serve. Regardless as to how we feel about conflicts around the world, we ought to appreciate the service of those who are in our military, and we ought to want every one of them to return home safely. So today I stand in the well of the House on a mission of mercy for our military persons who have lost their lives in distant places, but more specifically in Nepal. We are there for a reason, Mr. Speaker. We are there because Ruth Smeltzer is right: Some measure their lives by days and years, Others by heartthrobs, passions, and tears, But the surest measure under God's Sun. Is what for others in your lifetime have you done. We, in the United States of America, are doing things for others in the lifetime of people in this country currently, and we do it in the lifetime of our Nation. We want it said that we were there to help those in time of need. So, Mr. Speaker, there is a time of need for those in Nepal. On April 25, a 7.8 magnitude earthquake hit Nepal; 7.8. Thereafter, on May 12, a 7.3 magnitude earthquake hit Nepal. These earthquakes have devastated this country. Lives have been lost, more than 8,000 lives. People have been injured, [[Page H3244]] more than 17,000. Millions have been displaced, nearly 3 million. Millions have been affected, more than 8 million. Four Americans lost their lives. The United States moved quickly. We committed the sum of approximately $10 million initially, but that has now grown to more than $32 million. The relief efforts from the United States are growing. Not only are we placing dollars into the relief effort, we are also placing our military equipment into these efforts. That is why the helicopter was there in Nepal, to help in this time of need. So I am proud to say that we are there to help. The need is estimated to be approximately $415 million. The number could go up. But if it is that amount, we can do as much as we can, and we should do as much as we can to help the people of Nepal. I want you to know that the people of Nepal and the Nepalese community in the United States of America across the length and breadth of our country are pitching in. In my district, the Ninth Congressional District of Houston, Texas, on May 2, 2015, we held a meeting. That meeting was to discuss how we can be of service, the congressional office, and how the community can come together to provide assistance for those in need in Nepal. At that meeting, I am proud to say we had a good many persons in attendance. It was a community meeting. In the true spirit of community, which has the word ``unity'' in it, there was unity within this community meeting. I am proud to say that the members of the Nepalese Association of Houston were present. The president, Mr. Ghimirey was there, and he gave a report. The secretary, Mr. Nepal, was there. He gave a report. The building that we were in was at the International Center owned by Mr. Wei Li, and we are honored that he opened the doors of his facility for this purpose. But it is important to know that the community was in unity on the effort to help those in Nepal. Some of the members of the community in attendance: the Bhutanese community was there. The Taiwanese community was there. The Latino community was in attendance. The Burmese community was in attendance. The Pakistani community, the Vietnamese community, all in attendance. Asian realtors were there. The Southwest Management District was there. There were Venerables there, those who are of the Buddhist faith. The Filipino community was represented. The community activists of all stripes, of different ethnicities were in attendance. The Jewish community was there, and a report was given in terms of how Israel has been involved. The Turkish community was there, the Indian community. The Lion's Club was represented. The Chinese community was in attendance. And the African American community was there, as well as a representative of the NAACP. We had a cross-section of people all there for the purpose of becoming a part of the mission of mercy, for the purpose of making sure that we fulfill our obligation to help those in times of need, and I am proud to say that a goal of $100,000 was set for the purpose of aiding those in Nepal just from that meeting. There are many others who have other goals, some higher, some lower, but I believe this goal will be met because it was indicated at the meeting that approximately $60,000 had been committed. I am proud to know that the community, in the spirit of unity, has come together. We announced at that meeting that our congressional office, working with other Members of Congress, we have filed a bill, H.R. 2033, to accord, to provide temporary protected status for the Nepalese community in Texas, in the United States of America, if you are a citizen of Nepal. If you are a citizen of Nepal, and you find yourself here on some sort of visa, if you are here lawfully in the country, temporary protected status would extend the stay for those who are lawfully in the country. It will not change the immigration status of a single person. It will simply extend the stay. This is the American way. It is not the first time we have done this. This is the American way. When people are here and their visas expire, and they are subject to going back into harm's way or going back to their country, which would place them in harm's way, we have done the honorable thing, the right thing. We have on many occasions allowed them to stay here rather than send them into harm's way. That is what this bill would do, H.R. 2033. It would permit them to stay in this country and not return to a country that has been devastated by not one, but two earthquakes, a 7.3 and a 7.8. These two earthquakes have left much damage across the length and breadth of the country. The country is recovering. We need to make sure that we do all that we can to help the people of Nepal. This is why the bill was introduced, and I am proud to say that a good many persons have joined this mission of mercy. The Honorable Mike Honda is an original cosponsor, but there are others who are cosponsors, and in our tradition we like to thank people. It is a tradition of the House to thank people who are a part of a process that is helping someone. When you have people of goodwill who have put their names on the line, you ought to acknowledge that they are doing it. So I am proud to acknowledge people of goodwill, members of the United States House of Representatives who are a part of this mission of mercy, who have signed on to H.R. 2033. I want to mention each and every name. There are others who will sign on. This is not an all-inclusive list, but as of today: The Honorable Mike Honda, who was an original cosponsor; the Honorable Rrad Ashford-- and by the way these are alphabetized--the Honorable Karen Bass; the Honorable Mike Capuano; the Honorable Tony Cardenas; the Honorable Judy Chu; the Honorable Yvette Clarke; the Honorable Emanuel Cleaver; the Honorable James Clyburn; the Honorable Steve Cohen; the Honorable John Conyers. For those of you who may just have joined us, these are the people who are on a mission of mercy. These are the people who are on H.R. 2033, a bill designed to help people stay in this country and not go back into harm's way to Nepal. By the way, this bill would impact about 10,000 to 25,000 people. It is very difficult to count, but this is a guesstimate at best, the number of people who might benefit by staying in this country. I said the Honorable John Conyers is on this mission of mercy; the Honorable Joseph Crowley; the Honorable Henry Cuellar; the Honorable Danny Davis; the Honorable John Delaney; the Honorable Suzan DelBene; the Honorable Mark DeSaulnier; the Honorable Tammy Duckworth; the Honorable Keith Ellison; the Honorable Marcia Fudge; the Honorable Alan Grayson; the Honorable Gene Green; the Honorable Raul Grijalva. As I continue with this list, let me make mention of this: This is not the first time, as I have indicated, that we have had temporary status granted to other countries. {time} 1230 It was done under the Clinton administration, and it was granted to Montserrat. It was done under the Clinton administration as well for Nicaragua, following a hurricane, as well as for the Honduras. It was done with the Bush administration for El Salvador. It was done for the Obama administration for those who suffered from an earthquake in Haiti. So these are some of the people: the Honorable Tammy Duckworth, the Honorable Keith Ellison, the Honorable Marcia Fudge, the Honorable Alan Grayson, the Honorable Gene Green, the Honorable Raul Grijalva, the Honorable Luis Gutierrez, the Honorable Denny Heck, the Honorable Sheila Jackson Lee, the Honorable Hakeem Jeffries, the Honorable Eddie Bernice Johnson, the Honorable Hank Johnson, the Honorable Daniel Kildee, the Honorable Barbara Lee, the Honorable John Lewis, the Honorable Zoe Lofgren, the Honorable Jim McDermott, the Honorable Grace Meng, the Honorable Gwen Moore, the Honorable Grace Napolitano, the Honorable Jared Polis, the Honorable Charles Rangel, the Honorable Cedric Richmond, the Honorable Bobby Rush, the Honorable Linda T. Sanchez, the Honorable Loretta Sanchez, the Honorable Bobby Scott, the Honorable Jose Serrano, the Honorable Brad Sherman, the Honorable Chris Smith, the Honorable Jackie Speier, the Honorable Bennie Thompson, the Honorable Chris Van Hollen, the Honorable Maxine Waters, and the Honorable Bonnie Watson Coleman. [[Page H3245]] I might add that this is bipartisan. It is always a wonderful thing to have bipartisan legislation. This legislation is bipartisan in nature. I want you to know that, in sponsoring this legislation, it is our hope that the United States House of Representatives will take it up and that it will come to the floor of the House for a vote, so that we can do more than say we support the people of Nepal. This is a way for the Congress of the United States of America to go beyond endorsing aid. It is a way to provide aid because the people who are here will have an opportunity to continue to work. As they continue to work, they will be permitted to return funds to their home country. This is a way for us to not only keep people out of harm's way, but to allow those who are here to send money to those who are in harm's way. They can send dollars back to Nepal to help their country in a time of need. When we had the circumstance in Honduras that required temporary protective status, persons were allowed to stay. Since that occurred, approximately $31 billion has been sent back to Honduras from those who are in the diaspora. With reference to Nicaragua, for those who are in the diaspora, I want to commend you because you have sent approximately $10 billion home. For those in El Salvador, I want to commend you because you have sent approximately $45 billion home. For those in Haiti, in the diaspora, you have sent approximately $6 billion home. People in the diaspora from these various countries want to do what they can to be of assistance to their people at home. This is a way of providing them an opportunity to be of assistance to those that they love, those who find themselves in harm's way, those who are in their homelands. Well, we hope that this piece of legislation will pass. If this piece of legislation passes, it will give those persons who are here the opportunity to continue to be a part of the mission of mercy by sending dollars to those who are in harm's way. It is nothing unique, but it is something very much needed for those who are in Nepal. I am proud to tell you that, as we go forward with this effort, we will extend the reach to the United States Senate. We will ask that the Senators please become a part of this. This is an effort that we all, in my opinion, can embrace. We can do this, and we can do it without it costing us--meaning the government--any money. The Government of the United States of America is already sending tens of millions of dollars by way of aid and equipment, and we are doing a lot, but this is another way for the government to be of assistance without spending additional money to be of assistance to the people who are here by not putting them back in harm's way, but at the same time, to allow them--those who are here--to be of benefit to their country by sending dollars back in the form of remittances. I believe that the House of Representatives and the Senate of the United States of America can get this done. I am going to ask my colleagues to please give consideration to H.R. 2033. Let us join hands together, those in the House and Senate, and be on this mission of mercy to see if we can do something to provide aid and comfort for those who are in Nepal by passing legislation to allow those who are in this country to stay in the United States of America. We also are on this mission of mercy because Dr. King is right--I mentioned Ruth Smeltzer--when he reminded us that life is an ``inescapable network of mutuality, tied in a single garment of destiny.'' What impacts one directly impacts all indirectly, meaning what is happening to those in Nepal will have an impact on us. It may not be a direct impact, but there will be an indirect impact. It will happen in ways that we may not be able to measure, but it will. It will impact because there are people who are going to try to migrate, people trying to get out of harm's way and try to get to other countries. My hope is that we will do our share to help those who are trying to get out of harm's way and do our share to prevent those who are here from going back into harm's way. Dr. King is right; life is an inescapable network of mutuality. We are bonded together. This is one island that we are all stranded on, the island that we know as Earth. If we are going to live together as brothers and sisters, we have to treat each other as such. This is a time for us to be responsive to our brothers and sisters in Nepal because there is another comment I hear quite regularly when we hear of disasters like these. People will mention that: ``But for the grace of God, there go I.'' We have had our share of mishaps in the United States of America; and, when we have had our share of mishaps, people have always sent their best wishes and aid to us. People have been of assistance to us throughout the years, the decades, the century. People have been of assistance to us. But for the grace of God, there go I. I am so proud of the response that we had in this country after we suffered 9/11. There were people who showed us a great amount of sympathy and empathy, people who wanted to do all that they can to let us know that they cared and that they were concerned and that they did not, in fact, support--and, in fact, condemned--the dastardly deeds that were perpetrated. It was a time for the world to come together. This is another such occasion, but not the same--no two unpleasant circumstances are the same--but this one in Nepal is one that we can embrace. This is a time for us to show the world that we understand that there are things that we can do and will do. We are, by the way. We have sent millions of dollars. We have our aid in the form of the soft side of our military. Our heavy equipment and helicopters are there. As I mentioned earlier, we did lose a helicopter, and we lost some lives. We are stepping up to the plate. The United States of America is doing its part. I want us to continue to do our part. I want us to do all that we can to make sure that every person knows where we stand. In so doing, I want to mention that we in the United States have been blessed to have this melting pot of people who come from all over the world to be a part of this great American Dream, the great American ideal, and the people who have come here from the country of Nepal are no exception. They are hard-working people. They have shown their desire to be a part of the fiber and fabric of the United States of America. They have been people of good will. I ask that we extend the hand of friendship to these people of good will, especially during this month, which is a month that we are to give honor and show respect to those of Asian heritage, if you will. This is Asian and Pacific Islander Heritage Month. This is a great time for us, during this month, to show our concern for the Asian population that is in Nepal. We have the opportunity to pass H.R. 2033 and make a difference in the lives of a good many people in this country. I do want to mention again, for fear that some may not have heard, the community in Houston is well organized. Immediately after the first earthquake hit, we had a meeting, and we had scores of people in attendance. These were Nepalese persons. They were there to show their unity with each other. They also had a plan of action. Their plan of action included raising money so that they could send it to their homeland to be of assistance, and they want to send this money directly there themselves. I admire them for their lofty goals and their efforts. They want to send the money themselves to their homeland. They want to make sure that there is no question that they have done their part. The beautiful thing about this effort is that it became infectious and other members of the community decided: If not but for the grace of God, there go I. Here is my opportunity to be of assistance. Here is my opportunity to unify. It was an amazing sight to see, on May 2, when we had all of these various organizations and groups coming together, all of them pledging their support, all of them pledging their desire to be of assistance to the Nepalese community in Houston, Texas, across the length and breadth of this country, but also to those who are actually in Nepal in a time of need. [[Page H3246]] I am so honored that they have lofty goals that they, I believe, will meet--I plan to do my part--but I am also honored that they decided that this was something that we could all embrace. They have reached out to the entire community, and the community has responded. I beg my friends across all sides of the aisle, this is not a Republican or a Democratic resolution--or bill, if you will. This is a bill, H.R. 2033, that already has bipartisan support. It is not about what part of the country you are from. It is not about how many people you happen to represent from a certain community. It is about helping somebody in a country that is in need of help. I beg that my colleagues would sign on to H.R. 2033--those who have not, many have indicated they will--so that we can bring this bill to the floor of the United States House of Representatives. It is not going to cost us any additional money to bring it to the House of Representatives. It will not in any way grant any status to persons that they don't already have. It will simply extend the period of time that they will be allowed to stay in this country without having to return to harm's way. I am grateful for the time today, Mr. Speaker. I do believe that this is time that has been well spent, and I do want to, as I close, let those families who have friends and relatives who are serving in our military or who are in Nepal, especially those who have family members that were associated with the military and the loss related to that helicopter crash, but also those who are with USAID and those there with various other organizations that are in service and doing what they do to make a difference, thank all of them for being there on the ground.

But if it is that amount, we can do as much as we can, and we should do as much as we can to help the people of Nepal. I want you to know that the people of Nepal and the Nepalese community in the United States of America across the length and breadth of our country are pitching in. In my district, the Ninth Congressional District of Houston, Texas, on May 2, 2015, we held a meeting. That meeting was to discuss how we can be of service, the congressional office, and how the community can come together to provide assistance for those in need in Nepal. At that meeting, I am proud to say we had a good many persons in attendance. It was a community meeting. In the true spirit of community, which has the word ``unity'' in it, there was unity within this community meeting. I am proud to say that the members of the Nepalese Association of Houston were present. The president, Mr. Ghimirey was there, and he gave a report. The secretary, Mr. Nepal, was there. He gave a report. The building that we were in was at the International Center owned by Mr. Wei Li, and we are honored that he opened the doors of his facility for this purpose. But it is important to know that the community was in unity on the effort to help those in Nepal. Some of the members of the community in attendance: the Bhutanese community was there. The Taiwanese community was there. The Latino community was in attendance. The Burmese community was in attendance. The Pakistani community, the Vietnamese community, all in attendance. Asian realtors were there. The Southwest Management District was there. There were Venerables there, those who are of the Buddhist faith. The Filipino community was represented. The community activists of all stripes, of different ethnicities were in attendance. The Jewish community was there, and a report was given in terms of how Israel has been involved. The Turkish community was there, the Indian community. The Lion's Club was represented. The Chinese community was in attendance. And the African American community was there, as well as a representative of the NAACP. We had a cross-section of people all there for the purpose of becoming a part of the mission of mercy, for the purpose of making sure that we fulfill our obligation to help those in times of need, and I am proud to say that a goal of $100,000 was set for the purpose of aiding those in Nepal just from that meeting. There are many others who have other goals, some higher, some lower, but I believe this goal will be met because it was indicated at the meeting that approximately $60,000 had been committed. I am proud to know that the community, in the spirit of unity, has come together. We announced at that meeting that our congressional office, working with other Members of Congress, we have filed a bill, H.R. 2033, to accord, to provide temporary protected status for the Nepalese community in Texas, in the United States of America, if you are a citizen of Nepal. If you are a citizen of Nepal, and you find yourself here on some sort of visa, if you are here lawfully in the country, temporary protected status would extend the stay for those who are lawfully in the country. It will not change the immigration status of a single person. It will simply extend the stay. This is the American way. It is not the first time we have done this. This is the American way. When people are here and their visas expire, and they are subject to going back into harm's way or going back to their country, which would place them in harm's way, we have done the honorable thing, the right thing. We have on many occasions allowed them to stay here rather than send them into harm's way. That is what this bill would do, H.R. 2033. It would permit them to stay in this country and not return to a country that has been devastated by not one, but two earthquakes, a 7.3 and a 7.8. These two earthquakes have left much damage across the length and breadth of the country. The country is recovering. We need to make sure that we do all that we can to help the people of Nepal. This is why the bill was introduced, and I am proud to say that a good many persons have joined this mission of mercy. The Honorable Mike Honda is an original cosponsor, but there are others who are cosponsors, and in our tradition we like to thank people. It is a tradition of the House to thank people who are a part of a process that is helping someone. When you have people of goodwill who have put their names on the line, you ought to acknowledge that they are doing it. So I am proud to acknowledge people of goodwill, members of the United States House of Representatives who are a part of this mission of mercy, who have signed on to H.R. 2033. I want to mention each and every name. There are others who will sign on. This is not an all-inclusive list, but as of today: The Honorable Mike Honda, who was an original cosponsor; the Honorable Rrad Ashford-- and by the way these are alphabetized--the Honorable Karen Bass; the Honorable Mike Capuano; the Honorable Tony Cardenas; the Honorable Judy Chu; the Honorable Yvette Clarke; the Honorable Emanuel Cleaver; the Honorable James Clyburn; the Honorable Steve Cohen; the Honorable John Conyers. For those of you who may just have joined us, these are the people who are on a mission of mercy. These are the people who are on H.R. 2033, a bill designed to help people stay in this country and not go back into harm's way to Nepal. By the way, this bill would impact about 10,000 to 25,000 people. It is very difficult to count, but this is a guesstimate at best, the number of people who might benefit by staying in this country. I said the Honorable John Conyers is on this mission of mercy; the Honorable Joseph Crowley; the Honorable Henry Cuellar; the Honorable Danny Davis; the Honorable John Delaney; the Honorable Suzan DelBene; the Honorable Mark DeSaulnier; the Honorable Tammy Duckworth; the Honorable Keith Ellison; the Honorable Marcia Fudge; the Honorable Alan Grayson; the Honorable Gene Green; the Honorable Raul Grijalva. As I continue with this list, let me make mention of this: This is not the first time, as I have indicated, that we have had temporary status granted to other countries. {time} 1230 It was done under the Clinton administration, and it was granted to Montserrat. It was done under the Clinton administration as well for Nicaragua, following a hurricane, as well as for the Honduras. It was done with the Bush administration for El Salvador. It was done for the Obama administration for those who suffered from an earthquake in Haiti. So these are some of the people: the Honorable Tammy Duckworth, the Honorable Keith Ellison, the Honorable Marcia Fudge, the Honorable Alan Grayson, the Honorable Gene Green, the Honorable Raul Grijalva, the Honorable Luis Gutierrez, the Honorable Denny Heck, the Honorable Sheila Jackson Lee, the Honorable Hakeem Jeffries, the Honorable Eddie Bernice Johnson, the Honorable Hank Johnson, the Honorable Daniel Kildee, the Honorable Barbara Lee, the Honorable John Lewis, the Honorable Zoe Lofgren, the Honorable Jim McDermott, the Honorable Grace Meng, the Honorable Gwen Moore, the Honorable Grace Napolitano, the Honorable Jared Polis, the Honorable Charles Rangel, the Honorable Cedric Richmond, the Honorable Bobby Rush, the Honorable Linda T. Sanchez, the Honorable Loretta Sanchez, the Honorable Bobby Scott, the Honorable Jose Serrano, the Honorable Brad Sherman, the Honorable Chris Smith, the Honorable Jackie Speier, the Honorable Bennie Thompson, the Honorable Chris Van Hollen, the Honorable Maxine Waters, and the Honorable Bonnie Watson Coleman. [[Page H3245]] I might add that this is bipartisan. It is always a wonderful thing to have bipartisan legislation. This legislation is bipartisan in nature. I want you to know that, in sponsoring this legislation, it is our hope that the United States House of Representatives will take it up and that it will come to the floor of the House for a vote, so that we can do more than say we support the people of Nepal. This is a way for the Congress of the United States of America to go beyond endorsing aid. It is a way to provide aid because the people who are here will have an opportunity to continue to work. As they continue to work, they will be permitted to return funds to their home country. This is a way for us to not only keep people out of harm's way, but to allow those who are here to send money to those who are in harm's way. They can send dollars back to Nepal to help their country in a time of need. When we had the circumstance in Honduras that required temporary protective status, persons were allowed to stay. Since that occurred, approximately $31 billion has been sent back to Honduras from those who are in the diaspora. With reference to Nicaragua, for those who are in the diaspora, I want to commend you because you have sent approximately $10 billion home. For those in El Salvador, I want to commend you because you have sent approximately $45 billion home. For those in Haiti, in the diaspora, you have sent approximately $6 billion home. People in the diaspora from these various countries want to do what they can to be of assistance to their people at home. This is a way of providing them an opportunity to be of assistance to those that they love, those who find themselves in harm's way, those who are in their homelands. Well, we hope that this piece of legislation will pass. If this piece of legislation passes, it will give those persons who are here the opportunity to continue to be a part of the mission of mercy by sending dollars to those who are in harm's way. It is nothing unique, but it is something very much needed for those who are in Nepal. I am proud to tell you that, as we go forward with this effort, we will extend the reach to the United States Senate. We will ask that the Senators please become a part of this. This is an effort that we all, in my opinion, can embrace. We can do this, and we can do it without it costing us--meaning the government--any money. The Government of the United States of America is already sending tens of millions of dollars by way of aid and equipment, and we are doing a lot, but this is another way for the government to be of assistance without spending additional money to be of assistance to the people who are here by not putting them back in harm's way, but at the same time, to allow them--those who are here--to be of benefit to their country by sending dollars back in the form of remittances. I believe that the House of Representatives and the Senate of the United States of America can get this done. I am going to ask my colleagues to please give consideration to H.R. 2033. Let us join hands together, those in the House and Senate, and be on this mission of mercy to see if we can do something to provide aid and comfort for those who are in Nepal by passing legislation to allow those who are in this country to stay in the United States of America. We also are on this mission of mercy because Dr. King is right--I mentioned Ruth Smeltzer--when he reminded us that life is an ``inescapable network of mutuality, tied in a single garment of destiny.'' What impacts one directly impacts all indirectly, meaning what is happening to those in Nepal will have an impact on us. It may not be a direct impact, but there will be an indirect impact. It will happen in ways that we may not be able to measure, but it will. It will impact because there are people who are going to try to migrate, people trying to get out of harm's way and try to get to other countries. My hope is that we will do our share to help those who are trying to get out of harm's way and do our share to prevent those who are here from going back into harm's way. Dr. King is right; life is an inescapable network of mutuality. We are bonded together. This is one island that we are all stranded on, the island that we know as Earth. If we are going to live together as brothers and sisters, we have to treat each other as such. This is a time for us to be responsive to our brothers and sisters in Nepal because there is another comment I hear quite regularly when we hear of disasters like these. People will mention that: ``But for the grace of God, there go I.'' We have had our share of mishaps in the United States of America; and, when we have had our share of mishaps, people have always sent their best wishes and aid to us. People have been of assistance to us throughout the years, the decades, the century. People have been of assistance to us. But for the grace of God, there go I. I am so proud of the response that we had in this country after we suffered 9/11. There were people who showed us a great amount of sympathy and empathy, people who wanted to do all that they can to let us know that they cared and that they were concerned and that they did not, in fact, support--and, in fact, condemned--the dastardly deeds that were perpetrated. It was a time for the world to come together. This is another such occasion, but not the same--no two unpleasant circumstances are the same--but this one in Nepal is one that we can embrace. This is a time for us to show the world that we understand that there are things that we can do and will do. We are, by the way. We have sent millions of dollars. We have our aid in the form of the soft side of our military. Our heavy equipment and helicopters are there. As I mentioned earlier, we did lose a helicopter, and we lost some lives. We are stepping up to the plate. The United States of America is doing its part. I want us to continue to do our part. I want us to do all that we can to make sure that every person knows where we stand. In so doing, I want to mention that we in the United States have been blessed to have this melting pot of people who come from all over the world to be a part of this great American Dream, the great American ideal, and the people who have come here from the country of Nepal are no exception. They are hard-working people. They have shown their desire to be a part of the fiber and fabric of the United States of America. They have been people of good will. I ask that we extend the hand of friendship to these people of good will, especially during this month, which is a month that we are to give honor and show respect to those of Asian heritage, if you will. This is Asian and Pacific Islander Heritage Month. This is a great time for us, during this month, to show our concern for the Asian population that is in Nepal. We have the opportunity to pass H.R. 2033 and make a difference in the lives of a good many people in this country. I do want to mention again, for fear that some may not have heard, the community in Houston is well organized. Immediately after the first earthquake hit, we had a meeting, and we had scores of people in attendance. These were Nepalese persons. They were there to show their unity with each other. They also had a plan of action. Their plan of action included raising money so that they could send it to their homeland to be of assistance, and they want to send this money directly there themselves. I admire them for their lofty goals and their efforts. They want to send the money themselves to their homeland. They want to make sure that there is no question that they have done their part. The beautiful thing about this effort is that it became infectious and other members of the community decided: If not but for the grace of God, there go I. Here is my opportunity to be of assistance. Here is my opportunity to unify. It was an amazing sight to see, on May 2, when we had all of these various organizations and groups coming together, all of them pledging their support, all of them pledging their desire to be of assistance to the Nepalese community in Houston, Texas, across the length and breadth of this country, but also to those who are actually in Nepal in a time of need. [[Page H3246]] I am so honored that they have lofty goals that they, I believe, will meet--I plan to do my part--but I am also honored that they decided that this was something that we could all embrace. They have reached out to the entire community, and the community has responded. I beg my friends across all sides of the aisle, this is not a Republican or a Democratic resolution--or bill, if you will. This is a bill, H.R. 2033, that already has bipartisan support. It is not about what part of the country you are from. It is not about how many people you happen to represent from a certain community. It is about helping somebody in a country that is in need of help. I beg that my colleagues would sign on to H.R. 2033--those who have not, many have indicated they will--so that we can bring this bill to the floor of the United States House of Representatives. It is not going to cost us any additional money to bring it to the House of Representatives. It will not in any way grant any status to persons that they don't already have. It will simply extend the period of time that they will be allowed to stay in this country without having to return to harm's way. I am grateful for the time today, Mr. Speaker. I do believe that this is time that has been well spent, and I do want to, as I close, let those families who have friends and relatives who are serving in our military or who are in Nepal, especially those who have family members that were associated with the military and the loss related to that helicopter crash, but also those who are with USAID and those there with various other organizations that are in service and doing what they do to make a difference, thank all of them for being there on the ground. I also heard someone representing our military this morning. When speaking of those who are there as a part of that military effort and those who lost their lives, there was a request for prayers. There was a request that we would pray for those who are injured and those who have lost their lives. I believe in prayer. I do believe that it has a positive impact. I believe it can make a difference. I believe that there are times when there are no answers available to people, when you cannot explain what has happened, when the inexplicable is confronting you. At those times, many people turn to prayer because prayer can provide what words cannot explain. {time} 1245 Prayer can give you the hope that you need to go forward. Prayer can give you the sense of I can, the belief that I will, the belief that I will go on and continue to make a difference, that it is expected that I go on sometimes. People think that there is no more hope, and they should just give up right here and right now. Prayer can do marvelous things, so I am going to end with a prayer because I believe that the request should be honored from the military person who made the request. Without knowing the name, I want you to know that I appreciate that you indicated that we should pray for our people in harm's way. I will give this prayer from my heart, not from my head. I have no paper that I will be reading when I present this prayer. It is a prayer that has been written across my heart for a time such as this, and I pray, as I give this prayer, that it will be received with the intentionality that I will send it. It is a prayer for all. Those who would like to can join me in your tradition. However you pray is okay with me. I will lower my head to give this prayer, and I will close my eyes. Most gracious Creator, we know You by many names, but we also know that, by any name, You are the creator of all that was, is, and ever shall be, and we know that we are Your children, and as Your children, You have given us the greatest gift that we could ever receive, the gift of life. Regardless as to what we think of ourselves, we know, many of us in our hearts, that we are blessed beyond measure to simply have the gift of life. We know that we are better than we deserve, simply because we have the gift of life, because we cannot earn the gift of life. There is nothing that we could have done to earn it or merit the gift of life. It is something that we get because of grace. By Your grace, I stand here as Your servant, asking Your mercy for those who are in harm's way in the nation of Nepal. I ask Your mercy, I ask Your blessings for those who are reaching out and trying to do what they can to help someone in a time of need. I ask that You please strengthen those who are there who, tonight, may find that they do not have shelter, but please give them some sense of belief that help is on the way. Help them to believe that there are people in a distant place called the United States of America who are people of good will who are going to do what they can to make sure that they get the shelter they need. Please help those who may be suffering the pains associated with having been a part of a tragic circumstance and having been hurt physically. Help those who are suffering to know that help is on the way, that we plan to make sure that they get the medical aid that they need and the treatment that they need because You have given us so much and those who have so much, as we, should do as much as we can to help people who have little. I ask, gracious Creator, that You strengthen all of us in this House of Representatives so that we may continue to go forward to do Your will to make Your world a better place. We were given the precious gift of the life for a reason. There are many reasons that may be cited, but I believe that we have been blessed with the gift of life so that we may be a blessing to others. This is our opportunity to be a blessing to others, and I beg and I pray that we, who have received the precious gift of life, when we finally, 1 day, have the opportunity to look back upon all that our lives stand for, perhaps we will, at some point in time, have an opportunity to see the omniscient, the omnipresent, and the omnipotent, and we will have an opportunity to tell and go over the record of our lives. On that day, I hope that we will be able to say that we did all that we could to help the people of Nepal. We thank You for the gift of life, and we pray that we will use it wisely and well and make a difference in the lives of others. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. God bless you, Mr. Speaker, and God bless the United States of America. I yield back the balance of my time. ____________________",package_114_249.csv,25273,25273,25338,"[congressional record volume 161, number 75 (friday, may 15, 2015)] [house] [pages h3243-h3246] from

2015, the gentleman from texas (mr. al green) is recognized for 60 minutes as the designee of the minority leader. mr. al green of texas. mr. speaker, today i am on a mission of mercy; a mission of mercy, mr. speaker, because a u.s. military helicopter has gone down in nepal on tuesday, may 12. they were on a mission of mercy. the united states of america always responds to those who are in need, those who are in harm's way. this was no exception. our very finest volunteer to serve in our military. many of them will go to distant places, and some of them will not always return home the same way they left. some will not return at all. i am honored to say that we should be proud of those who serve. regardless as to how we feel about conflicts around the world, we ought to appreciate the service of those who are in our military, and we ought to want every one of them to return home safely. so today i stand in the well of the house on a mission of mercy for our military persons who have lost their lives in distant places, but more specifically in nepal. we are there for a reason, mr. speaker. we are there because ruth smeltzer is right: some measure their lives by days and years, others by heartthrobs, passions, and tears, but the surest measure under god's sun. is what for others in your lifetime have you done. we, in the united states of america, are doing things for others in the lifetime of people in this country currently, and we do it in the lifetime of our nation. we want it said that we were there to help those in time of need. so, mr. speaker, there is a time of need for those in nepal. on april 25, a 7.8 magnitude earthquake hit nepal; 7.8. thereafter, on may 12, a 7.3 magnitude earthquake hit nepal. these earthquakes have devastated this country. lives have been lost, more than 8,000 lives. people have been injured, [[page h3244]] more than 17,000. millions have been displaced, nearly 3 million. millions have been affected, more than 8 million. four americans lost their lives. the united states moved quickly. we committed the sum of approximately $10 million initially, but that has now grown to more than $32 million. the relief efforts from the united states are growing. not only are we placing dollars into the relief effort, we are also placing our military equipment into these efforts. that is why the helicopter was there in nepal, to help in this time of need. so i am proud to say that we are there to help. the need is estimated to be approximately $415 million. the number could go up. but if it is that amount, we can

[[page h3245]] i might add that this is bipartisan. it is always a wonderful thing to have bipartisan legislation. this legislation is bipartisan in nature. i want you to know that, in sponsoring this legislation, it is our hope that the united states house of representatives will take it up and that it will come to the floor of the house for a vote, so that we can do more than say we support the people of nepal. this is a way for the congress of the united states of america to go beyond endorsing aid. it is a way to provide aid because the people who are here will have an opportunity to continue to work. as they continue to work, they will be permitted to return funds to their home country. this is a way for us to not only keep people out of harm's way, but to allow those who are here to send money to those who are in harm's way. they can send dollars back to nepal to help their country in a time of need. when we had the circumstance in honduras that required temporary protective status, persons were allowed to stay. since that occurred, approximately $31 billion has been sent back to honduras from those who are in the diaspora. with reference to nicaragua, for those who are in the diaspora, i want to commend you because you have sent approximately $10 billion home. for those in el salvador, i want to commend you because you have sent approximately $45 billion home. for those in haiti, in the diaspora, you have sent approximately $6 billion home. people in the diaspora from these various countries want to do what they can to be of assistance to their people at home. this is a way of providing them an opportunity to be of assistance to those that they love, those who find themselves in harm's way, those who are in their homelands. well, we hope that this piece of legislation will pass. if this piece of legislation passes, it will give those persons who are here the opportunity to continue to be a part of the mission of mercy by sending dollars to those who are in harm's way. it is nothing unique, but it is something very much needed for those who are in nepal. i am proud to tell you that, as we go forward with this effort, we will extend the reach to the united states senate. we will ask that the senators please become a part of this. this is an effort that we all, in my opinion, can embrace. we can do this, and we can do it without it costing us--meaning the government--any money. the government of the united states of america is already sending tens of millions of dollars by way of aid and equipment, and we are doing a lot, but this is another way for the government to be of assistance without spending additional money to be of assistance to the people who are here by not putting them back in harm's way, but at the same time, to allow them--those who are here--to be of benefit to their country by sending dollars back in the form of remittances. i believe that the house of representatives and the senate of the united states of america can get this done. i am going to ask my colleagues to please give consideration to h.r. 2033. let us join hands together, those in the house and senate, and be on this mission of mercy to see if we can do something to provide aid and comfort for those who are in nepal by passing legislation to allow those who are in this country to stay in the united states of america. we also are on this mission of mercy because dr. king is right--i mentioned ruth smeltzer--when he reminded us that life is an ``inescapable network of mutuality, tied in a single garment of destiny.'' what impacts one directly impacts all indirectly, meaning what is happening to those in nepal will have an impact on us. it may not be a direct impact, but there will be an indirect impact. it will happen in ways that we may not be able to measure, but it will. it will impact because there are people who are going to try to migrate, people trying to get out of harm's way and try to get to other countries. my hope is that we will do our share to help those who are trying to get out of harm's way and do our share to prevent those who are here from going back into harm's way. dr. king is right; life is an inescapable network of mutuality. we are bonded together. this is one island that we are all stranded on, the island that we know as earth. if we are going to live together as brothers and sisters, we have to treat each other as such. this is a time for us to be responsive to our brothers and sisters in nepal because there is another comment i hear quite regularly when we hear of disasters like these. people will mention that: ``but for the grace of god, there go i.'' we have had our share of mishaps in the united states of america; and, when we have had our share of mishaps, people have always sent their best wishes and aid to us. people have been of assistance to us throughout the years, the decades, the century. people have been of assistance to us. but for the grace of god, there go i. i am so proud of the response that we had in this country after we suffered 9/11. there were people who showed us a great amount of sympathy and empathy, people who wanted to do all that they can to let us know that they cared and that they were concerned and that they did not, in fact, support--and, in fact, condemned--the dastardly deeds that were perpetrated. it was a time for the world to come together. this is another such occasion, but not the same--no two unpleasant circumstances are the same--but this one in nepal is one that we can embrace. this is a time for us to show the world that we understand that there are things that we can do and will do. we are, by the way. we have sent millions of dollars. we have our aid in the form of the soft side of our military. our heavy equipment and helicopters are there. as i mentioned earlier, we did lose a helicopter, and we lost some lives. we are stepping up to the plate. the united states of america is doing its part. i want us to continue to do our part. i want us to do all that we can to make sure that every person knows where we stand. in so doing, i want to mention that we in the united states have been blessed to have this melting pot of people who come from all over the world to be a part of this great american dream, the great american ideal, and the people who have come here from the country of nepal are no exception. they are hard-working people. they have shown their desire to be a part of the fiber and fabric of the united states of america. they have been people of good will. i ask that we extend the hand of friendship to these people of good will, especially during this month, which is a month that we are to give honor and show respect to those of asian heritage, if you will. this is asian and pacific islander heritage month. this is a great time for us, during this month, to show our concern for the asian population that is in nepal. we have the opportunity to pass h.r. 2033 and make a difference in the lives of a good many people in this country. i do want to mention again, for fear that some may not have heard, the community in houston is well organized. immediately after the first earthquake hit, we had a meeting, and we had scores of people in attendance. these were nepalese persons. they were there to show their unity with each other. they also had a plan of action. their plan of action included raising money so that they could send it to their homeland to be of assistance, and they want to send this money directly there themselves. i admire them for their lofty goals and their efforts. they want to send the money themselves to their homeland. they want to make sure that there is no question that they have done their part. the beautiful thing about this effort is that it became infectious and other members of the community decided: if not but for the grace of god, there go i. here is my opportunity to be of assistance. here is my opportunity to unify. it was an amazing sight to see, on may 2, when we had all of these various organizations and groups coming together, all of them pledging their support, all of them pledging their desire to be of assistance to the nepalese community in houston, texas, across the length and breadth of this country, but also to those who are actually in nepal in a time of need. [[page h3246]] i am so honored that they have lofty goals that they, i believe, will meet--i plan to do my part--but i am also honored that they decided that this was something that we could all embrace. they have reached out to the entire community, and the community has responded. i beg my friends across all sides of the aisle, this is not a republican or a democratic resolution--or bill, if you will. this is a bill, h.r. 2033, that already has bipartisan support. it is not about what part of the country you are from. it is not about how many people you happen to represent from a certain community. it is about helping somebody in a country that is in need of help. i beg that my colleagues would sign on to h.r. 2033--those who have not, many have indicated they will--so that we can bring this bill to the floor of the united states house of representatives. it is not going to cost us any additional money to bring it to the house of representatives. it will not in any way grant any status to persons that they don't already have. it will simply extend the period of time that they will be allowed to stay in this country without having to return to harm's way. i am grateful for the time today, mr. speaker. i do believe that this is time that has been well spent, and i do want to, as i close, let those families who have friends and relatives who are serving in our military or who are in nepal, especially those who have family members that were associated with the military and the loss related to that helicopter crash, but also those who are with usaid and those there with various other organizations that are in service and doing what they do to make a difference, thank all of them for being there on the ground. i also heard someone representing our military this morning. when speaking of those who are there as a part of that military effort and those who lost their lives, there was a request for prayers. there was a request that we would pray for those who are injured and those who have lost their lives. i believe in prayer. i do believe that it has a positive impact. i believe it can make a difference. i believe that there are times when there are no answers available to people, when you cannot explain what has happened, when the inexplicable is confronting you. at those times, many people turn to prayer because prayer can provide what words cannot explain. {time} 1245 prayer can give you the hope that you need to go forward. prayer can give you the sense of i can, the belief that i will, the belief that i will go on and continue to make a difference, that it is expected that i go on sometimes. people think that there is no more hope, and they should just give up right here and right now. prayer can do marvelous things, so i am going to end with a prayer because i believe that the request should be honored from the military person who made the request. without knowing the name, i want you to know that i appreciate that you indicated that we should pray for our people in harm's way. i will give this prayer from my heart, not from my head. i have no paper that i will be reading when i present this prayer. it is a prayer that has been written across my heart for a time such as this, and i pray, as i give this prayer, that it will be received with the intentionality that i will send it. it is a prayer for all. those who would like to can join me in your tradition. however you pray is okay with me. i will lower my head to give this prayer, and i will close my eyes. most gracious creator, we know you by many names, but we also know that, by any name, you are the creator of all that was, is, and ever shall be, and we know that we are your children, and as your children, you have given us the greatest gift that we could ever receive, the gift of life. regardless as to what we think of ourselves, we know, many of us in our hearts, that we are blessed beyond measure to simply have the gift of life. we know that we are better than we deserve, simply because we have the gift of life, because we cannot earn the gift of life. there is nothing that we could have done to earn it or merit the gift of life. it is something that we get because of grace. by your grace, i stand here as your servant, asking your mercy for those who are in harm's way in the nation of nepal. i ask your mercy, i ask your blessings for those who are reaching out and trying to do what they can to help someone in a time of need. i ask that you please strengthen those who are there who, tonight, may find that they do not have shelter, but please give them some sense of belief that help is on the way. help them to believe that there are people in a distant place called the united states of america who are people of good will who are going to do what they can to make sure that they get the shelter they need. please help those who may be suffering the pains associated with having been a part of a tragic circumstance and having been hurt physically. help those who are suffering to know that help is on the way, that we plan to make sure that they get the medical aid that they need and the treatment that they need because you have given us so much and those who have so much, as we, should do as much as we can to help people who have little. i ask, gracious creator, that you strengthen all of us in this house of representatives so that we may continue to go forward to do your will to make your world a better place. we were given the precious gift of the life for a reason. there are many reasons that may be cited, but i believe that we have been blessed with the gift of life so that we may be a blessing to others. this is our opportunity to be a blessing to others, and i beg and i pray that we, who have received the precious gift of life, when we finally, 1 day, have the opportunity to look back upon all that our lives stand for, perhaps we will, at some point in time, have an opportunity to see the omniscient, the omnipresent, and the omnipotent, and we will have an opportunity to tell and go over the record of our lives. on that day, i hope that we will be able to say that we did all that we could to help the people of nepal. we thank you for the gift of life, and we pray that we will use it wisely and well and make a difference in the lives of others. thank you, mr. speaker. god bless you, mr. speaker, and god bless the united states of america. i yield back the balance of my time. ____________________",25273

CREC-2015-05-15-pt1-PgH3246,CREC-2015-05-15,114,HONORING FALLEN LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS,"[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 75 (Friday, May 15, 2015)] [House] [Pages H3246-H3249] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] HONORING FALLEN LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Knight). Under the Speaker's announced policy of January 6, 2015, the Chair recognizes the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Gohmert) for 30 minutes. Mr. GOHMERT. Mr. Speaker, it is an honor and pleasure to follow my friend and fellow former judge from Texas when he talks about praying. I know him to be a praying man. I also know his heart to be a big heart. We can disagree on issues, but he is a brother, as a Christian, and he is a very good friend, and I appreciate his perspective very much. Mr. AL GREEN of Texas. Will the gentleman yield? Mr. GOHMERT. I yield to the gentleman from Texas. Mr. AL GREEN of Texas. I thank the friend from the great State of Texas. He and I happen to share more than being Members of Congress. We are Members of Congress from the same State. I am honored that you have not only worked hard in Congress, but you have also been a part of activities outside of Congress, and I am honored to work with you on at least one project, and we hope to do some good for the great State of Texas on this project together. I am grateful to you, and I am grateful for your kind words. Thank you so much. Mr. GOHMERT. I would never question the heart or motivation of my friend Al Green. I know his heart to be bigger than most in Washington. It is just an honor to serve with you. There is so much that has gone on this week. One of the things that has happened here in Washington and continues to happen today is a tribute, memorial to law enforcement officers who have lost their lives in the line of duty--doing what?--serving and protecting. [[Page H3247]] After the horrors and evil of 9/11/2001, it was encouraging to me to see so many people, once again, come to appreciate that the vast majority of law enforcement, the vast majority of first responders, they are serving and trying to protect for the good of others and willing to lay down their lives. As Jesus said: No greater love is this than a man lay down his life for his friends. We have seen that in the hundreds of people--I think 273 lost their lives over this past year. Over 40 have lost their lives this year in the line of duty. Just like in any walk of life, there are bad apples, people who don't have the best motivation; but I would humbly submit, I believe with all my heart that, when it comes to law enforcement, the percentage of those who are not properly motivated is far, far less than in the general population. We do owe them so much. Some people say: Oh, well, we ought to just live and let live. They say: I am a Christian. I believe in living and letting live. If you note, if you believe the Bible, Jesus was commenting, of course, his ultimate point was that we will be judged for what is in our heart by our Father in heaven. He said, if you say ``raca,'' which was an offense back in that day, then you will answer to the courts. He understood, in an orderly society, you need a government; you need governing officials to which people will be responsible if they violate the law. That was also true in Romans 13, anticipating, in an orderly society, you need a government with a sword to punish those who do evil. That is why 13:4 says: If you do you evil, be afraid, because God doesn't give the sword in vain. I know some people in the country start freaking out when I quote the most quoted book in the history of the country, as quoted here in the House of Representatives and in the Senate floor. It is part of our history. The Bible is the most quoted book in congressional history-- was, is, and I hope will be in the future. We owe so much to the police who risk their lives. Right out of law school, I was an assistant DA for three counties in east Texas. Very early on, I went with law enforcement to execute a warrant, and the individual, the subject of the warrant for arrest, had made clear that, when he saw any law enforcement officers, he was going to start shooting; he would kill any law enforcement officer that came out there. I don't forget the feelings that all of us had, even though some were very seasoned law officers, when you are approaching a dangerous building--in this case, a home--where somebody in there is threatening to kill anybody like you, you do have a little hair stand up on the back of your neck. You do realize you are putting your life at risk in trying to maintain order and civility by approaching somebody that is a threat to society. That was quite a lesson, that these law officers--whether they are new, whether they have been working for a long time--they are constantly in a situation where they don't know if, 10 minutes later, they may be dead in the service of their community, but they are serving anyway. We do owe them so much for what they do and what they risk on our behalf, so we are just grateful to all law enforcement officers willing to serve and protect all of us. We have a report here back in February, and this is an article from The Hill entitled: ``FBI investigating ISIS suspects in all 50 States.'' The article is quoting FBI Director James Comey, that he revealed Wednesday his agency is investigating suspected supporters of the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria in every State across the United States. Down further in the article, it said, ``Earlier this month, Comey said the FBI was investigating ISIS supporters in every State except Alaska.'' At the time of this article, at the end of February, he was saying: We are investigating ISIS suspects in all 50 States. Director Comey said: ``We have investigations of people in various stages of radicalization in all 50 States.'' He said: ``This isn't a New York phenomenon or a Washington phenomenon. This is in all 50 States and in ways that are very hard to see.'' He said: ``ISIL in particular is putting out a siren song with their slick propaganda through social media.'' He said: ``The message `resonates with troubled souls, people seeking meaning in some horribly misguided way,' '' and that ``those people exist in every State.'' His pronouncement in February should have been a siren song for Americans to understand there are people who live among us who want to destroy us and our way of life. Then it was rather interesting--that was February 25. Less than 2 months later, there was an article put out, Judicial Watch indicated that an ISIS camp was just a few miles from Texas, that Mexican authorities confirmed that. The article said: ``ISIS is operating a camp just a few miles from El Paso, Texas, according to Judicial Watch sources that include a Mexican Army field grade officer and a Mexican Federal Police Inspector. {time} 1300 ``The exact location where the terrorist group has established its base is around 8 miles from the U.S. border in an area known an `Anapra,' situated just west of Cuidad Juarez in the Mexican State of Chihuahua. Another ISIS cell to the west of Cuidad Juarez, in Puerto Palomas, targets the New Mexico towns of Columbus and Deming for easy access to the United States.'' So, anyway, after this article came out in April, I quoted from that, brought it up on the floor and-- Let's see. This article was 2 days later from FOX News: ``Islamic State fighters are operating training bases near the U.S. southern border and are being aided by violent drug cartels to smuggle terrorists into States like Texas, a report published Tuesday by a watchdog group claims.'' So, anyway, I brought that up. And this report seems to get even more legs after the Federal Government, though, denying that any such thing like that was occurring, apparently sent FBI officials to Mexico to meet with their counterterrorism experts, seemed to give some credence that there is something to be concerned about in the way of training of violent radical Islamists across our United States border. So the irony here is pretty profound. People all across the United States of America just accepted when the FBI Director says, you know, there are ISIS suspects in every State in the Union. People said: Wow, that is amazing. Man, they are here? I saw a headline of a survey just moments ago on FOX News saying, 6 out of 10 Americans believe that there are terrorists in their community. So how ironic that even the far left that turns a blind eye to radical Islam could be so accepting that, yes, there are radical Islamist terrorists in every State in the Union. And when Judicial Watch and Louie Gohmert quote from their material, quote other things going on to point out that there is a report that there is an ISIS camp across our border, the left went nuts, saying how crazy Judicial Watch was, how crazy I am for even mentioning this. There couldn't possibly be an ISIS camp in Mexico. Mr. Speaker, I hope you see the irony here. They are saying, yes, we believe there are radical Islamist terrorists in every State in the United States, but there couldn't possibly be ISIS across the border where the drug cartels are. And I haven't gotten a good explanation. Do they have so much faith and trust in the drug cartels' integrity that they would never associate with radical Islamists? Is that what they are saying by their cynicism about ISIS being in Mexico? Because it is a bit intriguing. But then again, some on the far left are educated way beyond their means--their mental capacity, at least--and so they have information; they just can't process it effectively. Because anyone who can readily accept when the FBI Director says there is ISIS in every State in the Union and we are investigating in every State in the Union radical Islamists--he doesn't use those terms because this administration doesn't want to offend any radical Islamists that want to kill us. So we don't use that term if you are in this administration, but I use the term because it is accurate. They are radical Islamists. So, anyway, it is just a great irony here. [[Page H3248]] Then this is an AP story from this week: ``Minnesota men accused of trying to join Islamic State ordered held, but may have other options.'' And that is because U.S. District Judge Michael Davis, who wears a dark robe to match his intellect--he is the same guy that previously-- this is also a May 12 article by Patrick Poole. This is the same judge, Michael J. Davis, chief judge of the district of Minnesota-- This article from Patrick Poole says: ``A terror `deradicalization' program--established in the `Ground Zero' of terror recruitment, Minnesota's Twin Cities--has already failed after just a few months. ``The program was established after a Federal court released 19-year- old terror suspect Abdullahi Yusuf to a halfway house earlier this year. Federal prosecutors opposed Yusuf's release, but were overruled by'' this big-hearted, caring ``Federal judge''--at least big-hearted and caring about radical Islam, not so much about victims of radical Islam. But Michael J. Davis cares deeply about those who want to kill us. So as the article says: ``Remarkably, Judge Davis said today in a separate case of six men charged with trying to join the Islamic State that he would be willing to consider `less restrictive options' than detaining the men--just a day after Yusuf's re-arrest.'' That is because he decided that he was smarter and more capable than anybody else in America. He could deradicalize people who want to kill Americans by just sending them through this program that he had helped with or proved: Gee, we are going to get you reading good material that really helps you see the wonder and glory of this country. And then, of course, I, Judge Michael J. Davis, will be a hero to all of my leftist friends because I cared more for the criminal radical Islamists than I did for the victims. And the left loves that kind of thing. ``Last May, Yusuf was arrested in Minneapolis airport while on his way of Syria by way of Turkey to join the Islamic State. One of his accomplices, Abdi Nur, did make it to Syria, and he now serves as an effective recruiter for the terror group. ``Just last week, The Wall Street Journal reported on the program with an article titled, `A Test Case for ``Deradicalization.' '' ``The path of reform for Abdullahi Yusuf, a U.S. teenager who tried to become a radical Islamic soldier, passes through writings of Martin Luther King, Jr. readings of the U.S. Constitution, and discussions about life and literature with a fellow Somali-American named Ahmed Amin. ``Mr. Yusuf's attempt to travel to the Middle East last year helped lead authorities to six Minnesota men who were charged last month in connection with a plan to join Islamic State abroad. The 19-year-old has become a test case for whether Americans lured by Islamic extremism can be deradicalized.'' Oh, I think they can, but I sure wouldn't trust them to Judge Michael J. Davis, if that is what we want. But see here again, this is once again pointing out the ingenuity of the Founders in creating three branches. We have the executive branch that is supposed to carry out the laws that the Congress, elected by the people, pass. We have two Houses of Congress to make it more difficult to pass laws. They wanted some obstacles and problems to passing legislation too quickly. And then we have the judicial branch that will handle criminal cases, handle civil cases, handle review of actions to ensure their constitutionality. And then we also have this part of the judicial branch, like five of the Justices on the Supreme Court that decided that they wanted to micromanage enemy combatants at Guantanamo. I thought it would have been a good idea to let them live over at the Supreme Court if they want to micromanage them. But then, also, this judge like Michael J. Davis in Minnesota who decides, actually, he is not just judiciary; he is clairvoyant. He is a rehabilitative agent. He is everything to everybody, just the kind of judge you want. God in a robe. So, anyway, he put Mr. Yusuf through these reading materials. And I wonder, though, if he was a bit surprised when Yusuf was arrested because he is not following the program, and he is not reformed. But even that does not prevent God in a robe from saying: You know what? But these new terrorists that you have arrested, they are just a little misguided. I hate to have them in jail because if they are in jail, then the American people will be protected, but they won't be able to come to see how wonderful people like I am. So I want them to develop warm and loving, fuzzy feelings for people on the left, like me. So I want to find some way we don't have to keep them in jail. Anyway, there is another article about that. But it is just amazing to me when people exceed the bounds of their job in government because they think they are wiser than the Founders. They think they are wiser than anyone that has gone on before. We hear people in recent days on the issue of marriage talking in terms of how much smarter and how much more we know today than the ignoramuses of the past. And the ignorance that displays is pretty astounding. Solomon, for those who believe the Bible, Solomon, considered to be-- until he got sidetracked by having too many wives and concubines--was considered to be the wisest man in the world. And Solomon, credited for writing some of the things in the Old Testament--the Old Testament, as we call it--but in what we call Ecclesiastes, he points out, there is nothing new under the Sun. You think socialism, communism is a new idea? It is not new. It has been around forever. And every time it has been tried, it leads to totalitarianism. It leads to the loss of freedom, and then it fails because, as Margaret Thatcher once said, eventually you find out--well, you run out of other people's money to spend. It doesn't work. It won't work. Now, that is different from socialized medicine, like ObamaCare is taking us toward, government control. I have friends on the Republican side of the aisle who say, Louie, we won't have to worry. ObamaCare is going to fall of its own weight. The problem is government health care, socialized medicine, it never falls of its own weight. Socialism does. It can't survive because when you are paying people to not work the same amount you are paying people to work, eventually you destroy the society. And we are in the process of doing that here in America, paying people to do things that are destructive to their well-being. We ought to be incentivizing good conduct, not rewarding conduct destructive to the individual and to the Nation. But we continue down this path that has not been working for 50 years, so hopefully people are going to eventually get the message. But amidst this, this same week, I have a Wall Street Journal article, ``Deadly Mexican Cartel Rises as New Threat.'' It should be noted--Carlos the Jackal, probably the most notorious, famous assassin--had commented that he believed the only way to really bring down the United States would be for socialists and Islamists to join forces, and that could be the successful force to bring down the United States. Interesting observation from an anarchist like Carlos the Jackal. Interesting. {time} 1315 Anyway, Mr. Speaker, this article talks about the rise of the Mexican cartel and it says this in the second page of the article: ``The New Generation cartel is perhaps Mexico's most audacious and vicious criminal enterprise, after the government captured or killed most leaders of the Zetas gang based in northeastern Mexico, say officials and security analysts. Like the Zetas, originally formed by Army deserters, the New Generation gang favors paramilitary methods and has received tactical training from Mexican and foreign mercenaries, these people say, including the use of rocket-propelled grenades against the helicopter.'' So, let's see, Mr. Speaker, this columnist said the helicopter incident was a declaration of war. The coming months are going to be very hard in Jalisco. You have got violence building on our southern border, but don't worry. Our Justice Department has been very [[Page H3249]] helpful. We can't get documents because the Justice Department becomes an Injustice Department quite often in obfuscating--hiding documents, hiding the truth, preventing people from getting at the truth--and won't provide the documents to me that they provided to convicted terrorism supporters in the Holy Land Foundation trial. Oh, they sent me a couple Web sites I could visit. That was very nice and gracious of them. But basically they were covering up their tracks, being the most muddy--not transparent--Justice Department in my lifetime. That includes going back to the lack of transparency under J. Edgar Hoover when he became too enthralled with his power and began using FBI agents to investigate people not for information to introduce in court but just to use, apparently, to persuade them to do what the FBI director wanted. Information like that is dangerous, and the Founders knew that. Then there is another Wall Street article from May 14: ``FBI Says Texas Man Lied About Links to Syria.'' Imagine that, Mr. Speaker. They catch somebody who they have evidence to show he has got links to terrorism in Syria, and, lo and behold, they found out not only does he have links to terrorism but he may have actually lied to the FBI. Imagine that. The article points out that ``Bilal Abood, 37 years old, of Mesquite, Texas, was arrested Thursday after a 2-year game of cat and mouse with Federal agents, who questioned him repeatedly before and after he allegedly traveled to Syria in 2013.'' But anyway let's see. It says: ``A week later, agents interviewed him again and he admitted he planned to go to Syria to fight with the Free Syrian Army, according to the complaint. Unlike terror groups, such as Islamic State and the Nusra Front, the moderate FSA''--Free Syrian Army--``has received backing from the United States.'' Well, Mr. Speaker, they received backing from this administration is what the bottom line is, not from all of us here because some of us have been saying that this administration is providing weapons to the Islamic State. They were providing weapons to the so-called vetted moderate Free Syrian Army. Remarkably weapons that the Obama administration was providing to the vetted moderate Syrian Army kept ending up in Islamic State hands. And they were, Oh, gee, they raided, they took this stuff, they took the weapons, send us more. Well, the Obama administration wised up about 4 months. They suspended weapons shipment to the vetted moderate Free Syrian Army. But then, not to worry, they eventually started back sending weapons to the vetted moderate Free Syrian Army even after their leaders were saying, Yeah, we may disagree with the Islamic State on the leader, Assad, the leader in Syria, but we are brothers, and we do line up on most issues. So, Mr. Speaker, it is important to note terrorism is alive and well in the world, and this administration has done very little to stop it, has turned a blind eye to it, and we have got to do all we can to help them wake up and smell the gunpowder coming from radical Islamists. With that, Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 75 (Friday, May 15, 2015)] [House] [Pages H3246-H3249] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] HONORING FALLEN LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Knight). Under the Speaker's announced policy of January 6, 2015, the Chair recognizes the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Gohmert) for 30 minutes. Mr. GOHMERT. Mr. Speaker, it is an honor and pleasure to follow my friend and fellow former judge from Texas when he talks about praying. I know him to be a praying man. I also know his heart to be a big heart. We can disagree on issues, but he is a brother, as a Christian, and he is a very good friend, and I appreciate his perspective very much. Mr. AL GREEN of Texas. Will the gentleman yield? Mr. GOHMERT. I yield to the gentleman from Texas. Mr. AL GREEN of Texas. I thank the friend from the great State of Texas. He and I happen to share more than being Members of Congress. We are Members of Congress from the same State. I am honored that you have not only worked hard in Congress, but you have also been a part of activities outside of Congress, and I am honored to work with you on at least one project, and we hope to do some good for the great State of Texas on this project together. I am grateful to you, and I am grateful for your kind words. Thank you so much. Mr. GOHMERT. I would never question the heart or motivation of my friend Al Green. I know his heart to be bigger than most in Washington. It is just an honor to serve with you. There is so much that has gone on this week. One of the things that has happened here in Washington and continues to happen today is a tribute, memorial to law enforcement officers who have lost their lives in the line of duty--doing what?--serving and protecting. [[Page H3247]] After the horrors and evil of 9/11/2001, it was encouraging to me to see so many people, once again, come to appreciate that the vast majority of law enforcement, the vast majority of first responders, they are serving and trying to protect for the good of others and willing to lay down their lives. As Jesus said: No greater love is this than a man lay down his life for his friends. We have seen that in the hundreds of people--I think 273 lost their lives over this past year. Over 40 have lost their lives this year in the line of duty. Just like in any walk of life, there are bad apples, people who don't have the best motivation; but I would humbly submit, I believe with all my heart that, when it comes to law enforcement, the percentage of those who are not properly motivated is far, far less than in the general population. We do owe them so much. Some people say: Oh, well, we ought to just live and let live. They say: I am a Christian. I believe in living and letting live. If you note, if you believe the Bible, Jesus was commenting, of course, his ultimate point was that we will be judged for what is in our heart by our Father in heaven. He said, if you say ``raca,'' which was an offense back in that day, then you will answer to the courts. He understood, in an orderly society, you need a government; you need governing officials to which people will be responsible if they violate the law. That was also true in Romans 13, anticipating, in an orderly society, you need a government with a sword to punish those who do evil. That is why 13:4 says: If you do you evil, be afraid, because God doesn't give the sword in vain. I know some people in the country start freaking out when I quote the most quoted book in the history of the country, as quoted here in the House of Representatives and in the Senate floor. It is part of our history. The Bible is the most quoted book in congressional history-- was, is, and I hope will be in the future. We owe so much to the police who risk their lives. Right out of law school, I was an assistant DA for three counties in east Texas. Very early on, I went with law enforcement to execute a warrant, and the individual, the subject of the warrant for arrest, had made clear that, when he saw any law enforcement officers, he was going to start shooting; he would kill any law enforcement officer that came out there. I don't forget the feelings that all of us had, even though some were very seasoned law officers, when you are approaching a dangerous building--in this case, a home--where somebody in there is threatening to kill anybody like you, you do have a little hair stand up on the back of your neck. You do realize you are putting your life at risk in trying to maintain order and civility by approaching somebody that is a threat to society. That was quite a lesson, that these law officers--whether they are new, whether they have been working for a long time--they are constantly in a situation where they don't know if, 10 minutes later, they may be dead in the service of their community, but they are serving anyway. We do owe them so much for what they do and what they risk on our behalf, so we are just grateful to all law enforcement officers willing to serve and protect all of us. We have a report here back in February, and this is an article from The Hill entitled: ``FBI investigating ISIS suspects in all 50 States.'' The article is quoting FBI Director James Comey, that he revealed Wednesday his agency is investigating suspected supporters of the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria in every State across the United States. Down further in the article, it said, ``Earlier this month, Comey said the FBI was investigating ISIS supporters in every State except Alaska.'' At the time of this article, at the end of February, he was saying: We are investigating ISIS suspects in all 50 States. Director Comey said: ``We have investigations of people in various stages of radicalization in all 50 States.'' He said: ``This isn't a New York phenomenon or a Washington phenomenon. This is in all 50 States and in ways that are very hard to see.'' He said: ``ISIL in particular is putting out a siren song with their slick propaganda through social media.'' He said: ``The message `resonates with troubled souls, people seeking meaning in some horribly misguided way,' '' and that ``those people exist in every State.'' His pronouncement in February should have been a siren song for Americans to understand there are people who live among us who want to destroy us and our way of life. Then it was rather interesting--that was February 25. Less than 2 months later, there was an article put out, Judicial Watch indicated that an ISIS camp was just a few miles from Texas, that Mexican authorities confirmed that. The article said: ``ISIS is operating a camp just a few miles from El Paso, Texas, according to Judicial Watch sources that include a Mexican Army field grade officer and a Mexican Federal Police Inspector. {time} 1300 ``The exact location where the terrorist group has established its base is around 8 miles from the U.S. border in an area known an `Anapra,' situated just west of Cuidad Juarez in the Mexican State of Chihuahua. Another ISIS cell to the west of Cuidad Juarez, in Puerto Palomas, targets the New Mexico towns of Columbus and Deming for easy access to the United States.'' So, anyway, after this article came out in April, I quoted from that, brought it up on the floor and-- Let's see. This article was 2 days later from FOX News: ``Islamic State fighters are operating training bases near the U.S. southern border and are being aided by violent drug cartels to smuggle terrorists into States like Texas, a report published Tuesday by a watchdog group claims.'' So, anyway, I brought that up. And this report seems to get even more legs after the Federal Government, though, denying that any such thing like that was occurring, apparently sent FBI officials to Mexico to meet with their counterterrorism experts, seemed to give some credence that there is something to be concerned about in the way of training of violent radical Islamists across our United States border. So the irony here is pretty profound. People all across the United States of America just accepted when the FBI Director says, you know, there are ISIS suspects in every State in the Union. People said: Wow, that is amazing. Man, they are here? I saw a headline of a survey just moments ago on FOX News saying, 6 out of 10 Americans believe that there are terrorists in their community. So how ironic that even the far left that turns a blind eye to radical Islam could be so accepting that, yes, there are radical Islamist terrorists in every State in the Union. And when Judicial Watch and Louie Gohmert quote from their material, quote other things going on to point out that there is a report that there is an ISIS camp across our border, the left went nuts, saying how crazy Judicial Watch was, how crazy I am for even mentioning this. There couldn't possibly be an ISIS camp in Mexico. Mr. Speaker, I hope you see the irony here. They are saying, yes, we believe there are radical Islamist terrorists in every State in the United States, but there couldn't possibly be ISIS across the border where the drug cartels are. And I haven't gotten a good explanation. Do they have so much faith and trust in the drug cartels' integrity that they would never associate with radical Islamists? Is that what they are saying by their cynicism about ISIS being in Mexico? Because it is a bit intriguing. But then again, some on the far left are educated way beyond their means--their mental capacity, at least--and so they have information; they just can't process it effectively. Because anyone who can readily accept when the FBI Director says there is ISIS in every State in the Union and we are investigating in every State in the Union radical Islamists--he doesn't use those terms because this administration doesn't want to offend any radical Islamists that want to kill us. So we don't use that term if you are in this administration, but I use the term because it is accurate. They are radical Islamists. So, anyway, it is just a great irony here. [[Page H3248]] Then this is an AP story from this week: ``Minnesota men accused of trying to join Islamic State ordered held, but may have other options.'' And that is because U.S. District Judge Michael Davis, who wears a dark robe to match his intellect--he is the same guy that previously-- this is also a May 12 article by Patrick Poole. This is the same judge, Michael J. Davis, chief judge of the district of Minnesota-- This article from Patrick Poole says: ``A terror `deradicalization' program--established in the `Ground Zero' of terror recruitment, Minnesota's Twin Cities--has already failed after just a few months. ``The program was established after a Federal court released 19-year- old terror suspect Abdullahi Yusuf to a halfway house earlier this year. Federal prosecutors opposed Yusuf's release, but were overruled by'' this big-hearted, caring ``Federal judge''--at least big-hearted and caring about radical Islam, not so much about victims of radical Islam. But Michael J. Davis cares deeply about those who want to kill us. So as the article says: ``Remarkably, Judge Davis said today in a separate case of six men charged with trying to join the Islamic State that he would be willing to consider `less restrictive options' than detaining the men--just a day after Yusuf's re-arrest.'' That is because he decided that he was smarter and more capable than anybody else in America. He could deradicalize people who want to kill Americans by just sending them through this program that he had helped with or proved: Gee, we are going to get you reading good material that really helps you see the wonder and glory of this country. And then, of course, I, Judge Michael J. Davis, will be a hero to all of my leftist friends because I cared more for the criminal radical Islamists than I did for the victims. And the left loves that kind of thing. ``Last May, Yusuf was arrested in Minneapolis airport while on his way of Syria by way of Turkey to join the Islamic State. One of his accomplices, Abdi Nur, did make it to Syria, and he now serves as an effective recruiter for the terror group. ``Just last week, The Wall Street Journal reported on the program with an article titled, `A Test Case for ``Deradicalization.' '' ``The path of reform for Abdullahi Yusuf, a U.S. teenager who tried to become a radical Islamic soldier, passes through writings of Martin Luther King, Jr. readings of the U.S. Constitution, and discussions about life and literature with a fellow Somali-American named Ahmed Amin. ``Mr. Yusuf's attempt to travel to the Middle East last year helped lead authorities to six Minnesota men who were charged last month in connection with a plan to join Islamic State abroad. The 19-year-old has become a test case for whether Americans lured by Islamic extremism can be deradicalized.'' Oh, I think they can, but I sure wouldn't trust them to Judge Michael J. Davis, if that is what we want. But see here again, this is once again pointing out the ingenuity of the Founders in creating three branches. We have the executive branch that is supposed to carry out the laws that the Congress, elected by the people, pass. We have two Houses of Congress to make it more difficult to pass laws.

I thought it would have been a good idea to let them live over at the Supreme Court if they want to micromanage them. But then, also, this judge like Michael J. Davis in Minnesota who decides, actually, he is not just judiciary; he is clairvoyant. He is a rehabilitative agent. He is everything to everybody, just the kind of judge you want. God in a robe. So, anyway, he put Mr. Yusuf through these reading materials. And I wonder, though, if he was a bit surprised when Yusuf was arrested because he is not following the program, and he is not reformed. But even that does not prevent God in a robe from saying: You know what? But these new terrorists that you have arrested, they are just a little misguided. I hate to have them in jail because if they are in jail, then the American people will be protected, but they won't be able to come to see how wonderful people like I am.

Very early on, I went with law enforcement to execute a warrant, and the individual, the subject of the warrant for arrest, had made clear that, when he saw any law enforcement officers, he was going to start shooting; he would kill any law enforcement officer that came out there. I don't forget the feelings that all of us had, even though some were very seasoned law officers, when you are approaching a dangerous building--in this case, a home--where somebody in there is threatening to kill anybody like you, you do have a little hair stand up on the back of your neck. You do realize you are putting your life at risk in trying to maintain order and civility by approaching somebody that is a threat to society. That was quite a lesson, that these law officers--whether they are new, whether they have been working for a long time--they are constantly in a situation where they don't know if, 10 minutes later, they may be dead in the service of their community, but they are serving anyway. We do owe them so much for what they do and what they risk on our behalf, so we are just grateful to all law enforcement officers willing to serve and protect all of us. We have a report here back in February, and this is an article from The Hill entitled: ``FBI investigating ISIS suspects in all 50 States.'' The article is quoting FBI Director James Comey, that he revealed Wednesday his agency is investigating suspected supporters of the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria in every State across the United States. Down further in the article, it said, ``Earlier this month, Comey said the FBI was investigating ISIS supporters in every State except Alaska.'' At the time of this article, at the end of February, he was saying: We are investigating ISIS suspects in all 50 States. Director Comey said: ``We have investigations of people in various stages of radicalization in all 50 States.'' He said: ``This isn't a New York phenomenon or a Washington phenomenon. This is in all 50 States and in ways that are very hard to see.'' He said: ``ISIL in particular is putting out a siren song with their slick propaganda through social media.'' He said: ``The message `resonates with troubled souls, people seeking meaning in some horribly misguided way,' '' and that ``those people exist in every State.'' His pronouncement in February should have been a siren song for Americans to understand there are people who live among us who want to destroy us and our way of life. Then it was rather interesting--that was February 25. Less than 2 months later, there was an article put out, Judicial Watch indicated that an ISIS camp was just a few miles from Texas, that Mexican authorities confirmed that. The article said: ``ISIS is operating a camp just a few miles from El Paso, Texas, according to Judicial Watch sources that include a Mexican Army field grade officer and a Mexican Federal Police Inspector. {time} 1300 ``The exact location where the terrorist group has established its base is around 8 miles from the U.S. border in an area known an `Anapra,' situated just west of Cuidad Juarez in the Mexican State of Chihuahua. Another ISIS cell to the west of Cuidad Juarez, in Puerto Palomas, targets the New Mexico towns of Columbus and Deming for easy access to the United States.'' So, anyway, after this article came out in April, I quoted from that, brought it up on the floor and-- Let's see. This article was 2 days later from FOX News: ``Islamic State fighters are operating training bases near the U.S. southern border and are being aided by violent drug cartels to smuggle terrorists into States like Texas, a report published Tuesday by a watchdog group claims.'' So, anyway, I brought that up. And this report seems to get even more legs after the Federal Government, though, denying that any such thing like that was occurring, apparently sent FBI officials to Mexico to meet with their counterterrorism experts, seemed to give some credence that there is something to be concerned about in the way of training of violent radical Islamists across our United States border. So the irony here is pretty profound. People all across the United States of America just accepted when the FBI Director says, you know, there are ISIS suspects in every State in the Union. People said: Wow, that is amazing. Man, they are here? I saw a headline of a survey just moments ago on FOX News saying, 6 out of 10 Americans believe that there are terrorists in their community. So how ironic that even the far left that turns a blind eye to radical Islam could be so accepting that, yes, there are radical Islamist terrorists in every State in the Union. And when Judicial Watch and Louie Gohmert quote from their material, quote other things going on to point out that there is a report that there is an ISIS camp across our border, the left went nuts, saying how crazy Judicial Watch was, how crazy I am for even mentioning this. There couldn't possibly be an ISIS camp in Mexico. Mr. Speaker, I hope you see the irony here. They are saying, yes, we believe there are radical Islamist terrorists in every State in the United States, but there couldn't possibly be ISIS across the border where the drug cartels are. And I haven't gotten a good explanation. Do they have so much faith and trust in the drug cartels' integrity that they would never associate with radical Islamists? Is that what they are saying by their cynicism about ISIS being in Mexico? Because it is a bit intriguing. But then again, some on the far left are educated way beyond their means--their mental capacity, at least--and so they have information; they just can't process it effectively. Because anyone who can readily accept when the FBI Director says there is ISIS in every State in the Union and we are investigating in every State in the Union radical Islamists--he doesn't use those terms because this administration doesn't want to offend any radical Islamists that want to kill us. So we don't use that term if you are in this administration, but I use the term because it is accurate. They are radical Islamists. So, anyway, it is just a great irony here. [[Page H3248]] Then this is an AP story from this week: ``Minnesota men accused of trying to join Islamic State ordered held, but may have other options.'' And that is because U.S. District Judge Michael Davis, who wears a dark robe to match his intellect--he is the same guy that previously-- this is also a May 12 article by Patrick Poole. This is the same judge, Michael J. Davis, chief judge of the district of Minnesota-- This article from Patrick Poole says: ``A terror `deradicalization' program--established in the `Ground Zero' of terror recruitment, Minnesota's Twin Cities--has already failed after just a few months. ``The program was established after a Federal court released 19-year- old terror suspect Abdullahi Yusuf to a halfway house earlier this year. Federal prosecutors opposed Yusuf's release, but were overruled by'' this big-hearted, caring ``Federal judge''--at least big-hearted and caring about radical Islam, not so much about victims of radical Islam. But Michael J. Davis cares deeply about those who want to kill us. So as the article says: ``Remarkably, Judge Davis said today in a separate case of six men charged with trying to join the Islamic State that he would be willing to consider `less restrictive options' than detaining the men--just a day after Yusuf's re-arrest.'' That is because he decided that he was smarter and more capable than anybody else in America. He could deradicalize people who want to kill Americans by just sending them through this program that he had helped with or proved: Gee, we are going to get you reading good material that really helps you see the wonder and glory of this country. And then, of course, I, Judge Michael J. Davis, will be a hero to all of my leftist friends because I cared more for the criminal radical Islamists than I did for the victims. And the left loves that kind of thing. ``Last May, Yusuf was arrested in Minneapolis airport while on his way of Syria by way of Turkey to join the Islamic State. One of his accomplices, Abdi Nur, did make it to Syria, and he now serves as an effective recruiter for the terror group. ``Just last week, The Wall Street Journal reported on the program with an article titled, `A Test Case for ``Deradicalization.' '' ``The path of reform for Abdullahi Yusuf, a U.S. teenager who tried to become a radical Islamic soldier, passes through writings of Martin Luther King, Jr. readings of the U.S. Constitution, and discussions about life and literature with a fellow Somali-American named Ahmed Amin. ``Mr. Yusuf's attempt to travel to the Middle East last year helped lead authorities to six Minnesota men who were charged last month in connection with a plan to join Islamic State abroad. The 19-year-old has become a test case for whether Americans lured by Islamic extremism can be deradicalized.'' Oh, I think they can, but I sure wouldn't trust them to Judge Michael J. Davis, if that is what we want. But see here again, this is once again pointing out the ingenuity of the Founders in creating three branches. We have the executive branch that is supposed to carry out the laws that the Congress, elected by the people, pass. We have two Houses of Congress to make it more difficult to pass laws. They wanted some obstacles and problems to passing legislation too quickly. And then we have the judicial branch that will handle criminal cases, handle civil cases, handle review of actions to ensure their constitutionality. And then we also have this part of the judicial branch, like five of the Justices on the Supreme Court that decided that they wanted to micromanage enemy combatants at Guantanamo. I thought it would have been a good idea to let them live over at the Supreme Court if they want to micromanage them. But then, also, this judge like Michael J. Davis in Minnesota who decides, actually, he is not just judiciary; he is clairvoyant. He is a rehabilitative agent. He is everything to everybody, just the kind of judge you want. God in a robe. So, anyway, he put Mr. Yusuf through these reading materials. And I wonder, though, if he was a bit surprised when Yusuf was arrested because he is not following the program, and he is not reformed. But even that does not prevent God in a robe from saying: You know what? But these new terrorists that you have arrested, they are just a little misguided. I hate to have them in jail because if they are in jail, then the American people will be protected, but they won't be able to come to see how wonderful people like I am. So I want them to develop warm and loving, fuzzy feelings for people on the left, like me. So I want to find some way we don't have to keep them in jail. Anyway, there is another article about that. But it is just amazing to me when people exceed the bounds of their job in government because they think they are wiser than the Founders. They think they are wiser than anyone that has gone on before. We hear people in recent days on the issue of marriage talking in terms of how much smarter and how much more we know today than the ignoramuses of the past. And the ignorance that displays is pretty astounding. Solomon, for those who believe the Bible, Solomon, considered to be-- until he got sidetracked by having too many wives and concubines--was considered to be the wisest man in the world. And Solomon, credited for writing some of the things in the Old Testament--the Old Testament, as we call it--but in what we call Ecclesiastes, he points out, there is nothing new under the Sun. You think socialism, communism is a new idea? It is not new. It has been around forever. And every time it has been tried, it leads to totalitarianism. It leads to the loss of freedom, and then it fails because, as Margaret Thatcher once said, eventually you find out--well, you run out of other people's money to spend. It doesn't work. It won't work. Now, that is different from socialized medicine, like ObamaCare is taking us toward, government control. I have friends on the Republican side of the aisle who say, Louie, we won't have to worry. ObamaCare is going to fall of its own weight. The problem is government health care, socialized medicine, it never falls of its own weight. Socialism does. It can't survive because when you are paying people to not work the same amount you are paying people to work, eventually you destroy the society. And we are in the process of doing that here in America, paying people to do things that are destructive to their well-being. We ought to be incentivizing good conduct, not rewarding conduct destructive to the individual and to the Nation. But we continue down this path that has not been working for 50 years, so hopefully people are going to eventually get the message. But amidst this, this same week, I have a Wall Street Journal article, ``Deadly Mexican Cartel Rises as New Threat.'' It should be noted--Carlos the Jackal, probably the most notorious, famous assassin--had commented that he believed the only way to really bring down the United States would be for socialists and Islamists to join forces, and that could be the successful force to bring down the United States. Interesting observation from an anarchist like Carlos the Jackal. Interesting. {time} 1315 Anyway, Mr. Speaker, this article talks about the rise of the Mexican cartel and it says this in the second page of the article: ``The New Generation cartel is perhaps Mexico's most audacious and vicious criminal enterprise, after the government captured or killed most leaders of the Zetas gang based in northeastern Mexico, say officials and security analysts. Like the Zetas, originally formed by Army deserters, the New Generation gang favors paramilitary methods and has received tactical training from Mexican and foreign mercenaries, these people say, including the use of rocket-propelled grenades against the helicopter.'' So, let's see, Mr. Speaker, this columnist said the helicopter incident was a declaration of war. The coming months are going to be very hard in Jalisco. You have got violence building on our southern border, but don't worry. Our Justice Department has been very [[Page H3249]] helpful. We can't get documents because the Justice Department becomes an Injustice Department quite often in obfuscating--hiding documents, hiding the truth, preventing people from getting at the truth--and won't provide the documents to me that they provided to convicted terrorism supporters in the Holy Land Foundation trial. Oh, they sent me a couple Web sites I could visit. That was very nice and gracious of them. But basically they were covering up their tracks, being the most muddy--not transparent--Justice Department in my lifetime. That includes going back to the lack of transparency under J. Edgar Hoover when he became too enthralled with his power and began using FBI agents to investigate people not for information to introduce in court but just to use, apparently, to persuade them to do what the FBI director wanted. Information like that is dangerous, and the Founders knew that. Then there is another Wall Street article from May 14: ``FBI Says Texas Man Lied About Links to Syria.'' Imagine that, Mr. Speaker. They catch somebody who they have evidence to show he has got links to terrorism in Syria, and, lo and behold, they found out not only does he have links to terrorism but he may have actually lied to the FBI. Imagine that. The article points out that ``Bilal Abood, 37 years old, of Mesquite, Texas, was arrested Thursday after a 2-year game of cat and mouse with Federal agents, who questioned him repeatedly before and after he allegedly traveled to Syria in 2013.'' But anyway let's see. It says: ``A week later, agents interviewed him again and he admitted he planned to go to Syria to fight with the Free Syrian Army, according to the complaint. Unlike terror groups, such as Islamic State and the Nusra Front, the moderate FSA''--Free Syrian Army--``has received backing from the United States.'' Well, Mr. Speaker, they received backing from this administration is what the bottom line is, not from all of us here because some of us have been saying that this administration is providing weapons to the Islamic State. They were providing weapons to the so-called vetted moderate Free Syrian Army. Remarkably weapons that the Obama administration was providing to the vetted moderate Syrian Army kept ending up in Islamic State hands. And they were, Oh, gee, they raided, they took this stuff, they took the weapons, send us more. Well, the Obama administration wised up about 4 months. They suspended weapons shipment to the vetted moderate Free Syrian Army. But then, not to worry, they eventually started back sending weapons to the vetted moderate Free Syrian Army even after their leaders were saying, Yeah, we may disagree with the Islamic State on the leader, Assad, the leader in Syria, but we are brothers, and we do line up on most issues. So, Mr. Speaker, it is important to note terrorism is alive and well in the world, and this administration has done very little to stop it, has turned a blind eye to it, and we have got to do all we can to help them wake up and smell the gunpowder coming from radical Islamists. With that, Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. ____________________",package_114_249.csv,21376,21376,21441,"[congressional record volume 161, number 75 (friday, may 15, 2015)] [house] [pages h3246-h3249] from the congressional record online through the government publishing office [ www.gpo.gov ] honoring fallen law enforcement officers the speaker pro tempore (mr. knight). under the speaker's announced policy of january 6, 2015, the chair recognizes the gentleman from texas (mr. gohmert) for 30 minutes. mr. gohmert. mr. speaker, it is an honor and pleasure to follow my friend and fellow former judge from texas when he talks about praying. i know him to be a praying man. i also know his heart to be a big heart. we can disagree on issues, but he is a brother, as a christian, and he is a very good friend, and i appreciate his perspective very much. mr. al green of texas. will the gentleman yield? mr. gohmert. i yield to the gentleman from texas. mr. al green of texas. i thank the friend from the great state of texas. he and i happen to share more than being members of congress. we are members of congress from the same state. i am honored that you have not only worked hard in congress, but you have also been a part of activities outside of congress, and i am honored to work with you on at least one project, and we hope to do some good for the great state of texas on this project together. i am grateful to you, and i am grateful for your kind words. thank you so much. mr. gohmert. i would never question the heart or motivation of my friend al green. i know his heart to be bigger than most in washington. it is just an honor to serve with you. there is so much that has gone on this week. one of the things that has happened here in washington and continues to happen today is a tribute, memorial to law enforcement officers who have lost their lives in the line of duty--doing what?--serving and protecting. [[page h3247]] after the horrors and evil of 9/11/2001, it was encouraging to me to see so many people, once again, come to appreciate that the vast majority of law enforcement, the vast majority of first responders, they are serving and trying to protect for the good of others and willing to lay down their lives. as jesus said: no greater love is this than a man lay down his life for his friends. we have seen that in the hundreds of people--i think 273 lost their lives over this past year. over 40 have lost their lives this year in the line of duty. just like in any walk of life, there are bad apples, people who don't have the best motivation; but i would humbly submit, i believe with all my heart that, when it comes to law enforcement, the percentage of those who are not properly motivated is far, far less than in the general population. we do owe them so much. some people say: oh, well, we ought to just live and let live. they say: i am a christian. i believe in living and letting live. if you note, if you believe the bible, jesus was commenting, of course, his ultimate point was that we will be judged for what is in our heart by our father in heaven. he said, if you say ``raca,'' which was an offense back in that day, then you will answer to the courts. he understood, in an orderly society, you need a government; you need governing officials to which people will be responsible if they violate the law. that was also true in romans 13, anticipating, in an orderly society, you need a government with a sword to punish those who do evil. that is why 13:4 says: if you do you evil, be afraid, because god doesn't give the sword in vain. i know some people in the country start freaking out when i quote the most quoted book in the history of the country, as quoted here in the house of representatives and in the senate floor. it is part of our history. the bible is the most quoted book in congressional history-- was, is, and i hope will be in the future. we owe so much to the police who risk their lives. right out of law school, i was an assistant da for three counties in east texas. very early on, i went with law enforcement to execute a

they do and what they risk on our behalf, so we are just grateful to all law enforcement officers willing to serve and protect all of us. we have a report here back in february, and this is an article from the hill entitled: ``fbi investigating isis suspects in all 50 states.'' the article is quoting fbi director james comey, that he revealed wednesday his agency is investigating suspected supporters of the islamic state in iraq and syria in every state across the united states. down further in the article, it said, ``earlier this month, comey said the fbi was investigating isis supporters in every state except alaska.'' at the time of this article, at the end of february, he was saying: we are investigating isis suspects in all 50 states. director comey said: ``we have investigations of people in various stages of radicalization in all 50 states.'' he said: ``this isn't a new york phenomenon or a washington phenomenon. this is in all 50 states and in ways that are very hard to see.'' he said: ``isil in particular is putting out a siren song with their slick propaganda through social media.'' he said: ``the message `resonates with troubled souls, people seeking meaning in some horribly misguided way,' '' and that ``those people exist in every state.'' his pronouncement in february should have been a siren song for americans to understand there are people who live among us who want to destroy us and our way of life. then it was rather interesting--that was february 25. less than 2 months later, there was an article put out, judicial watch indicated that an isis camp was just a few miles from texas, that mexican authorities confirmed that. the article said: ``isis is operating a camp just a few miles from el paso, texas, according to judicial watch sources that include a mexican army field grade officer and a mexican federal police inspector. {time} 1300 ``the exact location where the terrorist group has established its base is around 8 miles

new mexico towns of columbus and deming for easy access to the united states.'' so, anyway, after this article came out in april, i quoted from that, brought it up on the floor and-- let's see. this article was 2 days later from fox news: ``islamic state fighters are operating training bases near the u.s. southern border and are being aided by violent drug cartels to smuggle terrorists into

we are investigating in every state in the union radical islamists--he doesn't use those terms because this administration doesn't want to offend any radical islamists that want to kill us. so we don't use that term if you are in this administration, but i use the term because it is accurate. they are radical islamists. so, anyway, it is just a great irony here. [[page h3248]] then this is an ap story from this week: ``minnesota men accused of trying to join islamic state ordered held, but may have other options.'' and that is because u.s. district judge michael davis, who wears a dark robe to match his intellect--he is the same guy that previously-- this is also a may 12 article by patrick poole. this is the same judge, michael j. davis, chief judge of the district of minnesota-- this article from patrick poole says: ``a terror `deradicalization' program--established in the `ground zero' of terror recruitment, minnesota's twin cities--has already failed after just a few months. ``the program was established after a federal court released 19-year- old terror suspect abdullahi yusuf to a halfway house earlier this year. federal prosecutors opposed yusuf's release, but were overruled by'' this big-hearted, caring ``federal judge''--at least big-hearted and caring about radical islam, not so much about victims of radical islam. but michael j. davis cares deeply about those who want to kill us. so as the article says: ``remarkably, judge davis said today in a separate case of six men charged with trying to join the islamic state that he would be willing to consider `less restrictive options' than detaining the men--just a day after yusuf's re-arrest.'' that is because he decided that he was smarter and more capable than anybody else in america. he could deradicalize people who want to kill americans by just sending them through this program that he had helped with or proved: gee, we are going to get you reading good material that really helps you see the wonder and glory of this country. and then, of course, i, judge michael j. davis, will be a hero to all of my leftist friends because i cared more for the criminal radical islamists than i did for the victims. and the left loves that kind of thing. ``last may, yusuf was arrested in minneapolis airport while on his way of syria by way of turkey to join the islamic state. one of his accomplices, abdi nur, did make it to syria, and he now serves as an effective recruiter for the terror group. ``just last week, the wall street journal reported on the program with an article titled, `a test case for ``deradicalization.' '' ``the path of reform for abdullahi yusuf, a u.s. teenager who tried to become a radical islamic soldier, passes through writings of martin luther king, jr. readings of the u.s. constitution, and discussions about life and literature with a fellow somali-american named ahmed amin. ``mr. yusuf's attempt to travel to the middle east last year helped lead authorities to six minnesota men who were charged last month in connection with a plan to join islamic state abroad. the 19-year-old has become a test case for whether americans lured by islamic extremism can be deradicalized.'' oh, i think they can, but i sure wouldn't trust them to judge michael j. davis, if that is what we want. but see here again, this is once again pointing out the ingenuity of the founders in creating three branches. we have the executive branch that is supposed to carry out the laws that the congress, elected by the people, pass. we have two houses of congress to make it more difficult to pass laws.

decides, actually, he is not just judiciary; he is clairvoyant. he is a rehabilitative agent. he is everything to everybody, just the kind of judge you want. god in a robe. so, anyway, he put mr. yusuf through these reading materials. and i wonder, though, if he was a bit surprised when yusuf was arrested because he is not following the program, and he is not reformed. but even that does not prevent god in a robe from saying: you know what? but these new terrorists that you have arrested, they are just a little misguided. i hate to have them in jail because if they are in jail, then the american people will be protected, but they won't be able to come to see how wonderful people like i am. so i want them to develop warm and loving, fuzzy feelings for people on the left, like me. so i want to find some way we don't have to keep them in jail. anyway, there is another article about that. but it is just amazing to me when people exceed the bounds of their job in government because they think they are wiser than the founders. they think they are wiser than anyone that has gone on before. we hear people in recent days on the issue of marriage talking in terms of how much smarter and how much more we know today than the ignoramuses of the past. and the ignorance that displays is pretty astounding. solomon, for those who believe the bible, solomon, considered to be-- until he

that here in america, paying people to do things that are destructive to their well-being. we ought to be incentivizing good conduct, not rewarding conduct destructive to the individual and to the nation. but we continue down this path that has not been working for 50 years, so hopefully people are going to eventually get the message. but amidst this, this same week, i have a wall street journal article, ``deadly mexican cartel rises as new threat.'' it should be noted--carlos the jackal, probably the most notorious, famous assassin--had commented that he believed the only way to really bring down the united states would be for socialists and islamists to join forces, and that could be the successful force to bring down the united states. interesting observation from an anarchist like carlos the jackal. interesting. {time} 1315 anyway, mr. speaker, this article talks about the rise of the mexican cartel and it says this in the second page of the article: ``the new generation cartel is perhaps mexico's most audacious and vicious criminal enterprise, after the government captured or killed most leaders of the zetas gang based in northeastern mexico, say officials and security analysts. like the zetas, originally formed by army deserters, the new generation gang favors paramilitary methods and has received tactical training from mexican and foreign mercenaries, these people say, including the use of rocket-propelled grenades against the helicopter.'' so, let's see, mr. speaker, this columnist said the helicopter incident was a declaration of war. the coming months are going to be very hard in jalisco. you have got violence building on our southern border, but don't worry. our justice department has been very [[page h3249]] helpful. we can't get documents because the justice department becomes an injustice department quite often in obfuscating--hiding documents, hiding the truth, preventing people from getting at the truth--and won't provide the documents to me that they provided to convicted terrorism supporters in the holy land foundation trial. oh, they sent me a couple web sites i could visit. that was very nice and gracious of them. but basically they were covering up their tracks, being the most muddy--not transparent--justice department in my lifetime. that includes going back to the lack of transparency under j. edgar hoover when he became too enthralled with his power and began using fbi agents to investigate people not for information to introduce in court but just to use, apparently, to persuade them to do what the fbi director wanted. information like that is dangerous, and the founders knew that. then there is another wall street article from may 14: ``fbi says texas man lied about links to syria.'' imagine that, mr. speaker. they catch somebody who they have evidence to show he has got links to terrorism in syria, and, lo and behold, they found out not only does he have links to terrorism but he may have actually lied to the fbi. imagine that. the article points out that ``bilal abood, 37 years old, of mesquite, texas, was arrested thursday after a 2-year game of cat and mouse with federal agents, who questioned him repeatedly before and after he allegedly traveled to syria in 2013.'' but anyway let's see. it says: ``a week later, agents interviewed him again and he admitted he planned to go to syria to fight with the free syrian army, according to the complaint. unlike terror groups, such as islamic state and the nusra front, the moderate fsa''--free syrian army--``has received backing from the united states.'' well, mr. speaker, they received backing from this administration is what the bottom line is, not from all of us here because some of us have been saying that this administration is providing weapons to the islamic state. they were providing weapons to the so-called vetted moderate free syrian army. remarkably weapons that the obama administration was providing to the vetted moderate syrian army kept ending up in islamic state hands. and they were, oh, gee, they raided, they took this stuff, they took the weapons, send us more. well, the obama administration wised up about 4 months. they suspended weapons shipment to the vetted moderate free syrian army. but then, not to worry, they eventually started back sending weapons to the vetted moderate free syrian army even after their leaders were saying, yeah, we may disagree with the islamic state on the leader, assad, the leader in syria, but we are brothers, and we do line up on most issues. so, mr. speaker, it is important to note terrorism is alive and well in the world, and this administration has done very little to stop it, has turned a blind eye to it, and we have got to do all we can to help them wake up and smell the gunpowder coming from radical islamists. with that, mr. speaker, i yield back the balance of my time. ____________________",21376

SAM FARR of california in the house of representatives Friday, May 15, 2015 Mr. FARR. Mr. Speaker, the Salinas Airport is a remarkable place. Earlier this week, my good friend at the Salinas Californian, Jeff Mitchell, captured the spirit of the airport best when he wrote on Thursday, May 14: The Salinas airport--to the untrained eye--is a funny place. Most of the time it doesn't look like much is happening there. But take a closer look and you'll find some interesting things going on there . . . The facility is the home airport for many of the corporate jets flown by our elite ag companies. It's also the home for a company--Cal Pacific Airmotive--that has gained a national reputation for the perfect restoration of the greatest World War II-era fighter ever made, the venerable P-51 Mustang. Finally, the Salinas airport is home to none other than Sean D. Tucker, a National Aerobatics Champion and U.S. Aviation Hall of Fame member. Now through the hard work of the Salinas Valley aviation community and the airport staff, the national Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association (AOPA) has picked the Salinas Airport as one of the sites for its 2015 national fly in. Residents in my Congressional District will have the opportunity to participate in educational forums and hear from national aviation speakers, view top of the line manufacturers, and see aerobatic performances. With our own hometown aerobatic star, Sean Tucker, I know the crowds will have a wonderful family experience. Americans have always been fascinated with flight, which propelled the Wright Brothers to aviation history by inventing the first three- axis control that enabled pilots, for the first time, to steer their aircraft and maintain equilibrium. As we enter our second hundred years of aviation advancement, space flight will become the norm and the United States will conquer new horizons. Mr. Speaker, I know that I speak for the House of Representatives in congratulating the Salinas Airport and Brett Godown, the Salinas Municipal Airport Manager, for hosting APOA the 2015. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 75 (Friday, May 15, 2015)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E717] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] THE 2015 AIRCRAFT OWNERS AND PILOTS ASSOCIATION FLY-IN IN SALINAS, CALIFORNIA ______ HON.

JAIME HERRERA BEUTLER of washington in the house of representatives Friday, May 15, 2015 Ms. HERRERA BEUTLER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Preeclampsia Awareness Month and the importance of addressing maternal and infant health. Preeclampsia is a serious and far too common complication of pregnancy and the postpartum period and is one of the leading causes of maternal deaths, illness, and premature birth. According to the Preeclampsia Foundation, the disease affects approximately 1 in 12 women, and can result in seizure, stroke, organ failure or death. Prenatal care is necessary if preeclampsia or risk of preeclampsia is to be identified and monitored to ensure the health of the mom and baby. Unfortunately, too many people are unaware of this potentially fatal condition. The main indicator of preeclampsia is high blood pressure. Additional symptoms of preeclampsia are common to pregnancy such as headaches, abdominal pain, shortness of breath, vomiting, confusion, heightened state of anxiety or visual disturbances such as oversensitivity to light or blurred vision. That is why I support the Preeclampsia Foundation's efforts to educate women and their families to know the symptoms, respond to warning signs, and seek prenatal care. So much more needs to be understood about this condition--why it occurs, how to cure it, and its long-term effect on a woman and her child's health. Research has demonstrated a possible direct link to the placenta. I understand that the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development at NIH has embarked on a new effort to understand diseases and conditions related to the placenta, and it is my hope that it leads to new discovery for preeclampsia and other conditions of pregnancy. Together we must do all we can to eliminate preventable maternal and infant death and disability. I am hopeful for the promise of our research efforts, and I am grateful for the work of clinicians around this country and organizations like the Preeclampsia Foundation who work so tirelessly to advance maternal and infant health and well- being.

BILL SHUSTER of pennsylvania in the house of representatives Friday, May 15, 2015 Mr. SHUSTER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the Pyrex brand of glassware on the occasion of their 100th year of business. Over the past century, the Pyrex brand of glassware products has become a staple of the American kitchen. It all started when a Corning Glass scientist gave his wife an improvised casserole pan made out of the cut-off bottoms of battery jars. After refining the product, the company capitalized on the glassware's potential and now, according to their parent company, World Kitchen, eight of every 10 homes in the United States have Pyrex products. The story behind the dependable Pyrex brand is a timeless testament to the innovative and hard-working nature of our country. As the Pyrex brand marks its centennial, it is essential to also recognize the extraordinary employees that have made the milestone possible. A tradition almost as old as the Pyrex brand itself is the manufacturing of its glassware in Charleroi, Pennsylvania. Charleroi has been a glassmaking presence since the late 19th century and has been producing Pyrex products ever since Corning Glass bought the local glassmaking facility. The Mon Valley community has subsequently provided a skilled workforce as reliable as the products they make, and that very group can proudly say that they not only produce tens of millions of Pyrex pieces but they have helped make the company what it is today. In addition to congratulating the Pyrex brand on its 100th anniversary, I am honored to highlight the hard-working Mon Valley community for its impressive efforts and continued commitment to making Pyrex successful. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 75 (Friday, May 15, 2015)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E717] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] RECOGNIZING THE PYREX BRAND AND THOSE WHO MAKE IT FOR 100 YEARS OF CONTINUED SUCCESS ______ HON.

The Administration has undertaken a comprehensive review process to solicit comment from all the stakeholders to rewrite the rules. While today's bill argues that the Army Corps and EPA have made insufficient effort to obtain input from the regulated community, there have been over 400 public meetings and hundreds of thousands of public comments. The public comment period lasted 207 days. This bill would throw out that whole process and force the Administration to start from scratch, delaying regulatory certainty and clean water protections indefinitely.

TED POE of texas in the house of representatives Friday, May 15, 2015 Mr. POE of Texas. Mr. Speaker, this week is National Police Week. We take this time to honor local, state and federal law enforcement officers for their tireless dedication. We also remember those who have been killed in the line of duty. Every day, brave men and women across the country put on the uniform, pin on the badge, and place themselves in harm's way to serve and protect our communities. I grew up in a small town outside of Temple, Texas. When I was 5 or 6 years old, my dad took me to watch a parade in Temple. I noticed a man standing at the curb who was not in the parade, just watching it and the people in the crowd. Of course, it was a local police officer. When my dad saw me watching this individual, he told me something I never forgot, ``If you are ever in trouble, if you ever need help, go to the person who wears the badge because they are a cut above the rest of us.'' Those words were true then and are true today. When people are in trouble and need help, who do they go to? Peace officers. These peace officers serve as the barrier between the law and the lawless, and they are all that separate us from the criminals and bad guys. Everyone remembers where they were on 9/11 when they learned of the terrorist attack. I was driving to the courthouse in Houston, listening to the radio when it was interrupted with news about the airplane that crashed into the World Trade Center. As I continued, I heard that a second plane had crashed into the Second Tower, then another plane crashed in Pennsylvania, and then a fourth [[Page E719]] plane crashed not far from here, into the Pentagon. As thousands of people ran away from the terrorist attack in New York, a much smaller group ran in the opposite direction--towards the scene of the attack--to help. This group was comprised of emergency technicians, firefighters, and peace officers. Seventy-two peace officers gave their lives that day. They, along with other first responders, gave the ultimate sacrifice so that others could live. This week we gather to honor peace officers from across the country for their service and sacrifice. We honor them because they truly are, as my dad said many years ago, ``a cut above the rest of us.'' My home state of Texas is home to some of America's finest lawmen. During my 22 years as a judge, I had the distinct privilege of working alongside many of them. These peace officers put their lives on the line each and every day to protect us all. But that protection comes at a price. Almost 60,000 lawmen each year are injured in the line of duty, and an average of 150 officers are killed in the line of duty each year. In 2014, 117 law enforcement officers were killed; 11 of these brave souls were from the great state of Texas: Mark Uland Kelley of the Trinity University Police Department; Detective Charles Dinwiddie of the Kileen Police Department; Sergeant Paul A. Buckles of the Potter County Sheriff's Office; Chief of Police Lee Dixon of the Little River-Academy Police Department; Chief of Police Michael Pimentel of the Elmendorf Police Department; Border Patrol Agent Tyler R. Robledo of the United States Department of Homeland Security--Customs and Boarder Protection--United States Border Patrol; Senior Deputy Jessica Laura Hollis of the Travis County Sheriffs Office; Sergeant Michael Lee Naylor of the Midland County Sheriffs Office; Deputy Sheriff Jesse Valdez, III of the Harris County Sheriff's Office; Constable Robert Parker White of the El Paso County Constable's Office--Precinct One; and Sergeant Alejandro ``Alex'' Martinez of the Willacy County Sheriff's Office. These 10 men and 1 woman represent all that is good and right in our country. This week we remember those brave Texas officers and all officers who have been killed or wounded in the line of duty. And we say ``thank you'' to the thousands of men and women who continue to serve. And that's just the way it is. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 75 (Friday, May 15, 2015)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Pages E718-E719] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] NATIONAL POLICE WEEK _____ HON.

CHRIS VAN HOLLEN of maryland in the house of representatives Thursday, May 14, 2015 Mr. VAN HOLLEN. Madam Speaker, I rise today in strong support of this important legislation to provide for Congressional review of any final nuclear agreement with Iran. It is the policy of the United States to prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon. That is my position, and it has been the position of both President Obama and a majority in the United States Congress. As I indicated in a statement a few weeks ago, I support President Obama's ongoing effort to work with our P5+1 partners to achieve a strong and verifiable agreement to prevent Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapon. This legislation makes clear that Congress must exercise its responsibilities in this process. As the Administration has acknowledged, many important details remain to be worked out before the June 30 deadline. These include ensuring that inspectors are able to visit all nuclear sites in Iran, that sanctions only begin to unwind after the International Atomic Energy Agency confirms that Iran is complying with the terms of the final agreement, that the ``snap back'' of sanctions is assured should Iran violate the agreement, and that Iran implements an agreed set of measures to address the IAEA's concerns regarding the possible military dimensions of its program. I will be carefully monitoring and reviewing the ongoing negotiations to determine whether the final agreement meets the objectives we established. The legislation before us today ensures the very important role that Congress must play in this process. It provides that Congress will review this agreement and have the opportunity to act. Moreover, it makes clear that any repeal of sanctions legislation will require congressional action. As negotiations continue, I look forward to working with the president and my congressional colleagues to prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon. I agree with President Obama that it would be best if we can achieve that objective by negotiating a verifiable agreement. But I also agree with him that no deal is better than a bad deal. Madam Speaker, the President and a majority in the Congress are united in our commitment to prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon. Let us continue to pursue that objective together. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 75 (Friday, May 15, 2015)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E719] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] PROTECTING VOLUNTEER FIREFIGHTERS AND EMERGENCY RESPONDERS ACT ______ speech of HON.

Mr. Speaker, I come to the floor today to recognize and commend my constituent Favil West on being named Nevada Senior Citizen of the Year for 2015. Favil is a resident of Henderson, Nevada, where he has lived with Pat, his wife of 54 years, since 2000. A tireless advocate for southern Nevada's senior community, Favil co- founded The Foundation Assisting Seniors to improve the lives of seniors in his own community through programs designed to assist seniors in times of illness, recovery, confinement at home, and coping with loss of a loved one. Among the most pressing challenges facing our senior communities are the health and safety risks that come with living alone. Favil worked with the Foundation Assisting Seniors to develop a solution to this challenge. Last fall, Favil developed the HowRU Program, an effort specifically designed to minimize risks of living alone by maintaining daily contact with their senior clients. The program calls the subscriber daily at a designated time to see if they are doing okay. Think of the peace of mind that daily contact brings not only the seniors who participate, but also their family members. That peace of mind is the result of Favil's devotion to serving fellow senior citizens in his community. I congratulate Favil West on being named Nevada Senior Citizen of the Year for 2015.

WILLIAM R. KEATING of massachusetts in the house of representatives Friday, May 15, 2015 Mr. KEATING. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize John Francis Smith, a patrolman from Lynn, Massachusetts who died, as a result of injuries sustained in the line of duty, on August 19, 1934. Today being Peace Officers Memorial Day, I can think of no more fitting occasion to honor his commitment to his community and family. Patrolman Smith was a sixteen year veteran of the Lynn Police Department at the time of his fateful incident. Though his initial violent confrontation did not prove fatal, the wounds sustained that day did prove to be grievous. Patrolman Smith was rushed into emergency surgery, which would prolong his life by an additional two years. Despite his life threatening wounds, John F. Smith eventually returned to active patrol duty, serving his community to the best of his ability. Sadly, the wounds suffered in 1932, eventually took his life on August 19th, 1934. In addition to his dedicated service as a patrolman in the Lynn Police Department, John F. Smith was a loving husband, and father to nine children. His family has continued to grow and flourish in the eight decades since his untimely passing. In the five generations since his watch ended, public service has remained a very important component of the Smith family. Several of the descendants went on to serve in the Lynn Police Department, and others still got involved in municipal government. But, we can all be thankful for the precedent set by John Francis Smith's service to his community. Mr. Speaker, I am proud to honor John Francis Smith on this day dedicated to the men and women who have fallen in the line of duty. I ask that my colleagues join me in commemorating his sacrifice in the pursuit of a more perfect community.

Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize John Francis Smith, a patrolman from Lynn, Massachusetts who died, as a result of injuries sustained in the line of duty, on August 19, 1934. Today being Peace Officers Memorial Day, I can think of no more fitting occasion to honor his commitment to his community and family. Patrolman Smith was a sixteen year veteran of the Lynn Police Department at the time of his fateful incident. Though his initial violent confrontation did not prove fatal, the wounds sustained that day did prove to be grievous. Patrolman Smith was rushed into emergency surgery, which would prolong his life by an additional two years. Despite his life threatening wounds, John F. Smith eventually returned to active patrol duty, serving his community to the best of his ability. Sadly, the wounds suffered in 1932, eventually took his life on August 19th, 1934. In addition to his dedicated service as a patrolman in the Lynn Police Department, John F. Smith was a loving husband, and father to nine children. His family has continued to grow and flourish in the eight decades since his untimely passing. In the five generations since his watch ended, public service has remained a very important component of the Smith family. Several of the descendants went on to serve in the Lynn Police Department, and others still got involved in municipal government. But, we can all be thankful for the precedent set by John Francis Smith's service to his community. Mr. Speaker, I am proud to honor John Francis Smith on this day dedicated to the men and women who have fallen in the line of duty. I ask that my colleagues join me in commemorating his sacrifice in the pursuit of a more perfect community.

MARCY KAPTUR of ohio in the house of representatives Friday, May 15, 2015 Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to join the men and women of Local 50 of the United Association of Journeymen Plumbers, Steamfitters and Service Mechanics' 125th anniversary. I join in the union's celebration and add my congratulations to the chorus in recognizing this remarkable milestone event. The union's original 37 members were granted a charter on December 1, 1890 after previous association with the International Association. Aggressive organizing efforts brought the city's pipe craftsmen together and the union grew to nearly 90 members by 1897. During this time the local worked not only to increase its membership, but also the wages of its members who had been earning on average 30 cents an hour in a sixty hour work week. The Local's history reports that one of its first major construction projects was the Nasby Building, Toledo's first skyscraper at six stories tall. By the end of its first decade, Local 50 craftsmen also helped to build Toledo landmarks the Gardner Building, the Spitzer Building and the Lucas County Courthouse. During this time of its initial establishment and growth, the Local's history explains that its leadership was able to work with are contractors and business owners while adhering to its primary objective: ``Solidarity among workers for the benefit of all.'' As the new century dawned, there were rivalries between the UA and other unions which ultimately weakened the relationship between Local 50 and contractors and resulted in wage and overtime differentials among the crafts. However, these early power struggles eventually served to strengthen Local 50, which emerged from the battles a strong and powerful leader in Toledo's labor movement. Through World War I, fears of Communist infiltration, tensions between management and labor, violent strikes, Prohibition and the Great Depression, Local 50 suffered, but survived. Then came the 1934 Electric Auto-Lite Strike. The Local 50 history notes, `` `The outcome of the Auto-Lite Strike strengthened the Toledo Central Labor Union, its affiliate locals and the Lucas County Unemployed League, leading to further organizing activity in the city.' The strike also led to the creation of the Toledo Industrial Peace Board, which would go on to become a national model for strike resolution.'' President Franklin Roosevelt's New Deal saved Local 50. Its members were employed by many of the public works building efforts the New Deal initiated, including the city's Collins Park Water Treatment Plant, completed in 1941 and still operating in testament to the members' skills. World War II brought increased work and technological and training improvements. As the union grew, progressive changes were initiated for its membership. The Health and Welfare Fund was created in 1952 followed by pension, holiday and retirement plans. Beginning in the 1950s, the union's membership was kept busy with many new buildings going up along Toledo's downtown skyline and new buildings at the University of Toledo. In 1970, the members of Local 50 began the biggest project in its history: the building of the Davis-Besse nuclear power plant. The history reports that during the eight-year building project, ``Local 50 members dismantled and rebuilt components of nearly every piping system installed in the plant.'' Local 50 then joined with other unions in the Northwest Ohio Building Trades to strengthen further its efforts on behalf of its membership. This coalition was crucial to the unions during the economic downturn of the 1980s and the subsequent fallout of the challenges to working families brought by that economy. The Local's history explains the union was able to remain strong ``by `drawing on the highest traditions of craft unionism and moral guidance provided by the hearts and minds of its membership.' The 1990s saw the centennial celebration of Local 50 as well as employment in large construction projects and a renewed emphasis on continual training. As the new century began, the jobs were still going strong. A new union hall and training center opened on August 12, 2003 with a state-of-the-art training center completed in 2009. Through the first years of the 21st Century, Local 50 members were again an integral part of major building efforts at universities, industries and public construction in our region. The January 4, 2000 edition of ``The Pipe Line'' Voice of the Building Trades printed this truth which summarizes the U.S. labor movement and the journey of Local 50: ``When Local 50 was born, there were no pensions, no hospitalization, no scholarships, no picnics, no dinner dances, no apprenticeships, no Journeyman training and no credit union. Each of these benefits grew through struggle and dedication. `We stand on the shoulders of those who came before.' I don't know who said this, but it is certainly true of Local 50 . . . Over the last 100 years, labor has changed the face of this nation. We have weekends, Social Security, living wages, Health and Welfare, pensions, 8 hour days, safety provisions, and other benefits which are a direct result of labor's struggles.'' I am reminded of labor leader Richard Trumka's statement that ``There is nothing stronger than the American labor movement. United, we cannot and we will not be turned aside. We'll work for it, sisters and brothers. We'll stand for it. Together. Each of us. To bring out the best in America. To bring out the best in ourselves, and each other.'' The brothers and sisters of Local 50 in Northwest Ohio have done just this for 125 years, helping to create the middle class and bringing out the best that is in us. United, its members have stood strong over three centuries. United, its members will stand strong and in solidarity in the centuries to come. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 75 (Friday, May 15, 2015)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E721] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] CELEBRATING 125 YEARS OF L CAL 50 OF THE UNITED ASSOCIATION OF JOURNEYMEN PLUMBERS, STEAMFITTERS AND SERVICE MECHANICS _____ HON.

CHRIS VAN HOLLEN of maryland in the house of representatives Thursday, May 14, 2015 Mr. VAN HOLLEN. Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 2297, the Hezbollah International Financing Prevention Act. The aim of the bill is to curtail the funding of Hezbollah's domestic and international terrorist activities by disrupting its logistics and financial network. The bill proposes diplomatic, legislative, and executive strategies to combat Hezbollah including directing the Treasury Department to prohibit or impose strict restrictions on the activities of financial institutions that knowingly facilitate transactions for the terrorist group. Some of the world's most powerful banks are suspected of knowingly helping Hezbollah fund its terror operations by concealing billions of dollars in transactions with its Iranian sponsor. This bill will help to curb those activities. H.R. 2297 is largely the same bill as that which passed the House unanimously last July. The only differences are minor and include the stripping of the findings clauses and the removal of the section on conflict minerals. Hezbollah's global logistics and financial network is a lifeline to the organization that strengthens its power to consolidate within countries such as Lebanon and Syria. I encourage my colleagues join me again in supporting the bill. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 75 (Friday, May 15, 2015)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E721] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] HEZBOLLAH INTERNATIONAL FINANCING PREVENTION ACT OF 2015 ______ speech of HON.

DANA ROHRABACHER of california in the house of representatives Friday, May 15, 2015 Mr. ROHRABACHER. Mr. Speaker, I would like to acknowledge the accomplishments of [[Page E722]] my constituent, Ms. Becky Mudd. Becky ran a 263-mile course from Huntington Beach, California to the border of Arizona in nine days to raise public awareness of and funds for pediatric cancer research. Over the nine day period, Becky ran daily and dedicated parts of her journey to different forms of childhood cancer. She dedicated the first day of her run to Samuel Jeffers who at age 8 lost his life to brain cancer. The Jeffers family was Becky's support crew during her run. As Becky neared the halfway point of her run in the city of Banning, California, the police chief rode alongside her on a bicycle. Becky made a brief stop at Banning City Hall to meet with families who had lost children to cancer. She surpassed her fundraising goal, raising more than $7,500 to support the Pediatric Cancer Research Foundation. Through her activism, Becky has touched the lives of families and children who have been affected by pediatric cancer. Becky is supporting a tremendous effort to raise public awareness of a disease that this year is estimated by the American Cancer Society to affect 10,380 children in the United States under the age of 15. Her daily efforts to bring pediatric cancer to the forefront honors the memory of her two sisters, Robin Ross and Rhonda Ross, both of whom lost their lives to cancer. Becky was born and raised in Orange County, California. She is a resident of my 48th Congressional District in Laguna Beach, California and a longtime employee of the Orange County Water District. I commend and applaud her unstinting work to support pediatric cancer research. It is my honor to join with my colleagues in recognition of Becky Mudd. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 75 (Friday, May 15, 2015)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Pages E721-E722] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] RECOGNIZING BECKY MUDD _____ HON.

CAROLYN B. MALONEY of new york in the house of representatives Friday, May 15, 2015 Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, I am honored to introduce today the Gun Show Loophole Closing Act--critical legislation to keep dangerous weapons away from criminals and other prohibited persons.

States across the country, including my home state of New York, have recognized the danger posed by this significant gap in our gun laws that allows complete strangers to buy and sell guns without the background check requirements Congress passed in the Brady Bill. I'm proud that there is momentum around the country to update our gun laws and ensure that weapons do not end up in the wrong hands--but the fact is that we need a federal solution to this national problem. The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives has cited gun shows as a ``major trafficking channel'', and lax gun show regulations in one state can allow guns in the hands of criminals in communities many states away. The Gun Show Loophole Closing Act will close this gap in existing law and give the ATF the resources and authority it needs to ensure that gun shows do not facilitate dangerous gun sales. The legislation will make sure that law enforcement knows the details about shows and that records are kept on firearm sales.

BORDALLO of guam in the house of representatives Wednesday, May 13, 2015 The House in Committee of the Whole House on the state of the Union had under consideration the bill (H.R. 1735) to authorize appropriations for fiscal year 2016 for military activities of the Department of Defense and for military construction, to prescribe military personnel strengths for such fiscal year, and for other purposes: Ms. BORDALLO. Mr. Chair, I rise to discuss several important provisions included in H.R. 1735, the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2016. The bill provides critical authorities to support our men and women in uniform. In particular, I appreciate the leadership of Readiness Chairman, Rep. Rob Wittman of Virginia, and the way we have worked together to address the readiness of our United States military. The underlying bill takes important steps to provide authorities and funds to support for the readiness of our military to meet the full spectrum of threats. However, I have concerns about an amendment that is in en-bloc package 1 and sponsored by Congressman Hanna of New York. While I do not oppose the entire en-bloc package I am concerned about the potential impacts of Mr. Hanna's amendment on reverse auctions. In last year's defense bill we carried a provision that provided a framework to conduct reverse auctions in the Department of Defense. I am concerned that Mr. Hanna's amendment, as offered, is too broad and does not allow ample time for the DoD to implement what we required just months ago. The amendment would restrict the use of reverse auctions on procurement of certain items for the protection of Federal employees or members of the Armed Forces. Such broad language could include items that are more [[Page E723]] appropriately procured through reverse auctions. There is also no evidence that reverse auctions have been harmful in the procurement of any personal safety devices including bullet-proof vests. Finally, the amendment includes a definition of design and construction services that is overly broad and could preclude contracting officials from using reverse auctions to save the government significant funding. For example, it defines design and construction services to include interior design and landscape design. Use of reverse auctions may be an appropriate way to save the government significant funding. Ultimately, I appreciate the gentlemen's intent to provide a government-wide framework for reverse auctions but I am concerned the language is overly broad and could have the unintended consequences for contracting officers and potentially add costs instead of save the government valuable funding. I look forward to working with Mr. Hanna of New York and Ms. Meng of New York to address their concerns during Conference Committee on the FY16 NDAA. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 75 (Friday, May 15, 2015)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Pages E722-E723] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] NATIONAL DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION ACT FOR FISCAL YEAR 2016 ______ speech of HON.

ELEANOR HOLMES NORTON of the district of columbia in the house of representatives Friday, May 15, 2015 Ms. NORTON. Mr. Speaker, I rise to introduce a bill, the Racial Profiling Prevention Act, to reestablish a federal grant program for states that desire to develop racial profiling laws, collect and maintain appropriate data, design programs to reduce racial profiling, and train law enforcement officers. We were successful in getting the program included in the Safe, Accountable, Flexible, Efficient Transportation Equity Act: A Legacy for Users (SAFETEA-LU) in 2005. Although the program was just a small piece of the large SAFETEA-LU bill, nearly half of the states competed and ultimately participated in the program for multiple years. This experience speaks to state desires to deal with their own policing and profiling issues and to the usefulness of the program to states. Racial profiling is a form of racial discrimination that has been thrust back into the forefront of national concern by the tragic deaths of Black men by police and national demonstrations and disturbances, most recently in Baltimore, Maryland. Racial profiling on roads built with federal funds is a violation of Title VI of the 1964 Civil Rights Act, because it amounts to a government subsidy of discrimination. However, while racial profiling remains more widespread in our country than most other forms of discrimination, there is little experience in developing legislation in this sensitive area to address racial profiling while allowing for appropriate law enforcement. My bill would help states to better develop their racial profiling laws and help train law enforcement to avoid these problems. My bill imposes no mandates on states. It simply authorizes a grant program, but does not require states to participate. However, it provides resources that many states and localities clearly need if they are to curb racial profiling. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 75 (Friday, May 15, 2015)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E723] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] INTRODUCTION OF THE RACIAL PROFILING PREVENTION ACT _____ HON.

KING,"[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 75 (Friday, May 15, 2015)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E723] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] RECOGNIZING AMERICAN MUSIC LEGEND AND MISSISSIPPI NATIVE B.B. KING _____ HON. BENNIE G. THOMPSON of mississippi in the house of representatives Friday, May 15, 2015 Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the life and legacy of one of Mississippi's favorite sons and one of the icons of American music, Riley B. (``B.B.'') King. Born on a plantation between Indianola and Itta Bena, Mississippi, on September 16, 1925, B.B. King was raised in the Mississippi Delta and went on to become the unquestioned ``King of the Blues.'' Like many great musicians, B.B. King began his music career in church--singing in the choir of his grandmother's church in Kilmichael, Mississippi. Eventually, he went on to earn nickels and dimes for playing the guitar in the surrounding area. Mr. King was then introduced to Beale Street in Memphis and the Sonny Boy Williamson's Radio Show where he received his big break and gained his nickname ``Beale Street Blues Boy'' which was ultimately shortened to ``B.B.'' In the 1950's, B.B. King embarked on what would be a legendary touring career. This included a record-setting 342 appearances in 1956 with his band throughout the country in many venues ranging from those on the so-called ``Chit'lin Circuit'' to symphony concert halls. B.B. King often spent three hundred days out of the year performing on the road--even well into his 80's. In one of the most unruly experiences he had on the road, he was playing a concert hall where a fight broke out, a kerosene lamp was knocked over and a fire was started in the hall. B.B. realized that in the rush, he left his beloved guitar in the hall and ran back in to get it. He later discovered that the fight broke out over a woman named Lucille and he decided to name his guitar after her as a reminder to never do anything that crazy again. To this day, his trademark, black Gibson guitars are called ``Lucille.'' B.B. King had one of the most identifiable and unique guitar styles in music history. He integrated complex string blends and his left hand vibrato which created an almost vocal-sounding guitar sound. This sound can be heard on his many hits including ``Three O'Clock Blues,'' ``The Thrill Is Gone,'' and ``Stormy Monday'' B.B. King's awards and honors are almost countless. He was inducted into the Blues Hall of Fame in 1984 and into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1987. He has received the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award, Kennedy Center Honors and the Presidential Medal of Freedom for his contribution to American music. Additionally, he has been bestowed honorary doctorates from Tougaloo College, Mississippi Valley State University, Rhodes College, Yale University and Brown University. Although he had such immense success all over the world, B.B. King never lost touch with his Mississippi Delta roots and each year returned to his hometown of Indianola to give a concert at the B.B. King Homecoming Blues Festival. His iconic impact on music is a source of great pride for all Mississippians--especially those in the Delta. Mr. Speaker, I ask that you and my colleagues join me in celebrating the life and legacy of B.B. King. His work ethic and talent were immeasurable and his impact on American music is undeniable. He was a great bluesman, a great Mississippian and a great American. The ``King'' may have died today but his music will live on forever. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 75 (Friday, May 15, 2015)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E723] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] RECOGNIZING AMERICAN MUSIC LEGEND AND MISSISSIPPI NATIVE B.B.

KING _____ HON. BENNIE G. THOMPSON of mississippi in the house of representatives Friday, May 15, 2015 Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the life and legacy of one of Mississippi's favorite sons and one of the icons of American music, Riley B. (``B.B.'') King. Born on a plantation between Indianola and Itta Bena, Mississippi, on September 16, 1925, B.B. King was raised in the Mississippi Delta and went on to become the unquestioned ``King of the Blues.'' Like many great musicians, B.B. King began his music career in church--singing in the choir of his grandmother's church in Kilmichael, Mississippi. Eventually, he went on to earn nickels and dimes for playing the guitar in the surrounding area. Mr. King was then introduced to Beale Street in Memphis and the Sonny Boy Williamson's Radio Show where he received his big break and gained his nickname ``Beale Street Blues Boy'' which was ultimately shortened to ``B.B.'' In the 1950's, B.B. King embarked on what would be a legendary touring career. This included a record-setting 342 appearances in 1956 with his band throughout the country in many venues ranging from those on the so-called ``Chit'lin Circuit'' to symphony concert halls. B.B. King often spent three hundred days out of the year performing on the road--even well into his 80's. In one of the most unruly experiences he had on the road, he was playing a concert hall where a fight broke out, a kerosene lamp was knocked over and a fire was started in the hall. B.B. realized that in the rush, he left his beloved guitar in the hall and ran back in to get it. He later discovered that the fight broke out over a woman named Lucille and he decided to name his guitar after her as a reminder to never do anything that crazy again. To this day, his trademark, black Gibson guitars are called ``Lucille.'' B.B. King had one of the most identifiable and unique guitar styles in music history. He integrated complex string blends and his left hand vibrato which created an almost vocal-sounding guitar sound. This sound can be heard on his many hits including ``Three O'Clock Blues,'' ``The Thrill Is Gone,'' and ``Stormy Monday'' B.B. King's awards and honors are almost countless. He was inducted into the Blues Hall of Fame in 1984 and into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1987. He has received the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award, Kennedy Center Honors and the Presidential Medal of Freedom for his contribution to American music. Additionally, he has been bestowed honorary doctorates from Tougaloo College, Mississippi Valley State University, Rhodes College, Yale University and Brown University. Although he had such immense success all over the world, B.B. King never lost touch with his Mississippi Delta roots and each year returned to his hometown of Indianola to give a concert at the B.B. King Homecoming Blues Festival. His iconic impact on music is a source of great pride for all Mississippians--especially those in the Delta. Mr. Speaker, I ask that you and my colleagues join me in celebrating the life and legacy of B.B. King. His work ethic and talent were immeasurable and his impact on American music is undeniable. He was a great bluesman, a great Mississippian and a great American.

DONNA F. EDWARDS of maryland in the house of representatives Friday, May 15, 2015 Ms. EDWARDS. Mr. Speaker, education is the key to building a workforce prepared to meet the needs and challenges of the 21st century global economy. However, every year more than 1.2 million students drop out of high schools across the United States. Students who drop out of high school not only reduce their opportunity to learn, but also tend to earn less over the course of their life and are often less prepared to compete in the workforce. Adults who drop out of high school and do not receive their GED earn on average 41 percent less than their counterparts who completed high school. In addition, reducing the high school dropout rate could provide a significant boost to our economy. A study by researchers at Columbia University estimates that the net economic benefit per student graduating high school is approximately $127,000. Mr. Speaker, that is why today I reintroduced my Broadening Opportunities Through Education Act. This legislation provides additional resources to states that raise the age of compulsory school attendance through age 17. These resources are designed to ensure that students at risk of dropping out receive the support they need to reach their fullest potential. These funds would go towards establishing or expanding work-based programs that integrate academic and career-based skills through career and technical training and apprenticeships; implementing early warning systems to help high schools and middle schools to identify struggling students and implement evidence based interventions; and increasing support systems for students through activities such as student advising and one-to-one mentoring. As Congress continues to work on strategies to address our deficit and grow our 21st century economy, we cannot forget that our greatest asset is the knowledge base of our workforce. I encourage my colleagues to cosponsor the Broadening Opportunities Through Education Act and help me bring this program to fruition. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 75 (Friday, May 15, 2015)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E723] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] THE INTRODUCTION OF THE BROADENING OPPORTUNITIES THROUGH EDUCATION ACT _____ HON.

Bill was very kind and hardworking but above all else, he loved his family and they were his most prized possession. For all who knew Bill, one of his proudest achievements in life had been serving as an Ensign in the U.S. Navy. He was stationed as Commissary Officer on Guam, until he was honorably discharged in 1946. Bill later dedicated over 32 years, working for General Electric (GE) in computer systems until finally retiring in 1988. Bill was passionate about cooking, photography, writing, and working with computers. On January 16, 1955 Bill married Ms. Joyce (Harkins) Walker in northern Georgia and later the pair welcomed their son Jeffrey and daughter Nancy.

We are so grateful that Mayor McLendon has given so much of himself to the city of Richland, Georgia. A man of great integrity, he serves as an inspiration to other public officials in the city and surrounding areas, as well as to those who strive to better their own communities.

WEICKER, JR., FORMER GOVERNOR AND SENATOR OF CONNECTICUT","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 75 (Friday, May 15, 2015)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Pages E724-E725] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] IN RECOGNITION OF LOWELL P. WEICKER, JR., FORMER GOVERNOR AND SENATOR OF CONNECTICUT _____ HON. JOE COURTNEY of connecticut in the house of representatives Friday, May 15, 2015 Mr. COURTNEY. Mr. Speaker, today I rise to recognize Lowell P. Weicker, Jr., former Governor and Senator of Connecticut, on the dedication of the Lowell P. Weicker Building at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) in Bethesda, Maryland. Lowell Weicker served as the 85th Governor of Connecticut from 1991 to 1995, prior to which he represented Connecticut in the United States Senate from 1971 to 1989. In 1981, when President Reagan submitted his first budget to Congress, he proposed significant cuts to domestic programs, including the NIH and services for the disabled and disadvantaged. Then-Senator Weicker led a band of Republicans to respond to these proposed cuts and worked with Democrats to craft a budget that restored funding for the NIH. In 1983, Senator Weicker ascended to Chairman of the Labor, Health, and Human Services Appropriations Subcommittee. From that post, Senator Weicker defended the NIH from proposed cuts to research on cancer and Alzheimer's, and he held the first hearings on HIV/AIDS research. In the early 1980s, few Americans understood what the AIDS virus was and how it was transmitted. Many held prejudices against those who were most initially affected by the disease. Senator Weicker was ahead of his time in seeing HIV/AIDS as an emerging health crisis. While support for AIDS research was controversial, Senator Weicker stood firm in his support for science and the community, and preserved research from the threat of prejudice. Senator Weicker recognized the need for our government to fight the AIDS epidemic comprehensively, from research to treatment to public education. Senator Weicker implored his colleagues to change their attitudes on AIDS, asking them, ``When in America did we ask how you got sick before coming to your assistance?'' In 1986, Senator Weicker played a critical role in securing the first funding for clinical trials on AZT and treatment for 10,000 AIDS infected patients. AZT was a transformative and first in a line of drugs that helped turned the tide in treatment for HIV/AIDS. Weicker's support laid the groundwork for the approval of AZT as an effective treatment by the FDA in 1987. As Chairman of the Labor-Health Appropriations Subcommittee, Senator Weicker did more than defend the NIH budget, he helped secure a 56 percent increase, translating into lifesaving research for millions of Americans. Moreover, Senator Weicker led the fight to grow federal funding to combat AIDS from $64 million in 1984 to $925 million in 1988. He also worked for health and education programs for physically and developmentally disabled persons and the poor. Weicker sponsored the Protection and Advocacy for the Mentally Ill Act in 1985 and in 1988 introduced legislation that would become the Americans with Disabilities Act. Even after his service in the U.S. Senate, he has continued to champion medical research, launching Research!America in 1989, and serving as President of the Board of Directors of Trust for America's Health, and as a Director of the National Library of Medicine of the National Institutes of Health since February 2003. On Tuesday, May 5, the National Institutes of Health held a ceremony dedicating the newly-renovated Lowell P. Weicker Building, where scientists in the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases will conduct the lifesaving research then-Senator Weicker fought so hard to protect. Speakers at the ceremony included Dr. Francis Collins, Director of the National Institutes of Health, Dr. Anthony Fauci, Director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, Research!America President Mary Woolley and former Senator Tom Harkin, a colleague of Senator Weicker who worked with him on a bipartisan basis to secure funding for the NIH. Each speaker highlighted Senator Weicker's achievements on health policy as a senator, especially with regard to NIH research on HIV/AIDS. It was a fitting tribute at NIH for Lowell Weicker, worthy of the champion who fought bravely to protect its buildings and the irreplaceable research conducted inside them. I ask my colleagues to join me in congratulating Governor Weicker on the dedication of the Lowell P. Weicker Building and for his lifelong dedication to disadvantaged Americans.

Last Congress, I voted in favor of Mr. King's amendment in two different appropriations bills and in the 112th Congress, I voted in favor of eight different Davis-Bacon prohibition amendments in various appropriations and transportation bills.

LOUISE McINTOSH SLAUGHTER of new york in the house of representatives Friday, May 15, 2015 Ms. SLAUGHTER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to commemorate the life of a veteran and member of the Rochester community, Steven Lucyshyn. Rochester is a vibrant city with a rich history including the members of its community who ranged from activists to philanthropists to technological pioneers, and the businesses that were the front-runners of their time in their respective fields. The contributions made by Rochesterians inspire their fellow community members on a daily basis. Steven is no exception. Born in 1919, Steven was a hardworking man who carried on the spirit of Rochester in his day-to-day life as a husband, father, and friend. But he went well beyond that. In the midst of World War II, Steven answered the call to serve his country and joined the Armed Forces. On June 12, 1941, Steven enlisted as a Private and proudly served in the Warrant Officers branch of the U.S. Army. Steven displayed this immense bravery while fighting in the Battle of the Bulge. Serving one's country requires an immense amount of courage and valor that few of us are capable of displaying. It is without hesitation that we honor the life of Steven, his love for his family and the contributions that he made to this country and the Rochester community. Steven was predeceased by his beloved wife of 66 years, Amelia, who together, raised two children, Michael Lucyshyn and Janice Schillaci; had two grandsons, Samuel J. (Becky) Lucyshyn and Michael J. Schillaci; and four great-grandchildren, Zoe, Dominic, Mia, and Jessica.

Mr. Speaker, this May we celebrate Jewish American History Month, to recognize the social, political, and cultural history of America's Jewish community. I am pleased to recognize the myriad contributions Jewish Americans make every day to improve our City, State and Nation often in the face of unspeakable discrimination and adversity. America is blessed to have such a vibrant community that impacts so many lives through the spirit of tikkun olam, or repairing the world. It is my great honor to represent the Upper Manhattan Congressional District and the Bronx, which is home to many distinguished institutions, such as The Jewish Theological Seminary, Yeshiva University, and Touro College, as well as almost thirty active synagogues of all denominations. I am proud that my dearly respected friend, Rabbi Arthur Schneier, who is world-renowned for his efforts to promote peace and justice, has been recently knighted by Pope Francis and made a member of the Papal Order of St. Sylvester at a ceremony in New York. Over the years, I have worked closely with New York based institutional organizations like the Jewish Community Relations Council, Met Council of Jewish Poverty and the American Jewish Committee on a variety of issues. I have led past efforts to assist Jews seeking refuge from the former Soviet Union and Ethiopia, and I am proud to have worked with my colleagues in Congress on various bills to fight anti-Semitism and racism. Just recently I supported a resolution urging the Administration to combat anti-Semitism globally. As a strong supporter of Israel, I will continue to advocate for stability in the Middle East. I congratulate Jewish people everywhere for their contributions to our community and to our country. To them I say Shalom and Kol Tov. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 75 (Friday, May 15, 2015)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E726] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] HONORING JEWISH AMERICAN HERITAGE MONTH _____ HON.

Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate West Kentucky Community and Technical College (WKCTC) on recently being named one of the top three community colleges in America by the Aspen Institute. Selected from 1,123 community colleges nationwide, this marks the second time WKCTC has been chosen as Finalist-with-Distinction in addition to having been ranked as a top ten finalist every year the Aspen Prize has been awarded since its launch in 2011. Created by the Aspen Institute, The Aspen Prize is the nation's preeminent recognition of high achievement and performance in America's community colleges and is awarded every two years. The prize recognizes institutions for outstanding outcomes in four areas: student learning; certificate and degree completion; employment and earnings; and high levels of access and success for minority and low-income students. WKCTC students graduate and transfer at rates that exceed the national average by eight percent and asserts no gap in graduation rates between minorities and other students--a rare occurrence in most of the nation's colleges and universities. Working to draw first- generation students into college, WKCTC faculty and staff consistently track student learning and completion outcomes and use this data to improve teaching and guidance practices. These efforts have resulted in an increase in student retention and degree completion, and place them among the very best in graduating students who are prepared for meaningful employment and/or success after transferring to a four-year institution. WKCTC has been a primary player in efforts to expand economic growth, from a high-tech industrialized training facility for area companies to adding programs in anticipated growth areas, including marine technology, logistics and operations management. Community colleges today enroll more than 40 percent of all U.S. undergraduates--7 million students--working toward degrees and certificates. While fewer than half of all community college students graduate nationwide, Aspen Prize finalist institutions demonstrate community colleges can help students achieve higher levels of success while in college and after they graduate. West Kentucky Community and Technical College, located in Paducah, Kentucky, stands among these leading institutions and I am pleased to see its success once again being acknowledged. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 75 (Friday, May 15, 2015)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E726] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] CONGRATULATING WEST KENTUCKY COMMUNITY AND TECHNICAL COLLEGE _____ HON.

CHRIS VAN HOLLEN of maryland in the house of representatives Wednesday, May 13, 2015 Mr. VAN HOLLEN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in opposition to H.R. 2048, the USA Freedom Act. In the wake of last week's 2nd Circuit Court Decision, I want to commend Chairman Goodlatte, Ranking Member Conyers, Congressman Sensenbrenner, and Congressman Nadler, for crafting legislation that makes meaningful reforms to many NSA surveillance programs--including Section 215 of the Patriot Act--and is a departure from the untenable status quo. However, despite these positive reforms, this bill fails to address Section 702 of the FISA Amendments Act, an even more invasive program than Section 215 which allows the government to collect both data and content of Americans without a warrant. Last year's version of the USA Freedom Act similarly scaled back many of the surveillance programs the NSA currently has at its disposal. Unfortunately, Section 702 was not one of them. Throughout the process, we were repeatedly assured by Chairman Goodlatte and Congressman Sensenbrenner that there would be a real future effort to address Section 702. At that time, Rep. Sensenbrenner stated, ``Section 702 of FISA has been improperly used to obtain the content of Americans' private communications without a warrant, which is unconstitutional under the Fourth Amendment and a blatant violation of Americans' civil liberties.'' Like Rep. Sensenbrenner, I have also consistently said that Section 702 opened the door to some of the most troublesome surveillance practices that have come to light in recent years. Last year, I strongly supported the effort to fix those aspects of Section 702. Unfortunately, as I indicated last year, last minute changes stripped out provisions that would have ``prevented the NSA from being able to search government databases for foreign communications content of American citizens without a warrant.'' When those important provisions were removed, Chairman Goodlatte and Rep. Sensenbrenner pledged that we would address these reforms without delay. Unfortunately, here we are a year later and Chairman Goodlatte and Rep. Sensenbrenner still have not allowed for a full debate and vote on this issue. Despite the Chairman's supposed support to end Section 702, when Congresswoman Lofgren offered an amendment during markup of the USA Freedom Act to prohibit these warrantless backdoor searches, Chairman Goodlatte said, ``this is [[Page E727]] a poison pill amendment . . ., there is a time and a place for everything.'' When this bill came before the Rules Committee, Rep. Lofgren was not even allowed to offer her amendment. The refusal to include reforms to Section 702 is even more disappointing given that there are many important provisions in this bill that provide additional safeguards to protect the privacy and civil liberties of Americans. Specifically, this bill puts significant constraints on the government's ability to collect data under Section 215. No longer will the NSA be able to collect the phone records of millions of Americans who have no connection to crime or terrorism. Instead, every request made by the NSA for specific call records must be reviewed on a case-by-case basis by the FISA court. This legislation also carefully constructs the definition of the ``specific selection terms'' the government can use to access call records. H.R. 2048 requires the ``specific selection term'' to be an ``individual, account, or personal device.'' As a result, no longer will the NSA be able to collect phone records in bulk using terms like ``People in Maryland'' and ``Area Code 301.'' Despite these improvements to Section 215, I remain disappointed that the bill does not establish a Citizens Advocate to represent citizens' privacy interests at the secret FISA Court proceedings. In 2013, Representative Jim Jordan and I introduced bipartisan legislation to create such a position. The initial draft of last year's USA Freedom Act included this provision, but this language has since been weakened and only provides for a panel of advisors to be employed at the discretion of the FISC. Last month's decision by the Second Circuit in ACLU v. Clapper, makes clear that Section 215 is illegal and that a clean re-authorization would be a clear violation of the law. So while I appreciate the reforms made in this bill to Section 215, these reforms are modest given the Court's recent decision. On the other hand, Section 702 of the FISA Amendments Act does not sunset until the end of 2017 and there is no clear indication that we will be voting to curtail this program anytime in the near future. I believe that today's legislation could be our last real opportunity to address this. It is my hope that the companion legislation in the Senate includes these provisions and that I will be able to support a final compromise bill later this year. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 75 (Friday, May 15, 2015)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Pages E726-E727] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] UNITING AND STRENGTHENING AMERICA BY FULFILLING RIGHTS AND ENSURING EFFECTIVE DISCIPLINE OVER MONITORING ACT OF 2015 ______ speech of HON. CHRIS VAN HOLLEN of maryland in the house of representatives Wednesday, May 13, 2015 Mr. VAN HOLLEN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in opposition to H.R. 2048, the USA Freedom Act. In the wake of last week's 2nd Circuit Court Decision, I want to commend Chairman Goodlatte, Ranking Member Conyers, Congressman Sensenbrenner, and Congressman Nadler, for crafting legislation that makes meaningful reforms to many NSA surveillance programs--including Section 215 of the Patriot Act--and is a departure from the untenable status quo. However, despite these positive reforms, this bill fails to address Section 702 of the FISA Amendments Act, an even more invasive program than Section 215 which allows the government to collect both data and content of Americans without a warrant. Last year's version of the USA Freedom Act similarly scaled back many of the surveillance programs the NSA currently has at its disposal. Unfortunately, Section 702 was not one of them. Throughout the process, we were repeatedly assured by Chairman Goodlatte and Congressman Sensenbrenner that there would be a real future effort to address Section 702. At that time, Rep. Sensenbrenner stated, ``Section 702 of FISA has been improperly used to obtain the content of Americans' private communications without a warrant, which is unconstitutional under the Fourth Amendment and a blatant violation of Americans' civil liberties.'' Like Rep. Sensenbrenner, I have also consistently said that Section 702 opened the door to some of the most troublesome surveillance practices that have come to light in recent years. Last year, I strongly supported the effort to fix those aspects of Section 702. Unfortunately, as I indicated last year, last minute changes stripped out provisions that would have ``prevented the NSA from being able to search government databases for foreign communications content of American citizens without a warrant.'' When those important provisions were removed, Chairman Goodlatte and Rep. Sensenbrenner pledged that we would address these reforms without delay. Unfortunately, here we are a year later and Chairman Goodlatte and Rep. Sensenbrenner still have not allowed for a full debate and vote on this issue. Despite the Chairman's supposed support to end Section 702, when Congresswoman Lofgren offered an amendment during markup of the USA Freedom Act to prohibit these warrantless backdoor searches, Chairman Goodlatte said, ``this is [[Page E727]] a poison pill amendment . . ., there is a time and a place for everything.'' When this bill came before the Rules Committee, Rep. Lofgren was not even allowed to offer her amendment. The refusal to include reforms to Section 702 is even more disappointing given that there are many important provisions in this bill that provide additional safeguards to protect the privacy and civil liberties of Americans. Specifically, this bill puts significant constraints on the government's ability to collect data under Section 215.

PERRY _____ HON. DORIS O. MATSUI of california in the house of representatives Friday, May 15, 2015 Ms. MATSUI. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize my friend and a true leader of our nation's seniors, Ms. Elizabeth ``Betty'' Perry, who recently passed away. I ask all my colleagues to join me in recognizing her for her work on behalf of all Americans. A Sacramento native, Betty returned home to become a teacher after graduating from UC Berkeley. She first taught at Kit Carson Junior High School, and then became a teacher and counselor at C. K. McClatchy High School, where she influenced many students. One of these students was my husband, the late Congressman Robert Matsui. Bob adored Betty and remained close to her when he served on the Sacramento City Council and in Congress. After her teaching career came to a close, Betty emerged a true expert and leader on senior issues, where she and Bob worked closely to ensure Medicare and Social Security were preserved for future generations. Betty was especially known for her work with the Older Women's League (OWL), an organization whose mission is to improve the status and quality of life for midlife and older women. Within OWL, she served in many positions, including President of its Sacramento and California chapters, Coordinator of Education & Research, and Director of Public Policy. She also served as President of Health Access California. Betty was an unwavering advocate for improved access to quality health care, including universal coverage and improved in-home care, as well as fair housing laws and preserving each American's civil rights. Betty married Calvin Perry in 1977, gaining three step-children and six step-grandchildren in the process. In addition to her thoughtful advocacy, she was known as an incredibly caring woman and accomplished athlete. Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me today in paying honor to Elizabeth ``Betty'' M. Perry for her extraordinary service and advocacy to those of us in Sacramento and across the nation. Her life and legacy is an inspiration to us all. I ask that we take a moment and extend our utmost respect and condolences to her family. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 75 (Friday, May 15, 2015)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E727] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] IN RECOGNITION OF ELIZABETH ``BETTY'' M.

Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize my friend and a true leader of our nation's seniors, Ms. Elizabeth ``Betty'' Perry, who recently passed away. I ask all my colleagues to join me in recognizing her for her work on behalf of all Americans. A Sacramento native, Betty returned home to become a teacher after graduating from UC Berkeley. She first taught at Kit Carson Junior High School, and then became a teacher and counselor at C. K. McClatchy High School, where she influenced many students. One of these students was my husband, the late Congressman Robert Matsui. Bob adored Betty and remained close to her when he served on the Sacramento City Council and in Congress. After her teaching career came to a close, Betty emerged a true expert and leader on senior issues, where she and Bob worked closely to ensure Medicare and Social Security were preserved for future generations. Betty was especially known for her work with the Older Women's League (OWL), an organization whose mission is to improve the status and quality of life for midlife and older women. Within OWL, she served in many positions, including President of its Sacramento and California chapters, Coordinator of Education & Research, and Director of Public Policy. She also served as President of Health Access California. Betty was an unwavering advocate for improved access to quality health care, including universal coverage and improved in-home care, as well as fair housing laws and preserving each American's civil rights. Betty married Calvin Perry in 1977, gaining three step-children and six step-grandchildren in the process. In addition to her thoughtful advocacy, she was known as an incredibly caring woman and accomplished athlete.

MODENA, SR. _____ HON. SANFORD D. BISHOP, JR. of georgia in the house of representatives Friday, May 15, 2015 Mr. BISHOP of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, it is with a heavy heart and solemn remembrance that I rise today to pay tribute to an outstanding public servant and courageous leader of the Macon, Georgia community, Sheriff Jerry M. Modena, Sr. Sadly, Sheriff Modena passed away on Wednesday, May 13, 2015. Funeral services to celebrate his life will be held on Monday, May 18, 2015 at 11:00 a.m. at Mabel White Memorial Baptist Church in Macon, Georgia. Sheriff Jerry Modena was widely known in his community as a compassionate leader committed to fighting crime and making Bibb County a safer place to live. Throughout his entire career with the Sheriff's office, Sheriff Modena gave one hundred percent of his heart to his line of duty. Prior to joining the Bibb County Sheriff's Office, Sheriff Modena served our country honorably as a paratrooper in the United States Army. In 1964, at the age of 23, he joined the Sheriff's office and remained there for over forty years. In 2001, he was elected Bibb County Sheriff and remained Sheriff for three terms before stepping down in 2012. Even [[Page E728]] after leaving the Sheriff's Office, he remained heavily involved and concerned for the wellbeing of the community. From the beginning of his career, Sheriff Modena was determinedly committed to the safety and welfare of those he was charged to protect. Described as firm but fair, he not only had a positive impact on each individual he encountered, but he also had a tremendous and everlasting impact upon his community. He is celebrated for creating substations around Bibb County and for championing the cause of the mentally ill in the Bibb County Jail, reserving 200 beds for those with mental health issues in his newly expanded 966-person lockup that opened in 2007. Perhaps one of Sheriff Modena's greatest accomplishments is his invaluable leadership in overseeing the merge of the Sheriff's Office and the Macon Police Department. He was also regarded as a mentor and guide to many in the Sheriff's Office. He taught others the importance of transparency in law enforcement, the need to be accessible to the community, and the importance of engaging with the people one serves. George Washington Carver once said, ``No individual has any right to come into the world and go out of it without leaving behind him distinct and legitimate reasons for having passed through it.'' Sheriff Modena's impression on this earth extends beyond himself to the very wellbeing of the Macon community, and for it he will be remembered by the community for time to come. Mr. Speaker, my wife Vivian and I, along with the more than 730,000 people in Georgia's Second Congressional District, salute Sheriff Jerry M. Modena, Sr. for an outstanding career in law enforcement, his significant contributions to Bibb County, and his lifelong dedication to serving his community. I ask my colleagues in the House of Representatives to join us in extending our deepest sympathies to Sheriff Modena's family, friends and loved ones during this difficult time.
