At the age of 17, PFC Oakley enlisted in the United States Army. He was extremely proud to serve his country. On May 28, 1965, PFC Oakley was killed when two Army helicopters collided. He was only 18 years old and had served for less than a year. As we commemorate Memorial Day and remember all those who lost their lives while in service to our country, let us pause to think of PFC Oakley on the 50th anniversary of his death. This year also marks the 50th anniversary of the ground offensive in Vietnam. Over 58,000 names are written on the Vietnam Veterans Memorial Wall in Washington, DC. Thirty of these brave Americans, including PFC Oakley, called Waterbury home. The City of Waterbury and the Waterbury Veterans Memorial Committee will never forget the service and sacrifice of the men and women who died while serving in our nation's military throughout our history.

CREC-2015-05-26-pt1-PgE793-2,CREC-2015-05-26,114,RECOGNIZING MAY AS PREECLAMPSIA AWARENESS MONTH,"[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 82 (Tuesday, May 26, 2015)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E793] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] RECOGNIZING MAY AS PREECLAMPSIA AWARENESS MONTH ______ HON. KRISTI L. NOEM of south dakota in the house of representatives Tuesday, May 26, 2015 Mrs. NOEM. Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize May as Preeclampsia Awareness Month. Despite advances in treatment and technology across the medical field, the disease of preeclampsia continues to affect mothers and infants across the country. As one of the leading causes of premature birth, illness, and maternal death, preeclampsia afflicts one in 12 women, according to the Preeclampsia Foundation. Preeclampsia is characterized by high blood pressure, and its symptoms mimic common difficulties associated with pregnancy, like abdominal pain, the cause of headaches, vomiting, and anxiety. Because they are so common, many women may simply ignore these symptoms. Worse, little is known about preeclampsia. While current research suggests it is related to the placenta, we do not know why it occurs, we do not know how to cure it, and we are still learning about its long-term effects on mothers and their children. Our lack of understanding about preeclampsia is why I strongly support the work of groups like the Preeclampsia Foundation to educate women about the symptoms of preeclampsia and how they can find care. I also support the research being done at the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development.

KRISTI L. NOEM of south dakota in the house of representatives Tuesday, May 26, 2015 Mrs. NOEM. Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize May as Preeclampsia Awareness Month. Despite advances in treatment and technology across the medical field, the disease of preeclampsia continues to affect mothers and infants across the country. As one of the leading causes of premature birth, illness, and maternal death, preeclampsia afflicts one in 12 women, according to the Preeclampsia Foundation. Preeclampsia is characterized by high blood pressure, and its symptoms mimic common difficulties associated with pregnancy, like abdominal pain, the cause of headaches, vomiting, and anxiety. Because they are so common, many women may simply ignore these symptoms. Worse, little is known about preeclampsia. While current research suggests it is related to the placenta, we do not know why it occurs, we do not know how to cure it, and we are still learning about its long-term effects on mothers and their children.

ROSA L. DeLAURO of connecticut in the house of representatives Tuesday, May 26, 2015 Ms. DeLAURO. Mr. Speaker, I rise in recognition of the International Day to End Obstetric Fistula. Obstetric fistula, a debilitating condition, has left hundreds of thousands of women suffering in solitude and shame. It is perhaps one of the most telling examples of inequitable access to maternal health care and, until recently, one of the most hidden. Addressing this issue is not only a moral imperative for the United States, but it is also in our best strategic interest. When women are pushed out of society, they cannot contribute. By treating and preventing this condition, we empower women to care for themselves and their families, and be active participants in society, reducing global poverty. Dr. Babatunde Osotimehin, United Nations Under-Secretary-General and Executive Director of UNFPA, the United Nations Population Fund, recently said, ``Let us decide, as a global community, that the world we want is one where fistula no longer exists. Let us, once and for all, put an end to this assault on women's and girls' health and human rights, which steals from them their very dignity and destroys the most fundamental of human qualities: hope. Much of the world has already virtually eliminated fistula. It is time to finish the job. Let us all work together to wipe fistula off the map.'' The International Day to End Obstetric Fistula is an important opportunity to raise awareness of a condition that is not well- understood, even in societies where it is prevalent. I urge everyone to use the day of recognition to help raise awareness and intensify actions towards ending obstetric fistula. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 82 (Tuesday, May 26, 2015)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E793] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] THE INTERNATIONAL DAY TO END OBSTETRIC FISTULA ______ HON.

Mayor Strzelczyk began his career in public service in 1978 when he worked as a special recreation instructor for the Chicago Park District.

Over almost two decades as mayor, he focused on improving and revitalizing Summit through grassroots efforts along with attracting businesses and revenue to the city.

Mayor Strzelczyk was also active in organizing village cleanups. Mayor Strzelczyk's love of his community stretched into all facets of his life. An avid softball player, he coached in the North American Pro Softball League and later hosted a local cable TV show in addition to being a sports commentator on radio.

Thomas Garnett founded the New Hope Baptist Church of Danbury with area residents who were drawn together by faith and kinship. Eight pastors have led New Hope over the past 120 years, shepherding the parish through many periods of growth. Increasing membership throughout the decades also necessitated expansions in church programs and services as well as physical additions to the church itself. This year, under the leadership of Rev. Leroy Parker, New Hope expanded its ministry to include services in Waterbury to reach even more individuals and families in western Connecticut. Rev. Parker is an inspiring preacher, and I was honored for him to join me at the National Prayer Breakfast in Washington, DC earlier this year. New Hope Baptist Church is an outstanding example of what a faith community can accomplish through ministry and fellowship. The parishioners are welcoming and eager to share their faith with community members and visitors alike. I enjoy worshiping at New Hope and cherish the friendships I have made.
