Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the Chicago Chapter of American Veterans for Equal Rights, which dedicated a monument for LGBT Veterans in Abraham Lincoln National Cemetery in Elwood, IL on May 25, 2015. This is an historic day, as this is the first federally-approved monument honoring LGBT veterans to be dedicated in a National Cemetery in the United States. It is fitting that this monument is located in the Abraham Lincoln National Cemetery. President Lincoln was not only our 16th President and from the great state of Illinois, but he was also the founder of the National Cemetery system. His Gettysburg Address of 1863 became a model of the principles of nationalism, republicanism, equal rights, liberty, and democracy. I am grateful for the efforts of the American Veterans for Equal Rights (AVER) and their continued commitment and dedication to equal rights and equitable treatment for all present and former members of the United States Armed Forces. Thanks to Stanley J. Jenczyk and his colleagues with the Chicago Chapter of AVER, the LGBT veteran community will have a lasting tribute honoring their achievements and sacrifices. This monument recognizes the innumerable accomplishments of our military and forever commemorates their endeavors as servants of our great nation. Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in celebrating this significant dedication with the Chicago Chapter of American Veterans for Equal Rights.
